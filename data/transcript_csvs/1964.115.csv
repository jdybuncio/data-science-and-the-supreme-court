1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,29.377,32.735,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,567.613,569.718,"Mr. Jacobson you may have told us but if so, I missed it."
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,580.456,593.43,"Mr. Justice Stewart, the one point of law upon which both parties are aggrieved is that sales to individuals on the United States versus Holiday, individual Indians constitutes Indian commerce."
1964.115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,601.583,605.997,But at least into -- individual Indians are members of the Indian tribes (Voice Overlap) --
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,605.997,607.246,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, they are."
1964.115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,607.246,611.732,I'm thinking about a story in Omaha or Cheyenne.
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,611.732,612.078,Right.
1964.115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,612.078,613.971,Or even Detroit or New York.
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,617.553,618.971,Very good.
1964.115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,619.982,621.514,How can they have power over that kind?
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,621.514,622.051,"No, no."
1964.115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,636.386,636.653,Of the non-Indians.
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,636.653,642.131,-- non-Indians so we're concerned only with Reservation sales to Indians.
1964.115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,642.131,646.629,And there's no question that these are not casually into the tribal Indians?
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,646.629,647.239,Correct.
1964.115,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,650.017,654.074,(Inaudible)
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,654.074,655.814,Yes Mr. Justice Goldberg.
1964.115,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,655.814,657.543,(Inaudible)
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,657.543,658.234,No.
1964.115,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,712.022,719.063,Does every Indian trader or did every trader on a reservation need a license from the Federal Government?
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,719.063,722.098,"Mr. Justice White, every trader must have a license."
1964.115,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,731.427,737.914,"And under this tax, this Arizona tax, does the trade -- the same trader need another license?"
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,737.914,738.84,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.115,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,738.84,742.24,He just doesn't -- he has to have the license as well as pay the tax.
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,742.24,744.181,That is the claim of the State of Arizona.
1964.115,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,794.763,798.146,Has this conceded the (Inaudible)?
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,798.146,800.16,"Yes Your Honor, it is conceded."
1964.115,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,809.658,823.894,But do you think the tribe can levy the tax without any authority from any further authority than the present law of -- without any further authority from the Department of Interior or anybody else?
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,823.894,826.558,"Mr. Justice White, you're correct."
1964.115,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,842.764,846.221,Does this resort to some statute that they may do so?
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,846.221,849.583,"Yes, pursuant to the -- to two things."
1964.115,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,882.361,882.855,What is that (Voice Overlap) --
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,882.855,884.331,-- Department of Interior?
1964.115,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,885.1,887.859,Where did that right come from?
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,887.859,890.134,The right for the rule --
1964.115,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,890.134,897.375,"I mean, the right for the (Inaudible) -- of the tribe to levy its own fees that you just referred to, shall not be in derogation of that right."
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,899.376,910.948,"The right of the derogation of the tribal right to levy its own fees recognized by the opinion of the Department of Interior, I believe comes and there is no flat answer, we're now talking about an opinion of law."
1964.115,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,950.444,961.657,"Well, if that is so, if this were a -- if these were a sales tax, I suppose under the Buck Act, it could be levied right on this trader and exact it from the Indians."
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,961.657,964.31,This is a tax levied on the trader in each instance --
1964.115,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,964.31,967.073,"Yes, but it's not passed onto the Indians."
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,969.525,979.706,"To the extent that the trader is permitted to pass it on to the Indians, it is passed on to the Indians to the extent that he is not permitted to, it will not be passed on."
1964.115,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,988.265,993.566,But wouldn't the Buck Act permit a sales tax to be collected on this reservation by an Indian trader?
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,993.566,999.365,That is the fourth point and it's a negative point and so I didn't name it as one of my three.
1964.115,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1185.414,1189.98,They think it applies to sales taxes?
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,1189.98,1205.7,The opinion of the Department of Interior indicates that the Buck Act applies to what we would consider Federal Military Reservations and Federal Park Reservations but not the Indian Reservations as being outside (Voice Overlap) --
1964.115,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1205.7,1205.791,Outside (Voice Overlap) --
1964.115,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1205.791,1209.099,Do you say the Department of Interior took the position that you have stated?
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,1209.099,1210.784,Yes sir and the states acceded to it.
1964.115,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1210.784,1212.842,The Buck Act doesn't apply at all --
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,1212.842,1213.965,On Indian reservations.
1964.115,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1213.965,1215.626,Regardless of the kind of tax.
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,1215.626,1216.33,Correct.
1964.115,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1216.33,1218.389,Whether it's a sales tax or privilege tax.
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,1218.389,1222.957,It has nothing to do with Indian reservations with the position of the Department.
1964.115,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1222.957,1229.436,Mr. Jacobson -- would you tell us again those three amendments that you spoke of.
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,1233.11,1234.11,I -- yes.
1964.115,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1234.11,1235.321,I don't want to take a lot of time from you.
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,1235.321,1235.642,Very good Mr. Chief Justice.
1964.115,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1235.642,1237.501,You just say it very briefly.
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,1237.501,1254.989,"In the Senate Finance Subcommittee after the Buck Act had gone from the House top the Senate, the Department of Interior became worried and asked that an amendment be given to make sure that the Buck Act did not apply to Indian Reservations."
1964.115,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1327.593,1337.826,"Mr. Jacobson, getting back to that Papago privilege tax that you say has its source perhaps in the reserve sovereignty of the (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,1337.826,1338.913,"Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1964.115,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1338.913,1354.105,"Now would a conflict between that reserve -- the exercise that reserve power and the state's taxing power, does that create supremacy towards power?"
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,1354.105,1359.259,I've never given that consideration and I couldn't give you mature consideration on this further moment here.
1964.115,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1359.259,1360.672,Which you're not suggesting it anyway.
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,1361.868,1362.45,No.
1964.115,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1366.71,1368.801,Why wouldn't you?
1964.115,0,22534,edward_jacobson,,1381.607,1397.21,I think Mr. Justice Black that to the extent the Supremacy Clause is deeply related to the internal sovereignty of the Indians which still remains it would raise the question.
1964.115,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1519.234,1520.688,Mr. Haggerty.
1964.115,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1520.688,1523.477,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.115,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1693.758,1699.298,But I recognized -- maybe you don't have the possible case before us but what about that situation?
1964.115,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1699.298,1703.809,It's not the position of the State of Arizona to say whether or not an Indian tribe can tax.
1964.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1714.959,1715.355,Do they --
1964.115,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1715.355,1716.961,The fact that there are multiple sovereigns taxing with the --
1964.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1716.961,1720.336,(Voice Overlap)have sovereignty.
1964.115,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1720.336,1726.236,"This Court has indicated often enough in certain areas concerned with tribal self-government, yes, they do have a residual --"
1964.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1726.236,1728.624,"No, I said a county."
1964.115,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1730.259,1732.664,For the purposes of imposing taxation certainly they do impose many taxes.
1964.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1732.664,1738.522,"Oh, they have the powers that the state gives you and isn't that all of the political subdivision?"
1964.115,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1738.522,1739.899,Yes it is a grant from the state --
1964.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1739.899,1741.589,(Inaudible)
1964.115,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1741.589,1745.335,"Well, it is a type of -- I think that's not really particularly material."
1964.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1746.413,1746.838,I didn't think so either --
1964.115,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1746.838,1747.656,So what --
1964.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1747.656,1748.931,-- that's really my --
1964.115,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1748.931,1765.919,"Let me tell you this, this would certainly be (Inaudible) the derogation of the sovereignty whatever it may be as the Indians sought upon which is predicated with tax as federal law and why is it that there's serious question whether the Arizona tax --"
1964.115,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1765.919,1774.632,"I think no more serious than a question of whether or not we can impose as a state, an income tax where the United States also imposes an income tax."
1964.115,2,22534,edward_jacobson,,2954.852,2957.675,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.115,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3026.237,3030.088,May I ask you if you would consider answer in time.
1964.115,2,22534,edward_jacobson,,3037.659,3046.367,"Mr. Justice Black, I think that is the heart of the disagreement between the State of Arizona and myself."
1964.115,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3237.362,3245.314,"Well Mr. Jacobson, obviously, this tax couldn't be imposed on -- the trade in California by Arizona."
1964.115,2,22534,edward_jacobson,,3245.314,3246.085,No Mr. Justice Brennan.
1964.115,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3246.085,3255.47,Why would -- do you suggest that nevertheless there maybe circumstances under which it might impose this tax on a trader on the Indian reservation?
1964.115,2,22534,edward_jacobson,,3261.778,3263.417,I -- Mr. Justice --
1964.115,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3263.417,3264.219,(Inaudible) answer the question.
1964.115,2,22534,edward_jacobson,,3264.219,3264.282,Thank you.
1964.115,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3264.282,3265.5,Take your time.
1964.115,2,22534,edward_jacobson,,3265.5,3288.337,"Mr. Justice Brennan, my understanding of sovereignty as I have attempted to explain it to Mr. Justice Black is that Arizona could impose this tax on an Indian trader on the reservation at such time as it was specifically so authorized by the Congress of the United States and that until that time, it could not."
1964.115,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3309.483,3311.223,What did the Buck Act do?
1964.115,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3311.223,3311.57,The Buck Act --
1964.115,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3311.57,3311.928,It was directed to --
1964.115,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3311.928,3328.567,-- as I understand it and as I read it and as the New Mexico Court interprets it and as I believe the legislative debates carry out was intended to not affect the posture of state taxation on Indian reservations at all.
1964.115,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3339.63,3347.844,"Well then, why isn't that the end of the -- why shouldn't that be the end of the argument without you ever having to get to Indian commerce or preempt or anything like that?"
1964.115,2,22534,edward_jacobson,,3357.396,3378.281,"Our position on the Buck Act Mr. Justice White is that it was not intended to affect the Indian reservations and so I would have to accede that if the State of Arizona otherwise had the power to tax Indian of sales to Indians on the reservation, the Buck Act wouldn't prevent it."
1964.115,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3389.384,3394.925,"Well, it isn't -- no, I just wondered why it -- why is that so -- why the question was so difficult."
1964.115,2,22534,edward_jacobson,,3400.291,3401.661,Yes.
1964.115,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3401.661,3405.442,"You've already -- that Congress hasn't permitted, this may not be done."
1964.115,2,22534,edward_jacobson,,3405.442,3406.31,I would agree.
1964.115,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3406.31,3428.51,"And -- but do you think you have to give all of those grievance that an Indian commerce to show this or (Inaudible) have to be a federal enclave on which -- I mean it, may be that the state could attack (Inaudible) like in the Washington tax case that has something to do with the contract --"
1964.115,2,22534,edward_jacobson,,3428.51,3428.716,Right.
1964.115,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3428.716,3429.407,(Inaudible)
1964.115,2,22534,edward_jacobson,,3429.407,3430.634,Right.
1964.115,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3430.634,3444.511,But these transactions takes place not in the State of Arizona but in a -- on a federal enclave or on federal property or an Indian property whatever you want to call it.
1964.115,2,22534,edward_jacobson,,3444.511,3447.673,Let me back into it very briefly in this fashion.
