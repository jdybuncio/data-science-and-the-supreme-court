1985.84-1606,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,28.317,"Mr. Dickinson, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,28.317,31.019,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1606,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,61.222,64.156,How many defendants were there being tried at that time?
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,64.156,70.41,"Mr. Chief Justice, there were six defendants on trial at the time this case went to trial in Providence, Rhode Island."
1985.84-1606,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,81.202,87.606,Are you going to tell us exactly where the officers were in relation to the defendants in the courtroom?
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,87.606,88.272,"--Your Honor, the record--"
1985.84-1606,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,88.272,92.093,Were they behind the chairs in which defendants were sitting or where?
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,92.093,98.514,"--Your Honor, it would appear that the record does not specifically reflect where the officers were at all points in time."
1985.84-1606,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,105.833,114.839,"As, for example, we have a counsel side here and a... beyond it, a spectator section."
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,114.839,115.672,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1606,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,115.672,116.405,Is that the way it is?
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,116.405,120.374,"And if I were to use this courtroom as an illustration, I think it would be a perfect illustration."
1985.84-1606,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,125.278,125.828,Yes.
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,125.828,131.815,"--And the troopers would be seated in the front row of the spectator section behind, if you will, the bar, what we refer to in Rhode Island as the bar."
1985.84-1606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,131.815,135.2,"But directly behind that, behind the defendants, or does the record show?"
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,135.2,137.801,The record does not specifically address where they were.
1985.84-1606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,137.801,139.601,It could be they were on the other side of the front row?
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,139.601,143.187,"It's unquestioned, Your Honor, that they were seated in the front row of the spectator section."
1985.84-1606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,143.187,147.574,But they might have been on the other side of the room from the defendants.
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,147.574,148.291,They might have been.
1985.84-1606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,151.293,153.145,"It doesn't reflect where they were, is that it?"
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,153.145,155.245,--It merely reflects that they were outside the bar.
1985.84-1606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,155.245,155.763,Yes.
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,155.763,157.93,And the defendants were inside the bar.
1985.84-1606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,157.93,159.299,All right.
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,159.299,162.167,I will be addressing two questions in my argument today.
1985.84-1606,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,230.745,241.286,"Were they held with... when you use the term were held without bail, do you mean they were unable to raise money bail or that the trial court would not allow them to be free even if they had raised money bail?"
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,241.286,248.19,"It was that they, they were... the trial court would not allow them to be free, and perhaps this is... this may be an esoteric point of Rhode Island law."
1985.84-1606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,267.77,269.17,"Well, bail was denied, that's all."
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,269.17,272.055,"--Bail was denied, that's correct, Your Honor, prior to trial."
1985.84-1606,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,272.055,274.507,Did each have his own counsel?
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,274.507,278.809,My recollection is that Flynn and another defendant shared counsel.
1985.84-1606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,283.446,286.732,So it would suggest that there were at least four defense counsel?
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,286.732,289.017,"Oh, there were at least four defense counsel, that's true, Your Honor."
1985.84-1606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,289.017,290.134,For the trial.
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,290.134,294.088,"And there were also two prosecutors, I believe, in the courtroom at all times."
1985.84-1606,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,371.871,383.145,"Mr. Dickinson, there was a state appellate court review of the trial court's rulings, in effect, wasn't there?"
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,383.145,385.345,"--I suppose you might say, Your Honor, that there were two reviews."
1985.84-1606,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,385.345,386.98,"Was there... yes, well, there was."
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,388.063,389.132,"That's true, that's true."
1985.84-1606,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,389.132,403.642,"Now, did the state appellate court ever think that the trial judge had considered that there was anything about these defendants or this trial that required extra security?"
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,403.642,417.3,"I would submit, Your Honor, that there's nothing... the state appellate court did not, did not cite anything specifically referenced to these defendants with regard to, if you will, heightened security."
1985.84-1606,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,417.3,424.622,It seemed to focus on the manpower shortages and the obligations of the collective bargaining agreement.
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,424.622,444.802,"Well, it certainly focused on those aspects, Your Honor, and perhaps the reason for that is that what the... the purpose of the security force was not enhanced security at all but was to provide normal security, and the only way that normal security could be provided was to enhance it with some outside service."
1985.84-1606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,444.802,457.044,"Now, is that clear in the record, that if there had been enough nonuniformed people available, would they have been in the courtroom and seated in roughly the same place?"
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,457.044,466.882,"Well, I don't think the record specifically speaks to nonuniformed personnel for the reason that the issue that was presented to the trial judge was state troopers."
1985.84-1606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,466.882,467.332,"I know, I know."
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,467.332,468.598,"As opposed to state marshals, and of course, state marshals are uniformed."
1985.84-1606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,468.598,475.319,"I know, but you just said, you just said that this wasn't enhanced security, this was just normal security."
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,475.319,477.954,Normal security with unusual personnel.
1985.84-1606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,477.954,481.156,Except for the fact that they were uniformed and armed.
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,481.156,482.056,And armed.
1985.84-1606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,488.293,498.232,"Well, are you asking us to believe that in this particular trial there always would have been security people seated in the courtroom."
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,498.232,499.182,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,499.182,500.101,In a case like this.
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,500.101,502.434,"In any case, Your Honor, there would be a certain--"
1985.84-1606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,502.434,503.736,Would there have been four or--
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,503.736,512.825,"--There would have... the security forces would have maintained, attempted to maintain a two to one ratio, so in a case where you had one defendant, there would be two."
1985.84-1606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,512.825,514.125,--Was that the general rule?
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,514.125,516.71,"The general goal, Your Honor, was a two to one ratio."
1985.84-1606,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,530.287,539.559,"Well, Mr. Dickinson, had there been a dozen marshals, uniformed differently, I gather, from the state troopers, would they also have been armed?"
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,539.959,541.095,"--No, they would not have been armed."
1985.84-1606,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,551.883,553.735,"Well, may I just ask while I have you interrupted--"
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,553.735,554.802,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1606,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,554.802,565.126,"--Are the... were the arms holstered at the state troopers' sides, or could they be seen, their weapons?"
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,565.126,565.776,I would say they could be seen.
1985.84-1606,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,566.91,567.41,They could be.
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,567.41,568.762,"They were on holsters, Your Honor--"
1985.84-1606,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,568.762,569.178,Yes.
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,569.178,571.03,--And they were not concealed under jackets.
1985.84-1606,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,571.03,598.431,"Mr. Dickinson, do you take the position that the presence of armed security guards in the courtroom, no matter how many there might have been, simply doesn't impair or burden the presumption of innocence, or do you take the position that there was a special need in this case for the security measures that were in fact taken?"
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,600.383,602.816,"Well, I think our position, Your Honor, is in some ways both."
1985.84-1606,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,614.893,620.797,Except that there was no such finding by the trial court or the state appellate court.
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,620.797,643.893,"--Well, I would suggest, Your Honor, that the trial judge specifically found that it was... that the committed squad itself, the squad of state marshals, was inadequate and that the only supplement that was available to the committing squad was a force of state troopers, and that to that extent, from that logical conclusion, these state troopers were necessary in the courtroom to maintain custody--"
1985.84-1606,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,643.893,652.23,"So you want us to assume that there was a finding that there was a need for special security here, is that the position?"
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,652.23,673.412,"--The special security being that there was a large number of defendants, six, and that all of them were held without bail, and that the available security, the normal, customary state marshals, were simply inadequate to both operate at this trial and permit the system of justice in Rhode Island to go on--"
1985.84-1606,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,673.412,676.447,"Well, what was the need for arms?"
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,677.664,686.251,"--The trial judge didn't make a specific finding as to the need for arms, and it was never really specifically addressed that there was a need for the troopers to be armed in this courtroom."
1985.84-1606,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,686.251,688.503,"Take, take this hypothetical."
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,707.298,719.605,"I suppose that a hypothetical juror might draw such a conclusion, and to that end, Justice Giannini in this case conducted an extensive voir dire of the jurors who were available for being empaneled in this trial."
1985.84-1606,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,719.605,723.574,Did he ask them would they be influenced by a gun?
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,723.574,726.692,"During... the voir dire itself was never transcribed, Your Honor."
1985.84-1606,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,726.692,727.528,"Well, I--"
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,727.528,738.4,"However, it's clear from Justice Giannini's summarization of what occurred at the voir dire that none of the jurors who were seated in the jury box at the trial drew any kind of inference at all from the presence of armed troopers."
1985.84-1606,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,738.4,747.173,"--They acquitted three of the... they acquitted three of the defendants, so they, apparently they must have had a selective feeling if there was any feeling at all."
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,747.173,763.301,"Well, in fact, Your Honor, that's why I don't think it's necessary for us today to focus too much on the hypothetical juror because we have the voir dire in this case i which the jurors clearly expressed no inference at all from the presence of armed troopers, and we have what this jury actually did in the end, which was acquit three of the defendants."
1985.84-1606,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,763.301,773.757,"About how many reasons can you conceive that a juror would acquit one man and hold another man guilty, about how many different reasons would you--"
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,773.757,776.209,"Well, Your Honor, I think there are infinite possibilities, of course--"
1985.84-1606,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,776.209,777.725,"--Close to a million, wouldn't it be?"
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,777.725,799.722,"--Of course, and as Justice Giannini concluded in the motion for a new trial aspect of this case, you can never really draw any inferences from what the jury does in many cases because the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is so great that one shifting set of circumstances related to one defendant may fall below that burden, and in this case, apparently that is what happened with the jurors."
1985.84-1606,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,809.278,810.244,Mr. Dickinson.
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,810.244,810.894,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1606,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,810.894,819.767,"I want to find out, if I can, if it is in the record, how the system of furnishing security at Rhode Island trials works."
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,828.123,838.514,"I would say that the ordinary practice, Your Honor, is that the marshals... if a defendant is not on bail... I'm sorry, if a defendant is on bail, we can dismiss that category of cases."
1985.84-1606,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,868.783,877.489,"So that's a... the custody decision, how it shall be maintained, is initially made by, not by the Court, I take it, but by the Department of Corrections."
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,877.489,882.709,"And essentially, Your Honor, it's not really a judicial function at the beginning, it's an executive function."
1985.84-1606,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,887.578,888.78,Mr. Dickinson.
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,888.78,890.18,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1606,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,890.18,901.771,"In connection with what you and Justice Rehnquist are discussing, the District Court... and I am looking at page B-12 of the Petition for Certiorari--"
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,901.771,904.621,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1606,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,904.621,909.675,--The first full paragraph goes on to say
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,928.588,929.271,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1606,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,929.271,933.073,I wonder if that doesn't answer to some extent Justice Rehnquist's question.
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,933.073,942.746,"Well, that would... that would certainly be true in a case where the defendant raises the question and asks the trial judge to make a decision."
1985.84-1606,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,951.835,955.739,"In this case, the District Court so found."
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,958.524,961.81,"--Found that it was the decision of the... the responsibility of the judge, Your Honor?"
1985.84-1606,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,961.81,962.21,Yes.
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,962.21,963.844,"No, that hasn't been found erroneous."
1985.84-1606,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,963.844,964.311,All right--
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,976.669,977.919,Yes.
1985.84-1606,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,978.335,983.056,The judge found there was a heightened necessity for security.
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,987.275,992.512,"--Well, I think the First Circuit did dispute that conclusion by District Judge Selya."
1985.84-1606,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,992.512,994.131,Did it find it clearly erroneous?
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,994.131,997.649,"I don't think that the Court specifically used the terms ""clearly erroneous"", Your Honor."
1985.84-1606,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1124.849,1129.152,I gather that was after the objection was made to the presence of the troopers?
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,1129.152,1147.197,"--That is correct, Your Honor, that is correct, Your Honor, and I might point out that he promised the defendants that should they wish to exclude any of these jurors because of anything they said, that he would certainly exclude them for cause, and it is very clear that at the close of the jury selection, the defendants were satisfied with the jury that they had."
1985.84-1606,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1147.197,1154.951,"I don't know why they whether we've breached it, but is the objection against the uniform or the gun?"
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,1154.951,1155.887,"Well, I think that--"
1985.84-1606,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1155.887,1156.887,Or both?
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,1156.887,1181.085,"--I suppose that we could say that it's both, Your Honor, and if it's against the uniform, I think that Flynn has a real problem because he was apparently willing to concede throughout the trial that the state marshals would be fine, the normal state marshals, and they wear uniforms, and their uniforms, I would submit, are no more obtrusive or obnoxious, if you will, to a defendant's presumption of innocence, than the uniform worn by the Rhode Island State Troopers."
1985.84-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1289.656,1293.441,Is it clear that the same evidence wasn't offered against the defendants who were acquitted?
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,1293.441,1298.495,"--Certainly that evidence, Your Honor, particularly with regard to Dussault was not offered against the defendants who were acquitted."
1985.84-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1298.495,1299.545,And how about the identification evidence?
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,1299.545,1299.979,"No, the--"
1985.84-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1299.979,1302.081,Was there identification evidence against the two who were acquitted?
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,1302.081,1308.701,"--The best identification evidence, the impartial witness identification evidence, was against Flynn, Your Honor, and I would argue that--"
1985.84-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1308.701,1312.172,Was there any identification evidence against the defendants who were acquitted?
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,1312.172,1319.343,--Only in my recollection of the record from the accomplice witnesses who were certainly more familiar--
1985.84-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1319.343,1325.663,So should we disregard the accomplish witnesses' testimonies throughout in order to decide whether the evidence is clearly sufficient as to those--
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,1325.663,1334.418,"--Well, I think that, I would say, Your Honor, is a jury question, and the jury seems to have accepted part of their testimony and apparently rejected part of their testimony."
1985.84-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1334.418,1336.454,"--But we should read it and accept it all, is that it?"
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,1336.454,1343.374,"Well, I think we should certainly accept what the jury accepted, Your Honor, which is the evidence against Flynn and the three defendants that it convicted."
1985.84-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1360.92,1361.72,May I ask this?
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,1374.995,1375.379,Well--
1985.84-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1375.379,1378.714,"For example, we don't yet know just how many people were in the courtroom, do we?"
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,1378.714,1380.066,"--That's true, Your Honor."
1985.84-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1381.133,1389.922,"I notice the district judge said that the complaint was that the use of armed and uniformed state troopers to augment, augment the other people that were there."
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,1389.922,1391.189,--There were marshals in the courtroom--
1985.84-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1391.189,1392.791,In addition to the four uniformed people.
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,1392.791,1394.607,--but the troopers were supplementing the marshals.
1985.84-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1394.607,1396.326,"But we don't know how many altogether, do we?"
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,1396.326,1413.454,"But I would suggest that the record itself in this case doesn't reflect because the defendants never, on a day to day basis, didn't put on the record how many troopers were present and how many marshals and where exactly they were, but I don't think the defendants would contend that there were more than four troopers present in the courtroom."
1985.84-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1413.92,1415.406,But there were more than four security personnel.
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,1415.406,1416.189,"--Oh, there certainly were."
1985.84-1606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1437.92,1440.355,"Your first argument is you want it reversed, isn't it?"
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,1440.972,1443.324,"Well, we certainly want it reversed, but I'm answering Justice Stevens' question with regard--"
1985.84-1606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1443.324,1443.74,"Yes, all right, yes."
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,1443.74,1445.759,--to a subsequent hearing.
1985.84-1606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1454.781,1456.983,Without the necessity for a new hearing?
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,1456.983,1460.201,"--Absolutely without the necessity for a new hearing, but short of that, Your Honor--"
1985.84-1606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1460.201,1461.151,"Yes, yes, all right."
1985.84-1606,0,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,1461.151,1486.167,"--Were this Court to conclude that the First Circuit had some points with regard to the manner in which the trial judge had conducted the pretrial hearing, it is certainly Flynn's burden a a habeas petitioner to put before the federal court facts that will support his claim for a new trial, and it is our view that he failed to do that by failing to put in any evidence in the lower court."
1985.84-1606,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1539.387,1540.587,Mr. Kannar?
1985.84-1606,1,25589,george_kannar,,1540.587,1543.605,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1606,2,42614,thomas_more_dickinson,,2791.643,2794.928,"Yes, ore or two points, Mr. Chief Justice, if I may."
