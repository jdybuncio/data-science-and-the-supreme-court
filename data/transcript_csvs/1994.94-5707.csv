1994.94-5707,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.779,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-5707, Sharlene Wilson v. Arkansas."
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,56.837,61.133,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.94-5707,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,138.227,138.555,Well wait.
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,144.646,145.629,--That's true.
1994.94-5707,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,145.629,156.016,"They got a warrant based on something that the fourth occupant was doing, and the other three had to be subjected to that, so that doesn't really carry a whole lot of weight, it seems to me."
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,156.016,163.481,"I think it carries weight because in the context of, the innocent inside a home have as much right to a knock-and-announce as the guilty."
1994.94-5707,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,163.481,165.122,Did the three live in the home?
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,165.122,167.918,"Ricki Cates lived in the home, her son."
1994.94-5707,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,169.963,171.774,Did the others you're referring to live in the home?
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,171.774,171.977,No.
1994.94-5707,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,172.368,176.43,Then do you think they had the same rights as a dweller in the house?
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,176.43,180.958,"If... the Olson case, Minnesota v. Olson, we're told that guests have standing in a house."
1994.94-5707,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,181.958,185.02,"That was an overnight guest, wasn't it?"
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,185.02,188.938,"That's true, but don't... doesn't any guest in a home have some standing--"
1994.94-5707,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,188.938,189.188,Well--
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,189.188,189.97,--to be free from a search?
1994.94-5707,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,189.97,195.983,--I think you're making some generalizations that perhaps require a little more refinement than you're giving them.
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,202.731,203.325,It doesn't.
1994.94-5707,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,203.325,208.338,"Your position is exactly the same if your client were the only person in the house, isn't that correct?"
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,208.338,222.051,"That's true, but I think it underscores the issue of the innocent having as much right as the guilty, in this case because there were three other people in the house, and as I was referring to the record, at page 379 we tried to get Ricki Cates to testify at trial."
1994.94-5707,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,249.212,258.286,"Do you suppose the inevitable discovery doctrine is applicable in these situations, so that evidence, in any event, wouldn't be excluded."
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,279.778,281.121,That doesn't even--
1994.94-5707,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,281.121,281.621,--make it admissible?
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,281.621,283.385,--bring in the plaintiff inevitable discovery doctrine.
1994.94-5707,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,290.961,296.224,"Well, presumably it would be open to the Court if it had to go back."
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,296.224,297.521,"Well, you have other cases."
1994.94-5707,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,300.223,300.505,Yes.
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,300.505,306.252,"But the State could raise, I suppose, any ground, and in this case I'll concede that all three grounds are possible."
1994.94-5707,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,306.252,306.612,Yes.
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,306.612,313.951,"But there's not any concrete proof on anything, because at the suppression hearing the State put on no evidence and cross-examined no witnesses."
1994.94-5707,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,326.884,327.992,Why... that is--
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,357.34,362.807,"No, but destruction of evidence under Arkansas law is a rather minor felony compared to the possession of a drug."
1994.94-5707,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,362.807,363.573,"Well, but that isn't the point."
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,367.524,368.087,Well--
1994.94-5707,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.087,376.568,"I don't see how you... how the unlawful destruction of contraband, unlawful destruction could possibly be a defense to the inevitable discovery principle."
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,376.568,382.066,"--Well, inevitable discovery is not an issue in this case, either, because that's not within the grant of cert.--"
1994.94-5707,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,382.066,384.173,But what's your position on the question?
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,391.952,409.008,"--No, because the State is using the inevitable discovery rule as an opportunity to salvage the search, but then on the other hand they argue we have to enter without announcement to make sure it's there, so if they have to enter without announcement to make sure it's there, that's not inevitable discovery."
1994.94-5707,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,414.349,421.425,"Mr. Hall, does it make a difference that in this case the police went through a screen door that was closed but not locked?"
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,430.124,441.838,"--There could be on the issue of reasonableness, and in this case it could also go to whether or not they could look through the door and see that they were police officers, because it was a screen door."
1994.94-5707,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,442.931,449.304,"Well, in this case, as entries go, this was rather mild, was it not?"
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,456.145,457.675,--They identified themselves.
1994.94-5707,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,479.932,492.77,"--Your position is, I take it, that there is a general rule that the search is unreasonable, prima facie unreasonable, if they enter without knocking and announce, in the absence of some exceptions which are not before us."
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,493.864,495.816,"--That's correct, and the reasonableness--"
1994.94-5707,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,495.816,497.176,--So that's why that covers this case.
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,504.842,508.341,--It would go back to determine the reasonableness overall.
1994.94-5707,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,532.379,550.981,"How much difference is there between the knock-and-announce rule as a part of the Fourth Amendment with some exceptions to it, which I gather is your position, and the position taken by the Solicitor General that the knock-and-announce rule is a factor to be considered in determining overall reasonableness?"
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,550.981,555.103,"I look at it a different way, that the Fourth Amendment requires announcement."
1994.94-5707,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,562.523,569.863,"Well, so what difference does it make, say, in a typical case if you apply one rule or the other?"
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,569.863,576.19,It's still... knock-and-announce becomes a Fourth Amendment requirement because it's part of reasonableness.
1994.94-5707,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,585.217,586.998,Can I ask about that?
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,611.816,612.269,Yes.
1994.94-5707,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,612.269,621.578,"Well, there they say, you know, was she in the bathroom, say I didn't see weapons drawn, but he says, I went straight to the bathroom where Mrs. Wilson was."
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,645.802,648.02,You have to draw the inference but there's no evidence of it.
1994.94-5707,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,648.02,651.394,"Well, what is the evidence where he says because she'd run to the bathroom?"
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,653.784,659.703,"Somebody told Efird that, she's gone to the bathroom."
1994.94-5707,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,661.155,661.467,So?
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,661.467,663.248,"--He was next-to-last through the door, or something like that."
1994.94-5707,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,663.248,664.513,"Yes, well, why isn't all that evidence?"
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,664.513,668.605,All that shows is an inference that she ran to the bathroom.
1994.94-5707,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,668.605,668.778,Right.
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,668.778,675.976,"You could guess that well, maybe she was in there flushing drugs, but even if she did flush drugs, in this case they've testified there was residue in the toilet."
1994.94-5707,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,675.976,676.289,All right.
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,697.625,698.313,That was in the affidavit--
1994.94-5707,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,698.313,702.529,"--And wouldn't that have been part of the evidence at the suppression hearing, because they must have introduced the warrant?"
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,702.529,705.497,--I introduced the warrant.
1994.94-5707,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,705.887,708.369,"All right, but I mean, was it... the question is... my question--"
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,708.369,708.588,The trial--
1994.94-5707,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,708.588,713.228,"--wasn't that there in the suppression hearing, and if it was, isn't that evidence of what you call peril?"
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,713.228,714.742,"--It was, but--"
1994.94-5707,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,714.742,717.491,"Well then, why would we have to send this back?"
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,717.491,733.892,"--Because the exceptions weren't a part of a grant of cert, and I direct the Court to Gates v. Illinois, pages 223, where the Court sent a case... or asked the case to be rebriefed on the question of the good faith exception."
1994.94-5707,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,733.892,734.782,"Well, we can do it."
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,746.591,746.965,That's true.
1994.94-5707,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,746.965,749.543,"--We need not allow it, but we certainly may allow it."
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,777.093,783.95,"I think you probably could, and I would concede that on remand I don't know that the proof would get much better."
1994.94-5707,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,794.726,809.487,"Counsel, suppose the police don't have any knowledge that there was a gun in the possession of a drug dealer but he is a drug dealer, is it unreasonable for the police to assume that he probably has a gun?"
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,809.487,816.514,"All the case law under the Federal statute has said possession of a gun alone is not enough, and we include--"
1994.94-5707,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,816.514,822.496,I'm asking what the police officers can assume when they begin to make their arrest.
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,827.073,832.743,--In some cases you could make that assumption.
1994.94-5707,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,839.38,859.122,"Is it unreasonable for the police to assume that in the case of easily disposable contraband that there is a strong probability, or a significant probability, that the contraband will be... that there will be an attempt to dispose of it by flushing it down the drain?"
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,861.73,875.834,"It's not, but I want to counter that with another view, that in this case, for example, by the time they got the search warrant, they had charges on her for three separate sales, and she got 31 years as a result of the sales."
1994.94-5707,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,895.451,910.009,"Well, you don't necessarily concede, do you, that destruction of the evidence is an adequate excuse for dispensing with knock-and-announce, or do you concede that?"
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,910.009,922.035,"It depends, I would say... to some extent I have to agree with the Government on that, but if it's a small quantity of drugs, you've already got them on a felony that could get them life imprisonment and you're going into possess, you're probably just as well off that they flushed it."
1994.94-5707,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,926.751,927.86,I think we--
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,927.86,929.25,--say we've got residue--
1994.94-5707,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,929.25,931.358,--I think we generally take these things crime by crime.
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,933.405,935.373,"--By the time they go in, though, they've got them."
1994.94-5707,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,937.013,953.116,I'm aware of no authority that requires the police to make a judgment as to whether or not there are some other crimes for which they might have evidence that would excuse them ignoring an ongoing crime.
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,959.832,961.472,--We're not asking them to ignore the crime.
1994.94-5707,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,976.341,985.666,"With respect to water, Mr. Hall, is the advent of the indoor toilet relevant to the Fourth Amendment analysis?"
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,985.666,995.616,"To some extent, it is, but even at common law people had stoves, they had pots in the house that had water in it, and if you had cocaine back in the Sixteenth Century they could have disposed of it that way."
1994.94-5707,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,995.616,1000.706,The disappearance of the indoor fireplace is a counterdevelopment--
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1003.392,1007.641,We go from the stove in the house to central heat to having indoor plumbing.
1994.94-5707,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1007.641,1009.969,Let me ask you this.
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1015.624,1016.436,We do.
1994.94-5707,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1016.436,1016.903,--for the house.
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1020.355,1025.526,"They also had an arrest warrant for the sales that occurred... the three sales that occurred prior, or at least two of the sales."
1994.94-5707,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1025.526,1025.617,--Okay.
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1025.617,1026.15,There may have been a third.
1994.94-5707,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1026.15,1052.093,"Now, if there is, indeed, an inevitable discovery doctrine that is applicable here, perhaps it isn't necessary that the case be remanded to determine what the risk of guns was, or anything of that kind, because presumably the evidence wouldn't be suppressed in any event if the inevitable discovery rule applies."
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1052.093,1053.701,"If it does, in fact apply."
1994.94-5707,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1053.701,1055.997,"There wouldn't be a factual determination to make, right?"
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1055.997,1067.961,"If it applies, but I dispute that it applies because of their own admissions and the way they argued the issue, that it has... we have to make the entry to make sure it's there, therefore it is the but-for reason that it's found."
1994.94-5707,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1067.961,1070.85,But it's a pure legal question.
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1076.41,1076.769,I think not.
1994.94-5707,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1077.472,1081.096,Does Arkansas have an inevitable discovery rule?
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1081.096,1083.157,It does.
1994.94-5707,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1102.9,1103.619,I understand.
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1106.211,1109.085,"Well, it's the way it was phrased in the opinion."
1994.94-5707,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1109.085,1109.414,Oh.
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1109.414,1109.976,It's--
1994.94-5707,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1109.976,1111.52,How would it apply in Arkansas?
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1129.373,1137.23,"--We don't know about Arkansas law, but I would counter that with, what about the overall reasonableness about the way this search was conducted?"
1994.94-5707,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1138.901,1143.681,"But doesn't that... under the inevitable discovery rule, isn't that all beside the point?"
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1152.942,1155.144,--Well--
1994.94-5707,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1155.144,1160.767,--How does the inevitable discovery rule work in those two different settings?
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1160.767,1164.641,--My response to that would be a kind of remedial response.
1994.94-5707,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1183.195,1186.991,"Exclude the evidence that would have been found anyway, even if they had entered properly?"
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1186.991,1191.099,If their conduct was so outrageous that it far surpassed reasonableness.
1994.94-5707,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1191.099,1199.782,"What if a State imposes an outrageous tax, I mean, you know, maybe an improper penalty for an outrageous collection of a tax as well?"
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1205.155,1207.232,"Well, taxes aren't normally imposed at gunpoint."
1994.94-5707,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1207.232,1207.514,I see.
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1217.526,1218.149,It's not irrelevant.
1994.94-5707,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1218.149,1221.648,"Well, it's irrelevant to whether the drugs would have been found or not."
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1221.648,1233.565,"Well, if you say that the drugs wouldn't have been flushed in any event, if there were so many drugs they would have always been found, no matter what, you know, how do you remedy a police abuse when they come in like that?"
1994.94-5707,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1233.565,1238.002,"Well, you have a lawsuit, don't you, under 1983?"
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1244.841,1246.295,They have a possible cause of action.
1994.94-5707,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1246.295,1246.685,Sure.
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1246.685,1249.31,"Whether or not it would actually go anywhere, I doubt seriously."
1994.94-5707,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1266.428,1270.255,But that's not the legal burden of proof.
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1270.255,1271.19,"No, that's the practical burden."
1994.94-5707,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1271.19,1273.174,You're just talking practicalities.
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1273.174,1281.655,"I'm talking the reality, because I've tried enough of them to know that in your own mind you've proved it by a preponderance, but the jury still says, well, they're police officers."
1994.94-5707,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1324.716,1336.055,"Well, what if in the course of a very rough search the authorities physically beat up on someone who was never then charged with anything?"
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1348.66,1365.592,"In the context of where somebody is, in fact, guilty of the crime, I'd say then that would not be an appropriate case for suppression of the evidence, but what I'm thinking about is the overall reasonableness of when the police come in, what do they know, what about the innocent people inside, what about the--"
1994.94-5707,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1365.592,1379.648,"Well, when you say overall reasonableness, supposing you've got three police coming into this house, and one of them is a maverick, and he simply sees the first person inside the house and just hits them with his billy, or whatever they take on these raids."
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1394.189,1399.937,"--If he is truly innocent and squeaky clean, he'd have a fairly good cause of action and could probably prevail."
1994.94-5707,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1399.937,1411.134,But could the two who are... against whom charges are made try to suppress the evidence found in the house on the basis of this one maverick officer's beating up of someone who is not charged?
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1411.134,1425.894,"In your hypothetical I'd say no, because the overall reasonableness of the search that produced the evidence would not... or that would not be unreasonable, under that situation, because it didn't involve the people who were the target of the search, and the other officers acted with restraint."
1994.94-5707,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1576.427,1582.067,"Well, you let the police officer calculate those odds."
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1589.375,1593.093,And we let them at their own folly take the risk of getting shot?
1994.94-5707,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1595.748,1608.478,"Well, I mean, you're asking us... I don't find... you have some good arguments, but I don't think that's one of them, that we should exercise the judgment of whether it's a wise thing for the policeman to go crashing in or not, from his standpoint."
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1608.478,1623.002,"Well, but he could make that determination based on what he knows at the scene, starting from the principle that we have an announcement requirement, but can it be dispensed with in this case for whatever reason, and if it can be dispensed with, I'm sure they'll be able to justify it."
1994.94-5707,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1647.414,1650.835,How about reasonable suspicion that evidence will be destroyed?
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1650.835,1652.35,Possibly the same as well.
1994.94-5707,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1652.35,1653.287,Isn't that--
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1653.287,1654.053,But Bowie--
1994.94-5707,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1654.053,1657.003,--Wouldn't that be so in so many of these narcotics cases?
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1657.003,1660.268,"--Well, we have to remember, Bowie is based on safety of the officer."
1994.94-5707,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1669.187,1685.305,"Well, why doesn't knowledge that there's a gun in the house give rise to the safety of the officer concerned and the presence of marijuana in a place with indoor plumbing to the destruction of evidence?"
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1688.757,1693.459,Because then you're creating a blanket exception without any belief in the facts.
1994.94-5707,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1693.459,1697.44,"No, not a blanket exception without any belief in the facts, these facts."
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1697.44,1697.721,Well--
1994.94-5707,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1697.721,1698.924,There's a gun in that house.
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1703.049,1716.308,"--If the warrant is to search for narcotics, then you've created a blanket exception that the police can enter any time that drugs are involved, and since 42 percent of all American households have guns in them, can you say that there's a reasonable suspicion there's a gun in the house?"
1994.94-5707,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1721.806,1727.319,"Well, what would be enough to have a concern about the safety of the officer?"
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1732.645,1740.814,"--In this case, I think you could say there was enough in this case because you've got an alleged threat to the informant."
1994.94-5707,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1750.543,1761.416,A gun plus someone who is reasonably suspected of being a violent person willing to use that gun.
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1761.416,1762.43,Willing to use the gun.
1994.94-5707,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1762.43,1763.696,Yes.
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1763.696,1772.348,"If the guy's got a history of beating up people, I would say that would be enough, given the presence of a gun as well, but these are all hypotheticals that are way beyond the facts."
1994.94-5707,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1781.312,1781.859,Thank you--
1994.94-5707,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1781.859,1782.64,That would be enough.
1994.94-5707,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1782.64,1783.202,"--Thank you, Mr. Hall."
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1787.42,1792.246,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-5707,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1831.824,1839.258,"General Bryant, do you deny that it is a relevant consideration in determining whether the entry was, and the search was reasonable?"
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1839.258,1841.602,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-5707,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1842.226,1845.772,"Do you deny it, or do you agree that it is a relevant consideration?"
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1845.772,1845.975,--Yes.
1994.94-5707,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1856.096,1862.295,"No, but my question is, is it a relevant consideration in determining whether a search is reasonable or not?"
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1868.371,1875.978,"No, Your Honor, in that instance the case is... the State's first argument is that it is not relevant in the consideration."
1994.94-5707,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1875.978,1882.069,So then under your view the State routinely could use a battering ram to knock down every door.
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1882.069,1883.288,"No, Your Honor."
1994.94-5707,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1884.444,1889.66,So then the way entry is affected is a component of reasonableness.
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1889.66,1895.611,"--In the case of a battering ram, Your Honor, that would be subject to the reasonableness clause."
1994.94-5707,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1895.611,1896.407,How about kicking?
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1896.407,1905.95,"It might be necessary in some instances, Your Honor, where that was the means by which the officers had to enter."
1994.94-5707,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1905.95,1908.731,How about using a skeleton key?
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1908.731,1910.979,That would be--
1994.94-5707,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1910.979,1912.916,"All of this is without knocking, obviously."
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1912.916,1913.119,--Yes.
1994.94-5707,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1918.632,1925.692,All of these hypotheticals I've given to you constitute reasonable entry in all cases?
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1925.692,1926.848,"--It could, Your Honor."
1994.94-5707,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1929.254,1931.893,"Well, that's what we're testing, is the State's--"
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1931.893,1932.096,Yes.
1994.94-5707,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1932.096,1932.44,--first theory.
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1932.44,1933.345,The--
1994.94-5707,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1933.345,1941.201,I think the answer to each of my questions under your first theory is that there is no illegality in the entry.
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1941.201,1945.091,"--That is correct, Your Honor, that's possible."
1994.94-5707,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1947.309,1950.12,"Well, I... I'd like... we have to write the opinion."
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1963.707,1966.363,"--The... yes, Your... well, let me answer it this way, Your Honor."
1994.94-5707,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1974.001,1978.374,I want to know if it's an element in considering the reasonableness of the search.
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1978.374,1979.389,"--No, Your Honor."
1994.94-5707,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1980.825,1992.961,"So literally, if the State presented evidence and said, we knocked on the door and started to say we're police officers and there's an objection, the judge would say, strike that, that is totally irrelevant evidence?"
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1995.741,1997.366,"--Under the... yes, under the reasonable clause."
1994.94-5707,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2087.61,2101.622,"General Bryant, what is the purpose and effect of the Arkansas statute that says to make an arrest an officer may break open a door after having demanded admittance and explain the purpose for which admittance is desired?"
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,2101.622,2117.489,"Your Honor, in Arkansas the supreme court has adopted rules of criminal procedure, and the supreme court has taken the position that their rules supersede those of the legislature."
1994.94-5707,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2125.502,2126.767,But what is the court's rule in--
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,2126.767,2132.109,The court's rule on arrest warrants does not require knock and announce.
1994.94-5707,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2133.156,2133.906,--But there's--
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,2133.906,2134.201,--search warrants.
1994.94-5707,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2134.201,2136.638,"--As I understand it, the rules are silent."
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,2146.899,2150.945,"Yes, there is a rule on arrest warrants, Your Honor."
1994.94-5707,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2152.756,2154.786,This doesn't address warrants.
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,2169.515,2179.856,"--It's the criminal rules of criminal procedure number 4, Your Honor, that's been promulgated by the Arkansas court."
1994.94-5707,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2179.856,2183.135,And what does that rule say about how the officer is to make an arrest?
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,2183.135,2188.366,The officer in making arrests does not have to knock and announce.
1994.94-5707,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2191.115,2195.551,So then we have a silent... we have a statute that says one thing.
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,2198.55,2209.374,"--The State would submit, Your Honor, that based on Arkansas supreme court practice their rules would take precedence over a legislative statute."
1994.94-5707,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2209.374,2226.397,"General Bryant, I'm going to decide this case on the basis of whether I think there was a knock-and-announce rule at common law when the Fourth Amendment was adopted, and that it was assumed that part of the reasonableness of a search was that element."
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,2239.721,2240.673,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-5707,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2241.235,2242.548,You do dispute that?
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,2242.548,2243.735,--We do dispute that.
1994.94-5707,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2243.735,2248.248,What's your best case showing that such a rule did not exist?
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,2248.248,2252.154,"Your Honor, the State has cited two cases in the brief."
1994.94-5707,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2282.891,2285.062,"Where are they in your brief, and how old are they?"
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,2285.062,2295.792,"Your Honor, that is located... one case, Your Honor, is 1802, and the other case is 1819, and that--"

1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,2298.056,2304.459,"--Page 22 of the brief, Lonnick v. Brown and Ratcliffe v. Burton are the two cases."
1994.94-5707,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2338.025,2340.212,Well--
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,2340.212,2343.615,--this Court should not follow the common law knock-and-announce rule.
1994.94-5707,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2343.615,2346.849,"--Now, it depends on what you mean by the knock-and-announce rule."
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,2398.921,2400.468,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-5707,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2400.468,2404.216,What do you do about all the cases that seem to announce such a general principle?
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,2404.216,2405.966,Your Honor--
1994.94-5707,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2405.966,2407.887,Many cite it in the brief for petition.
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,2407.887,2409.557,--That is correct--
1994.94-5707,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2409.557,2410.417,And for the Government.
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,2410.417,2439.42,"--And for the Government, that is correct, but the point the State is making in that is that the authority is not conclusive or well-settled that that was the rule at common law, but even assuming that it was, this Court should not follow a common law rule that incorporates certain police practices when the Fourth Amendment was adopted or before into a black letter constitutional rule at this time."
1994.94-5707,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2439.42,2443.513,Why isn't it reasonable... you don't have to go... they go back to Edward I.
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,2477.296,2481.56,"Your Honor, that would be reasonable, and that's the State's position."
1994.94-5707,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2489.197,2510.454,"You know that they'd require... you'd require it because it's reasonable, and unreasonable not to knock and announce where they're not going to destroy any evidence, you have no reason for thinking so, you have no reason for thinking there's any danger, and there's this pedigree in history saying that it's unreasonable under those circumstances."
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,2512.125,2564.651,"Your Honor, in this case the officers had a search warrant, and there was a probable cause requirement met that there was illegal contraband on premises plus there was a weapon on premises, and in situations where the officers serve a warrant, they are at great risk, and the rule that Arkansas is suggesting would provide for the protection of officers, the protection of occupants by standards if present, as well as legitimate law enforcement principles of preventing the escape of suspects, preventing the destruction of evidence, and this Court has said that a categorical rule is best developed which will give the officers firm guidance in the field."
1994.94-5707,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2595.467,2602.792,"Well, what's the matter with the proposal of the Solicitor General, that would certainly take into account the long common law tradition?"
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,2610.383,2610.522,Yes--
1994.94-5707,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2610.522,2622.831,"And there's a very long tradition here that has to be taken into account, and the fact that the officers don't knock and announce certainly at a minimum ought to be a factor in what's reasonable."
1994.94-5707,1,29280,j_winston_bryant,,2622.831,2648.32,"--That is essentially the U.S. Government's position, and that is the State's fall back position, that if this Court does not see fit to announce a categorical rule to protect the police officers in this instance, that a reasonable fall back would be the position by the Solicitor, in that knock and announce would be part of the reasonableness test under the Fourth Amendment."
1994.94-5707,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2648.32,2650.867,"Time to fall back, General Bryant, I think."
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2655.77,2661.221,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-5707,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2674.388,2679.026,"Mr. Dreeben, I have the same question that the Chief Justice asked at the outset of the argument."
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2698.472,2716.62,"I think, Justice Kennedy, that's largely a semantic difference, but there is a connotation when one uses the word, exigent circumstances, that the police may have to have a particularly compelling immediate justification for dispensing with the requirement in question."
1994.94-5707,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2738.221,2743.406,"Mr. Dreeben, what do you want us to do in this case, just say that there is some such general requirement?"
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2745.297,2745.672,--Yes.
1994.94-5707,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2764.18,2766.944,Are there findings that support that conclusion?
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2766.944,2768.084,"--No, Justice Stevens."
1994.94-5707,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2768.084,2769.819,We should make the findings de novo ourselves?
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2769.819,2772.021,I don't think there's any serious dispute on that.
1994.94-5707,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2781.111,2783.344,"We would at least have to read the record in full, I suppose."
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2783.344,2786.562,--I think you'd have to read the record of the suppression hearing.
1994.94-5707,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2787.607,2787.842,Yes.
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2787.842,2804.694,"--the suppression motion was renewed at trial, and it would be appropriate to confine the record to the evidence that was adduced by the petitioner at the suppression hearing, but even that evidence clearly shows that there were two justifications known to the police, the violence risk, which I've alluded to, and the potential for destruction of evidence."
1994.94-5707,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2804.694,2806.241,What's your best case for that?
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2817.939,2839.071,"This Court recognized in the Sabbath case in describing the common law that destruction of evidence was a permissible ground for dispensing with knock and announce, but Justice Scalia, I think it's important to keep in mind that the common law, as it evolved in England, did not primarily consider the question of entries to effectuate search warrants."
1994.94-5707,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2848.224,2849.817,Sure.
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2849.817,2850.207,"Also, of course--"
1994.94-5707,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2850.207,2852.503,"But they still knock and announce, warrant or not."
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2852.503,2852.706,--Yes.
1994.94-5707,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2861.953,2862.906,I don't understand what you're saying.
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2868.529,2884.428,"--There were no cases that evaluated the question of what sort of requirements attached to searches by the police, and I think at common law there was no justification for searching merely for evidence at all."
1994.94-5707,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2905.919,2907.013,Except for the fireplace--
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2908.013,2908.387,--that is--
1994.94-5707,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2908.387,2909.84,They could just toss it right in.
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2913.04,2918.71,"--That is true, if it were lit, and if the police were coming on the scene at a time when it could be done."
1994.94-5707,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2918.71,2922.71,"Mr. Dreeben, what about the inevitable discovery notion."
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2934.877,2936.922,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1994.94-5707,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2952.761,2957.632,"Well, then, what's the point of trying to decide some factual issue where there are no findings below?"
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2957.632,2959.131,I think it would--
1994.94-5707,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2959.131,2964.488,"I mean, it would be certainly much simpler to deal with it on the inevitable discovery theory."
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2964.488,2969.612,--There is a certain amount of ease of application of that notion.
1994.94-5707,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2988.479,3000.927,"But as I understood your brief in the case of drug dealers, there is a presumption that they have an arm and a weapon, and that they may dispose of the contraband."
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3003.02,3003.223,--No.
1994.94-5707,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3010.643,3015.155,"In my colloquy with the defense counsel you said, well, this is a low level drug dealer."
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3021.294,3022.903,"--For this purpose, yes, Justice Kennedy."
1994.94-5707,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3055.39,3056.202,Or almost anything else.
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3087.47,3091.406,"Well, I don't think, Justice Scalia, that it entirely swallows the rule."
1994.94-5707,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3119.13,3131.624,"I just wonder whether that's a good enough exception to come in without knocking into a house, especially as you tell me that in common law you couldn't go in for evidence anyway, at all, even with knock and announce."
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3131.624,3132.312,Well--
1994.94-5707,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3132.312,3135.779,"Now you're saying you can not only go in to get evidence, but you can do it without knocking and announcing."
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3135.779,3138.076,"--Well, I... my response to that is twofold."
1994.94-5707,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3152.226,3162.753,"In that respect, do you make a difference between what the statute requires of Federal officers and what the Fourth Amendment requires of all officers?"
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3165.33,3167.049,"--No, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.94-5707,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3194.302,3197.113,May I ask a broader question based on that statement?
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3209.592,3217.34,--I don't think it would be precisely the same as this Court's construction of 3109 in every respect.
1994.94-5707,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3242.018,3250.373,"Apart from the question of remedy, in terms of the scope of whether there's a violation of the Fourth Amendment, would you say the law would be the same as whether there's a violation of 3109?"
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3250.373,3261.603,"Well, none of this Court's cases under 3109 evaluated whether there were exceptions, because the facts didn't present them, and to that extent those cases simply didn't present the problem that we have here."
1994.94-5707,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3263.306,3265.883,"Well, let me ask you in a different way, then."
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3282.75,3282.985,--No.
1994.94-5707,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3288.781,3289.67,As the Fourth Amendment.
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3289.67,3290.545,--as the Fourth Amendment.
1994.94-5707,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3290.545,3308.037,"Mr. Dreeben, I take it that in our decision in Warden v. Hayden, which I guess was the late sixties, we have already departed from the common law in construing the Fourth Amendment, since we there held that you could search for evidence and the common law didn't permit it."
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3308.037,3314.614,"That is correct, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and that was my second response to Justice Scalia's comment on the common law."
1994.94-5707,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3327.249,3342.476,"I understand that, but that's... but it's a further question to say not only are we going to let you go in to look for evidence when you couldn't do it before, but the obtaining of that evidence we are also going to allow to dispense with the common law requirement of knock and announce."
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3358.455,3381.351,"Well, the American common law from very early cases in this country did recognize that when it would be counterproductive to knock and announce before making the entry, such as by provoking a felon within to use violence to repel officers who were there to arrest them, then knock and announce need not be complied with, and that is the very principle that we are contending for here today with respect to the risk of violence."
1994.94-5707,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3381.351,3394.456,"Do I understand you to be saying, though, that this is largely an academic discussion, because if you have a warrant, then you can break the door down, you can be brutal, it doesn't matter because of the inevitable discovery rule."
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3394.456,3399.782,"For most of the evidence that is acquired under a search warrant, that is true, although I wouldn't--"
1994.94-5707,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3399.782,3407.607,"Well, why isn't the same reasoning, then, sufficient whenever there's a search without a warrant, where a warrant would be required by general rules?"
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3415.79,3427.348,"--I don't think so, Justice Souter, because the presumption that if police had applied for a warrant they would have gotten it is a very different thing from saying they did go to the magistrate, they did get the warrant, and they are--"
1994.94-5707,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3427.348,3436.143,Is it any more bizarre than saying that if they had knocked and announced they would have done the right thing and they just didn't happen to knock and announce?
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3455.165,3467.52,"--Well, the warrant that they possessed, which is the primary source of protection that the Fourth Amendment affords to privacy and against unreasonable searches, authorized them to acquire this evidence, so they were going to--"
1994.94-5707,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3467.52,3479.938,"Yes, but that begs the question whether it authorized them to go in in a manner which under a general rule, or a rule that takes into consideration knock and announce, was unreasonable."
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3483.561,3484.388,--That is true.
1994.94-5707,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3484.388,3486.762,"It got them to the threshold, is what I'm saying."
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3489.34,3501.693,"That is true, but this Court's cases that have examined police entries into dwellings that were done both under warrant and not under warrant have recognized that the evidence that is acquired under warrant is the fruit of the warrant."
1994.94-5707,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3517.64,3529.542,"Well, if that's the case, then I don't know why we're arguing about knock and announce, because the evidence is always going to be inside if they arrived with a warrant, and it's going to be there whether they knocked or whether they didn't knock."
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3529.542,3541.443,"That is true, Justice Souter, as to the tangible evidence that they seize, but it may not be true as to some of the things that they observe upon making an immediate entry, and if the entry is unlawful, a court could suppress things that they observe--"
1994.94-5707,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3541.443,3544.739,"But I was going to say, that's not what you're arguing would be inevitably discovered."
1994.94-5707,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3544.739,3545.364,--That's correct.
1994.94-5707,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3545.364,3545.738,Yes.
1994.94-5707,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3545.738,3546.878,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
