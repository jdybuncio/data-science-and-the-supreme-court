1959.295,0,35257,leroy_a_wright,,39.051,42.893,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1959.295,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,360.527,360.839,A deed --
1959.295,0,35257,leroy_a_wright,,360.839,361.334,-- still --
1959.295,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,361.334,362.87,-- a deed from RFC?
1959.295,0,35257,leroy_a_wright,,362.87,363.769,To the United States.
1959.295,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,363.769,366.054,You mean --
1959.295,0,35257,leroy_a_wright,,366.054,369.248,"There was no deed, formal deed under the --"
1959.295,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,369.248,370.966,From whom to whom?
1959.295,0,35257,leroy_a_wright,,370.966,383.92,"From RFC to the United States of America, such a deed was subsequently issued and recorded in 1955 but not at the time."
1959.295,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,383.92,387.128,"It went from RFC to War Assets Corporation, is it?"
1959.295,0,35257,leroy_a_wright,,387.128,390.029,By virtue of the declaration that it was surplus.
1959.295,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,390.029,399.218,"And it -- I'm not interested, not in words, not to known but is the deed a formal deed the way one agency of government transfers to another?"
1959.295,0,35257,leroy_a_wright,,399.218,400.894,"We think not, sir."
1959.295,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,412.282,416.012,I didn't mean to stumble on the issue in the case by an innocent question.
1959.295,0,35257,leroy_a_wright,,416.012,418.367,"You did, sir.[Laughter]"
1959.295,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,418.367,428.61,"That might raise questions, might it not, as to whether or not the RFC is an agency in the sense used here?"
1959.295,0,35257,leroy_a_wright,,428.61,431.837,"I think not, sir, under the decision."
1959.295,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1231.77,1235.367,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1959.295,2,36122,manuel_l_kugler,,2764.847,2768.546,"Mr. Chief Justice, and if the Court pleases."
1959.295,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3045.181,3046.128,"Mr. Kugler, may I --"
1959.295,2,36122,manuel_l_kugler,,3046.128,3046.157,Yes --
1959.295,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3046.157,3047.329,-- ask you a question about --
1959.295,2,36122,manuel_l_kugler,,3047.329,3047.666,-- Justice Whittaker.
1959.295,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3047.666,3048.901,-- please?
1959.295,2,36122,manuel_l_kugler,,3064.99,3085.129,"Well, Your Honor, I think that was what they were -- were aiming to determine that they were -- they had to go through the vehicle of determining what the state statute meant, whether the state statute applied, whether the definition in the state statute would control and there was this interpretation of local law which was present -- which has never been present in this case."
1959.295,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3085.129,3088.41,"Now, what have you to say of this?"
1959.295,2,36122,manuel_l_kugler,,3106.336,3109.718,That -- that certainly is a question which I think raised by appellant.
1959.295,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3109.718,3135.661,"Now, then, implicitly, doesn't that raise some question why and namely, that the state statute, as applied, violates the Federal Constitution without -- without saying it in words isn't that inherently and implicitly and necessarily involved?"
1959.295,2,36122,manuel_l_kugler,,3135.661,3137.183,"Perhaps, you're correct but --"
1959.295,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3137.183,3137.823,I -- I don't know -- I'd like (Voice Overlap)
1959.295,2,36122,manuel_l_kugler,,3137.823,3160.985,"Yes, yes, I -- I think -- I think that we -- we must concede there's a merit to that but that the issue is this that under -- under the -- the rules of this Court and the decisions of this Court, including the Wilson case, as I observed, Wilson versus Cook, 327 U.S. 474, the Court observed that the -- the record in this case does not disclosed at anytime in the course of proceedings."
1959.295,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3201.588,3230.226,"Well, if you say, you have no right to assess the tax because to do so would violate the Constitution of the United States, aren't you saying that to apply your state statute to effect collection of the tax is what violates this -- the Federal Constitution and therefore, the state statute, when so applied, violates the Constitution?"
1959.295,2,36122,manuel_l_kugler,,3230.226,3230.938,Well --
1959.295,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3230.938,3235.475,"Of course, you -- you wouldn't have the problem if you didn't have a state statute --"
1959.295,2,36122,manuel_l_kugler,,3235.475,3236.595,"No, that's true, Mr. --"
1959.295,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3236.595,3237.091,-- and because the --
1959.295,2,36122,manuel_l_kugler,,3237.091,3237.697,-- Justice Frankfurter.
1959.295,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3237.697,3239.302,-- the State couldn't levy it.
1959.295,2,36122,manuel_l_kugler,,3262.719,3274.892,"Of course, that's our position that these -- these courts below and certainly the California Supreme Court know where they ask to, did they spend any time in discussing the validity of California statute."
1959.295,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3283.888,3297.388,"The question of how far back you go, I'm saying that you really implicate a matter of validity of the state statute either directly or -- or either on its face by implication."
1959.295,2,36122,manuel_l_kugler,,3297.388,3297.458,Yes.
1959.295,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3297.458,3300.127,Didn't the state statute has entangled this?
1959.295,2,36122,manuel_l_kugler,,3305.046,3306.037,"Well, that -- that's true."
1959.295,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3306.037,3310.848,But -- but all the -- all the shooting is about not the state statute but things outside of it.
1959.295,2,36122,manuel_l_kugler,,3310.848,3312.003,That's precisely true.
1959.295,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3320.958,3329.423,"-- what -- what you've said, Mr. Kugler, is there any reason why the certiorari jurisdiction the Court should not be exercised?"
1959.295,2,36122,manuel_l_kugler,,3329.423,3330.383,"Oh, no, Your Honor."
1959.295,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3347.651,3347.706,Yes.
1959.295,2,36122,manuel_l_kugler,,3347.706,3349.727,-- in the court of certiorari and --
1959.295,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3349.727,3349.73,You -- you --
1959.295,2,36122,manuel_l_kugler,,3349.73,3350.745,-- give you more chance to adopt (Voice Overlap) --
1959.295,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3350.745,3354.838,-- make no contention that there's not a federal question involved here.
1959.295,2,36122,manuel_l_kugler,,3354.838,3355.488,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear."
1959.295,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3355.488,3356.615,You make no contention that there's not a federal question involved.
1959.295,2,36122,manuel_l_kugler,,3356.615,3358.366,"No, no, Your Honor."
1959.295,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3358.651,3359.664,Yes.
1959.295,2,36122,manuel_l_kugler,,3359.664,3367.868,Thank you very much.
1959.295,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3367.868,3377.583,Mr. Dietz.
1959.295,3,26882,henry_a_dietz,,3377.583,3383.429,"Mr. Chief Justice Warren, Mr. Justices of the Supreme Court."
1959.295,4,35257,leroy_a_wright,,4220.451,4221.184,May I --
1959.295,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4221.184,4221.539,Mr. Wright --
1959.295,4,35257,leroy_a_wright,,4221.539,4222.811,Mr. Chief Justice --
1959.295,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4222.811,4223.842,-- you may continue.
1959.295,4,35257,leroy_a_wright,,4223.842,4228.126,"-- members of the Court, with your permission."
1959.295,4,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4649.077,4667.202,"Do you -- do you, by that argument, sustain this right that all property, whether owned by the RFC or if not by its name is property of the United States not subject therefore to taxation?"
1959.295,4,35257,leroy_a_wright,,4667.202,4669.818,I -- I'm not talking about the waiver.
