1974.73-1210,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.687,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in 73-1210, Interstate Commerce Commission against Oregon Pacific Industries."
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,15.074,18.045,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1210,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,142.269,144.284,"When was that, in the summer of 1973?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,144.284,145.145,No Your Honor.
1974.73-1210,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,282.128,288.18,"The stop -- just an arbitrate place or other or what, how is that?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,288.18,292.32,In the specific instance of lumber shipping of the --
1974.73-1210,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,292.32,293.672,They moved from west to east basically?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,293.672,294.944,Yes Your Honor.
1974.73-1210,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,307.242,311.963,Were there half a dozen or dozen places that have these facilities?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,311.963,315.398,"Yes Mr. Justice Stewart, in that order."
1974.73-1210,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,324.305,326.862,And these are the Midwest somewhere?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,326.862,344.507,"Primarily in the Midwest, but in a far west possibly in Wyoming, Washington State but generally the movement is correctly pointed from the northwest towards the east and the reconsignment points might conceivably be in any place in that quadrant of the country."
1974.73-1210,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,451.244,457.881,"The shippers sometimes in effect use the demurrage as storage cost, in fact, do they not?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,457.881,462.107,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe they do."
1974.73-1210,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,462.107,473.423,"Mr. White, what are the problems have been had the Commission elected to increase the demurrage sufficiently to bring back the same result?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,473.423,488.564,"Well, Your Honor if the demurrage was increased sufficiently as you put it, the exact -- the limitation of the storage time would still be uncertain."
1974.73-1210,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,543.278,545.644,"Demurrage that goes progressively, doesn't it?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,545.644,546.534,"Yes, Your Honor, it does."
1974.73-1210,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,546.534,548.795,"It's not so much a day, it's so much --"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,548.795,553.434,"Well, it can be structured of any where the Commission chooses I believe but it's --"
1974.73-1210,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,553.434,555.38,But it gets greater per day as the --
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,555.38,555.872,"Yes, in step --"
1974.73-1210,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,555.872,557.111,And has the number of days increase?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,557.111,560.267,Yes Mr. Justice Stewart.
1974.73-1210,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,695.796,697.514,"Went to a lot of money, doesn't it?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,697.514,700.838,"Yes indeed, it does, Your Honor."
1974.73-1210,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,700.838,702.886,Had there been any precedent for this sort of thing?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,702.886,703.386,I'm sorry sir?
1974.73-1210,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,703.386,705.013,Any precedent for this sort of thing?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,705.013,706.089,Yes sir.
1974.73-1210,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,711.944,717.498,"It was a little bit of bind in answering that question of My brother Brennan, didn't you stipulate --"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,717.498,718.032,Yes indeed.
1974.73-1210,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,728.735,731.369,But there is a stipulation that there's no precedent?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,731.369,731.9,There is a stipulation.
1974.73-1210,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,731.9,735.269,"Well, in fact, is that there is at least one or maybe two precedent, right?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,735.269,739.25,"Yes, indeed, that's the case."
1974.73-1210,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,739.25,747.635,"And in any event there is no list that the rate -- the rate -- the basis, changes on the fifth day?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,747.635,749.546,"No Your Honor, I'd like to --"
1974.73-1210,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,749.546,757.557,Are you charge -- you charge some of the individual rates rather than the joint rate?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,757.557,758.605,I'd like to --
1974.73-1210,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,758.605,760.423,Or the true rate?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,760.423,777.511,"Mr. Justice White, I'd like to try and answer your question this way: the Commission suspendeit as it can under 1(15)(a) the car service rule which allows through rate privileges with reconsignment."
1974.73-1210,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,777.581,779.839,"Well, what was in the tariff?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,779.839,782.886,That was in the tariff.
1974.73-1210,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,799.368,801.456,Rates too?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,801.456,804.745,"This must, yes Your Honor."
1974.73-1210,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,870.19,883.586,"Do you say that the other side of Mr. Justice White's question is that if the car moves within the designated time, the rate isn't change at all?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,883.586,885.451,"Precisely that, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1974.73-1210,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,886.42,887.827,"So, it depends on how we look at it?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,887.827,892.748,"The rate -- exactly, that the option is left with the shipper."
1974.73-1210,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,937.062,959.558,"Mr. White, before the Commission entered its order that's on appeal here supposing that you put lumber in a boxcar in Portland and consign it to Chicago and then exercise your reconsignment privilege as the shipper to say it goes back to Denver and it's all them at least sold in Denver, now, what rate would the shipper pay?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,959.558,965.556,"The shipper would pay ,Mr. Justice Rehnquist the through rate from Portland to Denver."
1974.73-1210,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,965.556,967.539,You mean he could ship it --
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,967.539,982.654,"Even with that built-in security that I eluded to earlier, that the security is a -- it's a part of the practice that is necessary if reconsignment is fully a part --"
1974.73-1210,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,982.654,987.863,Even if it ended up -- if they want to if he is going back to Seattle he don't -- he'd pay only from Portland to Seattle?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,987.863,1012.369,"I believe that's right, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and that leads me to a point that this Court touched upon way back in a Turner Lumber case that reconsignment privileges are during times of economic crisis anyway is inherently ways for transportation resources."
1974.73-1210,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1120.923,1125.984,"Mr. White, if you -- let me theorize a little bit."
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1138.087,1144.101,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, which chronic problem do you mean, the car shortage or the reconsignment?"
1974.73-1210,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1144.101,1145.85,The car shortage.
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1145.85,1146.35,"Well, --"
1974.73-1210,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1146.35,1148.082,It seems lways to be with us --
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1148.082,1157.076,I can report that the Commission has taken a very significant and important step just this week I believe in ex parte 241.
1974.73-1210,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1186.969,1189.752,Financing on that I gather has put a problem.
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1189.752,1201.458,"It's -- the financing is a mixed problem because some of the nation's railroads as you know, Mr. Justice Brennan, are in the financial trouble but others are not."
1974.73-1210,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1201.458,1202.56,But this applies uniformly?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1202.56,1212.063,"This applies uniformly and it is aimed at increasing the fleet by some 69,000 units and reducing the bad order ratio."
1974.73-1210,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1281.251,1284.501,I gather this order -- did this order ever come effective?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1284.501,1288.666,This order was effective during the -- and it worked.
1974.73-1210,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1303.288,1305.819,Has the emergency that prompted it --
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1305.819,1307.002,The emergency probably --
1974.73-1210,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1307.002,1309.771,"That's over, is it?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1309.771,1315.773,I would say given the lumber prices in the housing industry that probably is over now.
1974.73-1210,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1317.179,1318.704,"Well, I meant the grain deal."
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1318.704,1319.615,"Oh, well, --"
1974.73-1210,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1319.615,1321.001,That was the emergency that created it.
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1321.001,1330.716,"No Your Honor, that was -- yes, that was a -- the part of this tremendous unexpected emergency."
1974.73-1210,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1336.974,1338.2,You mean independent of the grain?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1338.2,1347.339,Independent of but it was an event that could not be tolerated in the face of the overriding need to get the cars moving.
1974.73-1210,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1347.339,1355.077,"Well, in the past three years, we've had three or four years, we've had two or three car shortage cases here before us, have we not?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1355.077,1356.88,"Yes indeed, Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-1210,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1356.88,1361.494,All emergency situations stemming from other factors?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1361.494,1367.357,"No, I respectfully would not call them all emergency situations."
1974.73-1210,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1367.929,1368.697,But you said car shortage problem --
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1368.697,1374.686,"-- there were chronic shortage problems that is not what I'm here talking about today, Your Honor."
1974.73-1210,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1379.907,1387.91,"But there's nothing unique about a car shortage problem in this country from time to time, is there?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1387.91,1393.205,"No, we have -- we're in a period of a chronic shortage."
1974.73-1210,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1393.205,1397.091,But sometimes we have the cars but we have them in places where they aren't needed.
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1397.091,1406.266,"Indeed, we do and that's one of the reason why we have to have -- the Commission has to have the ability to order the cars to be moved to where they are needed the most."
1974.73-1210,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1406.266,1418.309,"Well, Mr. White, the statute of course confers this power only shortage of equipment or other emergency and you just said that this is a chronic condition."
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1418.415,1420.227,No Your Honor --
1974.73-1210,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1420.227,1421.257,-- if it's chronic?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1421.257,1431.931,"I'm trying to explain, if I may, that what I'm talking about here is a series of car Service Orders and the car Service Order that was aimed at an emergency."
1974.73-1210,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1431.931,1434.616,"Well, it's a never ending emergency, wasn't it?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1434.616,1436.782,"No, indeed, I don't believe it is."
1974.73-1210,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1436.782,1444.959,I understood your answer to be that there has been a chronic shortage for some time but this was an extraordinary emergency.
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1444.959,1453.404,"This was an emergency on top of the chronic shortage, an emergency that triggered the extraordinary summary powers that the Commission has."
1974.73-1210,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1453.404,1455.851,That being the grain -- that the grain deal --
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1455.851,1458.166,"The grain deal was one segment of it as I have mentioned, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1974.73-1210,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1458.166,1459.206,"Well, that's over?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1459.206,1459.862,That's over.
1974.73-1210,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1460.151,1463.656,"Now, what's left in the way of the emergency?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1463.656,1470.388,I don't believe that the emergency that supported 1134 still exists and that's totally consistent with.
1974.73-1210,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1470.388,1476.727,"Well, nobody know that then if you prevail here what happens to 1134?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1476.727,1487.895,"If we prevail, 1134 might -- 1134 is still is in existence but it has been suspended by the Court."
1974.73-1210,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1487.895,1490.649,"I know that but if you prevail, what happens?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1490.649,1491.216,If we prevail --
1974.73-1210,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1491.216,1492.193,Reinstated?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1492.193,1499.255,"If we prevail, 1134 probably would be terminated because of the -- beyond of the emergency."
1974.73-1210,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1509.875,1512.942,But you don't think that something like mootness about this thing?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1512.942,1517.987,"Indeed, I don't, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1974.73-1210,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1573.374,1578.509,"Well, Mr. White, following through a little on this, didn't the 1134 by its terms have an expiration date?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1578.509,1585.248,"Indeed, it did as to all car Service Orders and they last for the -- well, let me just explain --"
1974.73-1210,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1585.248,1588.117,Do you mean half months in duration by its terms?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1588.117,1589.969,"Well, it originated --"
1974.73-1210,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1589.969,1590.494,Unless --
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1590.494,1594.576,In six weeks I believe the first time around and it was renewed.
1974.73-1210,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1614.436,1619.777,"Well, if you prevail here it doesn't go automatically back into effect at this late date?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1619.777,1642.431,"Yes, it goes into effect but it compel -- the Commission will be compelled to consider the underlying economics to see if indeed the emergency still persists and if it does not persist car Service Order 1134 will have done its -- well have been terminated and will no longer apply."

1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1654.431,1665.31,The Commission has -- time -- from time to time extended the car Service Order but it had no application.
1974.73-1210,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1693.863,1712.221,"Well, is there somewhere in the record, Mr. White, something other than the notations at page 17 of the appendix which indicates that the original expiration date was May 15 or July 31, 1973 some indication that the Commission has renewed it?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1712.221,1712.937,Yes indeed.
1974.73-1210,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1739.752,1747.63,"Well, did the Commission extend the order, and their subsequent order as extending the order?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1747.63,1749.493,Yes it did Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1974.73-1210,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1749.493,1751.032,Where has that appeared?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1751.032,1765.301,"It appears in the federal register -- I can't cite you the pages but when an order is extended, it is -- a notice has given to the public by federal register publication."
1974.73-1210,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1765.843,1767.779,But it isn't in the record here?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1767.779,1768.023,Sir?
1974.73-1210,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1768.023,1769.682,It isn't in the appendix here?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1769.682,1772.631,"No, it isn't but I certainly can supply the Court with --"
1974.73-1210,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1772.631,1776.484,You supply the clerk with copies and of course your friend --
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1776.484,1778.174,"Indeed, I will, Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-1210,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1778.174,1781.729,What is the essential to extend the car Service Order?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1781.729,1784.999,"The Commission's judgment, Mr. Justice White, that the emergency --"
1974.73-1210,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1784.999,1786.198,The emergency still exists?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1786.198,1797.387,Still exists and that that judgment is subject to both administrative review by way of petition for reconsideration and judicial review on whether or not there was indeed --
1974.73-1210,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1797.387,1804.234,Though it's been extended every two or three months since --
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1804.234,1806.737,"While this matter is pending before this Court, yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1210,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1806.737,1809.137,There are whole series of extension?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1809.137,1812.816,"Yes Your Honor, the order is alive but suspended."
1974.73-1210,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1814.338,1822.502,Was there any reason why the Commission couldn't have a sought a stay from this Court after the three-judge District Court set its order aside?
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1822.502,1826.016,"No Your Honor, there's no reason why it could not have."
1974.73-1210,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1826.016,1827.623,"Mr. White, --"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1827.623,1827.862,Yes Mr. Justice.
1974.73-1210,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1827.862,1864.282,"-- the evidence from what you have said that the car shortage problem is chronic although you suggest that this particular order was triggered by the soviet wheat deal, let's assume it is severely chronic and that this practice of affording what in effect you've characterize as storage facilities has to be eliminated or modified on a long term basis not just an order of 60 or 90 days, under what section to the Act would the Commission proceeded and what would the procedure be?"
1974.73-1210,0,20340,charles_h_white_jr,,1864.282,1879.106,I suspect the Commission would undertake a rule making procedure probably under Section 15(7) that basically allows the Commission to examine the rate structure.
1974.73-1210,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1929.332,1932.473,"Thank you, Mr. White."
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,1932.473,1933.85,Mr. Coblens.
1974.73-1210,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1982.245,1985.126,"Well, would that make any difference if in fact --"
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,1985.126,1985.425,"No, --"
1974.73-1210,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1985.425,1987.895,-- is there an overlook?
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,1987.895,2003.535,"It doesn't make any difference, Your Honor, except the fact that I didn't want there to be any misunderstanding that there was a judicial precedent upholding in order of this kind and I don't think that there has been a judicial precedent."
1974.73-1210,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2103.601,2106.263,But dependent on the finding of emergency?

1974.73-1210,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2110.762,2112.484,"Apparently, it stayed, isn't it?"
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2112.484,2115.98,"I beg your pardon, it has not stayed sir."
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2115.98,2120.284,"Well, what did the Court -- what did the District Court do?"
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2120.284,2123.268,"Oh, I beg your pardon."
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2126.641,2128.805,The order --
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2128.805,2137.107,It declared it null and void not by reason of emergency but by reason of the fact that it was an illegal rate order.
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2137.107,2138.394,"So, it's not in the effect?"
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2138.394,2152.22,It's not in the effect in so far as becoming effective as far as the rates are concerned but the District Court made no finding with respect to emergency because certain precedents which I will --
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.22,2156.981,But do you agree that the Commission had going for the procedure of extending the order?
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2156.981,2158.074,Yes sir.
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2160.848,2164.284,And each time asserting an emergency?
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2164.284,2170.243,Each time as far as I recall asserting an emergency.
1974.73-1210,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2286.574,2295.448,Could you give a hypothesis as to how long that due process might take the kind of due process you're talking about.
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2295.448,2299.271,"Well, of course the Court well knows the --"
1974.73-1210,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2299.271,2301.698,But not that we measure due process by time when we're --
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2301.698,2302.277,By time I would say --
1974.73-1210,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2302.277,2306.966,"-- confronted with an emergency that does enter into, doesn't it?"
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2306.966,2323.689,"But Your Honor, we've had an emergency for 75 years and this business of reconsignment has been in existence for 50 years and as my brother states, they can expect further emergencies from time to time."
1974.73-1210,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2382.5,2396.518,"Mr. Coblens, in that connection, suppose the Commission issued an order just stating that no car could be held more than five days of the reconsignment point valid without a hearing?"
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2396.518,2404.88,"Yes sir, they filed without a hearing under 1(15) if they found an emergency."
1974.73-1210,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2404.88,2406.327,So that they could go that far?
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2406.327,2408.129,That is correct sir --
1974.73-1210,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2408.129,2409.957,And you'd have no objection?
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2409.957,2413.217,I would have an objection.
1974.73-1210,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2571.646,2602.28,"If I understand your friend's argument on this matter of a chronic condition related to an emergency, it's perhaps vaguely analogous to a person who has diabetes which is chronic but goes into diabetic shock perhaps from time to time and perhaps he analogize this immediate situation to a diabetic shock which cause for something ordinary -- something other than ordinary treatment?"
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2602.28,2621.022,Except the fact and I forget now how many diabetic shocks to lumber industries has had in this regard where orders of various kinds have been issued against the lumber industry by reason of one “emergency” after another.
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2655.549,2657.777,This isn't the basis the District Court went on.
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2657.777,2659.003,This is not the basis of the District Court --
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2659.003,2665.315,"The District Court said that you know it's an emergency and it seems to accept that fact that it was, it isn't a car Service Order."
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2665.315,2671.992,The issue of emergency was not raised before the District Court and for a perfectly good reason.
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2673.143,2676.207,"So, the question is whether it's a car Service Order or not?"
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2676.207,2682.874,"Well, that's what the way the District Court, I believe, however, when it comes up to this Court, this Court can --"
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2682.874,2685.378,"Well, did you assert in the District Court?"
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2686.715,2687.831,I attack the order --
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2687.831,2689.721,Did you say it wasn't an emergency?
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2689.721,2696.251,I did not bring that point before the Court because the Court had already ruled against me on that question and I will confess it.
1974.73-1210,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2696.251,2701.535,What you're really arguing now is that even if the District Court was wrong in calling it a rate order --
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2701.535,2701.96,That's right.
1974.73-1210,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2701.96,2707.845,"But it is the car Service Order, you say nevertheless you're entitled to an affirmance because there's no emergency?"
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2707.845,2710.449,That's correct sir.
1974.73-1210,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2712.821,2715.987,"What do we have before us, on which we can judge whether there was a original --"
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2715.987,2722.27,The history and the cases that Justice Rehnquist wrote and I have cited in my brief.
1974.73-1210,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2723.239,2726.669,Are we going to fact -- are we going to be fact finders on that?
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2726.669,2728.788,I don't think it's a fact finding.
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2736.216,2740.506,"Well, let me ask you, are you supporting the District Court's conclusion?"
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2740.506,2743.013,I am supporting the District Court's conclusion and --
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2743.013,2744.675,Except for the reasons that it used?
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2744.675,2745.263,"That's right, sir."
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2745.263,2746.552,That it is not a car Service?
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2746.552,2748.934,That's correct sir.
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2755.233,2759.688,Tell me again why this isn't a car Service Order but a rate order.
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2759.688,2785.926,"Because of the fact that it affects the rates, the traditional and historic way in which car Service Order have been enforced and except for the two orders that frankly I didn't know about and the ICC didn't know about, the traditional way is by use of demurrage charges and as has been stated --"
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2785.926,2788.328,But it increases the cost to the shipper?
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2788.328,2795.321,"It increases the cost to the shipper, everything increases the cost to the shipper or to ultimate buyer in an economic sense."
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2795.321,2796.771,"And unfortunately, yes."
1974.73-1210,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2796.771,2798.49,"Well, it increases the cost."
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2821.605,2853.844,"But the difficulty with that is that this is what the Intestate Commerce Commission has stated as I point out in my record and in the affidavit before the court below, there are many economic arguments for reconversion and for the practices of the lumber industry and the lumber industry or the wholesale lumber industry has never have an opportunity to submit those arguments because never has the Interstate Commerce Commission taken this question off in a full due process hearing."
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2853.844,2864.198,"If you -- but if this were just a demurrage in short putting a uniform charge daily charges or something like that for holding a car too long, you wouldn't -- you probably wouldn't be here?"
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2864.198,2865.326,I would not be here because --
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.326,2869.97,But this puts a very different charge on different shippers --
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2869.97,2870.552,That is correct.
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2870.552,2873.734,-- depending on what the rate structure?
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2878.953,2884.302,That -- what it does is it splits up the rate from a through and joint rate.
1974.73-1210,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2898.801,2901.442,"Well, it doesn't triple it if the car moves?"
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2901.442,2902.216,I beg your pardon.
1974.73-1210,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2902.216,2904.535,It doesn't triple it if the car moves.
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2904.535,2907.85,That is true.
1974.73-1210,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2907.85,2918.972,And this Court has upheld the demurrage charges against challenge and I guess what I want and I think that Mr. Justice White wants is what's the difference?
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,2918.972,2936.855,"The difference is in the structure of the Interstate Commerce Act, the Interstate Commerce Act only gives authority to the Interstate Commerce Commission for emergency action in the case of rules under 1(15)."
1974.73-1210,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3040.452,3058.103,"Can't you say the exactly the same thing about demurrage charges exactly the same thing and further I thought a little while ago you had conceded that if the Commission put out a plain bar order and said no car maybe held more than five days, this should be all right without due process."
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3058.103,3061.425,"No, if I said so I misspoke myself Your Honor."
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3061.425,3065.458,"Yes, but it wouldn't -- you wouldn't say it was a great order, would you?"
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3065.458,3067.469,"No sir, I would say that it --"
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3067.469,3072.948,"Well, it would be to the effect it would have the same effect, wouldn't it?"
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3072.948,3081.82,"It might have yes, it would have the same effect in the sense that it would put criminal penalties presumably, Your Honor, that there have to be some penalties of some kind."
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3081.82,3097.598,"Yes, but it wouldn't be a rate or the Commission unless the Commission said the line “all rates would apply” -- the individual rates would apply as the individual rate wouldn't apply did at least with the car order."
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3101.15,3102.749,That is correct sir.
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3118.851,3122.372,"In other case, do so when they say no more than five days they put the demurrage charge."
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3122.372,3124.596,They put a demurrage charges on it.
1974.73-1210,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3128.028,3137.974,"I think it is conceivable that demurrage charge could be the equivalent of the increase rate, couldn't it in dollars?"
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3137.974,3138.256,Except --
1974.73-1210,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3138.256,3139.416,And of course --
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3139.416,3141.621,Except the fact that --
1974.73-1210,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3141.621,3146.421,No couldn't be -- I mean suppose there were $100.00 a day demurrage charge?
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3146.421,3159.58,"No, it might not be or if it's $10,000.00 a day I assume so but you get to a point at which a demurrage charge becomes more than something different than a demurrage charge."
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3159.58,3165.922,"Well, here, if they hold it one day too long it cost let's say the example of $1,500.00."
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3165.922,3167.312,That's correct sir.
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3168.26,3171.521,"For $7,500.00 a day."
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3171.521,3194.503,"So that you come down to a question I suppose a question of degree in the sense that when in a demurrage charge usually starts at $10.00 a day and make it over $20.00 or $25.00, $50.00 or what have you that has been the traditional way and which it's done."
1974.73-1210,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3201.683,3202.731,Which a day?
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3202.731,3208.386,A day which I suppose is something the Commission --
1974.73-1210,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3208.386,3220.612,"Well, the demurrage charge will have to be uniform the way this rate thing works some -- I gather some shippers pay according to these examples thousands dollars more of the 300 more other 600."
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3220.612,3224.908,That is correct depending upon where it finally winds up.
1974.73-1210,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3341.583,3345.707,And it's because of those cases that you didn't make your lack of emergency argument --
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3345.707,3347.039,That is correct sir.
1974.73-1210,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3425.966,3427.118,Mr. Coblens?
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3427.118,3428.029,Yes sir.
1974.73-1210,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3428.029,3436.588,"You referred the due process as you have quite frequently, you are not speaking in a constitutional sense, are you?"
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3440.921,3465.474,"No, I'm arguing that the whole scheme of the Interstate Commerce Act except for Section 1(15) provides a hearing provides all the administrative procedures which allow you to bring before the Commission itself, the economic arguments on behalf of the industry."
1974.73-1210,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3513.67,3516.708,"Yes, in this case you're making a statutory argument?"
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3516.708,3532.117,"I'm making a statutory argument but I think that if in all other cases, if the other provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act did not provide due process, I think certainly counsel -- other counsel -- thank you sir."
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3587.363,3604.535,While the Commission in here apparently suggests to you that if the District Court is reversed on the car service as against rate order issue then the Commission is going to -- you're going to have some chance to litigate before the Commission again with respect to --
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3604.535,3606.067,"We never did have a chance to litigate, Your Honor."
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3606.067,3612.114,"Well, I know but they still have to decide each time whether there's an emergency."
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3612.114,3614.528,This is true but we never get a chance to litigate.
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3614.528,3616.53,Why you can't even litigate and you can --
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3616.53,3620.556,"No, I cannot because under the Dougherty case and under the --"
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3620.556,3625.179,"I know you can raise it, you may lose, you'll see if you lose."
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3625.179,3633.071,"Well, I can raise it, Your Honor, but I can raise it only under such conditions as gives me no chance at all."
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3641.324,3652.204,"If someone renews an order every three or four months for three or four years that on the basis of an emergency, it doesn't sound much like the case you're talking about."
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3652.204,3655.356,"But they don't renew it on the basis of every four years, this is a --"
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3655.356,3656.741,You mean every two or three months.
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3656.741,3657.956,Every two or three months.
1974.73-1210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3657.956,3659.009,"Well, that's what I said."
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3659.009,3660.058,But I do not have any judicial --
1974.73-1210,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3660.058,3661.698,Didn't you waive it?
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3661.698,3662.059,I beg your pardon sir.
1974.73-1210,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3662.059,3665.442,Didn't you waive the argument on emergency?
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3665.442,3667.385,Did I waive it sir?
1974.73-1210,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3667.385,3675.84,"You knew about it and you decided not to raise it, what's the difference of being a non-waiver?"
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3675.84,3678.719,A waiver is when a person --
1974.73-1210,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3678.719,3680.491,"As you said, it's intelligently done."
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3680.491,3681.531,I beg your pardon sir?
1974.73-1210,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3681.531,3685.405,Waiver is what is intelligently done and saying that this was.
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3685.405,3689.479,"Well, also it's when you have a choice."
1974.73-1210,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3703.206,3708.229,You have to use A and B.
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3708.229,3709.677,Not practically sir.
1974.73-1210,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3709.677,3714.365,Are you suggesting that judges never changed their minds about some things?
1974.73-1210,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3714.365,3718.822,"Well, when you have the same judge, it's very difficult to get them to change his mind."
1974.73-1210,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3718.822,3725.063,"We've all tried it and sometimes exceeded, haven't we in practice?"
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3725.063,3725.8,Yes sir.
1974.73-1210,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3725.8,3728.943,"We, even here we change our minds sometimes."
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3728.943,3735.094,"Well, this Court is unique, I must say that."
1974.73-1210,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3745.316,3746.652,And you may finish your sentence.
1974.73-1210,1,41165,seymour_l_coblens,,3746.652,3748.195,Thank you sir.
1974.73-1210,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3775.257,3775.866,Thank you gentlemen.
