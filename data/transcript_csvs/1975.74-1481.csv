1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,51.89,57.025,Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.
1975.74-1481,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,149.407,151.285,"That was a Texas Supreme Court Case, was it not?"
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,151.285,152.286,"Yes sir, Texas."
1975.74-1481,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,180.294,187.183,"Is it possible to say that your opponent does not rely on Adams, he does not cite it in his brief?"
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,187.183,191.099,"You Honor, I felt that the Court would --"

1975.74-1481,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,193.966,227.761,"Mr. Westbrook, I take it that this same plaintiff could have sued a domestic corporation in McLennan County just as you were sued in McLennan County, since this plaintiff resided in McLennan County, so that the only distinction you claim as being made between the in state and out of state corporations is the necessity with respect to a domestic corporation of having to prove a prima facie case for the cause of action?"
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,227.761,231.408,"Actually, we have not approved a case by preponderance of the evidence, Your Honor."
1975.74-1481,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,234.067,236.93,(Inaudible) is the final judgment?
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,236.93,237.628,I beg your pardon?
1975.74-1481,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,237.628,241.113,Do you think this is a final judgment under R. 28 U.S.C.?
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,241.113,242.883,Yes sir.
1975.74-1481,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,259.224,280.552,"What about our Langdeau case where the Court held that where a Congress conferred a right of -- limited the right to sue a Federal Bank, it would strike me that your claim here -- you are not claiming a right that Texas Law gives you to be sued in a particular county."
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,285.515,286.59,"Yes sir, that is correct."
1975.74-1481,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,286.59,291.419,"Do you think that is the same as Langdeau, for finality purposes?"
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,291.419,328.045,"I do not -- I do not have the familiarity with Langdeau on that point, Your Honor, but in our jurisdictional statement, the appendix B3, we cite a number of cases which, there are Texas cases of course, that do hold that they are final judgments and they are appealable in Texas and this Court did note proper jurisdiction before in an another Texas case, Exxon versus Preston and it had been briefed by the appellant."
1975.74-1481,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,328.045,337.051,"All the Texas Court here did was to say that the suit could proceed against your company, did they not?"
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,339.058,340.828,"That is right, yes sir."
1975.74-1481,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,340.828,349.349,Maybe you are suggesting we should have postponed jurisdiction rather than noted it?
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,349.349,354.596,"Well, sir I can only say that in Preston versus Exxon, jurisdiction was noted."
1975.74-1481,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,361.5,368.123,Let me follow with you with another question that Mr. Justice Rehnquist intimated?
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,375.768,376.869,Yes sir.
1975.74-1481,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,459.239,464.017,Do you feel that that words unequal protection as between domestic and foreign corporations?
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,464.017,487.402,"In this respect that when the domestic corporation make its challenge to the venue, the plaintiff in order to keep that case in that county, McLennan County, has to prove in addition to other factors such as his is resident there or he is an agent of that domestic corporation, resident in McLennan County."
1975.74-1481,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,506.969,511.671,"And you are saying he does not have to bear that with respect to a foreign corporation, and therefore, no equal protection?"
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,511.671,514.441,"That is right, Your Honor."
1975.74-1481,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,547.774,555.283,"I hear what you say, but does it mean that you have a full-dress trial before a jury on the merits on the venue issue alone?"
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,555.283,556.938,"If you ask for a jury, yes."
1975.74-1481,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,564.971,576.058,"(Inaudible) does not exercise that discretion, then the plaintiff has a burden of showing about a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitle to recover on the merits?"
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,576.058,579.424,"Yes sir, every element of the cause of action, except damages."
1975.74-1481,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,580.566,582.434,So you might have a weekâ€™s trial?
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,582.434,583.491,Yes sir.
1975.74-1481,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,583.491,586.865,"But if you are a foreign corporation, you do not have that opt-in."
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,586.865,587.893,No sir.
1975.74-1481,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,592.819,598.837,Does the defendant put in evidence at the jury trial to controvert the evidence introduced by the plaintiff?
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,598.837,599.87,Yes sir.
1975.74-1481,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,599.87,601.584,So you have a full-dress trial?
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,601.584,604.011,"It could be yes, yes sir."
1975.74-1481,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,604.585,605.93,What is the normal practice?
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,609.09,612.599,"No sir, I would say the normal practices of the jury are not demanding."
1975.74-1481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,622.485,625.204,"What is it, sort of a prima facie case, and just (Inaudible) of plaintiff?"
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,625.204,627.023,"No sir, it has to go beyond that."
1975.74-1481,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,641.636,674.187,"Mr. Westbrook, I see from the brief that you have filed, the appendix to your brief that there are 31 Sections to the Texas Venue Code and there are obviously distinctions between foreign corporations and domestic corporations which you are asking us to focus on, but under Section 28, if your company had been of a Fire, Marine or Inland Insurance Company, it would have been subject to different regulations than being an automobile casualty company."
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,688.126,713.099,"Sir, we say that the Federal Constitution has offended the Equal Protection Clause, by reason of the difference between Subdivision 23 which covers domestic corporations and Subdivision 27 which covers foreign corporations other than those specified elsewhere and this case came up under Subdivision 27."
1975.74-1481,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,716.455,742.594,"It is perfectly true, but it seems to me that any litigant in Texas, unless he happens to be a private individual sued in a particular kind of case is going to be able to make some claim that he is treated differently than either of the kind of railroad personal injury case in Section 25 or the Fire and Marine case in 28."
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,744.628,751.187,"Yes sir, as a matter of fact Subdivision 23 was before this Court 44 years ago."
1975.74-1481,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,815.105,825.91,"Now but your case is not power, is it, because Texas requires even though a foreign corporation that it be sued only in the county where it has an agent?"
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,825.91,831.893,Or it says agent or its principal place of business or in a county where the cause of action arose.
1975.74-1481,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,843.022,845.541,And he could have sued a domestic corporation?
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,845.541,848.824,"Yes, he could have sued a domestic corporation."
1975.74-1481,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,922.681,945.398,"Are you saying -- of course you are saying that it is irrational to say that a domestic corporation should be sued either (a) where the event took place or (b) at its home base when a foreign corporation is likely to have a more progressive presence in the state, is it not?"
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,945.398,947.925,"Yes sir, substantially so."
1975.74-1481,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,949.038,951.194,(Voice Overlap) basis for a different treatment?
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,951.194,951.646,I beg your pardon?
1975.74-1481,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,951.646,956.466,Is that a rational basis for a different treatment of the two?
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,956.466,966.474,"Your Honor, I do not believe that the sole effect and this is what was held I think in Saunders."
1975.74-1481,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1027.813,1029.351,"Mr. Westbrook, would you help me just a minute."
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,1037.991,1038.328,No sir.
1975.74-1481,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1051.426,1056.234,Your objection is the way in which the Texas Courts have construed Section 23.
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,1067.627,1069.293,"Your Honor, I do not believe so."
1975.74-1481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1069.293,1072.891,It seems to me there is a greater burden on the plaintiff where he has to do than it is on anyone else?
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,1072.891,1073.668,Yes sir.
1975.74-1481,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1073.668,1080.128,(Inaudible) the one that is really most excited about it.
1975.74-1481,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1080.128,1094.549,"Before you carry on, what is the justification for what in effect is a mini trial on a plea of privilege where the only issue is venue -- what is the rationale?"
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,1099.239,1105.778,"I think partly and of course this was before summary judgment, but I think that there are distinctions still."
1975.74-1481,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1127.509,1129.278,(Inaudible) summary judgment practice in Texas?
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,1129.278,1131.558,"We do have summary judgment practice, sir."
1975.74-1481,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1131.558,1134.582,And this curious procedure?
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,1134.582,1148.796,"No sir, and I think the reason why not and why we still have so much of this is it that you get some things in plea of privilege that you do not get -- I am talking from the defense point of view that you do not get a summary judgment."
1975.74-1481,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1164.506,1165.356,Yes.
1975.74-1481,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1165.356,1166.229,Mr. Westbrook.
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,1166.229,1168.169,Yes sir?
1975.74-1481,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1168.169,1179.765,"Your mini trial or whatever you want to call it, occurs in your plea of privilege cases only where the statute speaks of the cause of action having arisen in a particular place, does it not?"
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,1179.765,1181.109,Yes.
1975.74-1481,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1181.109,1192.411,"In other words, when the venue provision does not depend on where the cause of action arose then there is no mini trial?"
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,1192.411,1193.058,That is right.
1975.74-1481,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1202.972,1218.585,"Really, did not the Texas Supreme Court just come along and read this language where the cause of action arose and say that you are in affect, if you are depending on that kind of language in a venue statute, you had to show that a cause of action did arise?"
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,1218.585,1225.807,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I do not know if that was a language, but I can say that is a fair effect of it, yes sir."
1975.74-1481,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1225.807,1227.787,"Mr. Westbrook, what are you asking the Court to do?"
1975.74-1481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1235.426,1253.575,"No sir, we are asking this Court to declare that Subdivision 27 as it is applied in Texas, is unconstitutional because it deprives foreign corporations of the equal protection of the law."
1975.74-1481,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1253.575,1255.118,Then what happens to this lawsuit?
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,1255.118,1256.732,Then he would --
1975.74-1481,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1256.732,1270.36,"(Inaudible) at all if you write 27 off the books, (Inaudible) of the book?"
1975.74-1481,0,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,1270.36,1275.158,"I had, I suppose more difficult problems in that, but we would be happy with it."
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,1510.302,1533.753,"If it please the Court, I would like to in view of the fact apparently that Justices are not too familiar with the localized plea of privilege of venue practice in Texas, to give you actually a clearer view point of what it actually is about there."
1975.74-1481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1554.321,1556.305,"In their what, over 200 counties in Texas?"
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,1556.305,1557.805,Yes sir.
1975.74-1481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1557.805,1562.513,"And, so there -- it is the least possible their practice might vary from --"
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,1562.513,1578.701,"Well, if the lawyer or defendant demanded a jury trial then the Court would put in the trial on the merits at the same time and for that reason they never demand a jury trial because then you just try the whole case and he would not get his plea of privilege trial."
1975.74-1481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1578.701,1580.205,(Inaudible) demand a jury trial?
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,1580.205,1583.765,Either party could demand it but --
1975.74-1481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1583.765,1587.556,And the plea of privilege --
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,1587.556,1589.259,I do not believe either party can.
1975.74-1481,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1670.295,1673.536,"(Inaudible) judge a viability, what does he do?"
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,1675.854,1677.898,If venue is established.
1975.74-1481,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1678.451,1679.561,He makes no finding.
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,1679.561,1679.843,No.
1975.74-1481,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1679.9,1681.636,You make out a case of viability?
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,1681.636,1683.836,He just overrules a plea of privilege.
1975.74-1481,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1794.236,1801.167,"(Inaudible) no difference between the foreign corporations, domestic corporation on the plea of privilege?"
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,1801.167,1809.334,I say as to this -- this one ground of exception to venue in the county of oneâ€™s residence.
1975.74-1481,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1825.605,1829.751,Is there anything about cause of action in 27?
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,1829.751,1831.567,"That is what I just gave Your Honor, yes sir."
1975.74-1481,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1831.567,1831.828,Where (Voice Overlap) 27?

1975.74-1481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1852.848,1863.45,And I suppose that a plaintiff who lives in that county can sue in his own county either a domestic or foreign corporation?
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,1863.45,1864.516,In a --
1975.74-1481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1864.516,1868.419,Is that right or not?
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,1868.419,1869.423,That is not correct.
1975.74-1481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1869.423,1874.073,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,1874.073,1875.052,No sir.

1975.74-1481,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1897.43,1898.557,What 23 says?
1975.74-1481,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1898.557,1901.996,(Inaudible) but it looks to me like 23 is (Voice Overlap)
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,1901.996,1904.491,I am speaking of this clause.
1975.74-1481,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2051.674,2055.516,(Inaudible) the entire State of Texas (Voice Overlap) and all the 200 counties in the entire state?
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2055.516,2066.012,(Voice Overlap) Alright and we want to treat as equally as we can possibly do consistent with the differences at reasonably equal consistent with the differences.
1975.74-1481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2075.592,2079.572,"It is is one of the alternatives in which you can sue a foreign corporations, is it not?"
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2079.572,2081.748,That is one of the alternatives but --
1975.74-1481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2081.748,2088.741,Your own statute indicates that foreign corporations may be sued where their principal office is in Texas?
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2088.741,2090.918,We recognize that as a possibility.
1975.74-1481,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2145.432,2152.761,(Inaudible) office in Delaware.
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2152.761,2158.334,"That insurance company of course, it is a foreign insurance company, I am sure its main office is probably not in Dallas."
1975.74-1481,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2159.144,2162.233,The main Texans office is in Dallas?
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2162.233,2167.381,"Well, the -- the record does not show that Your Honor and I -- I do not know whether that even has it."
1975.74-1481,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2174.427,2179.145,The statutes says that only County was the principal of such company maybe situated?
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2179.145,2179.609,Alright.
1975.74-1481,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2210.411,2213.658,But Texas can make them say which one is?
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2213.658,2215.104,If --
1975.74-1481,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2215.104,2215.918,State of Texas?
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2215.918,2225.903,They would have to hold it as according actual primary office instead of their designation for this reason.
1975.74-1481,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2225.903,2230.135,But did Texas say that you have to designate one office as your principal office?
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2230.135,2231.496,Alright sir and here is what would happen.
1975.74-1481,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2231.496,2232.524,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2232.524,2233.449,Absolutely.
1975.74-1481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2290.744,2292.437,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2292.437,2293.307,"Your Honor, what?"
1975.74-1481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2293.307,2297.807,A domestic corporation could engage in the same tactics --
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2297.807,2301.204,But Texas holds it to their principal office in fact.
1975.74-1481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2301.204,2312.645,"Well, they could hold then foreign corporation to that -- to whatever the facts show as to where their principal office is?"
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2312.645,2315.797,Principal office in Blackâ€™s Dictionary is generally -
1975.74-1481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2315.797,2321.255,"What does a foreign corporation do when it qualifies in Texas, what kind of a piece of paper does it fill up?"
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2321.255,2324.916,They designate an agent for service and pay a franchise tax.
1975.74-1481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2324.916,2328.754,And the agent for service is usually the corporation --
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2328.754,2335.378,"That is probably the -- generally most of them have a CT corporations in some building in Dallas, Texas."
1975.74-1481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2335.759,2339.334,They do not say where their principal office is going to be in the State?
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2339.334,2342.814,I do not -- that they do not have to.
1975.74-1481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2342.814,2344.203,Or required to --
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2344.203,2353.081,"But, there would be a black pay if that determined where their principal office was."
1975.74-1481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2353.081,2358.823,It might not determine the -- finally where it was anymore than it would be with the domestic corporation?
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2358.823,2367.092,"Well, but -- it is easy to determine a domestic corporation because that is the home office of the company."
1975.74-1481,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2370.696,2379.708,"(Inaudible) goes down in two, three huge buildings to show it must be the home office, 130 stories high."
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2379.708,2380.503,That is right.
1975.74-1481,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2381.835,2384.467,(Inaudible) offices.
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2384.467,2385.462,If that was --
1975.74-1481,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2385.462,2387.386,But it would be hard to move them?
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2387.386,2389.751,It probably would be in that instance.
1975.74-1481,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2395.519,2420.796,"Well, is what you are saying that a domestic corporationâ€™s home office has certain functions associated like -- where the like the presence of a Chief Executive Officer, the meetings of the Directors and that sort of a thing that make it much more readily identifiable factually than what might be one of several relatively equally important branch office of a foreign corporation that has its principal place of business in another State?"
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2420.796,2421.929,That is exactly correct.
1975.74-1481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2490.874,2498.582,"The case in this Court that bears on this most relevantly I suppose is the Power Company against Saunders case, is it not?"
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2498.582,2507.667,"That was a case, that was a case where -- they just provided a personal injury action."
1975.74-1481,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2566.571,2571.985,"(Inaudible) point of the finality of the judgment here, I take it you are not?"
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2571.985,2594.439,"Well, in Texas a plea of privileges is an interlocutory ruling and the Supreme Court of the United -- of the State of Texas does not have jurisdiction of an order on a plea of privilege except in certain instances where there is a conflict of decisions or where there is a dissenting opinion on certified question because it is not, it is an interlocutory order."
1975.74-1481,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2594.439,2600.046,Are you taking that there is no jurisdiction in this Court for this review at this point.
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2603.081,2609.417,I have not claimed that in the brief that it is a question -- there are some serious question about it.
1975.74-1481,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2609.417,2610.228,I wonder why you did not do it?
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2610.228,2632.225,But I did not -- this is a matter -- I feel that as short as our brief is that that gets to the heart of this thing and the Texas Court has -- we would like a final decision on to by this Court.
1975.74-1481,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2632.225,2640.452,"As your brief is, it seems to me it does not touch upon it and this raises -- this brings me to my other question."
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2645.242,2651.066,"Well, he cited Adamâ€™s case enough and it attacked its rationality which we think is, is accurate."
1975.74-1481,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2708.327,2711.509,(Inaudible) interlocutory order?
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2711.509,2717.85,That is what the Supreme Court of Texas has always held that these are interlocutory orders or statutory jurisdiction.
1975.74-1481,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2717.85,2723.478,"Give us jurisdiction, you cannot waive jurisdiction?"
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2723.478,2724.967,"No, I know we cannot."
1975.74-1481,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2724.967,2726.991,Case which say we have jurisdiction?
1975.74-1481,1,44517,w_v_dunnam_jr,,2726.991,2736.979,"None whatsoever except the fact that the reason I did not raise it, back this Court did note probable jurisdiction back in this case one time when it presented there is conflict."
1975.74-1481,2,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,3318.362,3321.432,Very limited Mr. Chief Justice.
1975.74-1481,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3427.219,3436.273,As to whether or not that our Court has jurisdiction which depends upon whether or not this is the final judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals of Texas?
1975.74-1481,2,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,3436.273,3437.215,"Yes, that is right."
1975.74-1481,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3437.215,3443.603,I would be interested in it.
1975.74-1481,2,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,3443.603,3448.391,"Before closing finally your Honor,we believe that the Exxon case --"
1975.74-1481,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3448.391,3451.723,"How did the Exxon case, was it in the same procedural posture as this one?"
1975.74-1481,2,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,3451.723,3452.577,"Substantially, yes sir."
1975.74-1481,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3458.36,3461.121,That actually it was in the same procedural posture?
1975.74-1481,2,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,3461.121,3461.728,Yes sir.
1975.74-1481,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3461.728,3468.141,"Because the Arkansas case, Power Company case did not -- that was a final judgment for the plaintiff after a trial."
1975.74-1481,2,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,3468.141,3474.283,"Yes sir, that is right, but Exxon, Exxon likewise was the question where the plea of privilege was overruled."
1975.74-1481,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3474.283,3476.158,"Exxon was never argued here though, was it not?"
1975.74-1481,2,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,3476.158,3477.14,No sir.
1975.74-1481,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3480.276,3482.032,Proper jurisdiction was noted.
1975.74-1481,2,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,3482.032,3483.206,Probable jurisdiction was noted.
1975.74-1481,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3513.17,3516.807,"We transferred it then, we did not dismiss it?"
1975.74-1481,2,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,3516.807,3518.575,"No sir, did not dismiss it."
1975.74-1481,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3621.019,3627.883,(Inaudible) possibility of filing a written document directed to the issue of our jurisdiction.
1975.74-1481,2,33694,joel_w_westbrook,,3633.264,3636.883,"I do not I believe I gave a helpful oral argument on it, Your Honor."
