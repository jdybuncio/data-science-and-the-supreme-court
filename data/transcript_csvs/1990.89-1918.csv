1990.89-1918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.467,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-1918, Robert L. McCormick v. United States."
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,44.409,47.652,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,139.021,141.702,Where exactly was his district?
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,141.702,148.828,"The district is the... it's the southern district of West Virginia; Logan County is the county that he is elected from, Your Honor."
1990.89-1918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,148.828,149.629,Logan County.
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,149.629,166.109,"A couple of days before the June 1 payment, the contribution was made, there was a phone call... and this is the only evidence, the only evidence that links the petitioner with a solicitation."
1990.89-1918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,323.472,326.204,"Excuse me, Mr. di Trapano."
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,331.817,334.029,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,334.549,341.696,Their theory was that there had to be some coercion or threat of force.
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,349.699,350.58,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.89-1918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,357.874,358.605,"No, no, no."
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,361.016,361.747,"In those years, yes."
1990.89-1918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,361.747,366.159,"--in which, as you have just described, the Government never used this provision--"
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,366.159,366.76,"Never used it, right."
1990.89-1918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,366.76,371.124,"--for things of this sort, political corruption."
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,389.456,397.441,"That's... that appears to be the Government's reasoning, but it's not... it's not justified by the, by the language of the act."
1990.89-1918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,397.441,401.842,"Well, my understanding is that that was not the Government's reason."
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,417.464,418.175,That's correct.
1990.89-1918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,418.175,418.615,Okay.
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,418.615,422.685,"That was used... for the first time in the 1970's used, and disjunctive in the Kenny case."
1990.89-1918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,458.57,461.642,"It went unreported because the petitioner didn't report it, I take it?"
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,461.642,462.212,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,464.363,472.869,"Not only didn't report it for State law purposes as campaign contribution, but didn't report it as Federal income."
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,472.869,474.13,Yes.
1990.89-1918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,488.72,496.304,"Well, I suppose those facts are evidence about... that go to whether it was a campaign contribution or not."
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,506.371,526.153,"--Well, the jury apparently did consider that, but we, we strongly urged the court not to instruct the jury because under the color of official right and under the Hobbs Act the means... the definition of a political contribution, the purpose of it is to influence the nomination, the election, or defeat of a candidate."
1990.89-1918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,554.834,561.246,How do you explain the failure to report it as a campaign contribution and the failure to report it as income?
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,561.246,562.618,--How do I--
1990.89-1918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,562.618,564.198,Explain it.
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,564.198,570.102,"--Well, the campaign... money received to defray expenses is not income."
1990.89-1918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,591.616,598.552,"Mr. di Trapano, I think Justice O'Connor also asked how do you explain the failure to report it under West Virginia law?"
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,598.552,609.539,"--I don't... I don't have an explanation why he didn't report it, other than he simply didn't comply with the West Virginia reporting laws."
1990.89-1918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,766.541,768.662,Mr. di Trapano--
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,768.662,769.172,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,769.172,786.695,"--Do you think that it would be a violation of the Hobbs Act for a legislator to say if you will give me a so-called... a campaign contribution, then I promise I will try to help you get the legislation you want?"
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,786.695,792.387,"If the color of official right could be expanded to reach into campaign contributions, I'd say yes."
1990.89-1918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,792.387,793.249,Does it cover that?
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,793.249,796.421,"I don't think the intent covers that, but I do--"
1990.89-1918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,796.421,797.87,Does the language cover it?
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,797.87,798.772,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.89-1918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,798.772,800.054,Color of right.
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,800.054,802.435,Color of official right has a specific meaning.
1990.89-1918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,802.435,803.337,In exchange for a promise.
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,803.337,807.037,"Color of official right has a... no, Your Honor, I don't think it covers it."
1990.89-1918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,808.539,810.139,Some courts have so held.
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,810.139,817.285,--Some courts have held that there has to be a quid pro quo in order to convict--
1990.89-1918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,817.285,818.567,And a promise could be a quid pro quo.
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,818.567,819.346,"--A promise, yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,820.167,821.699,Which could be express or implied.
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,821.699,825.65,--I think there has to be an identifiable quid pro quo.
1990.89-1918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,830.264,831.043,But it could be a promise?
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,831.043,834.115,--There should be... there should be a promise made on behalf--
1990.89-1918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,834.115,835.497,"It could be a promise, is that right?"
1990.89-1918,0,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,835.497,836.689,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1606.142,1618.411,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1918,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1644.508,1655.504,"Before you do, the evidence... one can concede that the evidence supports that conclusion without conceding that the jury was required to arrive at that conclusion."
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1666.69,1669.753,I would be happy to review the instructions with you at this point.
1990.89-1918,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1669.753,1673.926,What I'm concerned about is specifically the sections of the instruction that we were talking about.
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1686.425,1696.31,"Well, first let me say that the portion of the instructions that Mr. di Trapano was referring to don't really have to do with campaign contributions."
1990.89-1918,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1719.147,1722.159,What page of the Joint Appendix will you be dealing with?
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1722.159,1724.96,--They start on page 27 and they run until the end.
1990.89-1918,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1792.985,1794.275,Where are you reading from now?
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1794.275,1796.227,--The second full paragraph.
1990.89-1918,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1796.227,1797.627,Of what page?
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1797.627,1798.679,33.
1990.89-1918,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1848.341,1852.672,"Excuse me, before you do that, what about the top paragraph on 34?"
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1858.456,1858.807,--No.
1990.89-1918,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1864.412,1865.454,"Well, wait--"
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1865.454,1868.306,--Let me say next that they did not object to this instruction either.
1990.89-1918,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1868.306,1872.677,--There was no objection to the instructions at all?
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1872.677,1876.922,Not to the paragraph on page 34 that you've just referred to.
1990.89-1918,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1876.922,1894.321,"Well, as I see the difference between 34, the first paragraph on 34 says what extortion does consist of, and the paragraph you just quoted says what a campaign contribution that is not extortion consists of."
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1925.982,1926.383,"No, Your Honor."
1990.89-1918,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1962.046,1972.323,"Well, Mr. Wright, how about the instruction that petitioner mentioned, the last full paragraph on page 30 of the Joint Appendix?"
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1972.323,1979.177,"Well, I think that it's very unusual for a petitioner to be commenting on this."
1990.89-1918,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2012.8,2014.209,Do you think that's a correct statement of the law?
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2014.209,2026.778,"--I think that in context it distinguishes what the district court meant it to distinguish, and what I think the jury understood it to be, that there is a difference between a consensual payment and a voluntary--"
1990.89-1918,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2026.778,2035.284,"But Mr. Wright, doesn't every person who makes a political contribution almost expect some kind of benefit in some form?"
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2035.284,2036.085,--Yes.
1990.89-1918,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2036.085,2044.701,"You expect to be benefitted by having their service, or because of the positions you expect them to take."
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2060.351,2066.966,"Well, Your Honor, I think whether it's a contribution or not can be determined from the facts."
1990.89-1918,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2090.65,2111.015,"But Mr. Wright, isn't it the case that the jury would be left, given these instructions, with the understanding that the difference between the... what is or is not a campaign contribution, and hence what is or is not a payoff, is a difference which depends on the distinction between giving with hope and giving with expectation?"
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2113.215,2114.545,I don't think so.
1990.89-1918,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2131.788,2137.171,"Yeah, but every... every candidate receives money on account either of the office that he holds or hopes to hold."
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2137.171,2141.763,--And it was told that it couldn't convict if it was a campaign contribution.
1990.89-1918,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2141.763,2154.443,"But... and maybe I'm just going around in circles here, but I don't see what the jury had to go on to determine what was or was not a contribution, except this distinction between hope and expectation."
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2154.443,2159.595,"Well, Your Honor, let me turn briefly to the tax fraud instructions."
1990.89-1918,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2170.841,2173.553,"Yes, but he was... he was also requesting more."
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2189.224,2193.609,"There was one objection to the quid pro quo instruction, yes."
1990.89-1918,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2249.805,2255.088,So is this a harmless error analysis?
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2255.088,2259.93,"--Your Honor, I don't... the way I read the instructions, I don't believe there was any error."
1990.89-1918,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2260.341,2263.834,"Well, suppose there had been no conviction, an acquittal on the tax charge?"
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2263.834,2266.144,"--I still, I believe--"
1990.89-1918,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2266.144,2268.076,Then you couldn't make the argument you just made.
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2268.076,2283.666,"--Well, I believe that the argument that the instructions on pages 33 to 34 of the Joint Appendix with respect to the campaign contribution defense to the Hobbs Act violation are perfectly adequate."
1990.89-1918,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2291.83,2301.357,"Well, Mr. Wright, if we thought a quid pro quo was an element of the offense, then I suppose the instructions were deficient?"
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2301.357,2308.063,"It depends on exactly what you mean, again, by quid pro quo."
1990.89-1918,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2314.268,2328.178,"Well, that there has to be some promise, express or implied, of benefit that the office holder makes in exchange for the payment."
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2328.178,2328.729,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1990.89-1918,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2330.429,2331.05,Yes.
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2331.05,2333.241,--I don't think that they are deficient.
1990.89-1918,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2340.554,2350.322,"Well, did the instructions not say that it is not necessary that the Government prove the defendant promised to commit a quid pro quo?"
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2350.322,2353.294,"--What the... no, they don't say that, phrased that way."
1990.89-1918,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2354.225,2358.426,"Well, would you look at the bottom of page 32 and 33 and tell me?"
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2358.426,2359.397,"--Yes, that's where I am, Your Honor."
1990.89-1918,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2415.124,2423.99,"Well, but it goes on and says in either event a quid pro quo... it says it... a quid pro quo is not an essential element of the crime."
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2430.975,2434.657,"Well, I don't think any court thinks it is in a payoff case."
1990.89-1918,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2445.324,2450.786,"When you say it isn't necessary in a payoff case, isn't that the paradigm example of a quid pro quo?"
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2453.959,2455.421,"Well, that's why, Your Honor, I think there--"
1990.89-1918,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2455.421,2455.959,I don't understand.
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2455.959,2458.092,--There are two different sorts of quid pro quo's that we're talking about here.
1990.89-1918,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2470.88,2472.422,Is that not a quid pro quo?
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2472.422,2472.873,"--Yes, it is."
1990.89-1918,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2473.601,2475.735,And you think the statute doesn't require that?
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2475.735,2479.605,"No, the statute does--"
1990.89-1918,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2479.605,2480.476,That there be a quid pro quo?
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2480.476,2481.057,--does require that.
1990.89-1918,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2481.057,2481.548,It does.
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2481.548,2482.079,And the jury was told--
1990.89-1918,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2482.079,2487.102,"But the jury was told that there is... that's not an essential element, that it's not necessary."
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2487.102,2504.683,"--I... I think that this... the jury has been told previously on the color of official right... instructions, rather... that the jury has to understand... or, I'm sorry, the jury has to be convinced that the money was given on account of the official's office."
1990.89-1918,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2523.086,2523.526,"Well, it doesn't say that."
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2527.377,2537.113,"--I... well, and it's not a deficiency in the Government's evidence that we didn't show that he said give me the money or I will switch position."
1990.89-1918,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2550.772,2560.429,"Well, Mr. Wright, you know, it isn't as if the Hobbs Act had a legislative exception for campaign contributions."
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2585.126,2586.125,Yes.
1990.89-1918,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2586.125,2598.804,"If you're... you know, if I'm Senator so-and-so and I go before some group that... raising funds, and they say well, gee, he has sure voted the way we wanted him to the last 6 years, let's give him some."
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2603.877,2604.708,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1918,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2608.662,2614.816,"But you talk as if the term, quote, ""campaign contribution"" is somewhere defined in a statute."
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2615.614,2618.057,Let me try to explain where we get it.
1990.89-1918,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2654.029,2670.041,"Your argument suggests that there is a very clearly established definition of the term campaign contribution which he who runs may read, and therefore we don't have to worry about the line between campaign contribution and something that violates the Hobbs Act."
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2671.931,2673.223,"Well, there is a line."
1990.89-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2691.296,2696.938,Unless there's an explicit promise to exchange legislative efforts for the money.
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2696.938,2697.857,--That's right.
1990.89-1918,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2704.812,2709.535,"Mr. Wright, as I... may I call your attention again to page 37 of the Appendix?"
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2744.31,2750.665,The jury must have rejected that it was used for generally recognized campaign expenses or to reimburse the candidate.
1990.89-1918,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2760.872,2777.863,"That's right, but they would have been non-taxable not because they were not political contributions originally when made, but because they were not nontaxable political contributions, because although they may have been contributed for his campaign, he converted them to his own use."
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2784.748,2789.671,"Well, I don't think that that's right with the instruction you have read, Your Honor."
1990.89-1918,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2819.472,2821.562,But the issue is what the jury understood by these instructions.
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2856.397,2856.916,I'm not sure I followed all that.
1990.89-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2882.043,2895.24,"Well, Mr. Wright, suppose we... suppose we think the jury might have found that these were campaign contributions, but that there was a quid pro quo, based on these facts?"
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2906.659,2910.902,"That these were campaign contributions, but that there was a quid pro quo?"
1990.89-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2910.902,2911.893,Based on these facts.
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2911.893,2917.186,I don't think that the jury could have found that in light of these instructions.
1990.89-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2919.967,2937.629,"I thought you a while ago said that if it's a campaign contribution there has to be an explicit statement of the exchange, and I thought you meant that on the facts of this case there wasn't such an explicit--"
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2937.629,2945.674,"We... that's right, we did not present evidence, and I am sorry, when I said quid pro quo again I meant the heightened sort of quid pro quo."
1990.89-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2945.674,2946.976,"--All right, but there was not evidence--"
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2946.976,2949.097,Mr. McCormick--
1990.89-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2949.097,2952.239,--in the campaign contribution there was not evidence to justify a conviction in this case.
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2952.239,2961.264,"--Yes, we did not show that the doctors reasonably believed that Mr. McCormick was definitely going to change position unless they gave him this."
1990.89-1918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2969.459,2972.121,"Mr. Wright, can I ask you a rather basic question?"
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2992.196,3000.581,"They objected to one portion of an argument, of an instruction respecting the quid pro quo instructions."
1990.89-1918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3000.581,3001.52,They objected in the trial court?
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3001.52,3002.091,Yes.
1990.89-1918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3002.712,3004.522,And did they argue that on appeal in the court of appeals?
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3004.522,3009.577,"--I believe that they mentioned that in their brief, but--"
1990.89-1918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3009.577,3018.342,"Because the court of appeals... reading the court of appeals' opinion, one would get the impression that the case was argued on the assumption that the jury was properly instructed."
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3018.342,3018.863,--Yes.
1990.89-1918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3018.863,3025.326,And I don't find in your opponent's brief a particularization of the instructions that he contends were erroneously given or failed to be given.
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3025.326,3025.836,"Oh, no, no."
1990.89-1918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3029.56,3031.57,That the evidence is insufficient--
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3031.57,3033.383,"--is a campaign contribution, not a payoff."
1990.89-1918,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3047.522,3064.502,"--I'm not sure it follows that because the legislator said he wouldn't change his position that there is still not, that you still can't prove some quid pro quo."
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3064.502,3073.558,"I'm not sure that we couldn't have proved a quid pro quo, but we didn't... we didn't go for the very strict... we proved that this money was given to secure his support."
1990.89-1918,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3085.045,3096.893,"But you seem to be saying that a quid pro quo is very constrictive of this statute, as exemplified by your answer to Justice O'Connor, that oh, well, a payoff is not a quid pro quo... which is something I still can't understand."
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3109.682,3111.693,"That's true, Your Honor."
1990.89-1918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3192.677,3196.458,Would you just help me on the term payoff?
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3202.921,3203.362,Yes.
1990.89-1918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3209.306,3215.872,"If he proved that he had in fact used it for campaign purposes, would it be a payoff?"
1990.89-1918,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3215.872,3225.897,"If it was given to him as a payoff and he happened to pay them off... to use it towards a campaign contribution, yes, it would still be a payoff."
1990.89-1918,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3248.382,3250.843,"Thank you, Mr. Wright."
1990.89-1918,2,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,3254.156,3254.857,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1990.89-1918,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3256.166,3266.733,"Mr. di Trapano, before you start may I just ask you to tell us specifically which instructions you objected to that... and argued in the court of appeals were erroneously given, and you still pertain?"
1990.89-1918,2,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,3266.733,3270.316,--We devoted a third of our brief to the instructions in the court of appeals.
1990.89-1918,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3271.698,3272.6,You did?
1990.89-1918,2,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,3273.438,3273.829,No.
1990.89-1918,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3274.61,3278.732,"You don't identify in your brief here which instructions you thought were erroneously given, do you?"
1990.89-1918,2,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,3278.732,3286.357,"Well, what we didn't... the court of appeals didn't rule on it and we don't address it in our... in this brief, except we do--"
1990.89-1918,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3286.357,3293.47,"So your argument is basically not that the jury was improperly instructed, but rather that the evidence in the record is insufficient to support the conviction?"
1990.89-1918,2,40646,rudolph_l_di_trapano,,3293.47,3306.199,"--No, we objected to the... we vigorously objected to the court defining or instructing the jury with respect to what a voluntary payment, that it... the expectation of benefit took it outside the ambit of a campaign contribution."
1990.89-1918,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3424.477,3426.367,"Thank you, Mr. di Trapano."
