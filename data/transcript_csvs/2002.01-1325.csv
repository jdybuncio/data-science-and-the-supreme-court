2002.01-1325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,10.774,"We'll hear argument in Number 01-1325, Washington Legal Foundation against the Legal Foundation of Washington."
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,41.693,45.425,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,78.557,81.817,"Before you start, Mr. Fried, may I ask you one broad question?"
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,89.619,90.984,--No.
2002.01-1325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,123.798,131.023,"The only point I was really want... you... you do not understand the dissenters in the Ninth Circuit to have gone that far, though, do you?"
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,131.023,133.169,"How... how far, Justice Stevens?"
2002.01-1325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,133.169,135.398,To have held that you're entitled to injunctive relief.
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,135.398,137.339,They did not go that far.
2002.01-1325,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,140.683,154.801,"In fact, they specifically said this equitable relief would not enjoin takings, but would simply stop Washington Supreme Court from requiring the LPO's to comply with the IOLTA rules."
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,154.801,173.543,"Well, if the injunctive relief, which we asked for... and here in the... the complaint, I believe, is on page 100 of the... 100 of the joint appendix."
2002.01-1325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,185.803,192.119,"Mr. Fried, what plaintiffs have standing to ask for injunctive relief in this case?"
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,192.119,195.884,--Certainly Brown and Hayes.
2002.01-1325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,199.599,206.287,But in the... in the complaint was an injunction sought on behalf of Brown and Hayes?
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,206.287,206.741,--Yes.
2002.01-1325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,217.005,222.289,"I... I thought it read to the contrary, that it was on behalf of the LPOs."
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,222.289,226.004,"--It was on behalf of the LPOs, but then finally... yes."
2002.01-1325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,239.545,243.177,"And... and you ask for it now on behalf of Brown and Hayes, not--"
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,243.177,244.003,We certainly do.
2002.01-1325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,244.003,244.375,--on behalf of the foundation.
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,244.375,251.228,We... we ask for it on behalf of any and all parties in this case.
2002.01-1325,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,251.228,262.207,"Mr. Fried, the question that Justice Stevens raised, which I was then addressing, was not what was in your complaint, but what was the position of the dissenting judges in the Ninth Circuit."
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,272.693,275.953,We are asking for more than the dissenters would have given us.
2002.01-1325,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,275.953,276.069,--Yes.
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,279.38,279.768,Yes.
2002.01-1325,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,307.904,314.757,"You... you mentioned your complaint, and then we have this passage in the dissent."
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,333.25,347.534,"It's been presented throughout, Justice Ginsburg, and in fact, in the Fifth Circuit case, which is virtually identical to this case, not only was it presented, but an injunction was granted."
2002.01-1325,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,351.621,371.888,"If you just could tell me at what point you made it clear to the court that you were seeking not what is described here, that is, that the... that the injunction would be addressed to the compliance of the LPO's with the IOLTA rules."
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,371.888,381.342,"--I think that the... I submit, Justice Ginsburg, that that paragraph, which I have read to you, makes that clear."
2002.01-1325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,381.342,382.623,But that paragraph--
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,382.623,389.31,And in the summary... and I'm... I'm informed that it was also made clear in our summary judgment motion.
2002.01-1325,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,408.052,413.048,--Let... let me see if I can help you get to the other major parts of your case by asking this question.
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,447.971,448.548,They--
2002.01-1325,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,448.548,451.603,--the nature of the taking that occurred in this case.
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,451.603,454.203,--The... I think that's exactly the reason.
2002.01-1325,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,552.944,554.802,"Well, what about my hypothetical on Loretto?"
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,561.201,561.944,--Yes.
2002.01-1325,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,561.944,568.714,--but let's... let's assume that the compensation was just so minimal it just really couldn't be calculated.
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,584.029,600.831,"My... our case is different because in this case, as in Webb's, as in Eastern Associates, to give compensation is to simply erase the program."
2002.01-1325,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,626.92,631.295,Why doesn't that just prove that you have the wrong clause of the Constitution?
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,670.183,678.068,"That would be correct if Webb's had been a due process case, but it was not."
2002.01-1325,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,690.411,706.592,"Then the rationale... you'd say even... I mean, occasionally some case does have something that's a little hard to follow, but the... the theory that that is consistent with the Just Compensation Clause, rather than the Due Process Clause, is?"
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,706.592,708.987,That it makes no sense.
2002.01-1325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,727.192,733.962,"Yes, but if... if it is shown... and I guess we don't know here because it hasn't been determined."
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,755.222,758.565,"The compensation is not 0, and the premise of the--"
2002.01-1325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,758.565,758.937,If.
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,762.075,763.273,--If it were.
2002.01-1325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,764.842,765.956,"Well, then what is your answer?"
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,769.588,770.248,--Yes.
2002.01-1325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,774.046,777.101,How is it in... in the language of the clause?
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,777.101,793.448,--Because this Court in Phillips has held that economic... that... that there is private property and it has value even though it has no realizable economic value.
2002.01-1325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,802.159,804.76,"But that has not been determined, has it?"
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,804.76,805.791,"--Yes, it has."
2002.01-1325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,839.849,842.904,But weren't those gross figures rather than net figures?
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,843.481,845.71,"--Those are gross figures, yes, Justice Stevens."
2002.01-1325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,845.71,853.141,"--But can we assume, along with Justice O'Connor's question, that there's no net loss to the property owner?"
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,862.223,863.792,Perhaps and perhaps not.
2002.01-1325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,874.649,874.815,Even if it had been--
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,874.815,876.135,--and that is the point--
2002.01-1325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,876.135,880.016,"--Do you agree if it was a taking and you were to get just compensation, you would get the net loss rather than the gross loss?"
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,880.016,880.676,--No.
2002.01-1325,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,882.08,919.603,"You... you again, Mr. Fried, are going quite beyond the position of the original panel, later the dissenters in the Ninth Circuit, who made it clear... and this is on page 83a of the original panel decision... that said, just as a client is not entitled to the full amount that a lawyer collects for him, but only that amount less the lawyer's reasonable expenses and fees, so just compensation for the interest taken by IOLTA, after IOLTA causes the interest fund to exist, is something less... is something less... than the amount of the interest."
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,919.603,921.173,--That is what the dissent says.
2002.01-1325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,948.21,948.665,"Well, isn't the difference--"
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,948.665,951.637,--that the government may seize those rents.
2002.01-1325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,951.637,969.181,"--Isn't the difference, Mr. Fried, that in the... in the rent example, what the... what the members of the Court were assuming was that if somebody wants to be a bad businessperson, he's perfectly free to do it, and until he goes bankrupt, or loses the property, he can collect the rent."
2002.01-1325,0,18942,charles_fried,,1001.337,1022.968,"I think not, Justice... Justice Souter, because the Court in Phillips said specifically this interest... so it assumes there is... this interest is the private property of the clients, Brown and Hayes."
2002.01-1325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1034.857,1039.686,"Well, I may not be the... the best expert on what the... what the majority meant by that."
2002.01-1325,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1551.401,1554.911,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1325,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1576.376,1584.178,So the position of the State of Washington is that it can take any property so long as it doesn't have... so long as compensation can't be calculated.
2002.01-1325,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1584.178,1584.838,No.
2002.01-1325,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1593.261,1601.434,Doesn't... doesn't the State have some duty to recognize that the Constitution protects property and it shouldn't take property that doesn't belong to it?
2002.01-1325,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1601.434,1607.378,"In certain circumstances, the Just Compensation Clause acts a shield."
2002.01-1325,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1607.378,1608.576,So... so if you can get it--
2002.01-1325,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1608.576,1608.864,The process might well--
2002.01-1325,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1608.864,1613.794,"--So if you can get away with taking property just because it can't be valued, then you can take it."
2002.01-1325,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1613.794,1614.166,--That is not--
2002.01-1325,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1614.166,1616.023,That's the position of the State of Washington.
2002.01-1325,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1616.023,1621.39,"--That is the position of this Court's cases, not the position of the State of Washington, which does not go that far."
2002.01-1325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1622.505,1625.849,"Well, there might be some due process claim, mightn't there?"
2002.01-1325,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1625.849,1626.964,--One was not stated here.
2002.01-1325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1626.964,1631.133,We're trying... what... what we're looking at here is a takings claim.
2002.01-1325,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1631.133,1631.793,Correct.
2002.01-1325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1645.994,1649.709,"Once again, I... $5 and $2."
2002.01-1325,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1654.539,1656.768,"Under this Court's cases, it is not their money."
2002.01-1325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1681.66,1685.747,But you're... there you're talking about something that has to be sold for money.
2002.01-1325,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1698.916,1708.121,"Answering the question of whether it's property, as the Court made clear in Phillips, does not answer the question of whether there is a taking, or the question of whether there is just compensation."
2002.01-1325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1708.121,1709.69,"Well, who has the $5 and $2?"
2002.01-1325,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1709.69,1716.543,"The government does, as it had the additional value in the cases such as the Boston Chamber case, and in--"
2002.01-1325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1716.543,1718.606,"Mr. Burman, am I right?"
2002.01-1325,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1721.002,1721.828,--That is gross.
2002.01-1325,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1734.543,1735.12,--Right.
2002.01-1325,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1736.689,1738.835,--Webb's did not have an injunction.
2002.01-1325,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1738.835,1739.389,I know it didn't.
2002.01-1325,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1748.577,1749.692,It's--
2002.01-1325,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1749.692,1750.601,--It's impossible.
2002.01-1325,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1759.351,1773.84,"--Where the textual language is just compensation, and where the value is economic or pecuniary or monetary loss, as this Court's cases often say, it's not just that there is no way to remedy this problem."
2002.01-1325,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1779.785,1794.357,"Suppose... suppose there were a State in which a group of lawyers or real... people with real estate accounts got together and say, we really should pool this interest and we'll give our clients a choice of four different things that they can allocate the money to."
2002.01-1325,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1810.172,1812.318,--That may be a very different case.
2002.01-1325,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1816.487,1821.4,But can... do they even have the possibility of trying that given the regulation that you now have?
2002.01-1325,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1821.4,1821.772,"--Actually, we don't know that."
2002.01-1325,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1821.772,1824.455,"You've taken away, in effect, a business opportunity, have you not?"
2002.01-1325,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1824.455,1824.91,No.
2002.01-1325,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1829.656,1832.174,"Well, it's certainly profitable for you to do it."
2002.01-1325,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1834.486,1840.885,Our burden is not to come up with hypotheticals for other cases that they might bring.
2002.01-1325,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1842.0,1844.312,"Well, your burden is to answer hypotheticals--"
2002.01-1325,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1844.312,1844.7,Yes.
2002.01-1325,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1844.7,1848.853,--that establish whether or not a property interest is being taken in violation of the Constitution here.
2002.01-1325,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1848.853,1849.308,"Correct, Your Honor."
2002.01-1325,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1849.308,1858.512,"And you say that simply because it can't be computed, A, because of the small amounts, and B, because of the government's unique program, that it is not property anymore."
2002.01-1325,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1858.512,1870.484,"And the difference is what is unique about the government's program and what Boston Chamber says would be relevant, if individuals could do it, was aggregation that reduces the transaction costs."
2002.01-1325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1871.31,1877.543,"Now, does... does this mean... let's... you know, banks pay higher... higher amounts for certain deposits above a certain amount."
2002.01-1325,1,20555,david_j_burman,,1899.091,1900.206,--Justice Scalia--
2002.01-1325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1900.206,1901.692,What a... what a wonderful scam.
2002.01-1325,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2418.751,2429.071,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1325,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2454.296,2456.525,"Well, but... but that's the issue before us."
2002.01-1325,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2471.097,2480.302,"--Justice Kennedy, it is a taking when the government takes your property without a sufficient regulatory basis."
2002.01-1325,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2594.442,2599.643,"So you give... you give the same answer to my $5,000 hypothetical that your... your brother would."
2002.01-1325,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2600.197,2601.933,My answer is that--
2002.01-1325,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2601.933,2610.6,"I mean, so long as the government sets it up that way and I couldn't make any more money, the money that the government makes on my money is the government's."
2002.01-1325,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2611.137,2621.928,"--Yes, because this Court's cases make it clear, Justice Scalia, that the amount of just compensation that is due is the amount of your loss."
2002.01-1325,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2626.181,2629.608,I don't think the cases make clear what you have to deduct from it.
2002.01-1325,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2639.761,2640.365,No.
2002.01-1325,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2678.77,2681.743,That's if you took his right to earn interest.
2002.01-1325,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2691.857,2710.35,"--I think that is a mischaracterization of the facts, Justice Scalia, that the money that he put in, if invested at that rate, in a world without transaction costs, would have earned that amount of money, but that world doesn't exist in the... in the Milky Way."
2002.01-1325,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2710.35,2711.836,Whose money earned the $7?
2002.01-1325,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2711.836,2714.519,The $7--
2002.01-1325,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2714.519,2716.294,"His money earned it, didn't it?"
2002.01-1325,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2722.404,2727.771,--That's not the case because the--
2002.01-1325,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2727.771,2732.352,"Mr. Dellinger, isn't the... isn't it... it's their money that earned it."
2002.01-1325,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2738.297,2738.297,"--Precisely, it's--"
2002.01-1325,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2738.297,2742.755,"And if that is the definition of interest, then there was no $5."
2002.01-1325,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2744.696,2745.894,"--That is exactly correct, Justice Souter."
2002.01-1325,3,18942,charles_fried,,3290.928,3292.786,"Thank you, Justice Stevens."
2002.01-1325,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3343.646,3351.093,"May I... I shouldn't be taking your rebuttal time, Mr. Fried, but are you saying that if they did this by a statute, it would be perfectly okay?"
2002.01-1325,3,18942,charles_fried,,3351.093,3352.867,"No, I'm not saying that."
2002.01-1325,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3353.405,3354.686,--as part of the revenue code.
2002.01-1325,3,18942,charles_fried,,3354.686,3356.794,--as a tax... if they did it as a tax because it--
2002.01-1325,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3356.794,3363.602,"Well, it seems to me the program was exactly the same, it was adopted by a legislature, and had the title tax on it."
2002.01-1325,3,18942,charles_fried,,3363.602,3373.14,"--Because in every jurisdiction and certainly in the Federal Government, taxes have to jump over certain hoops."
2002.01-1325,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3383.204,3385.379,I'm not sure I know the answer to my question.
2002.01-1325,3,18942,charles_fried,,3388.001,3390.767,--It would be an entirely different question.
2002.01-1325,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3478.363,3489.054,"Mr. Fried, may I ask you another question that is troubling me about this, in addition to the question of is it really the bank whose... whose economic gain has been taken?"
2002.01-1325,3,18942,charles_fried,,3527.199,3538.632,"Yes, and the solution for that is the political process rather than the process of judges and bar associations raising revenue."
2002.01-1325,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3547.177,3550.975,I'm not sure I understand that answer.
2002.01-1325,3,18942,charles_fried,,3566.29,3575.124,"Well, we're enjoining it... we are asking you to enjoin it because it is an illegal program."
2002.01-1325,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3580.697,3584.95,"Mr. Fried, you may have another minute if you didn't get your rebuttal through."
2002.01-1325,3,18942,charles_fried,,3584.95,3586.558,No.
2002.01-1325,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3587.551,3588.006,Thank you.
2002.01-1325,3,18942,charles_fried,,3588.006,3588.582,--sufficient.
