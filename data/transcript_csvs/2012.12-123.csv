2012.12-123,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.261,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-123, Horne v. Department of Agriculture."
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,8.291,11.898,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-123,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,22.784,25.659,Could I -- could I just stop you on a factual matter--
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,25.659,26.863,Certainly.
2012.12-123,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,26.863,28.127,--because it has confused me.
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,76.153,82.074,"The other two partners in Lassen were Laura Horne's parents, now deceased."
2012.12-123,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,82.074,85.587,But the estates have been substituted.
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,85.587,86.62,That's right.
2012.12-123,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,86.62,91.054,"So isn't it two legal entities, one who owns and one who handles?"
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,94.681,98.007,The Department of Agriculture did not distinguish among them.
2012.12-123,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,98.007,100.144,"Well, I don't care if they did or they didn't."
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,106.628,111.967,"They are separate -- they are separate legal entities, all effectively controlled by the same family."
2012.12-123,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,111.967,127.167,"--Well, that's -- you know, in the cat -- you get some limited liability by creating separate entities, so the creature who owns is one partnership, and the -- and the entity that produces, that handles, is a second one."
2012.12-123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,127.167,143.704,"I assume this is one of those difficult merits questions you were alluding to, it doesn't go to whether there's jurisdiction, but to whether the claim of a taking can be asserted by the partnership in question, isn't it?"
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,143.704,145.003,"That's right, Justice Scalia."
2012.12-123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,145.003,147.736,"I don't -- I don't see how it goes to jurisdiction, which is the only question before us."
2012.12-123,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,147.736,156.701,"Well, it does to my mind, because what is the claim, assuming that the producer owns -- the producer entity owns the raisins."
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,165.117,172.055,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, I'm -- I'm delighted to preview our -- our argument on the merits on that."
2012.12-123,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,172.055,173.303,What -- what do they own?
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,173.303,174.616,So the -- so the--
2012.12-123,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,174.616,176.769,What is it that's being taken from the handler entity?
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,176.769,186.283,"--The order in this case was issued against the -- the Hornes in their capacity as a handler only, so the entire fine was paid by them."
2012.12-123,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,192.842,194.418,All right.
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,214.083,218.096,"So -- so this is -- this is our position, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.12-123,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,314.059,320.836,"But you -- you began by saying that these are merits defenses, but you wanted to focus first on -- on the jurisdictional question that's before us."
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,320.836,321.616,That's right.
2012.12-123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,338.096,357.37,"Am I right in thinking that there is no dispute on that point, that the -- the takings claim could have been asserted by the Hornes as producers in the Court of Federal Claims?"
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,357.37,376.439,"I think that the Government no longer disputes, although you should ask them to be clear -- I think that they no longer dispute that this is not a jurisdictional client, even though they prevailed after the petition for rehearing was filed in the Court of Appeals--"
2012.12-123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,376.439,377.5,"Well, jurisdictional--"
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,377.5,379.189,--on the ground that it was jurisdictional.
2012.12-123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,379.189,396.853,"--jurisdictional or not, as a practical matter, producers who are not subject to fine as handlers, but the producers of the raisins whose raisins are being segregated, could they go to the Court of Federal Claims and say my raisins have been taken?"
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,396.853,408.786,"The -- whether the claim is being brought in the capacity of producer or handler I think is not relevant to one of our arguments, and it is relevant to the other argument."
2012.12-123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,408.786,412.33,But I'd just like a straight answer to that question.
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,416.188,417.376,"No, no."
2012.12-123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,420.906,422.516,--I'm saying hypothetically -- hypothetically.
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,427.122,431.387,It depends upon whether the taking has been from them or not.
2012.12-123,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,469.84,475.444,"But the problem is that they weren't entitled to that money, meaning they had to pay it over to the producer."
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,487.614,488.8,--I'm not sure what--
2012.12-123,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,488.8,490.207,--if they were sold in the ordinary course.
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,490.207,494.36,--I'm not sure which money you're -- they have not asserted any claim on any money.
2012.12-123,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,561.319,562.972,"Mr. McConnell, I'm sorry."
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,596.289,606.627,"--If they had -- if they had not been paid for the raisins, they had taken raisins to a handler, received no money for them, I think that they could go to the Court of Claims."
2012.12-123,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,606.627,609.626,"In other words, the Hornes did what the marketing order suggested they should do."
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,615.514,616.637,Yes.
2012.12-123,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,616.637,618.341,Okay.
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,623.45,634.77,"They didn't -- they didn't go that route, and the question I think is what are the -- what are the legal consequences of that--"
2012.12-123,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,634.77,635.429,Right.
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,635.429,660.355,"--because what they -- what they knew was that they were not going to be compensated for the raisins, and therefore they came up with a -- with a plan, a business plan that they believed made -- eliminated any handler and made it unnecessary for any of the independent producers on whose behalf they're operating to turn over raisins to the Government."
2012.12-123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,695.575,696.655,"Well, some of the raisins were their own."
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,698.2,699.276,That's correct.
2012.12-123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,699.276,700.995,"At least as to that, that wouldn't be true, right?"
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,700.995,703.666,That's -- that's correct.
2012.12-123,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,706.322,717.459,"Well, to get you back to the -- the jurisdiction point, let's -- let's just assume a hypothetical case where a regulated entity has to pay an exaction which it deems to be a penalty."
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,731.435,732.293,That's right.
2012.12-123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,764.685,779.04,"Mr. McConnell, would you explain the -- if they were just handlers and weren't producing any raisins, if they were just handlers, do they have a claim and where?"
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,818.168,821.072,So if they are just a handler--
2012.12-123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,821.072,821.946,Yes.
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,821.946,827.944,"--as the Department of Agriculture treated them, as far as the Department of Agriculture is concerned they are only a handler."
2012.12-123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,836.893,840.141,What I'm -- I'm trying to understand is this scheme.
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,860.711,862.774,I don't think that that's so.
2012.12-123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,869.053,872.489,"So any handler, any handler could be making the same claim?"
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,872.489,877.065,Any handler who has a business model that is similar to this.
2012.12-123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,878.423,881.499,But what do you mean by -- what's the business model that's similar to this?
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,881.499,894.197,"--So most handlers, if they're in compliance with the order, they take all the raisins from the producers, they only pay for -- for the free pool of raisins."
2012.12-123,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,924.105,925.072,I'm sorry.
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,925.072,926.246,In response to--
2012.12-123,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,926.246,932.416,"In the Horne model, the handlers buy, buy the free raisins and then pay the producers, is that what it--"
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,932.416,933.352,--That's correct.
2012.12-123,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,933.352,934.35,--Oh.
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,938.864,940.05,Exactly.
2012.12-123,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,944.629,945.736,All right.
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,946.55,948.142,And that -- and they were found to be handlers anyway.
2012.12-123,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,948.142,961.357,--What is -- what is the value in permitting a party who doesn't own property to raise a taking claim on behalf of other people?
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1000.465,1001.323,No.
2012.12-123,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1001.323,1005.231,So I go back to my question: What was the taking?
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1010.367,1018.941,"The taking is what the Government demanded, which was either give me your house or give me your money, give me your raisins or give us the monetary equivalent."
2012.12-123,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1018.941,1019.896,But they're not your raisins.
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1019.896,1030.437,"By the time -- by the time this order was enforced, the raisins were gone and so as a practical matter, only one of those two alternatives was left as a matter of timing."
2012.12-123,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1030.437,1045.135,"Well, but in answer to Justice Ginsburg's question that -- you said the producers could go to the -- the Court of Federal Claims to contest the taking of -- producers could go to contest the taking of raisins."
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1045.135,1046.948,If they had not been paid for the raisins.
2012.12-123,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1046.948,1047.962,If they had not been paid for it.
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1047.962,1048.82,Right.
2012.12-123,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1048.82,1055.633,But are you -- does that mean you do not think that the AMAA withdraws Tucker Act jurisdiction?
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1055.633,1058.802,It withdraws Tucker Act jurisdiction only for handlers.
2012.12-123,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1060.424,1061.282,Only for handlers.
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1061.282,1065.922,--pure producers do not go to the -- don't have to go through the AMAA process.
2012.12-123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1065.922,1066.983,Why?
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1069.857,1077.075,"These New Deal-era programs, Justice Scalia, are somewhat -- the purpose is somewhat obscure--"
2012.12-123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1077.075,1078.354,"No, I don't mean the policy."
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1082.651,1092.256,"--Oh, well, this is straightforwardly set forth in the -- in the -- in Sections 14(a) and 15(a) of the AMAA."
2012.12-123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1109.047,1110.139,You said--
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1110.139,1111.06,"--I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
2012.12-123,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1148.577,1150.402,I'm just trying to get to what you're arguing about.
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1207.678,1208.911,That's almost exactly right.
2012.12-123,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1208.911,1209.987,But not quite.
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1211.8,1214.612,With -- with one detail different--
2012.12-123,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1214.612,1215.439,Yes?
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1215.439,1220.656,--which is that this is the proceeding here that decides whether they have to pay.
2012.12-123,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1222.091,1223.264,"Okay, okay."
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1227.261,1228.809,So they're raising a defense.
2012.12-123,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1232.931,1234.635,And then the Ninth Circuit says go to the Court of Claims.
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1237.306,1249.032,"But that detail actually is quite important, because, remember, you can't even go to the Court of Claims unless you are seeking damages for an actual violation that has already taken place."
2012.12-123,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1269.865,1270.305,That's true--
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1270.305,1274.208,--“ have contemplated ”.
2012.12-123,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1274.208,1280.045,"--I think that's true, Mr. McConnell, as to part of the fine, that part of the fine falls under Apfel, but not the other part."
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1312.107,1319.107,"Well, the most pertinent case for that part of the fine, for the penalty part, is Missouri Pacific Railroad v. Nebraska."
2012.12-123,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1363.448,1376.753,"All I was trying to do was to get you on the basic argument, which you started with, which is why is there -- why was the Ninth Circuit wrong when they said they had no jurisdiction to hear this, that rather, they had to go -- you had to go to the--"
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1376.753,1378.333,May I tick off the three reasons?
2012.12-123,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1378.333,1378.926,--Yes.
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1378.926,1380.614,One is it has nothing to do with jurisdiction.
2012.12-123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1412.897,1411.974,What was the first?
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1413.958,1418.704,The first is that it isn't jurisdictional and therefore it should not have been raised--
2012.12-123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1418.704,1419.815,What -- what isn't jurisdictional?
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1419.815,1439.496,"--The -- the requirement to go to the Court of Claims when you -- when you need to is not jurisdictional, that that's a matter of remedy, that is, it's -- it's the equitable principle that you may not pursue your case for an injunctive relief when there's an adequate remedy at law."
2012.12-123,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1439.496,1450.38,"Mr. McConnell, in -- in -- if the producers had decided to challenge this as a Tucker Act violation, they would have had to hand over the raisins?"
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1459.002,1484.992,"So had they held on to their own raisins and sold them, I assume, you don't -- not just left them rot, if they had sold them, then the Department of Agriculture would have called them a handler, because anyone who sells raisins is called a handler, and then they would be fined in their capacity as a handler and it would be a somewhat similar case to this one."
2012.12-123,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1484.992,1486.131,All right.
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1486.131,1487.397,Maybe an easier one than this one.
2012.12-123,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1487.397,1497.517,"Well, the point is that under a normal takings claim, you have to hand over your property, you've lost the value, and you want the Government to pay it back to you, correct?"
2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1497.517,1499.205,Not necessarily correct.

2012.12-123,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1563.976,1565.38,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.12-123,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1612.736,1618.546,"Thank you, Mr. McConnell."
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1620.469,1622.687,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-123,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1651.532,1655.892,"Mr. Palmore, before you do that then, haven't you conceded the point that this is not jurisdictional?"
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1655.892,1663.952,We agree that the failure to go to the Court of Claims is not properly viewed as a jurisdictional defect.
2012.12-123,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1676.087,1678.96,When did you first raise the argument that it was jurisdictional?
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1678.96,1682.194,--In our opposition to the rehearing petition.
2012.12-123,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1682.194,1686.362,And now you are -- now you are changing back again and saying it's not?
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1686.362,1692.375,"There was Ninth Circuit precedent holding that it was jurisdictional, and we relied on that and there is certainly language from this Court--"
2012.12-123,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1692.375,1693.69,You relied on that when you got to rehearing.
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1696.326,1697.437,--That's correct.
2012.12-123,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1719.457,1729.409,"But Mr. Palmore, if you are conceding now that this is not jurisdictional, it seems to me that your Tucker Act argument as a substantive argument, I mean, has been waived."
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1732.735,1739.014,--That would certainly be something that -- that the Ninth Circuit could consider in the event there were a remand here.
2012.12-123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1748.634,1750.462,I'm really confused.
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1758.866,1759.989,"Well, the Ninth Circuit--"
2012.12-123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1759.989,1765.892,"So the two of you are in agreement it ought to go back to the Ninth Circuit, they should do it on the merits, and -- and if that's wrong, we can review that."
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1765.892,1772.655,"--If that happens, of course, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, the consequence for us is they reinstate the prior panel opinion, in which--"
2012.12-123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1772.655,1774.063,"That may well be, but--"
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1774.063,1777.404,"--I'm not going to resist too strenuously that kind of remand, but they did decide it."
2012.12-123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1882.769,1889.374,"--Yes, but part of that penalty was, you know, your raisins or your life, right?"
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1895.169,1896.714,"That's not correct, Justice Scalia."
2012.12-123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.432,1903.557,"You mean they -- Is that right, they have to give the raisins?"
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1903.557,1906.338,--They are under a regulatory obligation to provide the raisins.
2012.12-123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1910.662,1911.474,Okay.
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1912.35,1913.333,One component--
2012.12-123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1913.333,1915.832,"--that amounts to the same thing, your raisins or the penalty, right?"
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1915.832,1916.987,"--No, but it's not a choice."
2012.12-123,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1974.356,1986.098,"As this case stands as it comes before us, is there a claim that they -- that money -- the Government is trying to take money from them without just compensation?"
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1986.098,1990.941,That was certainly not how we understood the claim to be litigated below.
2012.12-123,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1999.188,2005.809,"Is that an issue we should decide or is that an issue that the Ninth Circuit should decide, whether there is a takings claim for money?"
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2005.809,2015.305,"That was certainly not decided below, so a remand -- to the extent that this was preserved, a remand would be possible outcome there."
2012.12-123,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2021.852,2022.585,All right.
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2027.678,2034.502,"Well, we think that -- for several reasons."
2012.12-123,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2060.321,2061.382,Don't they claim that--
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2061.382,2063.835,We suggested that there are a whole host of reasons--
2012.12-123,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2063.835,2068.44,"--Before you leave that, don't they claim that the entire amount that is assessed against them is a taking?"
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2079.904,2092.694,"--That's -- that's -- they are clearly wrong about that, and I -- but I think however you characterize that defect, it defeats this dollar-for-dollar pointless exercise point that Apfel--"
2012.12-123,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2092.694,2094.851,"Well, why is that a necessary part of Apfel?"
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2126.726,2136.537,"--Well, I think there were two things going on in Apfel and there were really two distinct reasons why the plurality in Apfel thought that there was no requirement to go to the Tucker Act there."
2012.12-123,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2195.664,2204.93,"No, no, but there's a similar -- i mean, it seemed to me, again simplifying, that underlying this their clients think this whole raisin program is unconstitutional."
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2228.714,2229.028,Yes.
2012.12-123,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2229.028,2229.84,Fine.
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2268.98,2270.87,Sure.
2012.12-123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2308.808,2310.774,That couldn't be what the statute meant.
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2345.246,2348.744,"--Justice Scalia, I have two -- two responses to that."
2012.12-123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2394.991,2396.099,And you -- you think that's a close question?
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2414.373,2416.919,"--Well, we do agree that it's a close question for the--"
2012.12-123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2416.919,2418.108,I don't think it's close at all.
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2426.7,2429.274,"--Well, of course, Congress didn't think this was a taking."
2012.12-123,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2488.346,2502.323,"Mr. Palmore, am I incorrect in thinking that the Government is saying, handlers cannot raise the constitutionality of the Raisin Marketing Order?"
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2530.563,2534.45,"--Justice Ginsburg, I think this goes back again to the property question."
2012.12-123,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2558.783,2559.629,But it would be--
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2559.629,2575.013,"If the claim -- if the claim is that the money that was taken from me, the fine, that itself is a taking, then we think that claim can and must be brought in the context of the AMAA proceeding."
2012.12-123,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2594.833,2596.893,But then you just -- but then you just lose on the merits.
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2599.376,2601.533,"Well, Justice Kennedy--"
2012.12-123,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2601.533,2615.607,"I thought that what we were going to decide was whether or not, assuming you can go to the Court of Claims, you must go to the Court of Claims, can you prefer to wait, have a penalty assessed against you and say this is unconstitutional, it's a taking."
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2623.898,2632.426,"--But, Justice Kennedy, the -- the Ninth Circuit didn't understand the taking claim to be that the fine for my violation of law is a taking of my money."
2012.12-123,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2656.934,2665.349,"The just compensation, I take it, in the program is supposed to come from the fact that raisin prices go up."
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2686.874,2690.512,"--Justice Breyer, and that goes to the -- to the merits of the case."
2012.12-123,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2690.512,2691.23,"No, no."
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2733.446,2739.444,"Well, Your Honor, of course, the consequence of that is they reinstate our prior victory in the prior panel opinion--"
2012.12-123,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2739.444,2746.833,"No, no, we'd say -- we'll say given the way that we've talked about the program, perhaps it's best to consider this matter fully."
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2746.833,2748.72,"--Well, they did consider the matter fully."
2012.12-123,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2752.299,2753.001,Yes.
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2753.001,2760.372,"So all of the discussion we're having here is about -- is predicated on the idea that if there were a taking, would compensation be available in the first place."
2012.12-123,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2760.372,2760.984,Excuse me.
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2761.749,2762.7,We agree there's no taking.
2012.12-123,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2762.7,2763.418,--All right.
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2805.088,2812.197,"No, because of the way that the statute and the regulatory program works."
2012.12-123,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2834.576,2839.621,"So they are missing a business opportunity, because they can't take title to those raisins."
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2842.012,2845.635,They would never pay for those -- they would never pay for those raisins because they can't take title.
2012.12-123,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2848.93,2859.131,--This really does sound to me -- and I think that both Justice Scalia and Breyer now are being more and more convinced -- there has to be a place to challenge this scheme.
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2859.131,2861.397,--And there absolutely is.
2012.12-123,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2861.397,2865.441,Whether it's a taking -- whether there's a takings claim f.
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2869.048,2872.125,"But the handler's property is not being taken, and that's critical."
2012.12-123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2902.849,2904.955,That's -- that's a merits question again.
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2913.172,2927.431,"No, Justice Scalia, I think it goes to the scope, the capacity question that we were talking about before, because the statute is quite clear in section 608c(13)(B) that this scheme does not regulate producers in their capacity as producers."
2012.12-123,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2992.67,3001.433,"Did I understand you to say a couple minutes ago that if the case were remanded, you would be entitled to win on the reasoning of the panel opinion?"
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3001.433,3003.744,"The prior panel opinion, Justice."
2012.12-123,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3023.769,3036.076,"Mr. Palmore, what would be wrong -- would anything be wrong -- with a -- with a disposition of this Court that went something like this: Everybody agrees that this is not a jurisdictional issue, including the Government, so they got that wrong."
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3066.312,3072.7,"--That would certainly be an available option, or the Ninth Circuit could decide for itself whether there had been a waiver."
2012.12-123,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3122.664,3125.242,What does the word “ acquire ” mean.
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3129.769,3132.986,"“ Acquire ” is a defined term, and it includes to possess."
2012.12-123,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3134.566,3136.487,"Like lessees or something, bailees?"
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3136.487,3142.174,--There was no question under the regulatory scheme here that Petitioners were handlers.
2012.12-123,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3143.78,3144.592,"I -- no, no."
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3146.217,3150.059,"--“ Acquire ” -- “ acquire ” is defined to include a number of things, including to possess."

2012.12-123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3168.49,3170.206,A bailee?
2012.12-123,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3171.454,3176.189,Can they -- can they assert a takings claim attaches to the car?
2012.12-123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3178.564,3180.813,"Yeah, I suppose a bailee could, a bailee of the car."
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3180.813,3182.373,"--No, I don't think a bailee could."
2012.12-123,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3225.14,3229.402,"But still, it might if they're acquirers -- but they are acquirers, okay?"
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3251.504,3256.374,--I -- I disagree that they have standing to make those other people's claims.
2012.12-123,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3268.104,3269.449,Suppose they did have standing.
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3270.51,3273.711,If--
2012.12-123,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3273.711,3275.665,You say no.
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3275.665,3278.103,"--Well, they have -- they certainly have standing as producers to raise the claim."
2012.12-123,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3278.103,3279.569,Let's assume they have standing.
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3280.665,3282.272,"Yes, that--"
2012.12-123,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3287.084,3288.16,"--No, no."
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3292.425,3300.872,"I think that they would have standing, but it's still a claim that's beyond the scope of this narrow specific judicial review proceeding."
2012.12-123,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3302.591,3311.494,I have to say -- I think it comes with less than good grace for you to criticize the other side for not having raised a particular argument.
2012.12-123,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3323.988,3331.049,"Well, I'm not going to resist that too strenuously, -- but I think if they did decide the question, they decided it correctly."

2012.12-123,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3427.665,3429.322,"Thank you, Mr. Palmore."
2012.12-123,2,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,3432.367,3435.413,I'd like to make two quick points.
2012.12-123,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3488.47,3491.983,"Well, they've conceded that it doesn't apply to handlers."

2012.12-123,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3494.481,3496.388,"Yes, and so they've conceded there is no--"
2012.12-123,2,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,3496.388,3499.059,--And the second issue I wanted to talk about so is this capacity issue.
