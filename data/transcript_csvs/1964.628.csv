1964.628,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,7.321,"Number 628, United States versus Midland-Ross Inc."
1964.628,0,23981,frank_i_goodman,,9.227,12.998,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1964.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,511.79,517.922,"Now in the example you just gave, the bank, what -- what’s the rule if the bank is not on the accrual basis?"
1964.628,0,23981,frank_i_goodman,,517.922,530.992,"If the bank is not on the accrual basis then, as any other cash basis taxpayers, it’s not required to account for the interest as it is earned over the life of the security, but (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,530.992,531.706,In the -- any year of the material note --
1964.628,0,23981,frank_i_goodman,,531.706,533.431,Only on the year of sale.
1964.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,540.724,541.352,Right.
1964.628,0,23981,frank_i_goodman,,541.352,541.816,-- these items.
1964.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,541.816,542.054,Right.
1964.628,0,23981,frank_i_goodman,,542.054,546.907,"There would be no question about that in any event, but that wasn’t the reason for the rulings."
1964.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,558.952,568.919,"That reason is clear I suppose but nonetheless as you say it, it’s like a person -- the real estate dealer, he doesn’t get the ordinary event because it’s a capital gains available of a case and also as a real estate."
1964.628,0,23981,frank_i_goodman,,568.919,575.425,"That’s right, but the ruling didn’t pertain to the treatment of the sale of a notes, whether it would be capital gain or ordinary income."
1964.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,829.46,842.385,"Do you really think that these differentiations are explainable just in terms of the inability to get beyond the forced rate of interest because this is certainly, it doesn’t take much sophistication?"
1964.628,0,23981,frank_i_goodman,,843.001,843.851,I agree --
1964.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,843.851,844.779,-- rate of interest.
1964.628,0,23981,frank_i_goodman,,844.779,855.164,"I’m afraid I can’t thing of any rational explanation to the differentiation treatment, and this is a pragmatic explanation which I think makes some sense in terms of a practical --"
1964.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,855.164,857.338,"Of somebody in the second grade, it makes some sense?"
1964.628,0,23981,frank_i_goodman,,857.338,891.206,"Well, the inability to recognize bond discount for what it was namely an additional interest paid to the lender does reflect I think considerable degree of naive test, but giving way to the pragmatic considerations to which I referred, the difficulty of making the computation from the case where a discount was small in relation to the stated interest and the difficulty of requiring subsequent holders of the bonds to make these computations, I think might well have the -- it might justify (Voice Overlap) the differentiation, it might well have explained."
1964.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,891.206,897.362,Unwillingness to impose this so much burden of computation on something at this -- probably --
1964.628,0,23981,frank_i_goodman,,897.362,897.553,Right.
1964.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,897.553,898.545,-- the matters in many cases.
1964.628,0,23981,frank_i_goodman,,898.545,925.953,"Well I think that is the most satisfactory explanation, but what I do suggest is that no one could ever have thought that corporate bonds issued without interest, 4% or 5% corporate bonds issued without stated interest but at a discount could yield the lender a capital gain treatment because if that were true, no other kind of bonds would ever have been issued."
1964.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,942.417,944.148,Can I ask you just a question now?
1964.628,0,23981,frank_i_goodman,,947.371,948.105,In our case?
1964.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,948.105,949.07,"Yes, that's right, in this case."
1964.628,0,23981,frank_i_goodman,,949.07,951.405,"It was an industrial corporation, I frankly -- I forgotten --"
1964.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,951.405,952.954,It wasn't in the business of buying and selling.
1964.628,0,23981,frank_i_goodman,,952.954,955.952,"No, it was not and as far as the record shows this is the only time that has happened."
1964.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,955.952,957.003,I see.
1964.628,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,957.003,962.636,[Inaudible] it’s the same settle I think.
1964.628,0,23981,frank_i_goodman,,962.636,963.944,Yes.
1964.628,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,971.561,973.275,Mr. Colborn.
1964.628,1,42523,theodore_r_colborn,,973.275,975.497,May it please the Court.
1964.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1242.148,1248.428,"If the whole transaction were within one taxable year, there wouldn’t be any practical difference from the government's point, if the government is right, would there be?"
1964.628,1,42523,theodore_r_colborn,,1248.428,1285.195,"In most cases, Mr. Justice Stewart not, but in certain unusual situations, the difference whether something comes in as interest income on an accrual basis or instead comes in from the gain of sale of a property which is not a capital asset does make a difference and to me, it’s extremely important in revealing that when Congress did legislate about this, that it had – as we all know many, many opportunities to legislate prior to 1954 and when it did, it did not say that this discount should be treated as interest."
1964.628,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1381.322,1388.077,How do you distinguish between -- or do you between the discount and premium?
1964.628,1,42523,theodore_r_colborn,,1388.077,1400.536,"Certainly in the proper treatment of it, I can see no reason for distinguishing the -- this Court in the --"
1964.628,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1400.536,1408.287,"Well the service in these two rulings -- when were they issued, that you said you mentioned at the end of your brief, when were they issued?"
1964.628,1,42523,theodore_r_colborn,,1408.287,1410.693,"1952, Sir."
1964.628,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1410.693,1422.889,"So, they were treating discount as a capital item whereas premium in at least many circumstances that that were being treated under the 42 statute as an income item."
1964.628,1,42523,theodore_r_colborn,,1424.199,1425.581,Forgive me Mr. Justice White.
1964.628,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1477.652,1486.47,"Now, what about the lender, the buyer who pays the premium?"
1964.628,1,42523,theodore_r_colborn,,1486.47,1520.44,"Well, the buyer of the bond or the lender of money who takes a note and receives a premium is making an investment, which he -- has denied by this Court in the earlier years, the right to apply in reduction of its interest income, Congress came along and said that you should be if the proper election is made, permitted to write it off over its life."
1964.628,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1530.589,1544.679,Well you say if -- what you’re -- you’re saying then that there really was no difference in treating the discounted premium say in 1952 when these rulings were issued?
1964.628,1,42523,theodore_r_colborn,,1544.679,1556.055,This is substantially right in 1952 and --
1964.628,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1556.055,1565.171,Well do they accept the law was changed on discount in the 1954 Act of – that they are now treated differently?
1964.628,1,42523,theodore_r_colborn,,1565.171,1581.543,"Well, there is a difference for example in the case of a non-registered bond without coupons as to which for a brief period there was no amortization of the premium allowed."
