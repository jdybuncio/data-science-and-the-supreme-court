1955.621,0,31547,joseph_s_lord_iii,,33.277,36.795,"May it please the Court, Your Honors."
1955.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,519.166,519.875,"Mr. Lord, it maybe merely --"
1955.621,0,31547,joseph_s_lord_iii,,519.875,520.592,"Yes, sir."
1955.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,520.592,535.369,"-- a matter of language, even the second paragraph under which Congress didn't reject as in employed in but at the time what constituted an employer."
1955.621,0,31547,joseph_s_lord_iii,,536.247,543.704,"As Your Honor said, I -- I think that is a matter of niceness but I think the distinction is of extreme importance."
1955.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,557.793,561.693,I'm not suggesting that the second paragraph is doing this.
1955.621,0,31547,joseph_s_lord_iii,,573.006,574.421,Transportation?
1955.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,574.421,577.391,(Inaudible) -- employed in such commerce.
1955.621,0,31547,joseph_s_lord_iii,,577.391,578.647,"Yes, sir."
1955.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,586.459,592.173,That's because it accepted the -- they accept it as to how that decision (Inaudible)
1955.621,0,31547,joseph_s_lord_iii,,592.173,599.156,"Well, sir, I'm not sure about that in view of the legislative history where they apparently accepted the Jones and Laughlin decision as controlling."
1955.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,599.156,599.593,Certainly.
1955.621,0,31547,joseph_s_lord_iii,,619.26,622.278,"Unquestionably, Your Honor, unquestionably."
1955.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,625.692,629.587,And this -- this doesn't offer difficulties disclosed in that (Inaudible)
1955.621,0,31547,joseph_s_lord_iii,,629.587,648.322,"But precisely what Congress did, it seems to me, is that the word commerce and the words interstate commerce as embodied in the 1939 amendment, actually embraced a different concept from the pre-1939 concept of interstate commerce."
1955.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,725.055,733.976,"Your argument could have (Inaudible) having no persuasiveness at least with me, that Congress can only use the first clause and stop there, period."
1955.621,0,31547,joseph_s_lord_iii,,733.976,739.697,"Sir, I think the legislative history maybe of importance in that."
1955.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,800.56,801.983,Here in the same boat.
1955.621,0,31547,joseph_s_lord_iii,,801.983,802.646,Sir.
1955.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,802.646,805.477,We are in the same lead insofar is that is --
1955.621,0,31547,joseph_s_lord_iii,,805.477,807.271,"But from a different viewpoint, sir."
1955.621,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,807.271,813.263,The record showed -- does the report of the hearing or anything show who drew the bill?
1955.621,0,31547,joseph_s_lord_iii,,813.263,814.174,Who drew the bill?
1955.621,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,814.174,816.42,Yes.
1955.621,0,31547,joseph_s_lord_iii,,816.42,828.236,"I don't believe, sir, that the -- there is anything in the report of the proceedings would show who actually framed the bill, at least not to my knowledge."
1955.621,1,43420,theodore_voorhees,,1831.78,1834.265,May it please the Court.
