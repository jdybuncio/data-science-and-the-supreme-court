1978.78-5384,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.883,We'll hear arguments in Sandstrom against Montana.
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,9.874,15.173,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-5384,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,85.118,110.516,"That has not prevented the courts generally from holding that the possession -- evidence of the possession of recently stolen property for example permits a jury to draw the inference that the possessor was also the thief, has it?"
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,110.516,142.874,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, but there is a difference between permitting a jury to infer and telling them that they are to presume or telling them that the law presumes and the difference is critical to the right for trial by jury upon proof beyond the reasonable doubt."
1978.78-5384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,142.874,155.938,"Mr. Boggs, I'm sure that all of us trained as lawyers would probably agree with you that there is a difference between the statement that “you may presume” and “you may infer.”"
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,161.339,180.764,I think that any juror or literate layperson knows the difference between the word “may” and the word “shall” or the difference between the word “may infer” and the phrase “the law presumes.”
1978.78-5384,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,299.724,306.882,"You don't find any fault with that kind of an instruction in the civil case, I take it although that question is not before us?"
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,306.882,312.129,I would see no fault with the instruction in a civil case Mr. Chief Justice.
1978.78-5384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,512.477,520.938,"Mr. Boggs, let me take you back once more to the instruction which you complain of which is I guess on the bottom of page 5 of your brief."
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,542.412,544.514,I don't think so.
1978.78-5384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,578.701,581.262,You'd have no objection to Instruction No. 9?
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,581.262,582.899,I have only one objection to it.
1978.78-5384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,590.655,606.749,"Counsel, I take it that this crime could have been proved if the jury found beyond reasonable doubt that he just knowingly as distinguishing purposefully causes death."
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,606.749,612.63,"Yes, knowingly in the sense that he was aware at that time."
1978.78-5384,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,612.638,618.572,But this Instruction No. 5 hasn't really any connection with that.
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,636.803,636.824,"Well, --"
1978.78-5384,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,636.824,639.484,Isn't it just in connection with purpose?
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,639.484,645.946,"It is most clearly identified with purpose, Mr. Justice White, but it would bother me as to knowingly also --"
1978.78-5384,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,645.946,646.63,Why would it have --
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,646.63,648.283,-- and for this reason.
1978.78-5384,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,648.283,652.189,"Well, I guess that -- I guess you can say that there was a general verdict here, wasn't there?"
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,655.01,655.847,That's true.
1978.78-5384,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,655.847,660.663,And if they found purposely you say this instruction is fatal to the case.
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,660.663,661.249,That's true.
1978.78-5384,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,661.249,662.295,Yes.
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,662.295,671.198,"But Mr. Justice White, if I could pursue that for a moment the crime is the liberate homicide."
1978.78-5384,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,673.812,677.962,Well maybe but the instruction told them what it was.
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,677.962,688.071,But the official code comment to the section states that this section deals only with acts done deliberately that is purposely or knowingly.
1978.78-5384,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,688.071,693.203,"That maybe but that isn't what the jury was told and you know, say that they told them wrong."
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,693.203,716.586,"No, I don't say that but what I'm trying to say is this, the concept of knowingly in the context of deliberate homicide must surely be that the individual has an awareness that he is causing the death at the time he is causing it in such circumstances as he might turn away from the consequence."
1978.78-5384,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,716.586,720.658,And you don't say -- you say knowingly and purposely then are the same?
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,720.658,722.069,They are certainly related.
1978.78-5384,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,722.069,729.929,"Well, they may be but certainly the instruction has defined them separately."
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,729.929,730.235,"Yes, the --"
1978.78-5384,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,730.235,734.648,The statutes define them separately.
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,734.648,744.263,I think there are two attempts at getting at the same concept albeit different evidence.
1978.78-5384,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,744.263,752.322,Does it purposely have some kind of notations of motivation to a greater extent than knowingly?
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,752.322,755.525,"Yes, I would agree with that Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.78-5384,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,755.525,759.469,So the -- it is appropriate to define them separately or not?
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,759.469,782.474,I don't disagree with that but I only say that the instruction -- the argument of course is not necessary for my position because if the jury followed the instruction and presumed purpose then they didn't have to ask themselves the question did he act knowingly?
1978.78-5384,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,938.039,942.879,Was this instruction given to the jury which you now read?
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,942.879,943.986,No.
1978.78-5384,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,943.986,947.723,"Well, I guess that's immaterial."
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,947.723,955.033,If there is any question as to how the public mind might interpret presumptions.
1978.78-5384,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,974.402,976.902,But how is that part of the jury?
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,985.293,988.025,We cannot assume that the jury knew what this rule was.
1978.78-5384,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,988.025,988.902,"Yes, that's what it mean."
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,988.902,992.867,"On the other hand, we cannot be sure that at least one of them didn't know that."
1978.78-5384,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,992.867,1015.872,"Well, is the subject of rebuttable presumptions in the legal context something that we would ever expect that generally known to the public members of the juries unless the judge has instructed them on it as Mr. Justice, my colleague has just suggested to you?"
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,1015.872,1023.649,I feel confident in saying Mr. Chief Justice that a jury is not going to know the convolutions and details of the law of rebuttable presumptions.
1978.78-5384,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1023.649,1029.52,"It's difficult and to offer them to grasp the ones they are instructed about, isn't it?"
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,1029.52,1034.02,I wouldn't think that this particular instruction would be difficult for them to grasp.
1978.78-5384,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1061.173,1077.96,And you don't think the Instructions 13 and 14 on the others that you must be convinced beyond the reasonable doubt offsets and takes care of this presumption?
1978.78-5384,0,17472,byron_w_boggs,,1077.96,1108.007,"No, I don't Mr. Chief Justice and I believe that the Montana Supreme Court itself in its second opinion in State of Montana v. McKenzie stated better than I could why that instruction would not cure the air contained in Instruction No. 5 and that is when they said that yes, the state carries the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt."
1978.78-5384,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1444.956,1448.937,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-5384,2,17472,byron_w_boggs,,2503.858,2510.909,If I may.
1978.78-5384,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2554.192,2570.149,"What operative effect does it have when the jury comes on and simply finds a verdict of deliberate homicide, no separate verdicts are requested as whether it was purposeful or deliberate, what operative effect does it have on your client?"
1978.78-5384,2,17472,byron_w_boggs,,2570.149,2572.745,"Well, this is the reason I wanted to pursue that point."
1978.78-5384,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2572.745,2573.205,Go ahead.
1978.78-5384,2,17472,byron_w_boggs,,2573.205,2578.281,"Because, I think it has due process implications."
1978.78-5384,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2578.281,2580.449,What I'm telling about is practical effect on your client.
1978.78-5384,2,17472,byron_w_boggs,,2580.449,2581.229,Yes.
1978.78-5384,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2650.722,2651.053,You don't have capital --
1978.78-5384,2,17472,byron_w_boggs,,2651.053,2652.129,-- 100 years.
