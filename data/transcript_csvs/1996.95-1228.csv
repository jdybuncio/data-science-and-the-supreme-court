1996.95-1228,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.798,"We'll hear argument next in Number 95-1228, United States v. Jerry Wells and Kenneth R. Steele."
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,23.317,27.08,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.95-1228,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,132.37,135.292,"With respect to that argument, I was thinking about hypotheticals."
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,148.83,152.473,"Assuming that it was a knowing false statement, if he was a Braves fan--"
1996.95-1228,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,152.473,152.964,--And it was knowingly false.
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,153.503,154.685,--Yes.
1996.95-1228,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,159.126,162.469,"Well, not theoretically, would be ccvered by your construction of the statute."
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,162.469,163.21,"--Yes, it would."
1996.95-1228,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,175.337,177.828,"They're mostly Yankee fans, we know."
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,178.039,179.949,"--Currently, yes."
1996.95-1228,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,224.318,236.407,"Well, I suppose under Gaudin, too, there would be a lot of 2255 proceedings in cases where the court had determined materiality for itself if... by people who had previously been convicted--"
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,236.407,236.898,That is--
1996.95-1228,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,236.898,239.8,--if we held materiality was a statutory requirement.
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,239.8,240.681,--That is exactly right.
1996.95-1228,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,273.292,281.687,"Mr. Dreeben, most courts of appeals have said materiality is an element, haven't they?"
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,283.119,283.828,--Yes.
1996.95-1228,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,283.828,286.169,And you say they're wrong.
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,286.169,286.53,Yes.
1996.95-1228,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,360.008,362.819,What was the jury instruction given here?
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,362.819,380.921,"The jury instruction given here, which is set forth at pages 42 and 43 of the Joint Appendix, informed the jury not that the court had found the statements to be material, I think it's important to emphasize that."
1996.95-1228,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,408.01,409.352,And where is that?
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,409.352,412.623,"That's on the prior page of the Joint Appendix, page 42."
1996.95-1228,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,435.108,439.819,"Now, no objection was made to these instructions?"
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,439.819,441.652,"Well, the defendant... the defendant did object."
1996.95-1228,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,450.658,457.062,But the Government was satisfied with the statement that it is... materiality is an element?
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,457.062,461.223,"--Justice O'Connor, I wouldn't describe the Government's position as satisfied."
1996.95-1228,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,485.671,488.532,"Well, so how's the question preserved here?"
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,488.532,500.009,--The question is preserved because when the case was decided in the court of appeals the Eighth Circuit received briefs from both parties before United States v. Gaudin was decided and heard oral argument.
1996.95-1228,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,552.763,554.705,And decided the question.
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,554.705,564.661,"--Exactly, decided on the merits that section 1014 requires proof of materiality in a binding circuitwide decision which we are challenging in this Court."
1996.95-1228,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,570.087,573.496,"Mr. Dreeben, I don't seem to have the instructions in front of me, but would you help me on this?"
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,580.672,581.133,Yes.
1996.95-1228,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,581.133,582.843,"It was, and the jury found that?"
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,582.843,583.203,Yes.
1996.95-1228,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,585.076,585.875,Mr. Dreeben--
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,628.604,637.26,"Well, Justice Scalia, we... I certainly agree that the instruction is not correct as we understand section 1014 to be read."
1996.95-1228,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,742.487,768.735,"But Mr. Dreeben, we don't have directed verdicts in criminal cases, and this judge in his instruction number 20, if you were sitting on the jury, wouldn't you think that the judge had made the determination that the representation was material, because the judge first says it must be material, and then he says, you don't worry about that, because that's for me to determine."
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,778.671,783.915,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think the jury could speculate that way, but the instruction doesn't say that."
1996.95-1228,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,790.459,792.2,"Well, but it says somewhat more than that."
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,795.993,798.363,That is true.
1996.95-1228,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,798.363,806.629,"So a knowledgeable jury, as I think Justice Ginsburg is suggesting, would say, well, materiality is important in this case, and it's been established."
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,806.629,808.612,I think--
1996.95-1228,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,808.612,811.954,"Suppose in this case the judge said, I instruct you as a matter of law that this is material."
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,814.466,817.167,--If materiality were an element of the crime--
1996.95-1228,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,817.167,823.221,"No, no, let's assume... let's assume that you prevail, and the question is whether or not the case has to go back."
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,823.221,823.481,--That's right.
1996.95-1228,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,866.581,871.704,Did the judge ever later tell the jury he had decided it was material?
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,871.704,873.596,"--Not that I'm aware of, Your Honor."
1996.95-1228,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,897.75,907.307,"If we were to rule in your favor on the materiality point, Mr. Dreeben, is the instruction point one that could be determined by the Eighth Circuit just as well as we could on remand?"
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,907.307,907.437,--Certainly.
1996.95-1228,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,922.998,926.592,Does the instruction become the law of the case somehow?
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,926.592,943.932,"There is some lower court authority to that effect, that an instruction can become the law of the case, and I think the issue here would have been for the Eighth Circuit, if it had chosen... it certainly wasn't required to... might have said the Government in this case charged materiality and requested--"
1996.95-1228,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,943.932,944.313,Right.
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,944.313,944.944,--materiality instruction.
1996.95-1228,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,945.933,946.403,Right.
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,946.403,949.866,"But the Eighth Circuit did not do that, and I do not think that the Eighth Circuit was required to do that."
1996.95-1228,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,951.786,952.767,Should we look at that?
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,952.767,953.128,--No.
1996.95-1228,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,956.521,956.942,Why not?
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,956.942,990.813,"--Because at most it would be a question of discretion for a court of appeals to decide whether it should conclude that the Government's posture in the district court precluded it from making the argument that it made on appeal, and I think that quite properly the Eighth Circuit in this case said before we find a constitutional violation based on the failure to have the jury decide materiality, we should at least be satisfied that the statute requires that to be proved, and it does not... none of the cases that respondent cited in this area of instructions becoming law of the case involved this kind of situation."
1996.95-1228,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,990.813,999.908,So we could say the circuit below was wrong but leave it open on the remand for that application of doctrine.
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,999.908,1009.185,"Well, I think the Eighth Circuit has crossed that bridge already, and has said that it is going to look at, on the merits, whether section 1014 requires proof of materiality."
1996.95-1228,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1054.685,1067.733,"May I ask another question about... I'm a little puzzled about the facts of this case, but the judge, I think, drew a distinction between statements and omissions, and he said an omission would not be false in his instruction unless it were of a material fact."
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1080.902,1096.29,"--My answer to that is no, Justice Stevens, but I need to explain what I think are the kinds of omissions that are covered by this statute, because this statute in its terms prohibits false statements or false reports."
1996.95-1228,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1285.166,1296.981,"Mr. Dreeben, if your interpretation of the law is correct, how should instruction number 20, which is on page 42 and 43 of the Joint Appendix, how should that have been trimmed?"
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1304.808,1308.851,"Well, first, Justice Ginsburg, there should be no reference to materiality at all."
1996.95-1228,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1355.091,1358.594,I would like to make sure I understand you correctly.
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1367.19,1372.252,"--Yes, that's correct, since materiality is not an element of the offense."
1996.95-1228,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1407.124,1414.511,I suppose if Congress wanted trivial misrepresentations prosecuted the courts would go... have to entertain those cases.
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1414.511,1427.336,"Well, that's certainly true also, Your Honor, and there's no question that Congress has the power, as it did in this case, to draft a broad prophylactic statute that accomplishes two main purposes without a materiality requirement."
1996.95-1228,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1431.901,1444.928,"Mr. Dreeben, do any of the statutes that you've cited to us earlier, which contain an explicit materiality requirement, do any of those also contain a purpose requirement?"
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1444.928,1446.19,"--Yes, some of them do."
1996.95-1228,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1449.502,1455.827,So the mere existence of a purpose requirement does not exclude the possibility of materiality being a requirement as well.
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1455.827,1456.716,That's right.
1996.95-1228,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1466.083,1467.274,May I ask one other question?
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1487.097,1492.289,"Typically they're longer, Justice Stevens, and the Government has a pending cross-appeal of the sentence in this case."
1996.95-1228,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1513.875,1515.387,"How long a term, do you remember?"
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1515.387,1520.63,"I believe it's between 26 and 31 months, but I'm not sure exactly what the range is."
1996.95-1228,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1520.63,1521.561,Thank you.
1996.95-1228,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1521.561,1522.072,Thank you.
1996.95-1228,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1523.232,1523.943,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,1525.783,1528.267,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1228,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1653.989,1656.979,"What is the last, including a direct statement that they were material?"
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,1656.979,1657.87,--That--
1996.95-1228,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1657.87,1658.421,By whom?
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,1660.142,1675.303,"--It is contained in Instruction 13, I believe, Your Honor, and in Instruction 15, in the instructions describing the offense and the indictment, those were set forth--"
1996.95-1228,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1675.303,1677.914,Thirteen and 15?
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,1677.914,1678.605,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1228,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1684.789,1686.71,Where--
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,1689.662,1691.343,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1996.95-1228,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1707.192,1708.264,--Where are you reading?
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,1708.865,1712.486,"That's paraphrased in the indictment, yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1996.95-1228,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1712.486,1713.477,What about the instructions?
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,1716.209,1721.762,"Well, on page 40, at paragraph (b), there is a statement to that effect."
1996.95-1228,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1730.408,1731.58,"Well, that's true in the indictment, isn't it?"
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,1731.921,1752.015,"It is true Justice... Mr. Justice Rehnquist that when the court submitted the instructions on the elements later on it only referred to material statements in terms of omission when it described the elements, that when it gave a general description, and it had to because much of this... much of these charges from the indictment had been... the court had granted an acquittal on."
1996.95-1228,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1756.487,1765.092,"--He didn't... no jury would have taken that as a finding by the judge that it was material, which is what I thought you were saying when you said it was in the instructions."
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,1765.092,1765.092,--We are--
1996.95-1228,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1765.092,1765.483,"The instruction begins, the crime of conspiracy as charged in Count I has four essential elements, which are, and then... you know, then he goes through the elements, and then he says that as part of four, who had joined in the agreement knowingly did one or more of the following acts, A, B, C."
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,1789.539,1790.22,"--Well, and--"
1996.95-1228,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1790.22,1791.111,--An instruction to the jury that--
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,1791.111,1792.491,--The jury--
1996.95-1228,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1792.491,1793.633,--materiality was proved.
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,1793.633,1802.188,"--Your Honor, the jury would have had to find one or more of these overt acts... this is at section 371... in order to--"
1996.95-1228,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1802.188,1808.523,"Well, do you have anything else besides what you've just read which would convince me that the judge told the jury that materiality was proved?"
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,1808.523,1809.632,--Was proven?
1996.95-1228,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1817.936,1821.689,"And that's just, don't pay any attention to it."
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,1821.689,1821.999,That's correct.
1996.95-1228,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1821.999,1822.049,Okay.
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,1822.049,1822.6,That's correct.
1996.95-1228,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1900.692,1906.368,"Well, but that was the law of the Eighth Circuit at the time, and the Government has a number of these prosecutions."
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,1912.709,1923.649,The Government subsequent to this case brought an indictment against one of our clients in the Western District of Missouri in which they did not allege that materiality was an element of section 1014.
1996.95-1228,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1945.621,1950.046,"Does the later indictment that you just referred to, was that after Gaudin?"
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,1950.046,1950.877,--It was after Gaudin.
1996.95-1228,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1950.877,1961.056,"Yes, but it would have been rather nervy for the prosecutor, given the law of the Eighth Circuit and before Gaudin, to go flatly against the law of the circuit in the indictment."
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,1961.056,1976.993,"The prosecutors did a prudent thing, but now, having done a prudent thing and not taken the bull by the horns, so to speak, and said this is what the Second Circuit is, we don't think we need to prove it, and so on, they should not now be permitted to say we want to retroactively say it is not an element--"
1996.95-1228,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1976.993,1977.294,Well--
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,1977.294,1978.776,"--when, in fact, that's what they indicted on."
1996.95-1228,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1978.776,1981.558,"--Well, the Eighth Circuit allowed them to do this."
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,1993.756,1996.317,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-1228,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1997.578,2001.511,And I suppose we don't have to even decide the question of prejudice here.
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2013.969,2015.13,--This Court would have that opportunity.
1996.95-1228,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2015.13,2015.219,Yes.
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2015.219,2032.702,"It could send it back to the Eighth Circuit and say, you determine whether these instructions were prejudicial, and if the Court were determined... or, to determine the issue that materiality is in fact not an element, then as the Government has properly said, it has to go back to the Eighth Circuit anyway because the Government wants a substantial sentence imposed in this case."
1996.95-1228,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2086.235,2096.232,"But may I ask, had any of the 10 statutes that did not have the materiality element expressly in the statute, had any of them been construed judicially to include such an element?"
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2096.232,2097.143,Not that I know of.
1996.95-1228,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2128.993,2130.766,But Kay did have the language in it.
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2152.141,2154.031,It could be read in that way.
1996.95-1228,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2171.292,2194.057,"But it's about the only indication that we have as to what any of those 10 statutes might mean, and I would suppose Congress could reasonably say, based on that language, dicta though it may be, that the statutes, in the absence of a material... or in the absence of an expressly stated element of materiality would not have one."
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2194.057,2215.921,"That is true, Your Honor, but I'd like to point out several things, one of which is that subsequently Congress has amended this statute many times, and has never come forward and said in a report or in any kind of a legislative history that materiality was not an element, despite the fact that some 10 circuits have said it is an element, and we think that's something for the Court to consider with respect--"
1996.95-1228,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2215.921,2218.313,"Well, but of course the text just doesn't include it."
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2218.313,2219.725,"--That's correct, but that--"
1996.95-1228,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2219.725,2221.916,And Congress may be aware of what it said.
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2221.916,2227.509,"--It may be aware of it, or it may not be aware of it, and we don't believe that Congress really intended that--"
1996.95-1228,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2227.509,2234.435,"We certainly have to assume, do we not, that our assumption must be that Congress knew what it was saying--"
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2234.435,2236.345,--I don't think we can make that assumption.
1996.95-1228,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2236.345,2239.069,--based on the language of the statute itself.
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2239.069,2245.201,"I don't think it... Justice O'Connor, that that ends the inquiry at all, because I don't think it's clear what Congress meant by it."
1996.95-1228,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2253.488,2264.374,"Well, why would you give more credence to a legislative history or a report than the actual language that Congress has used, which was to omit a requirement that had been present in some of the other statutes?"
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2264.374,2283.488,"--I think that that may be precisely the point, Mr. Chief Justice, because I'm not certain in my own mind that this legislative history indicates one way or the other, but the fact that when we look at the statute then without the history contains no element of materiality did not end the inquiry."
1996.95-1228,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2306.111,2313.396,In Green v. Bach Laundry we found the provision would have been absurd without implying a statutory requirement.
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2313.396,2313.626,--That's correct.
1996.95-1228,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2313.626,2314.778,This one wouldn't be absurd.
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2314.778,2315.529,It would be absurd.
1996.95-1228,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2365.411,2369.375,"Well, the falsity has to be for the purpose of influencing, not the statement."
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2369.375,2370.898,"Well, the--"
1996.95-1228,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2370.898,2384.746,"It has to be the misrepresentation that is for the purpose of influencing to grant the loan, and certainly understating your income is not likely to cause the bank to grant you the loan."
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2384.746,2405.108,"--If you understate your income and you agree with the Government that an omission is also part of this statute, and the bank concludes that you lied about it for some reason, for instance, you say I didn't lie about it for purposes of getting this loan, I lied about it because I'm in a divorce action, a different purpose, the Government still makes its case under that example."
1996.95-1228,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2407.462,2409.222,"Well, that's true, it is rather an absurd example."
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2443.363,2455.522,"--Because if the concepts are different, and if, in fact, the statement made about, you know, the Yankee example that was given there earlier, if that, in fact... does the Government have the opportunity in that instance to prosecute?"
1996.95-1228,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2459.666,2462.918,My actual point is the same as Justice Scalia's on that one.
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2462.918,2470.782,"--Well, I understand that, but I still say that if the concepts are different no one should be subject to harsh penalties, which is what many of the courts of appeals have said."
1996.95-1228,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2483.632,2496.942,"Well, a bad intent to influence the bank plus a false statement made to the bank, well, that may be a somewhat harsh statute in your view, but it's certainly not ridiculous or absurd."
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2502.245,2505.056,"If they had said that, Mr. Justice... Mr. Chief Justice--"
1996.95-1228,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2505.056,2507.668,"Well, perhaps the way they said it was to omit the word materiality."
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2507.668,2510.87,"--Perhaps they did, but perhaps they didn't, and we can't tell from this legislative--"
1996.95-1228,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2510.87,2533.284,"Well, what is the difference here and in the Kay case, where the Court said that it doesn't lie with someone who has knowingly made a false statement with intent to mislead, then to argue that the information wasn't important, that Congress was entitled to require the information be given truthfully and without intent to mislead?"
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2533.284,2550.644,"--That language can be construed to mean that the Court said that there was no materiality element with respect to that statute, but if you go on and read exactly what the Court held, which was... and this is how subsequent courts of appeals have read that decision... they read that decision as meaning actual damage is not an element in the case."
1996.95-1228,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2690.477,2692.828,"Yes, but this statute does contain a mens rea element."
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2693.759,2695.16,It does--
1996.95-1228,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2695.16,2696.562,You just want to add to it.
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2696.562,2708.159,"--We want to simply indicate that it is subject to a reasonableness requirement, Justice O'Connor, and it is subject to... and that reasonableness requirement in this instance is that it be material, and that the statements be material."
1996.95-1228,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2736.827,2754.269,"Are you suggesting, then, that in order for Congress to make this take out the element of materiality it would have to negate that expressly by saying, and materiality is not an element of this offense, because if it doesn't negate it then the courts will imply it?"
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2755.591,2780.595,"--I believe so, and I don't have the citation in the case in our briefs, but there was a case, and I think Justice Scalia offered the opinion as to whether or not a statute, what it required in the way of attorney fees, and I think that there was a '38 case, and there was an amendment in '46, and I think that the decision was, well, they must have meant this is the meaning of that term, because in fact there is a 1938 case and then a report with respect to this statute."
1996.95-1228,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2816.191,2820.753,"Well, I mean, either way, the Government... it doesn't prove the Government's case, but it certainly neutralizes your point."
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2830.1,2831.61,They said no substantive change.
1996.95-1228,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2831.61,2832.301,That can't be correct.
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2855.087,2855.616,That's correct.
1996.95-1228,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2855.616,2857.198,We don't know that.
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2857.198,2875.751,"In the Shabani case, which the Government has urged this Court to follow, there was a statement in that opinion that... to the effect that one of the canons of construction is to look at the common law, and what common law there has been, certainly since these folks were prosecuted, has been that 10 circuits have said that materiality is in fact an element."
1996.95-1228,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2875.751,2879.622,Is that common law or is that statutory construction?
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2879.622,2894.241,"I think it can be construed probably more as statutory construction, but in one of these cases, and I believe it was the Williams case, Mr. Chief Justice, they expressly referred to Coke and Blackstone in the common law, and they said at common law materiality was, in fact, an element."
1996.95-1228,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2894.241,2894.922,But I--
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2894.922,2897.215,"So I think it was both, at least under that Williams case."
1996.95-1228,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2897.215,2911.454,"--Do I remember correctly that you had earlier said, I think it was in response to a question of Justice Scalia, earlier said that none of the 10 had in fact been construed to require materiality?"
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2911.454,2914.877,I think one of the 10 under the Kay case had been construed--
1996.95-1228,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2914.877,2916.306,Not to require.
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2916.306,2917.698,--as not re--
1996.95-1228,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2917.698,2918.778,"Right, and the others--"
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2918.778,2919.459,--That was the--
1996.95-1228,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2919.459,2921.579,"--had not been construed on the point of issue at all, had they?"
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2922.71,2923.892,"--Yes, that's correct--"
1996.95-1228,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2923.892,2924.312,--Okay.
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2924.312,2926.162,"--Justice, to the best of our knowledge."
1996.95-1228,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2937.061,2950.008,"So you have only one case which comes out the other way, and yet you maintain that all of those statutes have a subterranean materiality requirement."
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,2950.008,2953.21,"Well, we're not going that far in our case."
1996.95-1228,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3072.609,3075.141,"That's what I don't quite understand, if you're going back to that."
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,3100.576,3102.519,We believe that the--
1996.95-1228,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3102.519,3102.91,What is the prejudice?
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,3102.91,3107.351,"--if the Government's correct, that purpose necessarily involves the issue of materiality or prejudice."
1996.95-1228,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3118.598,3119.299,But purpose was not.
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,3119.299,3120.601,--Purpose was not--
1996.95-1228,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3120.601,3121.27,"Purpose was not part, so--"
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,3121.27,3122.151,--on the false statement part.
1996.95-1228,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3122.151,3129.778,"--Yes, all right, but where's the prejudice, if in fact the judge was right in not giving the materiality issue to the jury, but for the wrong reason?"
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,3131.951,3147.52,"We urge you not go beyond the purpose requirement, but on the false statement requirement, because the definition of false statement would have required it be material, when the court took that away from the jury, it took away from them the determination as to whether or not these statements were false."
1996.95-1228,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3147.52,3152.725,If you're wrong about whether materiality is an issue of the part of the statute--
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,3152.725,3153.055,Yes.
1996.95-1228,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3153.055,3160.408,"--If you're wrong about that, what prejudice did your client suffer from the judge having mentioned it when he didn't let the jury decide it?"
1996.95-1228,1,33594,james_r_wyrsch,,3160.408,3161.45,"First of all, in two ways."
1996.95-1228,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3207.041,3209.773,"Thank you, Mr. Wyrsch, your time has expired."
