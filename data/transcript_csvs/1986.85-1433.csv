1986.85-1433,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.956,"We'll hear argument now in No. 85-1433, Gloria Richardson against Clarissa Marsh."
1986.85-1433,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,14.843,17.795,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-1433,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,631.843,639.162,"May I ask, just so you don't overlook it, are you going to address the problem about the prosecutor's argument which purported to tie the--"
1986.85-1433,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,639.162,641.531,"--Yes, I will, Your Honor."
1986.85-1433,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,730.506,735.16,"--Mr. Baughman, on that point, it really is pretty obvious she was involved in some of the advanced planning."
1986.85-1433,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,755.906,757.64,"No, there's no other evidence of that in this case."
1986.85-1433,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,757.64,758.056,Okay.
1986.85-1433,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,765.945,768.881,"I think not, and particularly given the nature of the charge in this case."
1986.85-1433,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,782.641,787.009,"Well, the state didn't have to rely on the confession to put the defendant in the car."
1986.85-1433,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,789.211,790.261,That's correct.
1986.85-1433,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,795.365,801.018,"Well, it needs the confession to establish what conversation had gone on in the car."
1986.85-1433,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,801.018,805.32,"The confession was the only evidence of the conversation in the car and what its contents were, that's correct."
1986.85-1433,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,805.32,816.545,"And if you accept her testimony at face value... and of course, it may or may not have been true... that she was in the back seat and there was a radio on, I suppose it is credible that she might not have heard that particular remark."
1986.85-1433,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,816.545,818.73,That... it is credible.
1986.85-1433,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,821.516,828.42,"And if the person who made the remark had been on the stand and cross-examined, he might have confirmed that the radio was on and she was in the back seat."
1986.85-1433,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,829.436,832.205,"That's correct, we don't know."
1986.85-1433,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,878.084,887.272,"Your point is that, even if there were no evidence of her advance knowledge of a plan to kill, as opposed to just advance knowledge of a plan to rob, that she still could have been convicted of the same crime?"
1986.85-1433,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,887.272,887.955,Absolutely.
1986.85-1433,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,887.955,888.874,I see.
1986.85-1433,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,888.874,904.734,"If there had never been a confession in this case by anyone, Cynthia Knighton's testimony would have been ample to convict her of the crime."
1986.85-1433,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1028.865,1031.166,Did you make this argument earlier?
1986.85-1433,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1032.534,1033.769,--It was not made in the lower courts.
1986.85-1433,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1033.769,1037.471,You haven't tried to get this in as admissible against the defendant?
1986.85-1433,0,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1037.471,1038.088,No.
1986.85-1433,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1084.817,1086.035,"Thank you, Mr. Baughman."
1986.85-1433,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1093.456,1096.225,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-1433,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1172.139,1175.091,"But I don't see how... on its face, it's certainly perfectly credible."
1986.85-1433,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1186.131,1212.383,"Well, in the context of the summation, I think it's important to be clear that prior to this particular remark by the prosecutor in summation he had been going through various parts of her testimony and the other evidence at trial to show that in fact she did know about a plan in advance: that she had used, for example, coded language that matched others, language that various of the other confederates had used."
1986.85-1433,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1212.383,1214.349,"Yes, that would all go to the general plan."
1986.85-1433,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1223.923,1226.375,I don't... I'm afraid I beg to differ.
1986.85-1433,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1275.189,1276.306,"Well, it's certainly consistent with that."
1986.85-1433,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1284.912,1289.866,"There may be, Justice Stevens, a number of available inferences from any piece of proof."
1986.85-1433,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1306.16,1315.266,"But you would have to agree, I think, that if she heard that remark in the car before she went in, then it's terribly powerful evidence that she knew in advance someone was going to get killed."
1986.85-1433,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1316.966,1321.504,It is powerful evidence if the jury disobeyed its instructions.
1986.85-1433,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1322.42,1328.841,"Well, why did the prosecutor make the argument... I'm sorry, in our dialogue I lost the force of your argument."
1986.85-1433,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1334.328,1343.683,"Well, I think what he had been doing at that point in the transcript... and I'm referring now to the transcript at page 452, the summation."
1986.85-1433,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1359.129,1363.331,And then he calls the jury's attention to the fact that that particular statement was made in the confession.
1986.85-1433,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1363.331,1363.881,--I'm sorry?
1986.85-1433,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1363.881,1368.651,Then he calls the jury's attention to the fact that that particular incident took place while she was in the car.
1986.85-1433,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1372.937,1378.691,"Well, he drew the jury's attention to the fact that she put herself in the car."
1986.85-1433,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1378.691,1383.327,Right after he was talking about the evidence concerning the plan.
1986.85-1433,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1383.327,1383.894,That's true.
1986.85-1433,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1383.894,1387.962,"I'm sorry, I'm taking up more of your time than I should."
1986.85-1433,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1387.962,1412.347,The bottom line I think is that compared in particular to the kinds of cases in which courts have justifiably chastised prosecutors for making that impermissible link... and I'd suggest as a good comparison the Second Circuit's decision in U.S. against Rodriguez in 555 F. 2d at 316 to 317 is an example that really makes this case pale by comparison.
1986.85-1433,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1500.053,1507.808,How about all of the difference when they're being tried together and the jury knows that they both are charged with the same crime?
1986.85-1433,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1507.808,1508.808,"--Well, Justice Marshall, I think--"
1986.85-1433,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1508.808,1510.177,"You recognize that, don't you?"
1986.85-1433,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1510.177,1511.01,"--I'm sorry, Justice Marshall?"
1986.85-1433,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1511.01,1513.295,"You recognize that as a fact, don't you?"
1986.85-1433,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1513.295,1518.431,The fact that the jury knows that they are both charged together is of course true.
1986.85-1433,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1518.431,1521.149,And that the confession is about that crime.
1986.85-1433,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1521.149,1522.501,That's true as well.
1986.85-1433,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1524.068,1527.389,"Well, I mean, don't we have to recognize that as a fact?"
1986.85-1433,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1527.389,1533.376,"--It is a factor, of course, that the defendants have been charged together and sit at counsel table together."
1986.85-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1633.056,1634.241,Obvious from what?
1986.85-1433,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1637.693,1641.912,"Well, the answer is it depends."
1986.85-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1659.19,1664.443,"Once you say that, you're stating nothing but the condition for conviction anyway."
1986.85-1433,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1680.287,1681.889,"I don't believe that's true, Justice Scalia."
1986.85-1433,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1742.511,1743.48,"Thank you, Mr. Robbins."
1986.85-1433,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1744.913,1745.596,Thank you.
1986.85-1433,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1745.596,1756.12,"We'll hear now from you, Mr. Whalen."
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,1756.12,1759.222,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-1433,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1776.351,1783.355,"Well, from your point of view you have to say viewed in the context of the evidence given by the defendant herself in this case."
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,1783.355,1800.649,"Actually, Mr. Chief Justice, if you look at the facts of this case you'll see that before the defendant Clarissa Marsh ever testified, there was in fact testimony from the prosecutor's case that linked Ms. Marsh to being present in the car."
1986.85-1433,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1825.015,1833.77,"But that's only a linkage by implication, whereas your client testified in fact she was in the back seat of the car."
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,1833.77,1838.924,"--True, that Ms. Marsh's testimony leaves no question."
1986.85-1433,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1841.959,1844.392,"Well, it isn't just an inference; it's a fact."
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,1844.392,1868.857,"The problem that I see is that in giving that testimony she found herself in a situation which I believe you alluded to, Mr. Chief Justice, in Parker, which is where an inference is created prior to her testimony here linking Cynthia Knighton's testimony that they entered the house together to Williams' statement."
1986.85-1433,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1959.664,1963.766,The trouble with that is you can't tell at the outset of the trial.
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,1975.424,1984.096,"Well, Justice Scalia, in our case, for example, I think the prosecutor should have been aware of the great potential for--"
1986.85-1433,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1984.096,1986.048,"Well, I'm not talking about your case for example."
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,2013.282,2021.971,"--I think superficially that looks like a workable rule, but it ignores what the Sixth Circuit in this case termed the true incriminating effect of the evidence."
1986.85-1433,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2043.385,2044.401,It's not a perfect world.
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,2080.156,2087.576,"Because, Justice Scalia, in this corner the end result is that the defendant is denied the right of confrontation."
1986.85-1433,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2287.685,2304.631,"Mr. Whalen, do you agree with your adversary that if she merely were in on the planning of the robbery and then there were the killings by her co-defendants in the course of the robbery, she could have been convicted of precisely the same offense?"
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,2304.631,2307.932,"No, I don't agree with that."
1986.85-1433,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2323.475,2324.092,Planning of the robbery.
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,2324.092,2326.96,--I think there's circumstantial evidence of planning of the robbery.
1986.85-1433,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2398.758,2403.31,I think you've gone past... maybe... I'm not sure you answered the precise question I asked.
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,2418.82,2420.756,--The jury--
1986.85-1433,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2420.756,2422.208,And maybe the weight would be different.
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,2422.691,2423.874,--The jury would be permitted to draw that inference.
1986.85-1433,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2423.874,2424.341,Yes.
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,2432.563,2433.746,"Theoretically possible, yes."
1986.85-1433,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2433.746,2435.598,All right.
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,2435.598,2439.217,"Again, the point I would make is that--"
1986.85-1433,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2439.217,2448.941,"More precisely, even if they didn't think she specifically intended that anyone would die, but she did specifically intend that the robbery would go forward with the risk of death."
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,2448.941,2453.06,--If the jury believe that the killings were a foreseeable consequence.
1986.85-1433,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2453.06,2453.527,Correct.
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,2453.527,2455.779,Yes.
1986.85-1433,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2560.428,2563.046,Did your client request a severance in this case?
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,2563.046,2570.617,"Yes, she did, Your Honor, before trial."
1986.85-1433,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2601.088,2605.223,"Mr. Whalen, let me ask you one other thing that troubles me about your argument in the case."
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,2634.642,2642.046,"--But I thin what we have to ask, Justice Stevens, is that what if the jury didn't draw that inference, what if they didn't believe that."
1986.85-1433,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2643.598,2650.086,"Because it is clear, is it not, that your client was the only one who knew the victim?"
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,2650.086,2650.452,That's clear.
1986.85-1433,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2654.973,2673.767,"Mr. Whalen, let's assume that I thought that a redacted confession would normally be okay, but I felt that the comment of the prosecutor in his summation undid what the redaction had achieved."
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,2691.229,2699.252,"The defendant, through the motion for severance and through the motion to exclude the statement, had already been ruled against by the trial judge."
1986.85-1433,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2704.838,2719.598,"Yes, but you have an additional factor coming in that, as you argue before us, makes the connection between the confession and your client much clearer, to wit, the statement by the prosecutor."
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,2725.819,2734.775,"Well, Justice Scalia, whether it was or not, of course, I don't think is critical in this case."
1986.85-1433,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2935.239,2939.858,"Well, life goes on in Philadelphia, too, doesn't it, where they don't do that?"
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,2939.858,2949.714,"Well, life goes on, but unfortunately life goes on without the confrontation clause in these joint trials."
1986.85-1433,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2949.714,2951.18,I daresay the citizens scarcely know it.
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,2951.18,2958.486,"My point, Justice Rehnquist, was that the rule is workable in at least four Circuits."
1986.85-1433,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2958.486,2964.473,"Well, and I suppose people on the other side would say that the Third Circuit rule is equally ""workable""."
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,2964.473,2969.108,"Oh, there's no question that it's workable, in the sense that it's easy to apply."
1986.85-1433,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2979.166,2981.601,You say the Second Circuit's rule is workable.
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,2999.647,3002.681,The test I'm proposing is that--
1986.85-1433,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3002.681,3006.483,"What we have come to call a totality of the circumstances test, right, which--"
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,3006.483,3007.366,--That's what I would call it.
1986.85-1433,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3007.366,3008.252,--That's not a test.
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,3012.62,3034.467,"The test I would propose is that suggested in the ABA standards in joinder and severance: Faced with a pretrial defense motion to sever or to exclude the confession, the prosecutor then has the election of proceeding in any number of ways: joint trial, separate trial, separate juries, redaction."
1986.85-1433,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3041.537,3043.489,"Well, why should that be?"
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,3065.801,3080.476,"Well, I agree that what we should do is go ahead and let the jury decide the question of guilt or innocence, but let them do so in circumstances which guarantee the trustworthiness of the verdict."
1986.85-1433,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3100.14,3119.785,"Yes, but all I'm suggesting is that you're saying that it's argued on both sides different rules could be adopted, and you're opting for a rule which would be applied by hindsight at the close of the trial, when the severance decision is made before trial, the prosecutor's decisions as to introducing evidence are made at the beginning of trial."
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,3128.057,3144.253,"Why couldn't the prosecutor in our case have been held to the burden of foreseeing through his own testimony, through Cynthia Knighton's testimony and through the statement, that there was a great risk?"
1986.85-1433,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3223.601,3226.735,"Well, did you raise the question of the sufficiency of the evidence in the Michigan courts?"
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,3226.735,3227.921,"Yes, I did."
1986.85-1433,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3227.921,3228.887,And how did they rule?
1986.85-1433,2,40710,r_steven_whalen,,3228.887,3235.575,"The Michigan courts ruled against me in that question, although they noted that it was a close question."
1986.85-1433,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3273.3,3275.818,"Thank you, Mr. Whalen."
1986.85-1433,3,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,3279.704,3282.056,"Very briefly, Your Honor, two quick points."
1986.85-1433,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3302.386,3304.57,"Mr. Baughman... am I saying your name... ""Boffman""?"
1986.85-1433,3,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,3304.57,3305.821,"""Boffman"", that's correct."
1986.85-1433,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3305.821,3314.11,What would the purpose of an objection by the defense have been?
1986.85-1433,3,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,3314.11,3315.66,To the prosecutor's statement?
1986.85-1433,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3315.66,3316.093,"Yes, to the prosecutor's statement."
1986.85-1433,3,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,3317.229,3322.383,He could have asked for a further cautionary instruction or he could have asked for a mistrial at that point.
1986.85-1433,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3329.787,3331.62,"Well, a further cautionary instruction would do not good."
1986.85-1433,3,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,3342.095,3343.245,--And I think that--
1986.85-1433,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3343.245,3348.182,So the only thing it could have achieved is you get a mistrial sooner rather than later.
1986.85-1433,3,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,3348.182,3350.099,"--That is correct, I believe."
1986.85-1433,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3384.838,3385.905,"Thank you, Mr. Baughman."
