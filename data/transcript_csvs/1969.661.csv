1969.661,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.714,"Number 661, Hellenic Lines against Rhoditis."
1969.661,0,30184,james_m_estabrook,,12.212,13.351,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1969.661,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,201.446,208.267,"Well, is this not a situation which fluctuates from time to time depending on the demands for shipping?"
1969.661,0,30184,james_m_estabrook,,208.267,209.423,Of course it does.
1969.661,1,32895,joseph_b_stahl,,1764.526,1766.224,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please this honorable --
1969.661,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1766.224,1767.638,Mr. Stahl.
1969.661,1,32895,joseph_b_stahl,,1767.638,1768.939,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1969.661,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1857.541,1860.064,"That's the end of (Inaudible), you mean the owner of the ship?"
1969.661,1,32895,joseph_b_stahl,,1860.064,1860.781,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.661,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1861.238,1863.491,Where was the ship built?
1969.661,1,32895,joseph_b_stahl,,1863.491,1870.154,"Some of them in Japan, some of them in Germany, some of them I believe in this country."
1969.661,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1876.266,1879.617,Are any of them -- are any of them American built ships?
1969.661,1,32895,joseph_b_stahl,,1879.617,1887.717,"Yes, the very first five ships he bought were American Liberty ships which incidentally he bought from the United States Government."
1969.661,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1887.717,1889.275,I don't think an individual owned those ships.
1969.661,1,32895,joseph_b_stahl,,1895.954,1897.53,That is correct.
1969.661,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1897.76,1900.527,So an individual doesn't own a ship.
1969.661,1,32895,joseph_b_stahl,,1900.527,1901.316,The corporation --
1969.661,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1901.316,1901.575,-- owns the ship.
1969.661,1,32895,joseph_b_stahl,,1901.575,1904.193,The registered owner is a Panamanian corporation --
1969.661,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1904.193,1907.193,"Hellenic Lines Limited is the owner of the ships, am I correct?"
1969.661,1,32895,joseph_b_stahl,,1907.193,1909.271,"Not the registered owner, no, Your Honor."
1969.661,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1909.271,1911.025,Universal Cargo Carriers?
1969.661,1,32895,joseph_b_stahl,,1911.025,1915.605,"Yes, it's potentially Universal Cargo Carriers Corporation which is a Panamanian corporation."
1969.661,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1923.211,1924.512,99 and what?
1969.661,1,32895,joseph_b_stahl,,1924.512,1925.874,Just 99%.
1969.661,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1925.874,1927.644,He only owns 99%.
1969.661,1,32895,joseph_b_stahl,,1927.644,1929.198,That's all.
1969.661,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1929.198,1929.766,He is a -- he is a --
1969.661,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1929.766,1932.019,What's Panama have to do with it?
1969.661,1,32895,joseph_b_stahl,,1932.019,1938.98,Absolutely nothing except that is a symbol of convenience for this man because apparently of its lax shipping laws.
1969.661,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1938.98,1949.357,"You have to be an American citizen at organizing corporation, 99% of the stock and what do they do for Panama, what they get from Panama?"
1969.661,1,32895,joseph_b_stahl,,1949.357,1957.003,He registered the ownership of 19 of 22 of his United States line of service vessels to a Panamanian corporation.
1969.661,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1957.003,1959.009,How long has he been a resident of this country?
1969.661,1,32895,joseph_b_stahl,,1959.009,1966.692,25 years and he's been a domiciliary for that long and for the last 19 he has had permanent resident alien status.
1969.661,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1966.692,1969.498,Who is the owner of this other 1% of the stock?
1969.661,1,32895,joseph_b_stahl,,1969.498,1972.603,"His son who also lives here, a Mr. Gregory."
1969.661,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1972.603,1973.976,Where does his son live?
1969.661,1,32895,joseph_b_stahl,,1973.976,1977.103,Also in New York.
1969.661,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1977.103,1978.892,"He's not an American citizen, is he?"
1969.661,1,32895,joseph_b_stahl,,1978.892,1980.896,I don't believe his son is either although the --
1969.661,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1980.896,1981.774,Neither one is?
1969.661,1,32895,joseph_b_stahl,,1981.774,1983.222,"Neither one are American citizens, that is correct."
1969.661,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1983.222,1985.977,"They're both Greek nationals, aren't they?"
1969.661,1,32895,joseph_b_stahl,,1985.977,1987.448,I would not call them nationals.
1969.661,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1991.135,1995.908,"Well, where did they get a passport if they want to travel?"
1969.661,1,32895,joseph_b_stahl,,1995.908,1999.752,"Well, I'm not familiar with the regulations for foreign travel, Your Honor."
1969.661,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1999.752,2003.111,But they are Greek nationals who were domiciled in the United States.
1969.661,1,32895,joseph_b_stahl,,2006.121,2011.812,"Well, it is but I argue that the domicile in the United States in this case --"
1969.661,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2011.812,2017.649,"Well, you may argue the significance of the domicile but that doesn't change the fact that he's a Greek national."
1969.661,1,32895,joseph_b_stahl,,2017.649,2018.142,"No, Your Honor."
1969.661,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2018.785,2023.297,He's a Greek national who chooses to live in this country with his family.
1969.661,1,32895,joseph_b_stahl,,2023.297,2025.841,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,3750.805,3752.99,"I think I have a couple of minutes, Your Honor."
1969.661,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3825.033,3833.399,"Mr. Estabrook, are they part of the reason for the large number of Greek seaman be the factor that there are cheaper labor?"
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,3833.399,3841.487,"One -- one of the points, things Your Honor, there are over 100,000 Greek seamen and one of the largest groups of seamen in the world and I think the principal --"
1969.661,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3841.487,3848.948,"Well, is the standard wages for Greek seamen equal to that of the United States, the answer is no."
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,3848.948,3849.822,Of course not.
1969.661,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3852.787,3855.629,But we're dealing with the United States here.
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,3855.629,3858.276,It is lower and --
1969.661,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3858.276,3860.29,Does he pay taxes in Greece?
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,3860.29,3862.071,"Yes, he does, Your Honor."
1969.661,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3862.071,3870.883,"And does he pay on these insurance policies over there, working compensation clauses, or do the seamen pay that?"
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,3870.883,3873.055,He pays on -- he pays that there.
1969.661,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3873.055,3875.237,I thought you said the seamen pay them.
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,3875.237,3884.74,"The seamen -- no, the seamen contribute and he contributes to a seaman's pension fund, NAT, N-A-T."
1969.661,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3884.74,3884.935,Oh!
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,3886.105,3887.433,"No, that's not involved here."
1969.661,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3891.887,3896.79,But do you agree that he will end up with a $160.00 he got if he went back to Greece?
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,3896.79,3897.922,He'll get more than that Your Honor.
1969.661,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3897.922,3899.675,How much?
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,3899.675,3901.07,I don't know.
1969.661,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3901.07,3903.279,165?
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,3903.279,3905.243,No.
1969.661,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3939.848,3942.681,He gets paid while he's working?
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,3942.681,3945.045,He gets paid while he's disabled.
1969.661,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3945.045,3946.134,But he's working now?
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,3946.134,3946.769,He's working now.
1969.661,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3948.602,3951.6,So what would he get now?
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,3952.977,3954.489,"No, he'd get more than that."
1969.661,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3954.964,3956.355,But you don't know how much more?
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,3956.355,3961.365,I don't know how much more and if there's any -- I don't -- this Court found no disability so he'd get --
1969.661,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3961.365,3969.877,Couldn't I assume from the fact that you're defending this case that there would be more?
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,3969.877,3972.949,We're defending this case because as a matter of principle --
1969.661,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3972.949,3973.416,I see.
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,3973.416,3974.671,-- he'd get more.
1969.661,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3981.542,3989.88,"But you would be making the same argument whether the -- suppose that this individual was a Greek or an American, wouldn't you?"
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,3989.88,3991.145,"On this ship, yes."
1969.661,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3991.287,4002.291,"So it's really irrelevant about the allegiance of the majority stockholder of this corporation, your argument would be the same?"
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,4002.291,4002.64,That's right.
1969.661,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4004.527,4011.232,And you're -- and the owner of the ship anyway is a Panamanian corporation?
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,4011.232,4014.913,All of the stock of which is owned by a Greek Corporation.
1969.661,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4014.913,4018.792,By a Greek Corporation and 99% of which is owned by --
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,4018.792,4021.22,A Greek citizen domiciled in this country.
1969.661,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4021.22,4028.562,"But those things are really irrelevant, aren't they, to your argument because as long as the ship is registered in Greece --"
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,4028.562,4029.101,That's right.
1969.661,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4029.101,4031.561,-- carrying the foreign flag and a Greek crew --
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,4031.561,4032.093,Yes.
1969.661,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4032.093,4034.791,-- it's irrelevant to your argument who the owner is.
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,4034.791,4037.848,"That's -- yes, that follows the argument in the McCulloch."
1969.661,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4046.622,4049.611,You say there are no such things as flags of convenience.
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,4049.611,4055.234,I say there are many flags of convenience but this isn't one of them.
1969.661,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4055.234,4056.911,This isn't one of them because --
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,4056.911,4063.153,Because of the fact the Greek Government is responsible for the good order and maintenance of the ship.
1969.661,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4071.721,4076.049,And that -- and that anybody from anywhere around the world can go and --
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,4076.049,4076.843,"No, no."
1969.661,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4076.843,4084.865,"And get -- and get their ships that are -- that may be built abroad, owned abroad and licensed in Greece?"
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,4084.865,4085.879,"No, Your Honor."
1969.661,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4096.557,4098.001,"It is not true here though, is it?"
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,4098.001,4099.02,"Yes, it is."
1969.661,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4099.02,4105.265,I thought you said 99% was owned by one man who lives in this country --
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,4105.265,4105.591,And is a Greek citizen.
1969.661,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4105.591,4107.745,And 1% by his son.
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,4107.745,4110.778,"No, I will say that 99% --"
1969.661,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4110.778,4111.158,What?
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,4111.158,4114.953,I will say that 99% was owned by one man --
1969.661,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4114.953,4115.773,In this country?
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,4115.773,4118.515,A Greek citizen with allegiance to Greece.
1969.661,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4118.741,4120.216,But he lives in this country.
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,4120.216,4120.837,"Yes, he does."
1969.661,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4120.837,4122.546,And did his business in this country?
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,4122.546,4123.772,"Yes, but he is a Greek citizen."
1969.661,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4123.772,4125.52,Had been living here many years?
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,4125.52,4126.459,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.661,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4126.459,4129.455,May I ask you just one other question about the contract?
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,4150.392,4153.145,"Under the Jones Act, it would not be valid."
1969.661,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4153.145,4154.063,It would not be valid.
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,4154.063,4156.376,There's a specific provision of the Jones Act.
1969.661,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4156.376,4157.152,That's right.
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,4157.152,4157.843,Yes.
1969.661,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4157.843,4159.953,"Alright, that's I wanted to know."
1969.661,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4159.953,4161.136,"Thank you, Mr. Estabrook."
1969.661,2,30184,james_m_estabrook,,4161.136,4161.688,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1969.661,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4161.688,4162.566,"Thank you, Mr. Stahl."
