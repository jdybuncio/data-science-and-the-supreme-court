2018.17-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.96,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 17-571, Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corporation versus Wall-Street.com. Mr. Panner."
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,8.96,52.44,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: The Copyright Act provides strong textual evidence that the phrase ""registration has been made"" in Section 411(a) refers to the copyright owner's compliance with the registration requirement of Section 408(a). That reading is confirmed by the legislative history, the statute overruled cases that made the Register a gatekeeper to the courthouse, and the policy of the statute, which grants exclusive rights upon fixation of an original work, not by virtue of any administrative action. And as a matter of ordinary language, and in the Copyright Act's lexicon, registration can refer to the copyright owner's effort to secure recordation of a claim and to the Copyright Office's recordation of the claim after examination."
2018.17-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,52.44,60.4,"Well, but as to that, it seems to me one reason the case is a little confusing is that I think you're right, registration could mean either."
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,67.92,70.96,"But, Your Honor, that's not the way the statute uses the language."
2018.17-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,117.2,140.84,"Well, but you forgot the second sentence of 411(a), which speaks of registration cannot mean when the applicant applies because it -- it talks about the applicant being able to take action when registration has been refused or, I would say, when registration has not been made."
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,140.84,144.4,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I wouldn't say when registration has not been made."
2018.17-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,190.92,194.88,So you just dismiss 410(d) as superfluous?
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,194.88,232.96,"Not at all. Section 410(d) provides that the effective date of registration is when the -- the application, fee and deposit have been received in a form that is acceptable for registration as later determined, and this is key, by the office or by a court. So Section 410(d), I think, strongly supports our position because it makes clear that in a case where there may be a doubt about -- perhaps because the Register has not yet acted, if there's some question about whether registration has been made in accordance with the title, the court can determine that question."
2018.17-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,235.12,243.76,But you've already said registration has been made in the terms of the registrar's action when the -- the applicant applies.
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,243.76,260.12,"Not -- not in -- to be clear, Your Honor, ""registration has been made"" in the statute refers to the copyright owner's compliance with Section 408(a), which says that registration may be obtained upon the submission of the required application, deposit, and fee."
2018.17-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,260.12,270.84,Do you drive without a driver's license when yours has expired because you wrote in to the registry of motor vehicles but they haven't yet licensed you?
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,270.84,272.2,"Well, Your Honor --"
2018.17-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,272.2,298.64,"Can you change your sewer in the house with a man who has not gotten the approval from the local public health authority under a statute that says you have to have a registered -- you have to have a -- an approved plumber because he wrote in and asked for one? I mean, I can't think of examples -- I'm trying to -- where -- where -- where there's something roughly comparable and the statute is interpreted the way you want."
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,301.12,314.56,"Well, I think that, Your Honor, there's a couple of cases, there's a couple of statutes that were cited in the amicus brief of the music publishers that refer to the fact that registration is upon the -- that registration is made when the -- the --"
2018.17-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,314.56,317.24,They say that specifically?
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,317.24,326.48,"But, Your Honor, the point here is that the text of the statute likewise makes clear that registration is made upon the submission of the materials."
2018.17-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,350.2,355.04,"Have you registered for the class when you've mailed it in, but the professor hasn't gotten it?"
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,355.04,362.08,"Well, Your Honor, this -- in this statute, it says that registration is made if -- and this is in Section 410(d)."
2018.17-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,418.44,425.0,Could you tell me as a matter of fact when is the copyright registration published?
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,425.0,435.88,"The copyright, under current -- under the current procedure, the copyright application becomes publicly available when it's -- after it's granted."
2018.17-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,435.88,450.52,And so it seems illogical to think that you're going to get rights against the third-party who's not on notice that your copyright has been registered because it's not public.
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,450.52,450.6,Right.
2018.17-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,451.08,452.2,There's --
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,452.2,454.32,-- I want to address that as strongly as I can.
2018.17-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,476.4,480.28,"But it is in terms of -- well, that begs the question."
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,480.28,480.36,And on --
2018.17-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,480.36,482.04,But you can't -- you -- you --
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,482.04,482.2,If I may.
2018.17-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,482.2,487.16,-- you can't pursue a suit unless the registration is accepted?
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,487.16,487.72,But -- no.
2018.17-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,494.88,495.64,"Yes, you're right."
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,495.64,495.8,Okay.
2018.17-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,496.0,496.52,Because the --
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,496.52,516.84,"And the other thing that's -- that's important to understand, and this is, I think, critical, the government concedes that the enhanced statutory remedies that are available for infringement after a work has been registered are available if the registration, the application, deposit, and fee have been submitted."
2018.17-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,530.48,536.16,"Well, that's enough assuming that the registrar has registered the mark."
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,541.16,544.44,"Again, the registrar does not have to register the mark."
2018.17-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,546.68,552.56,"Well, you're not entitled to the special benefits under the Act until the registrar has, right?"
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,552.56,553.04,No.
2018.17-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,553.04,557.28,"It just goes -- it goes back -- in terms of when you start calculating it, it may go back."
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,557.28,557.88,"No, Your Honor."
2018.17-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,558.52,564.48,"So you could go back, the registrar hasn't even registered the mark, and you can go into court and say, hey, I get the benefits of having registered my mark?"
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,564.48,566.84,"The copyright claim, yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,579.56,586.6,"Yeah, but maybe I'm just missing the point, or one of us. I mean, you have to at least had it registered, accepted by the registrar."
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,590.2,596.04,"Your Honor, because the question of registrability can be determined by a court in that litigation."
2018.17-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,645.68,648.4,"Well, that's just 410(d) that says that?"
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,648.4,663.36,"And -- but everybody agrees that that's what 412(2), which refers to -- which preserves certain statutory remedies, if registration is made within three months after publication, that's -- everyone agrees that that's what 412(2) means as well."
2018.17-571,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,773.84,774.56,"Mr. Panner, describe --"
2018.17-571,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,774.56,790.6,"Mr. Panner, I -- I -- I understand some of the policy arguments that you have on your side, but, I mean, the question is whether the text can -- can -- can be looked at that way. And I'll just go back to where the Chief Justice started, which is this passage in 411(a)."
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,826.6,829.24,"Well, Your Honor, obviously, we don't agree with that."
2018.17-571,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,850.32,855.84,"Well -- well, I'm kind of with you that the word ""register"" has some flexibility to it."
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,881.96,883.84,"I -- I -- I don't think so, Your Honor."
2018.17-571,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,989.2,993.6,And you -- you alluded to major problems and then didn't describe them.
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1014.52,1015.04,Sure.
2018.17-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1043.32,1043.64,All right.
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1080.36,1081.68,In a --
2018.17-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1081.68,1089.96,And what would happen if the court grants the injunction and the registrar refuses registration?
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1089.96,1094.4,"Well, Your Honor, are -- are you talking about in a -- in a situation in which there --"
2018.17-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1094.4,1096.08,Your reading is given effect.
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1104.12,1104.36,Yes.
2018.17-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1104.44,1106.44,What does the court do?
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1106.44,1117.4,"The -- as in any other civil action, the -- the plaintiff would have the obligation to provide prima facie evidence to carry the burden to show that they -- they're entitled to relief."
2018.17-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1126.92,1127.8,Let's assume they have.
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1127.8,1128.52,"Well, then --"
2018.17-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1128.52,1134.36,What do they do about the registrar not acting? Can final judgment be entered before the registrar acts?
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1134.36,1135.28,Certainly.
2018.17-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1155.2,1161.44,And what happens if the registrar refuses after the judgment is entered?
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1161.44,1179.6,"Well, in any case in which there's a -- in any civil suit, the registrar will receive notice of the suit, and the suit can be -- the -- you know, the -- the registrar could either expedite examination of the application or could potentially --"
2018.17-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1179.6,1181.28,"But, eventually, if -- if --"
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1181.28,1181.68,But --
2018.17-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1181.68,1182.76,-- judgment is entered --
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1182.76,1183.52,Yeah.
2018.17-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1183.52,1193.28,"-- and the registrar refuses, it's sort of a moot question to be told that the suit has already started, isn't it?"
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1193.28,1193.92,Well --
2018.17-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1193.92,1196.48,Because 411 --
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1196.48,1199.24,"-- again, they have to be notified within 30 days of the filing of the suit."
2018.17-571,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1272.12,1281.08,"What are the practical problems? I think the message of your argument is, if you really understood how this works in the real world, we would agree with your reading."
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1284.36,1289.88,"And -- and the practical problems are those that are described in our briefs and in the briefs of the amici, which are the major problems --"
2018.17-571,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1289.88,1294.72,"And what are the -- what are the most -- what are the most severe practical problems? Delay, I understand."
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1294.72,1299.32,I think the most severe practical problem is the inability to receive prompt injunctive relief --
2018.17-571,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1299.32,1299.44,Okay.
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1299.44,1302.0,-- in a circumstance where the claim has not yet --
2018.17-571,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1302.0,1304.48,And that's a problem because? Just spell it out.
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1304.48,1304.76,Sure.
2018.17-571,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1315.12,1318.08,"And in that period of delay, what may happen?"
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1318.08,1319.68,"In -- in that period -- thank you, Your Honor."
2018.17-571,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1320.48,1321.4,"I mean, just -- just spell it out."
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1321.4,1323.88,-- it could be -- it could be distributed over the Internet.
2018.17-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1345.48,1345.96,Now did you get --
2018.17-571,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1345.96,1349.8,And are damages never going to be sufficient to compensate for that? And why would that be?
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1349.8,1358.48,"Well, for many -- in many cases, it may be impossible to identify who has -- who has done all of the subsequent -- subsequent distribution."
2018.17-571,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1386.72,1393.52,How -- how long -- how long are the delays now? And how does that compare with what the delays were when this Act was passed?
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1393.52,1402.96,"The -- my understanding is that, for electronic submissions, the average is seven months, and for paper, it's nine."
2018.17-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1402.96,1406.56,"But you can -- you can pay extra for first class, right?"
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1406.56,1408.12,"You can -- you can, Your Honor."
2018.17-571,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1434.32,1434.64,Counsel --
2018.17-571,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1434.64,1437.28,"And when -- when the Act was passed, what were the delays then?"
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1437.28,1442.0,"They appear to have been significantly shorter, Your Honor."
2018.17-571,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1451.68,1455.52,"Yeah, I mean, significantly shorter but still a matter of weeks and months?"
2018.17-571,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1455.52,1458.16,I think a matter of weeks in -- in any event.
2018.17-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1523.24,1530.92,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stris."
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1530.92,1549.16,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 411 of the Copyright Act provides that no civil infringement suit shall be instituted until registration has been made or registration has been refused. The statutory text is plain."
2018.17-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1621.84,1634.6,"Well, but, I mean, your friend on the other side makes the point -- and I think there's a lot to it -- that there are a lot of other sections and provisions where it only makes sense to read ""register"" as if you were registering for, you know, for the draft or something."
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1634.6,1644.44,"So a few responses, Mr. Chief Justice. The first is I'm happy to do a close reading of any of the provisions that my friend cites."
2018.17-571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1682.04,1706.72,"What about 410(d)? In 410(d), it says the effective date of a copyright registration is the day on which an application, deposit, and fee, which are later determined to be registered, have all been received by the Copyright Office. So maybe the registration is when it's received, if there's later approval."
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1706.72,1717.76,"So, Justice Breyer, let me give a textual response and then a more fundamental one. My textual response is that the effective date provision requires a determination by someone."
2018.17-571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1743.2,1778.56,"It says registration. But, you see, if you look at 410(d), I guess in English, if you ever read like property law, there's such a thing as having a piece of property subject to defeasance. And so noting that, and it is a piece of property, you could read 410(d) as saying the effective date of copyright registration, i.e., you have it, is the date on which all those things are received, though they are subject to later defeasance if, in fact, the registrar disapproves. Okay."
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1781.36,1782.4,I don't think so.
2018.17-571,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1899.24,1902.24,"I mean, not just most. Ninety-seven percent, right?"
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1902.24,1904.8,"Well, so I think it may be even more than that."
2018.17-571,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1916.48,1918.68,How often does that happen?
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1918.68,1924.48,"I don't know as -- as a percentage, but I can tell you not a de minimis -- de minimis amount, a significant number of times."
2018.17-571,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1943.68,1970.64,"Well, maybe the bigger heartburn, if we have any, about the policy here is that if I'm persuaded of one thing, it's that Congress pretty much assumed that registration decisions would happen promptly when it enacted the statute and that there's at least some evidence that that -- that that hope or expectation has not exactly materialized. And -- and I take that to be the underlying plea from the other side really. What do you say to that?"
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1970.64,1978.32,"So I would say a few things. First, I would say that, to be perfectly frank, this is largely a solution in search of a problem."
2018.17-571,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2016.8,2020.88,But your solution undermines that solution.
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2031.48,2035.36,"No, no, that's -- Justice Sotomayor, that's -- Sotomayor, that's a very important point."
2018.17-571,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2037.76,2038.0,All right.
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2038.16,2038.28,Yeah.
2018.17-571,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2044.44,2044.84,All right.
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2047.32,2047.76,Of course.
2018.17-571,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2048.72,2052.08,And so isn't pre-registration being accepted slowly as well?
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2052.08,2052.44,No.
2018.17-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2245.36,2250.16,"Well, it doesn't -- well, as you said, it's a rolling statute administration."
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2270.64,2304.68,"So two responses. So, with regard to irreparable injury, I think that's what injunctions are for, and I feel like I addressed that a bit earlier. With regard to damages and your point which I take that it's rolling, and there are separate accruals, and we're not just talking about whether you lose your entire claim but whether you lose some of the damages, I'm making a much stronger point. I'm saying Petitioner doesn't cite a single case where some chunk of the damages fell outside of the three-year window because the applicant was waiting. The only --"
2018.17-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2304.68,2310.76,"Well, I don't know, you know, whether he cites a particular case or not, but as a matter of logic, it makes sense, doesn't it?"
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2310.76,2311.36,I don't think so.
2018.17-571,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2393.32,2393.6,What --
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2393.6,2396.8,-- indication that this is not that serious a problem.
2018.17-571,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2396.8,2399.44,"You have a -- a good argument on the text, obviously."
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2418.68,2435.04,"Well, so, Justice Kavanaugh, let me address that head on. So I -- I will concede that, for decades, there's been vigorous disagreement over whether and to what extent formalities should be removed from the Copyright Act."
2018.17-571,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2440.8,2441.2,Right.
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2442.32,2443.76,But -- but -- so let me -- let me finish.
2018.17-571,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2443.76,2445.2,Okay.
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2445.2,2448.88,There are many people who subscribe to that view.
2018.17-571,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2477.8,2478.16,Okay.
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2478.16,2494.56,"And on this one, I don't think just we have an okay argument on the text; I think that it's overwhelmingly the case that you -- you have to interpret it to mean a registration decision. So, going back to the text just for -- for a moment, I've only talked about the first sentence, which I think --"
2018.17-571,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2494.56,2497.92,"Before we leave that subject, I'm sorry -- I'm sorry to interrupt --"
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2497.92,2498.32,Please.
2018.17-571,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2498.32,2507.0,-- but what do you say to the objection that it puts American copyright holders at a disadvantage because formalities aren't required under our international obligations?
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2507.0,2517.6,"So what -- Justice Gorsuch, what you just asked was the core debate, and it was a vigorous one in 1988 when the House and the Senate split in determining how to deal with Berne."
2018.17-571,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2544.28,2548.6,You -- you made an analogy to exhaustion of administrative remedies.
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2550.52,2551.24,Uh-huh.
2018.17-571,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2551.24,2551.68,-- analogy.
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2558.96,2559.84,So I think it's -- I --
2018.17-571,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2559.84,2560.0,-- in many cases?
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2560.0,2562.24,"-- I used the word ""analogy"" on purpose."
2018.17-571,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2564.4,2566.48,"Well, is it -- is it even within the ZIP code?"
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2566.48,2567.4,"Oh, definitely. Definitely."
2018.17-571,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2567.4,2568.12,"Okay, how?"
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2568.12,2570.08,I think there are striking similarities.
2018.17-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2734.84,2735.04,Sure.
2018.17-571,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2735.04,2752.16,"The problem with what my friend does infects many of his arguments, which is he interprets the provision in a way that's not literally impossible but renders many provisions insignificant: 410(d), 408(f), the constructive notice provisions."
2018.17-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2759.92,2767.28,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Ellis."
2018.17-571,2,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2767.28,2792.16,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to pick up right where my friend left off on the second sentence of Section 411(a) because I do think that that is really the key to this case, and I think there are three pretty -- three textual cues in that sentence that show that registration has been made, and the first sentence must be referring to the act of the Register. The first is the one we just talked about, that it uses the word ""registration."" And I think it's actually a little bit stronger than what we've said."
2018.17-571,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2860.56,2860.8,"Well, I --"
2018.17-571,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2860.8,2861.04,Well --
2018.17-571,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2861.04,2861.88,-- I believe --
2018.17-571,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2861.88,2862.64,Go ahead.
2018.17-571,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2862.64,2870.36,"I believe Mr. Panner says that the function of the second sentence is to require an additional act, that notice be given to the Register."
2018.17-571,2,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2870.36,2886.2,"Right, and I think there are two problems with that reading, aside from the fact it's just not the most natural one. The first is that -- I think what he said this morning is that you can -- the case can still proceed when -- after the Register refuses registration. But that's not what it says."
2018.17-571,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3096.92,3100.36,"The textual argument you make is, of course, weighty."
2018.17-571,2,62960,jonathan_ellis,,3115.44,3136.04,"I'd love to address both. On -- on the first, I think, as to what Congress could have thought, it may be hard -- harder to say, but, as we discussed, the relays -- the delays at the time of the time the suit was passed or the act was passed weren't so great, so I think that sort of cuts against thinking that Congress couldn't have wanted this. As to the problems, I -- I think they're overstated."
2018.17-571,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3154.0,3157.24,You're not denying there are delays and the delays are a problem?
2018.17-571,2,62960,jonathan_ellis,,3157.24,3162.76,"Not -- I'm not denying -- I'm not denying there are delays, and I'm not denying that there is dissatisfaction with delays."
2018.17-571,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3162.76,3163.36,Yes.
2018.17-571,2,62960,jonathan_ellis,,3164.76,3169.56,I think the second thing you might look at is what Congress has done in response to those concerns.
2018.17-571,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3241.12,3247.4,I understand your textual argument about the incongruity of the same phrase having two different meanings in 411.
2018.17-571,2,62960,jonathan_ellis,,3259.08,3261.76,"So -- so, again, I don't -- we don't think that's actually true."
2018.17-571,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3381.72,3386.08,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Panner, you have five minutes remaining."
2018.17-571,3,16746,aaron_m_panner,,3386.08,3446.16,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I want to emphasize that our argument relies primarily on the text of Section 411(a) and the fact that it uses the phrase ""registration has been made"" and that in the Act, that phrase and that construction consistently refers to the action of the copyright owner. It's revealing that in the legislative history, which is included in the -- in the codification of the Act, it says that a copyright owner who has not -- who has not registered his claim can have a valid cause of action against someone who has infringed his copyright, but he cannot enforce his rights in the courts until he has made registration. That is -- and, again, in Section 411(b) of the 1976 Act, now 411(c), the copyright owner makes registration. It is a really consistent usage in the statute that when Congress was referring to the action of the copyright owner, it used that phraseology."
2018.17-571,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3674.4,3676.8,"Thank you, counsel."
