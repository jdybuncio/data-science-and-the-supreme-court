1974.73-1701,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,22.636,"We'll hear arguments first today in Number 73-1701, United States against the National Association of Securities Dealers."
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,24.071,30.713,"Mr. Chief Justice, here's a chart that I'll be using in the course of the argument which I would like to have set up before I proceed."
1974.73-1701,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,30.713,33.471,"Well, is that reproduced in --"
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,33.471,37.394,"Yes, copies have been handed up to the Court."
1974.73-1701,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,37.394,38.406,Is this the thing we have?
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,38.406,59.18,That's right.
1974.73-1701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,59.18,62.889,"Is that thing you've just put on Mr. Norton, is that in the record or is this just illustrative?"
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,62.889,65.67,It's just illustrative.
1974.73-1701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,534.337,539.053,"Is there no control on this load, no governmental control?"
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,539.053,540.66,Yes.
1974.73-1701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,615.128,622.482,"Is it clear that the language, the word dealer in 22 (d) does not apply to a broker as well?"
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,622.482,639.904,"Well, those terms are separately defined and as I've indicated the same -- any broker-dealer is at various times a broker or a dealer, someone who was acting in a brokerage capacity would not be governed by 22 (D)."
1974.73-1701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,639.904,646.765,So when you were describing the functions -- those functions are descriptions contained in the statute itself?
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,646.765,662.786,They are in part contained in the statute and in part a description of the industry as it operates and as it has been characterized by the commission to which I'll come in a moment.
1974.73-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1184.546,1209.452,Suppose the Securities and Exchange Commission had promulgated a rule under 22 (f) that brokers or that funds should restrict the transferability of their share so that brokers as well as dealers couldn't sell to investors at anything less than the offering price.
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1215.43,1219.329,"Well, that hasn't been presented."
1974.73-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1232.501,1241.738,"Yes, but the argument isn't it -- the argument on the other side I take it among other things is that that commission would have power to do such a thing."
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1258.913,1261.085,That is the argument.
1974.73-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1270.895,1273.192,Well the commission --
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1273.192,1282.373,It never indicated in any way that it had the expansive view of it's jurisdiction that the defendants and to some extent the commission now claim.
1974.73-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1282.373,1285.044,"Well the commission is now asserting it, isn't it?"
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1285.044,1291.131,It's not saying that it could require the industry to impose its restrictive agreement.
1974.73-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1302.002,1312.798,"Alright, suppose the fund did impose this restriction and the commission expressly approved it, expressly approved those restrictions such as we've been talking about."
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1317.682,1320.16,Well I suspect that would be their position.
1974.73-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1320.16,1323.138,"Well it is here, isn't it?"
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1323.138,1324.631,Well they haven't expressly approved them.
1974.73-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1340.734,1352.243,"Well, they say they could do that and if they could, that means that although the power is un-exercised, the power is there and it should not be interfered with by antitrust prosecution."
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1352.243,1355.827,Well that's true because this involves several problems.
1974.73-1701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1448.083,1456.856,"Well, isn't one of your arguments that a secondary market would benefit the holders of this security?"
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1456.856,1461.65,"Well, it would benefit the holders but it would benefit people who are not yet holders."
1974.73-1701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1461.65,1474.753,Well then when this 22 (f) says the commission has to act in the interest of all the holders wouldn't it have to take into consideration the fact if you're right that a secondary market would benefit some of the holders?
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1474.753,1480.715,"We would not argue that the commission ought not to take competitive factors into it, into consideration."
1974.73-1701,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1942.356,1946.888,Mr. Norton has there been any congressional reaction to that 74 study?
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1946.888,1969.423,I am not in the position to say.
1974.73-1701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2029.537,2036.003,"If this has been going on for 35 years, why did the Government wait so long to bring this suit?"
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2036.003,2054.418,"Well, there was I think until the early 60's, it was less clear to everyone that these securities transactions were fully subject to the antitrust laws and the practices were --"
1974.73-1701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2054.418,2057.882,But what happened that in the early 60's that made it more clear?
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2057.882,2071.0,"Well, there was the Silver case for one and it was also and with the particular reference to the securities industry of 1963 or so, a study which revealed a lot of the competitive problems of the industry."
1974.73-1701,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2146.67,2162.095,"Mr. Norton, would you summarize very briefly the essential difference between Count I what the Government is driving out there as contrasted with the practical consequences of what it is seeking in the other counts."
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2167.552,2189.641,"Well I think it's hard to give a precise answer to that because Count I is a broad horizontal type of combination which has as its focus the -- among other things, the development of these vertical arrangements which are challenged in Counts II through VIII, so they are somewhat interrelated."
1974.73-1701,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2189.641,2201.307,Specifically what types of agreements would Count I address that are different from the agreements addressed by the other counts.
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2201.307,2232.468,"Well, Count I referred to other matters such as discouraging people who -- a number of things to suppress the development of the secondary market in addition to contract such as discouraging people who might be interested in engaging in such a market by saying and suggesting that it was not lawful or a distributing information that mischaracterized the legality of such transactions and sort of supplemental to the --"
1974.73-1701,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2232.468,2238.263,The information like that violates the antitrust laws if it were erroneous.
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2251.143,2265.096,"But one problem on -- in answering on Count I is that we're here on a motion to dismiss, we don't have the facts but there are some indications in the record that are suggestive."
1974.73-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2424.605,2443.953,"Do you agree Mr. Norton that 22 (d) does oust the antitrust laws with respect to the primary market, of course you don't attack, you don't say that the price -- the resale price maintenance scheme that the funds that the underwriters use is illegal?"
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2443.953,2453.254,"No, no obviously if the statute requires someone to sell at a price fixed by his supplier we would --"
1974.73-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2453.254,2456.023,Now when does that -- when does that principal market end?
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2461.706,2463.103,That's right.
1974.73-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2463.103,2465.149,And has never been held by an investor before.
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2465.149,2466.154,That's right.
1974.73-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2466.154,2475.884,Then you say the primary market has ended and he should be able to sell to that to another investor either through a broker or directly.
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2475.884,2477.229,Well there's no question you can sell that --
1974.73-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2477.229,2479.283,I know but without any -- without any interference from.
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2479.283,2481.22,"That's right, imposed --"
1974.73-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2481.22,2484.005,-- by the fund or the underwriter or other dealer.
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2484.005,2488.068,That's precisely right.
1974.73-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2488.068,2507.362,So that just isn't the question of -- or do you say that the primary market just can't reach out and keep investors from selling to another one at as lower price even though the fund is continuously offering its new share.
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2507.362,2524.52,That's right and of course if the fund suspends offering and some do from time to time then the whole resale price maintenance is out and let me point out the agreements here don't limit their provisions to times when the fund is continuously offering.
1974.73-1701,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2528.593,2536.989,"Mr. Norton, I thought that clients did offer continuously or because they are obligated to buy back continuously."
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2536.989,2538.341,Well they generally do.
1974.73-1701,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2551.709,2553.131,There must be a liquidation.
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2553.131,2554.118,Not necessarily.
1974.73-1701,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2566.679,2580.511,"Pertaining to a question that Mr. Justice Marshall asked earlier, isn't that fundamental problem to the extent of the load and the SCC does have authority to regulate that."
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2580.511,2586.197,They have authority to regulate that in the primary distribution system.
1974.73-1701,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2591.598,2603.041,"But if the law were fair, what would be the advantage of having the secondary -- the pre-secondary market that you speak of?"
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2603.041,2617.755,"Well at present, an investor has to pay the load whether or not the dealer performs any services that sales load and mutual funds reflects a large selling expense."
1974.73-1701,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2638.092,2639.067,8 1/2%.
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2639.067,2642.187,"8 1/2 %, it's sizable."
1974.73-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2642.187,2654.836,"Your problem though but the situation would still exist, but perhaps not to the same extent that even if there was no sales load because investors may want to sell, another people may buy it less than the asset value."
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2654.836,2655.41,That's right.
1974.73-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2712.865,2715.966,An investor can always redeem at that asset value.
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2715.966,2728.159,"That's right, but it's net asset value with the date of receipt by the fund if he wants to get cash quickly and at more certain price, he may want to redeem on the secondary market."
1974.73-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2728.159,2732.565,But then he may have to pay a brokerage commission.
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2732.565,2732.955,"Well, it depends."
1974.73-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2732.955,2734.707,I mean he does know any other investors.
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2734.707,2741.281,"He sells to a dealer, he would pay whatever the market price was."
1974.73-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2789.041,2800.395,I take it Mr. Norton that the antitrust(Inaudible)
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2800.395,2804.199,That would appear to be the situation.
1974.73-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2804.199,2806.925,(Inaudible)
1974.73-1701,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2806.925,2809.639,That's right.
1974.73-1701,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2809.639,2813.366,Mr. Norton you've consumed all of your time.
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,2816.525,2819.206,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please it the Court.
1974.73-1701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3152.757,3156.21,But they don't compete in terms of the load percentage?
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,3156.21,3163.074,"Yes sir they do, because some funds have higher loads, other funds have no load, some funds have no loads."
1974.73-1701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3181.71,3188.397,"Well, do to the load factors in your open fund vary -- they're not all 7.5%."
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,3188.397,3189.506,"Indeed they are not, sir."
1974.73-1701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3207.139,3211.712,"You say, there are some with the open-end investment companies with the zero load?"
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,3211.712,3214.897,"Yes, sir but no load funds on the market and available."
1974.73-1701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3214.897,3217.502,"I knew that they were closed down, no load funds."
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,3217.502,3220.093,"Now there are open-end, no load funds on the markets."
1974.73-1701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3220.093,3225.413,So where is the --
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,3225.413,3227.208,"Right, why do people buy load funds that's --"
1974.73-1701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3227.208,3229.461,How can that economically be?
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,3229.461,3240.179,"That's a very good question, Mr. Justice and that brings me to the next point which is that mutual funds are and have been as found by the SEC dependent upon their primary distribution system."
1974.73-1701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3452.855,3460.587,That became the proposal that this problem will be dealt with my forward pricing.
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,3460.587,3463.338,That has been implemented by the SEC.
1974.73-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3547.22,3565.575,I guess you'll get to it but you -- wholly aside from 22 (f) -- I suppose you're saying that 22 (d) -- or 22 (d) and 22 (f) together mean that the primary -- it means that the -- there is only supposed to be a primary market.
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,3565.575,3567.727,"They eliminated the secondary market, Mr. Justice."
1974.73-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3567.727,3571.143,And wholly aside from the power of the SEC.
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,3571.143,3572.458,"As a practical matter, yes."
1974.73-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3577.284,3598.546,"Well, let's assume we disagreed with you on the 22 (d) that just by on its face or in the light of its legislative history, 22 (d) standing alone didn't eliminate secondary market and then we are left with the argument that the powers of the SEC under 22 (f) are sufficient to preempt the antitrust laws --"
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,3598.546,3599.915,Or that the --
1974.73-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3599.915,3604.367,Are you saying the 22 (f) alone has that --
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,3604.367,3605.99,We needn't rest on that sir that the --
1974.73-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3605.99,3610.424,I know you don't and you needn't but what if you have to?
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,3611.754,3631.959,"As a practical matter, the powers of the SEC under 22 (f) are perfectly adequate to this case to answer the question asked by Mr. Justice Powell as a practical matter all of the restrictions the Government has complaining about are in fact contained in the agreements and if the SEC made regulations under 22 (f), that would as a practical matter end the case."
1974.73-1701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3743.274,3750.53,Of course the Government says part of the reason it has disappeared is because of the agreements among your clients.
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,3750.53,3754.383,"Those existed prior to 1940, Mr. Justice."
1974.73-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3836.34,3838.091,Let me get it clear.
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,3860.566,3865.166,"No, the -- I'm sorry if the dealer wants to sell, yes sir."
1974.73-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3867.064,3869.811,Even though an investor has previously held though here.
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,3869.811,3870.135,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3876.367,3889.141,A special investor just wants to sell his shares to a friend and they say why would you split the difference between the redemption cost and the offering?
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,3889.141,3895.703,"Obviously proper, there's no law against it, no rule against it, no restriction against it, it's not involved in the case."
1974.73-1701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3895.703,3898.733,And if he goes through a broker it isn't at all?
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,3898.733,3910.703,There is some question as to whether or not 22d reaches the case of a broker who is not in fact a dealer and acts only as a broker between two investors but again that's a pure abstraction.
1974.73-1701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3947.612,3968.473,Assume that you may be right that it hardly ever happens but are you saying that the Act 22 (d) and 22 (f) would exempt the NASD from any antitrust liability and the brokers if they all agreed that we will just ever help an investor sell to another investor?
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,3968.473,3971.825,There's no charge that they have done this.
1974.73-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3974.416,3980.307,"Well, how about my question though, let's assume there was such an agreement, is that exempted by the --"
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,3980.307,3986.521,I think it would be sir because these are so -- there is such a pervasive system of regulation by the SEC.
1974.73-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3995.468,4008.859,"Well, I thought part of the Government's case was that the NASD and the formal system was suppressing any kind of a development of secondary market through brokers?"
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,4008.859,4014.488,There is a formal allegation to this effect but in fact it has been largely abandoned.
1974.73-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4036.246,4038.866,You're suggesting this is just a non-case.
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,4038.866,4043.392,"I believe that is precisely the incidence, Mr. Justice."
1974.73-1701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4043.392,4050.3,Assuming Mr. Norton in his response to Justice Powell's question didn't indicate that the Government had withdrawn Count I.
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,4050.3,4055.056,I know he didn't but in fact they have because all of the substantial allegations have been abandoned.
1974.73-1701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4055.056,4065.112,"Well, how -- you know when you talk about someone withdrawing a portion of their case, I would assume you take their word rather than opposing counsel's ordinarily."
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,4065.112,4078.924,"The Government is very anxious to have the case reversed and to prevail sir, but there is nothing left of Count I after they have abandoned the charge, the NASD rules violate the antitrust laws."
1974.73-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4111.085,4112.053,What do you point to?
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,4116.509,4120.417,Its concession that the NASD rules are not under attack.
1974.73-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4120.417,4123.792,Where is that?
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,4125.729,4131.395,Yes that's -- there is a letter from counsel and the Joint Appendix at page 327.
1974.73-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4145.803,4155.694,But they do say that there is a -- there are agreements which have this effect of ousting the development of any secondary market?
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,4155.694,4156.077,Yes sir.
1974.73-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4601.481,4613.658,But you don't suggest that 22 (d) or any other law makes it illegal for a broker to match and to help an investor sell his shares to another one?
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,4616.096,4617.841,"This is disputable, Mr. Justice."
1974.73-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4627.572,4629.15,I'll put it to you this way.
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,4635.924,4637.438,"No, sir."
1974.73-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4638.419,4640.784,That in fact they have the contrary opinion.
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,4640.784,4646.605,"Alright, they have never made a ruling that a contract dealer can act as a broker."
1974.73-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4654.383,4654.753,That's right.
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,4657.923,4671.897,But there is nothing charged in this suit that would prevent that because these are people who by definition are not subject to the restrictions of the sales agreements and they are not subject to any inhibition in the NASD rules.
1974.73-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4674.763,4681.104,"So, you might have some problem if the complaint was alleged to charge that there was some interference."
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,4681.104,4700.884,"If there were different complaint, we might have a different case, Mr. Justice but there is nothing in this complaint nor may I point out also that the Government has filed an affidavit and 30 exhibits taking 75 pages of the printed record from pages 230 to 305 elucidating that the charges in this complaint."
1974.73-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4710.329,4723.328,"Well, didn't the District Court rule that Section 22 (d) or 22 (d) and 22 (f) together just preempts, ousts the antitrust laws in this entire case?"
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,4723.328,4723.931,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4723.931,4731.926,"And that even if there was something to aim that brokers matching investors, the antitrust laws would still be irrelevant?"
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,4731.926,4752.24,"As a matter of fact, we would take that position because we think that under the decisions of this Court, there is such pervasive regulation of all these transactions by the SEC that under TWA and Pan American, the Court would hold that the SEC has the authority and therefore these are not subject to the antitrust laws."
1974.73-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4836.959,4838.816,Time is up now.
1974.73-1701,1,34774,lee_loevinger,,4838.816,4839.377,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4896.546,4908.582,"Alright, Mr. Lee Loevinger."
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,4909.324,4913.697,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5137.245,5143.406,But even if the SEC doesn't look at them?
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5143.406,5146.412,"Doesn't look at them, you say?"
1974.73-1701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5150.413,5158.055,"When did you start regulating on 22 f, when did the SEC start regulating"
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5158.055,5168.973,"Well, it started I would say with 1941 when we first reviewed the NASD's initial rules that were adopted pursuant to this section of the statute."
1974.73-1701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5168.973,5171.329,Did you issue regulations?
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5171.329,5177.656,We have not adopted any specific rule under 22 (f).
1974.73-1701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5177.656,5180.358,I'm sure that they have you?
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5180.358,5188.389,"Well, I'm not even doing it today.As a matter of fact, we have exercised --"
1974.73-1701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5188.389,5192.139,"I should ask another question, did you ever expressed?"
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5192.139,5223.643,We have proposals right now that we're working on to go to Congress with to change some of these things by statute rather than just by a regulation of our own and we in the meantime have specifically requested the NASD just last November to adopt a rule which would loosen up to some extent the right of others to participate in the market of mutual fund shares as distinguished from limiting it to the primary distribution that we now have.
1974.73-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5301.538,5322.877,"Let me ask you this part here, you are suggesting that the SEC by not disapproving any of these agreements has in effect proved a contract between for example, between a contract dealer and a underwriter that the dealer will never act as a broker between two investors."
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5322.877,5329.515,The commission has approved the portion of that contract which you are mentioning.
1974.73-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5329.515,5340.656,"Your answer is yes, and that there are such agreements in existence where the people participating in the primary submission system agree that they want brokerage."
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5340.656,5341.56,That's right.
1974.73-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5341.56,5347.37,And the underwriter agrees with the mutual fund that his contract dealers want brokerage.
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5347.37,5348.232,That's right.
1974.73-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5351.639,5356.882,You say that you have approved those agreements therefore they are exempted from the antitrust laws?
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5356.882,5363.573,"I am saying Your Honor that we haven't disapproved them, 22 f permits --"
1974.73-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5363.573,5367.602,"Well, then the a fortiori, if you would approve them you say that's the example."
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5367.602,5369.631,"Yes, certainly."
1974.73-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5369.631,5372.368,But what's essential to the operation to the Act?
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5387.492,5409.41,"22 (d) 22 (f) reads, no registered open end companies shall restrict the transferability of any security of which it is the issue except in conformity with the statements with respect to contained in this registration statement which statements are not in contradiction of any rule of the commission."
1974.73-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5409.41,5409.746,"Well, yes."
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5421.053,5433.449,We're saying that restrictions on transferability of the shares of an issuer are unobjectionable from the standpoint of the antitrust laws if -- as long as they are contained in the --
1974.73-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5433.449,5443.815,Are you suggesting that it could -- you could say that the stock could've honored and they have enforceable and then one investor couldn't sell to another.
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5443.815,5444.393,No.
1974.73-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5444.393,5447.666,"Well, why wouldn't you as you didn't disapprove it."
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5447.666,5447.974,Because --
1974.73-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5447.974,5456.315,"The evidence in the registration statement and if its not disapproved by the SEC, I think your answer would be yes under 22 (f)."
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5456.315,5458.216,"Maybe I didn't understand the question, I'm sorry."
1974.73-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5458.216,5468.5,"Or you would say that such a restriction on the sale from one investor to another would be -- not only, it would certainly wouldn't -- it wouldn't be anything wrong with that as long as you didn't disapprove it."
1974.73-1701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5468.5,5470.302,nd so long as its in the registration statement.
1974.73-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5470.302,5471.005,Yes.
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5471.005,5476.197,That's undoubtly so but I'm not at all sure about what we wouldn't disapprove it if they went that far.
1974.73-1701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5477.299,5477.795,"(Voice Overlap) well, do you --"
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5477.795,5480.752,-- that Congress has vested the authority in the commission to do that.
1974.73-1701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5480.752,5481.863,You're -- alright.
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5489.096,5489.893,I think we would say that --
1974.73-1701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5489.893,5495.896,So there are restrictions of which the Act wouldn't permit you to approve.
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5495.896,5501.891,The Act from its -- us to approve only once if we feel are in the best interest of the shareholders and the investing public in --
1974.73-1701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5501.891,5502.728,That's all I want to know.
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5502.728,5512.973,And that's exactly where we think the authority in this area lies as against lying in the hands of an antitrust court which wants to do the ruling for the commission in this area.
1974.73-1701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5512.973,5513.601,Very well.
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5513.601,5514.459,Now --
1974.73-1701,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5514.459,5515.261,Mr. North.
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5515.261,5516.251,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1701,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5516.251,5531.106,"In the commission's letter of November 22 to the NASD, you framed a request that certain be accomplished."
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5550.349,5554.627,I think the commission has adequate authority to require compliance.
1974.73-1701,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5571.673,5576.523,And you'd enact such a rule under 22 (f)?
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5576.523,5586.689,"Under that or under 6 (c) or under 30 (a), there are several Sections of the Act that gives the commission a rulemaking authority that I think would cover this kind of a situation."
1974.73-1701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5790.246,5797.482,"Mr. North, in the staff report, what action did the commission's taking upon that report as of now?"
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5797.482,5802.622,They have transmitted it to the Congress.
1974.73-1701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5809.614,5813.458,Was the (Voice Overlap) -- did the commission sent any report of its own to Congress?
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5813.458,5831.423,"There was an extensive letter of transmittal signed by the chairman of the commission and authorized by the whole commission, some eight pages in length, single spaced stating the commission's own reaction and sustaining some of the recommendations of the staff."
1974.73-1701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5831.423,5839.045,"But it took the commission 35 years to get to the point of getting to this bill, right?"
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5839.045,5840.504,"Well, no."
1974.73-1701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5845.212,5850.96,"Not yet -- not initiated by the commission, this is initiated by the Department of Justice."
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5850.96,5852.281,"Oh, no."
1974.73-1701,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5864.328,5877.156,"Granting all of that, what am I -- I still want an answer, as the commission done anything in the realm of regulation on 22?"
1974.73-1701,2,45729,walter_p_north,,5877.156,5880.343,"22 (f), no."
1974.73-1701,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5918.069,5919.921,Thank you Mr. North.
1974.73-1701,3,25838,gerald_p_norton,,5930.693,5935.508,I'd like to address one comment by Mr. Loevinger.
1974.73-1701,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6046.399,6057.783,"Well, does the rule, does NASD purport to recommend or authorize or forbid a dealer to act as a broker?"
1974.73-1701,3,25838,gerald_p_norton,,6057.783,6059.645,"NASD rules, no."
1974.73-1701,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6059.645,6060.578,"Well, but the --"
1974.73-1701,3,25838,gerald_p_norton,,6060.578,6060.627,"The contracts, yes."
1974.73-1701,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6060.627,6067.221,I take it that part of your cause of action is that dealers do agree not to act as brokers.
1974.73-1701,3,25838,gerald_p_norton,,6067.221,6067.613,That's right.
1974.73-1701,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6067.613,6069.996,And you attack that.
1974.73-1701,3,25838,gerald_p_norton,,6069.996,6071.609,That's right.
1974.73-1701,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6215.836,6216.775,Thank you gentlemen.
