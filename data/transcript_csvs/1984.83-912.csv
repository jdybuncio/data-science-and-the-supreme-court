1984.83-912,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,65.358,"Mr. Marcus, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,65.358,85.939,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the issue presented for review this afternoon is, must the defendant give up his right not to testify in order to preserve his right to appeal an erroneous ruling by the trial court admitting a prior conviction under Rule 609A of the Federal Rules of Evidence?"
1984.83-912,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,136.705,140.924,You say the trial court definitively held this.
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,144.025,144.644,He did not.
1984.83-912,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,145.26,151.881,"Wouldn't it be better to say the trial court said it then, since the trial court wasn't applying its rule to any particular set of facts that was before it?"
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,151.881,158.035,"The ruling, however, was definitive before the conclusion of the defense case."
1984.83-912,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,158.035,165.558,"I don't doubt that it was definitive, but I just thinking holding is not... a holding is... I think of a legal rule applied to specific facts."
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,170.026,179.116,"After the defendant was convicted, post-trial motions in this matter once again raised the issue of the earlier conviction being improperly admitted as impeachment."
1984.83-912,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,239.856,245.426,What if the trial court had just declined to rule at all on the motion in limine?
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,247.243,248.128,"--I'm sorry, Justice O'Connor."
1984.83-912,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,249.812,261.102,"--What if the trial judge had just declined to rule on the defendant's motion in limine, and had just said well, I don't know if I'll consider this or not, and had just let it ride?"
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,269.541,270.091,Perhaps.
1984.83-912,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,270.458,280.23,Do you think you could appeal the judge's decision not to rule on the motion in limine?
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,280.23,281.214,--I think you can.
1984.83-912,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,283.716,290.503,"So you think a trial court must then rule, entertain and rule on every motion in limine?"
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,290.503,291.287,"--Your Honor, yes."
1984.83-912,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,312.468,332.097,"I suppose I have been laboring under the impression at least that most trial courts treat it as a discretionary matter with the trial court, and as merely a tentative ruling, and not one that's definitive in any event."
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,332.097,335.298,"Well, I believe, as I had indicated earlier, that it should be decided."
1984.83-912,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,352.843,361.766,You think the trial court here could have changed the ruling at the time of trial if confronted with it again?
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,361.766,363.784,Changed the ruling at what point in time now?
1984.83-912,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,369.622,370.338,Or before.
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,370.338,373.657,--Or before the defendant had testified?
1984.83-912,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,386.499,392.503,Sometimes trial judges say to counsel I'll not act on that now; renew your motion at the time of trial.
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,393.687,394.855,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1984.83-912,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,396.122,399.891,So the problem might have all been solved.
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,399.891,409.013,"Well, in this case, I think the motion itself, in looking to the facts of the case, arose at the last possible moment prior to the defendant's testifying."
1984.83-912,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,446.372,448.84,"Well, your client didn't testify, did he?"
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,448.84,449.557,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-912,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,451.692,455.727,And so what's the violation against him?
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,455.727,460.647,"The violation against him, we submit, is that the ruling was indeed improper."
1984.83-912,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,465.368,469.837,And you object to the Court of Appeals not ruling on it?
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,469.837,470.787,That is correct.
1984.83-912,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,470.787,474.891,And what did the trial court do?
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,474.891,487.949,"The trial court, at the time of the... the trial court indeed did rule on the motion, and indeed indicated that if the defendant were to testify, the impeachment could be admitted... that being the impeachment by way of prior conviction."
1984.83-912,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,501.458,515.634,"Well, in the next case, I suppose under the Court of Appeals opinion, a trial court will never need to rule on the motion unless he says he's going to testify and gives the substance of his testimony."
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,515.634,519.42,"Well, this is the situation that was presented in the United States v. Cook."
1984.83-912,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,530.561,537.047,"The Court of Appeals, I guess, said a trial judge never needs to... never has to rule or--"
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,537.047,551.224,"Well, I believe at some point in time, clearly, there's a rule that there and a motion, presumably, that's presented, and at some point the court would have to rule; whether it be before the defendant testified or after the defendant testified."
1984.83-912,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,556.276,558.461,--If the defendant just stays off the stand--
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,558.461,559.461,Stays off the stand; that is correct.
1984.83-912,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,559.461,560.947,--There is never going to be a ruling on his motion.
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,560.947,561.897,That is correct.
1984.83-912,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,561.897,565.049,And there need not be under this Court of Appeals judgment.
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,565.049,566.234,That is correct.
1984.83-912,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,571.555,572.138,"Well, what's wrong with that?"
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,572.138,576.773,"Well, we indicate that we feel it is coercive on a defendant not to have that ruling."
1984.83-912,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,584.162,591.099,"Well, what's coercive about refusing to rule on a question of admissibility of evidence before the evidence is presented?"
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,591.099,593.884,"Well, I think in this unique set of circumstances--"
1984.83-912,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,593.884,595.001,What's unique about it?
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,595.001,601.074,--Unique... the fact is that this is perhaps the most devastating impeachment that can be admitted or elicited from a defendant.
1984.83-912,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,601.074,602.874,"But it happens often, doesn't it?"
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,610.18,612.882,"I think it's singular in the context in which it arose, too."
1984.83-912,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,630.407,639.097,"When you say it's unique, isn't it true that 99-44/100 percent of the defendants that don't take the stand have criminal records?"
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,639.097,640.699,"--I would have to disagree with that, Your Honor."
1984.83-912,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,640.699,641.165,Okay.
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,641.165,644.584,At least if I clarify that.
1984.83-912,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,644.584,644.901,Okay.
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,645.519,646.736,"Well, I don't think it's that high."
1984.83-912,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,670.734,672.753,And they don't take the witness stand.
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,672.753,676.638,Are you saying with the... I think the--
1984.83-912,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,676.638,684.978,I said that 99 percent who don't take the witness stand do not take it for the reason that they've got prior convictions.
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,684.978,688.43,--I would have to agree with that comment.
1984.83-912,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,698.552,708.075,Would you be making the same argument here if the district court hadn't ruled and said that the impeachment would be admissible?
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,708.075,709.176,I'm sorry.
1984.83-912,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,710.909,711.276,Yes.
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,751.336,760.192,"I think that district courts in virtually every case that I found, and every case certainly that's been reported that I'm aware of, the district court does rule."
1984.83-912,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,761.226,764.761,I don't think the courts in the Fifth Circuit--
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,764.761,765.294,--Sixth Circuit.
1984.83-912,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,765.294,765.694,--Yes.
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,769.463,770.165,After this.
1984.83-912,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,784.472,788.459,Doesn't... this circuit leaves it with the discretion of the district judge.
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,788.459,795.03,"Well, I think this circuit requires at some point in time, if the defendant testifies, the court does--"
1984.83-912,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,795.03,807.005,"I know, but if the defendant doesn't testify, he just doesn't go on the stand because he doesn't know if he is impeachment will be offered or not."
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,807.005,810.623,"--That certainly would leave him hanging by a thread, there is no question."
1984.83-912,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,829.953,841.928,"What did a lawyer tell his client 25 years ago, you know, 150 years after the adoption of the Constitution, before there were any such things as motions in limine?"
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,841.928,842.978,I--
1984.83-912,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,842.978,844.463,"That was before your time, I realize."
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,856.771,858.99,"--I don't doubt that, certainly."
1984.83-912,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,881.569,885.54,"Well, under that theory, you could come in at the beginning of a criminal trial."
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,906.07,906.47,No.
1984.83-912,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,906.47,907.436,Where would you draw the line?
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,907.436,916.142,"Well, certainly, I think in this particular instance, we have a rule, a federal rule of evidence which has to be construed at some point in time."
1984.83-912,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,931.652,941.81,"Not having the ruling would just test your skill as a lawyer and your judgment, which is what lawyers always have to exercise."
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,951.748,952.965,"Well, that's true."
1984.83-912,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,957.569,970.71,"Didn't this problem arise only after there were some decisions that, under some circumstances, prior convictions should be excluded if they were too remote or irrelevant or what not?"
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,973.579,974.281,"I believe so, Your Honor."
1984.83-912,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,974.281,975.497,And then the rule followed.
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,975.497,977.097,That is correct.
1984.83-912,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,977.097,987.938,"Now, when you made the motion, did you undertake to present reasons why in this particular case the prior conviction should not be--"
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,987.938,989.456,"Absolutely, judge."
1984.83-912,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,991.423,993.908,--And what was your reason?
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,993.908,1000.579,"My reasonings being... this Court, I am aware, is the author the Gordon decision which predates, of course, the federal rule."
1984.83-912,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1008.135,1009.218,Eight years old?
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,1009.218,1009.704,Eight years old.
1984.83-912,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1108.034,1114.521,Doesn't the rule speak in terms of relevancy outweighing prejudice?
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,1114.521,1118.739,"Well, I think it speaks of probativeness."
1984.83-912,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1118.739,1128.762,"Well, isn't prejudice something that can best be ascertained when the defendant actually takes the stand and testifies?"
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,1128.762,1139.636,"I don't think, Your Honor, that this is the type of area that a defendant would have to testify in, in order for a court to make a ruling."
1984.83-912,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1139.636,1150.777,Could the court make a better or sounder ruling as to the prejudice if the defendant had testified?
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,1171.191,1175.476,"Well, again, in this case, the district court did not feel it needed that information."
1984.83-912,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1196.156,1205.262,"We ordinarily decide abstract questions, and it seems to me until your client takes the stand, this remains an abstract question."
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,1205.262,1209.733,"Again, in the facts of this case, it was not an abstract question."
1984.83-912,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1237.466,1243.203,So what rule do we use to see whether or not the judge was wrong?
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,1245.655,1246.471,In this particular--
1984.83-912,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1246.471,1249.023,"Abuse of discretion, or what?"
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,1249.023,1256.361,"--I believe the Court would have to look to an abusive discretion standard, whether or not the court incorrectly applied the rule."
1984.83-912,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1268.735,1270.704,Is he obliged to?
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,1270.704,1273.056,"I believe he is, Your Honor, under the rule."
1984.83-912,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1273.056,1275.675,And is he obliged to give reasons?
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,1275.675,1278.543,The appellate courts that have spoken--
1984.83-912,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1278.543,1280.843,Is he obliged to give them in writing?
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,1280.843,1282.662,--He did in this case.
1984.83-912,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1293.552,1303.158,It seems to me that the trial judge is in a better position than any of us to decide this point.
1984.83-912,0,32018,james_i_marcus,,1303.158,1304.275,That is correct.
1984.83-912,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1474.601,1480.172,Mr. Kuhlik.
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,1480.172,1493.83,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, petitioner seeks review of an advisory evidentiary ruling when the evidence was never actually offered or admitted at trial."
1984.83-912,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1664.172,1671.426,"Well, the Court of Appeals declined to say whether the district court was right or wrong in ruling on his motion."
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,1671.426,1672.21,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-912,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1672.21,1676.146,And he says the Court of Appeals should have ruled on it.
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,1692.089,1699.326,"Well, he's insisting that the court was wrong, but he's never identified what element of the ruling was incorrect."
1984.83-912,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1699.326,1708.199,"Well, it would be a little odd to come all the way here and say the Court of Appeals should have ruled, if it didn't think the district court was wrong."
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,1708.199,1711.717,"Well, perhaps it might be more clearly--"
1984.83-912,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1711.717,1717.804,"He certainly wouldn't have gotten up in the Court of Appeals and said please rule on this motion, even though it was rightly ruled on."
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,1717.804,1718.739,"--Certainly, Your Honor."
1984.83-912,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1730.464,1745.038,"In the Court of Appeals view, it wouldn't have needed to rule, even if he had said he was going to testify, and even if he had told them what he was going to testify to."
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,1745.038,1746.124,"--That's true, Your Honor."
1984.83-912,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1746.124,1748.592,And disagreed with the Ninth Circuit in that respect.
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,1748.592,1749.709,That's true.
1984.83-912,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1760.166,1763.268,It wouldn't have done him any good to tell them what he was going to testify to.
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,1763.268,1767.487,"--Well, I think it would have been helpful, but I don't think it would have been enough, Your Honor."
1984.83-912,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1812.765,1820.12,"Well, do you think it would be error for the... was it error for the district court, or unwise for the district court to rule on this motion at all?"
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,1820.12,1820.537,No.
1984.83-912,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1823.839,1832.511,But how can it make a sensible ruling until he goes on the stand and then the impeachment is offered?
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,1832.511,1843.136,"--I believe the circumstances, Your Honor, are that the court makes a preliminary ruling that says, based on what I know now, here's what I think I will rule."
1984.83-912,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1843.136,1861.448,"Well, isn't one method that's used for the defense counsel to proffer the testimony, outline what the testimony will be, if he's allowed to take the stand without impeachment, and then if he goes beyond that in any significant way, the judge would be free to alter his ruling."
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,1861.448,1863.598,"Of course, Your Honor, I think that a proffer--"
1984.83-912,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1863.598,1875.79,"If the trial judge... if it's sensible for the trial judge to rule when the defendant makes that kind of a showing, why isn't it sensible for the Court of Appeals to rule on whether the district court was correct?"
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,1875.79,1885.629,"--Because what it is sensible for the district court to do is to make a preliminary ruling and say, based on what I know now, this is how I think I will rule."
1984.83-912,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1897.271,1908.911,"What if the district court listens and then says, I'll tell you, young man, that impeachment evidence is admissible... and then he stays off the stand."
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,1911.696,1913.413,--If he stays off the stand?
1984.83-912,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1913.746,1918.481,"That's this case, so you must say it's never reviewable."
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,1918.481,1927.904,--The broad rule stating that evidentiary claims are only preserved when the evidence is actually admitted is the preferable one.
1984.83-912,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1928.656,1932.808,So your answer is that it's not reviewable if he stays off the stand.
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,1932.808,1938.629,"--That's correct, unless, Your Honor, I suppose there may be an exception in the case of plain error."
1984.83-912,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1947.401,1961.894,"How would the reviewing court ever get at it, unless there had been, as I just suggested a few minutes ago, a proffer by the defense as to what he would testify to if he was permitted to testify free from impeachment?"
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,1964.279,1964.846,--That's true.
1984.83-912,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1974.885,1996.417,"Well, Mr. Kuhlik, what if, as sometimes actually happens, during the motion in limine, defense counsel actually puts the defendant on the stand, out of the presence of the jury for the benefit of the judge, and puts the testimony on the stand and says now, give me your ruling on the motion in limine."
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,1998.85,2009.308,"Your Honor, I think that that situation makes reviewability an easier task, more appropriate, but we don't believe it goes far enough."
1984.83-912,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2009.308,2011.493,"Well, is it... that's not far enough even?"
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,2011.493,2012.51,Let me tell you why.
1984.83-912,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2012.51,2015.029,Because that happens sometimes in trial courts.
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,2015.029,2018.481,"It does, Your Honor, but it creates a host of procedural problems of its own."
1984.83-912,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2023.218,2023.685,Sure.
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,2036.708,2042.779,"--First, Your Honor, I would suggest that the voir dire would also have to include cross-examination by the government."
1984.83-912,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2042.779,2043.548,Yes.
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,2043.548,2061.093,"And to suggest that what is gained is you still... even with the defendant stating that he will take the stand, you still have no guarantee that he would do so; you still have no guarantee that the government, in the event, would decide to introduce the evidence."
1984.83-912,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2061.093,2063.326,"Well, you would certainly have a factual record."
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,2063.326,2074.983,"You would have a better record, Your Honor, but I think that that approach is simply more trouble than it's worth, in a way, that it's... you're talking about taking a lot of time out of a trial."
1984.83-912,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2074.983,2087.577,"But what if the issue weren't impeachment by a prior conviction, but whether the defendant's testimony would be immunized in some way?"
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,2087.577,2088.177,Whether--
1984.83-912,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2088.177,2094.064,"Or, of course, a confession issue."
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,2094.064,2104.937,"--Your Honor, where you're talking about rulings of law that don't depend on an exercise of discretion by the trial court, I think you've got a more appropriate case for review."
1984.83-912,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2116.344,2124.516,"If you're correct, Mr. Kuhlik, the government should cross-examine on this dry run."
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,2139.36,2141.378,"--I think that's perfectly right, Your Honor."
1984.83-912,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2160.523,2162.741,"Well, you couldn't interrupt a trial like this."
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,2167.177,2174.516,"Well, quite obviously, there's no right of the defendant to an interlocutory appeal at this point."
1984.83-912,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2176.301,2179.087,"Mr. Kuhlik, these are normally done before trial."
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,2191.078,2197.548,"--Your Honor, and in that circumstance, the showing of prejudice is particularly difficult for the defendant to make."
1984.83-912,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2239.375,2248.064,"In this case, counsel, do we have to decide, is the question presented, what would be done if a motion is made before trial?"
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,2248.064,2248.664,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-912,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2250.683,2251.249,During trial.
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,2251.249,2256.103,"During trial, although I don't believe the result should be--"
1984.83-912,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2256.103,2259.972,"Perhaps not, but we're confronted only with the narrow question here."
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,2259.972,2267.459,"--Your Honor, I would submit that under any approach that the court would choose to adopt, this conviction should be affirmed."
1984.83-912,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2272.53,2284.17,"So we don't need to decide whether the Court of Appeals was correct in ruling as it did, and saying that it wouldn't make any difference if he had made the showing."
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,2293.276,2296.728,That is the narrowest ground on which you could decide the case.
1984.83-912,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.898,2554.277,"I would think the government, then, would urge, under the Sixth Circuit ruling, would certainly urge district courts not to rule on in limine motions at all; that you just wait till he... let him decide whether he's going to take the stand or not, and then rule on the evidence."
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,2554.277,2564.149,"Your Honor, I think the rulings serve a useful purpose, whether or not they themselves are reviewable, because we're talking about a discretionary rule to begin with."
1984.83-912,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2569.136,2574.54,"Well, how are you going to... how are you going to react to motions in limine?"
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,2583.963,2598.306,"Your Honor, I would suggest that that is far more likely to happen if this Court were to hold that the in limine rulings are reviewable, because that's the circumstance where reversible error is being created without a real showing of prejudice."
1984.83-912,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2612.63,2626.573,"If the defense does not proffer or tender what evidence a defendant will give, if he's allowed to testify free of impeachment, how could any court ever review it?"
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,2626.573,2627.156,"They can't, Your Honor."
1984.83-912,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2658.026,2661.996,Did the court order him to be under oath in that hearing?
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,2661.996,2665.781,"--I don't recall, Your Honor, but I would suggest that he would be."
1984.83-912,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2666.448,2667.248,Is that a recent case?
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,2667.248,2668.083,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.83-912,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2668.083,2669.466,Let's hope not.
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,2669.466,2677.886,That's the kind of difficulties that you get into when you review these sorts of rulings outside of the actual testimony.
1984.83-912,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2743.027,2745.979,"But, of course, the defendant also wants a not guilty verdict."
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,2745.979,2748.281,"Of course, he does, Your Honor, but there are--"
1984.83-912,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2748.281,2749.281,Which isn't subject to appeal.
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,2749.281,2761.838,--There are many circumstances where a defendant's desire to obtain an acquittal in front of his first jury conflicts to some extent with his need to preserve points for appeal.
1984.83-912,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2784.204,2785.739,Is that settled law?
1984.83-912,1,17768,bruce_m_kuhlik,,2785.739,2790.808,"Your Honor, there are some circuits, I believe, that have gone the other way."
1984.83-912,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2824.597,2828.316,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Marcus?"
1984.83-912,2,32018,james_i_marcus,,2828.316,2851.248,"Just briefly, in response to the Chief Justice's question, how can a district court ever review a motion in limine such as the one in this particular case, we submit the factors are present to balance prior to the testimony of the defendant, the age of the earlier conviction, the nature of the earlier conviction, the district court has the charge before it that the defendant's standing trial on."
