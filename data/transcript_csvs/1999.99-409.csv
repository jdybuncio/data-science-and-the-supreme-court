1999.99-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.939,"We'll hear argument next in Number 99-409, the Hartford Underwriters Insurance Company v. the Union Planters Bank."
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,27.4,33.304,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,86.939,96.395,"So you're simply arguing that if the code says nothing, the pre-code practice applies, notwithstanding something like 506(c)?"
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,96.395,97.664,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,115.375,117.508,"Well, here, Congress said the trustee--"
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,117.508,119.243,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,119.243,123.981,"--can bring it, and it doesn't talk about the creditor, so maybe that's a change."
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,125.597,130.735,"Yes, it is, Your Honor, but I think that the part that Congress recognized was the tip of the iceberg."
1999.99-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,149.596,153.666,"Well, I mean, this just looks like pretty clear language."
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,158.802,160.987,"--Actually, Your Honor, yes, my client did."
1999.99-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,160.987,161.337,Yes.
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,161.337,165.474,And the trustee's position was that the trustee had no interest in this case and would not pursue it.
1999.99-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,165.474,174.247,Could you have asked the judge to instruct the trustee to exercise his discretion to collect the... to impose the surcharge?
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,174.247,184.452,"Yes, we could have asked the Bankruptcy Court to do that, but we think that the... it would have been futile, because the trustee had no funds whatsoever to engage in litigation with the secured party."
1999.99-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,184.452,190.356,"So that it would have been abuse, an abuse of discretion for the trustee to go ahead and seek the surcharge?"
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,190.356,208.067,"It would have been, Your Honor, completely futile, plus I think Your Honor would have to recognize in this case that the trustee having no interest in recovery because the trustee had not paid the claim in the first place, one could argue that the trustee having no interest and no incentive and no ability, it simply could not have happened."
1999.99-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,208.067,215.987,Did the trustee in your view in this case have the discretion either to seek the surcharge or not to seek the surcharge?
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,215.987,220.558,"Well, if the trustee had wanted to do so for free, certainly the trustee could have pursued the claim."
1999.99-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,220.558,227.279,"Do you think, if you were the counsel for the trustee, you would have told the trustee that he has discretion not to pursue the surcharge?"
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,227.279,228.897,"Yes, Your Honor, I would, because the State of--"
1999.99-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,228.897,237.587,"So now we're in the position where the code says, with its... within the trustee's discretion not to pursue the surcharge, and yet the creditor can force it."
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,238.92,242.472,"--Well, Your Honor, our position is not that the creditor can force the trustee to do it."
1999.99-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,245.84,246.692,It still seems odd to me.
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,255.096,259.75,"I think perhaps, Your Honor, the question here is not whether the trustee has discretion."
1999.99-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,268.356,278.997,If you had had a prior arrangement with the trustee... I don't know whether you did or not... could an action be brought in State court on the basis of representations?
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,278.997,283.382,"We think, Your Honor, that the remedy here is a remedy under the bankruptcy laws."
1999.99-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,283.382,285.583,"Yes, I didn't... that's not the question I asked you."
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,285.583,285.918,Okay.
1999.99-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,285.918,295.673,I thought maybe the Eighth Circuit had reserved the question of whether there was some right you had to go into Federal court on diversity or State law.
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,295.673,303.029,"I think, Your Honor, that the Eighth Circuit, the en banc decision was merely saying that the only question here is whether there is a question under Federal law."
1999.99-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,303.029,304.512,What did the panel opinion say?
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,304.512,309.099,"The panel opinion, Your Honor, said that we had the right under section 506(c)."
1999.99-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,311.016,320.241,"Had you brought any claims in the district court, or any other court?"
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,320.241,321.174,"No, Your Honor, we had not."
1999.99-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,325.609,334.731,I'm curious about a prior question about what 506(c) covers.
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,334.731,335.25,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,335.25,355.747,"The text of 506(c) says the trustee may recover from property securing an allowed secured claim the reasonable, necessary costs and expenses of preserving or disposing of such property, and I think we're dealing here with Workman's Comp--"
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,355.747,356.43,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,356.43,365.103,--premiums that were incurred after the original Chapter 11 proceeding was begun--
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,365.103,365.486,Correct.
1999.99-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,365.486,367.887,--in an attempt to keep the business going.
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,376.493,377.527,"It did, Your Honor."
1999.99-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,392.503,392.82,Mr.--
1999.99-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,392.82,396.188,"--Yes, but if they operate at a loss, that's not much of a benefit to the secured creditor."
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,398.407,403.811,"Well, Your Honor, I think that the difference is that between liquidation value and going concern value of the gas station."
1999.99-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,403.811,404.511,"Well, put it this way."
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,430.045,430.345,"Well, Your--"
1999.99-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,430.345,432.162,--instead of 503(a).
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,432.162,436.216,"--Well, Your Honor, you never get to 506 unless you go through 503."
1999.99-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,442.186,446.405,Presumably your client is within that general category.
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,446.405,451.208,"There is no dispute, Your Honor, that our claim was allowed as a proper administrative expense."
1999.99-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,451.208,456.945,"But you just want to go now against the real property because that's the only thing there is, I guess."
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,456.945,457.129,Correct.
1999.99-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,458.245,458.579,Yes.
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,458.579,459.445,--a priority for certain claims.
1999.99-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,459.445,468.518,"Okay, but why doesn't it... isn't it limited to something that actually enhances the property as opposed to the broader 503 claim?"
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,468.518,484.694,"Your Honor, in this case it's undisputed that our claim provided a benefit to the secured party, and the reason that it did was because the value which the bank realized from the sale of these businesses as a going concern was actually much greater than the value that they would have received if the gas station had shut down."
1999.99-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,512.297,513.014,"Mr. Brunstad, I have--"
1999.99-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,513.014,519.701,--Who can speak to engage a client such as yours to continue?
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,523.52,538.281,"Well, I think Your Honor should understand that the trustee and creditors are adversaries, and that it would not be... it would be unseemly in the least for a creditor, who is adversary to a trustee, to have to hire the adversary to pursue the creditor's claims."
1999.99-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,538.281,548.57,"Yes, but in the first place, after bankruptcy, who authorizes your client to continue paying for Workman's Compensation?"
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,548.57,549.337,"Oh, I see."
1999.99-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,557.826,559.028,Without any authorization from the trustee?
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,559.028,564.496,"Well, it was authorized, Your Honor, but in the Chapter 11 context it doesn't quite work that way."
1999.99-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,582.291,588.797,"Now, but is the debtor authorized to incur expenses which will be ultimately classified as administrative expenses?"
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,588.797,601.438,"Yes, Your Honor, and that... expenses that are incurred in the ordinary course, the debtor is authorized by statute to continue to incur those expenses, and in this case what we have, Your Honor, is an involuntary creditor."
1999.99-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,614.846,616.698,Even when the premiums were not paid?
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,617.064,623.118,"Once the premiums were not paid, the Hartford then went and issued a default notice to the debtor--"
1999.99-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,623.118,624.884,"--No, my question is this."
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,624.884,625.568,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,625.568,629.355,Let's assume the current premium has not been paid.
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,629.355,629.988,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,629.988,634.926,"Does Hartford, under Missouri law, have the requirement to continue to provide the coverage?"
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,634.926,636.742,"For a period of time, yes, because--"
1999.99-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,636.742,637.192,How long?
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,637.192,641.246,--contractually there is a 30-day notice period before the policy can be cancelled.
1999.99-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,641.246,642.03,For just 30 days?
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,642.03,643.53,That's what the contract provides.
1999.99-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,643.53,647.166,"But you seek for some 6 or 7 months, am I right?"
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,647.166,658.541,"Yes, Your Honor, but what happened during that period of time was that initially a part of the premium was paid when the application for the insurance was submitted, so that was covered for a period of time."
1999.99-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,659.741,661.993,--up front.
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,661.993,664.509,"--I believe it was over $25,000."
1999.99-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,664.509,673.801,"Could not the insurer have said in a situation like this, the debtor is in Chapter 11, I'm not going to be at risk, put up the whole thing in front?"
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,673.801,679.705,"If we had known about the Chapter 11, perhaps we could have done that, but we did not know, Your Honor."
1999.99-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,679.705,686.024,"As soon as you found out about it, couldn't you say, at this point we stop until you pay the premium in advance?"
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,686.024,689.31,"We did not find out until after the policy was terminated, Your Honor."
1999.99-409,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,689.31,698.582,"How does that relate to your argument that you were required to provide insurance anyway because this individual, or the company would have been within the assigned risk pool?"
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,698.582,705.486,"Your Honor, what happened was that they tendered their application with part of the premium, and then the... a period of time went by."
1999.99-409,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,750.717,753.586,"So all you're saying is, we had to start insuring."
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,757.871,758.671,"Correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-409,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,758.671,758.955,Okay.
1999.99-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,758.955,763.275,"Could I ask you about section 506, which is on page 2 of your brief?"
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,763.275,763.791,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,763.791,769.678,It says the trustee may recover necessary costs and expenses of preserving or disposing.
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,773.647,775.582,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,775.582,776.049,Well--
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,776.049,776.882,When the trustee... the trustee--
1999.99-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,776.882,778.451,--That's a reasonable reading of it.
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,778.451,779.084,"--Correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,779.084,784.219,Isn't it also a reasonable reading of it that he can't recover them unless he has expended them?
1999.99-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,784.552,785.154,"Correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,785.154,786.088,When the trustee--
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,799.146,807.067,"--I think that the best reading of the statute, Your Honor, on its plain meaning, is that the trustee, when the trustee expends, then the trustee recovers."
1999.99-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,807.067,807.401,Right.
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,807.401,811.119,"But under prior practice, that was not necessarily the rule."
1999.99-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,819.725,821.061,So long as somebody else had expended.
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,822.877,829.85,"--Somebody has to be out some dollars before they can recover, and it has to be an administrative, allowable administrative expense before you get to 506(c)."
1999.99-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,829.85,838.456,--You agree that the most straightforward reading of the statute is that the trustee can recover any money that he's expended--
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,838.456,838.873,Correct.
1999.99-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,838.873,839.273,--in securing the--
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,839.273,846.026,"That's correct, Your Honor, but that doesn't, of course, tell us what to do when the trustee has not expended and the individual claimant is out--"
1999.99-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,846.026,855.398,"--You would agree, Mr. Brownlee, that the standard situation in which 506 applies is where the trustee has paid out cash, and--"
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,855.398,856.914,--Where the trustee has paid out cash--
1999.99-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,856.914,864.254,"--and then he gets back that cash from the security, from the sale of the secured property."
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,864.254,869.806,"--Correct, Your Honor, and that has always been the uniform rule in the Federal courts including as articulated by this Court."
1999.99-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,869.806,873.841,So how often has 506 applied to credit transactions?
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,873.841,879.376,"It applies in almost every single case, Your Honor, in one way or another, where there is a secured party."
1999.99-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,882.328,883.778,"No, I mean practically."
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,893.95,902.991,"--Correct, but that presupposes, Your Honor, that the trustee paid the expense first, and that presupposes the trustee had funds, unencumbered funds to pay these--"
1999.99-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,902.991,908.209,All I'm suggesting is that that is the core situation to which 506 applies.
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,908.209,908.895,--It is the--
1999.99-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,908.895,910.145,I thought you agreed with me.
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,910.145,925.405,"--It is the logical situation, the paradigm which Congress seemed to have had in mind, and now what we must do is fill in the gap for the part that Congress didn't seem to have in mind, and so the question becomes, do we follow the pre-code practice to fill the gap?"
1999.99-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,925.405,933.86,"Well, that's... you know, you keep talking about pre-code practice, and I looked at your cases, and there isn't all that pre-code practice."
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,943.532,945.918,"The Poznan case was an admiralty case, that's correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,945.918,951.155,That doesn't show a very solid pre-code practice.
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,951.155,960.078,"Well, Your Honor, the case which we rely on from this Court, the Wilson case, I think quite clearly addressed the specific problem and provided the specific solution that we're seeking."
1999.99-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1019.866,1027.137,"Yes, but you're relying on one rather old Supreme Court decision and some lower court decisions following it up."
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1037.661,1039.03,"Well, Your Honor, it was uniform."
1999.99-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1061.043,1072.934,"Well, isn't it possible Congress might have wanted to change this, figuring that what you describe as pre-code practice would attract a certain amount of leeches who wanted to get at the secured property?"
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1072.934,1083.059,"Well, Your Honor, the rule, I think, is one which initially five courts of appeals, and the Eighth Circuit changed its mind, had adopted and the courts had no ability administering."
1999.99-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1103.722,1125.902,"If the trustee chose to seek these funds to surcharge the property and, either by an accounting entry or by the actual receipt of cash, received $25,000, would that be paid 100 percent to you, or could the trustee say, well now, I have my own administrative expenses, too, and other, and there are other administrative... how does that work?"
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1125.902,1144.363,"If the trustee has paid the claim from unencumbered funds of the estate, and the trustee then seeks to recover it from the secured party's collateral, and the trustee is basically replenishing the estate and then the funds would be distributed, but in that situation, of course, the administrative claimant is paid in full--"
1999.99-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1144.363,1153.552,"No, but in my hypothetical he's not quite sure, and so he goes to court seeking authority to pay."
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1159.789,1163.075,--It would go to us if we were the only section 506--
1999.99-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1163.075,1163.908,"No, there are other ones."
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1163.908,1170.661,"--Well, those claimants' claims are not entitled to the priority that section 506(c) provides."
1999.99-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1174.548,1174.982,They say they did.
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1174.982,1179.6,"--Oh, if they did, and they were properly also 506(c) claimants--"
1999.99-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1179.6,1186.273,"They claim that, but he just seeks authority to recover the money for you, and then it's there in the pot."
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1187.373,1196.629,"--If those other claimants' claims were determined ultimately by the court to be entitled to 506(c), we would share with other 506(c) claimants."
1999.99-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1196.629,1200.331,"Do you have to do that under your theory of the case, where you yourself can sue?"
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1200.331,1201.614,Yes.
1999.99-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1201.614,1205.283,So once you get a surcharge you have to share it with everybody else?
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1205.283,1212.27,"I think it's important to understand, Your Honor, that in the bankruptcy case the timing of when claims are presented is not what's important."
1999.99-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1219.524,1219.957,I know.
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1228.898,1231.064,"If they have 506(c) rights, yes."
1999.99-409,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1231.064,1236.568,"Now, are there priorities within the 506(c) administrative claimants?"
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1236.568,1237.102,No.
1999.99-409,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1238.837,1241.706,Including those pre-conversion and post conversion?
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1241.706,1244.824,"No. 506(c) only applies, Your Honor, to post petition."

1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1260.417,1260.917,Yes.
1999.99-409,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1260.917,1262.517,"--but the creditor, who's a big creditor--"
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1262.517,1262.817,Yes.
1999.99-409,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1262.817,1264.619,--thinks I'd certainly like this money in the estate--
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1264.619,1264.802,Yes.
1999.99-409,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1264.802,1266.487,--I want him to bring the lawsuit.
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1269.689,1272.907,"Your Honor, we believe that the Court answered that question in Meyer v. Flemming--"
1999.99-409,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1272.907,1272.907,"Yes, and what's the answer?"
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1272.907,1277.959,"--which is cited in our brief, and the answer is that of course the lawsuit should not be allowed to lapse."
1999.99-409,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1280.061,1284.363,So the creditor can bring his own lawsuit in that case for the benefit of the estate because the trustee wouldn't.
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1284.363,1285.665,"Correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-409,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1285.665,1287.667,And you say that's really the same principle here.

1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1295.236,1296.153,--Conceivably--
1999.99-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1296.153,1297.819,--out there to protect Hartford?
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1297.819,1299.053,--Well--
1999.99-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1299.053,1306.509,Is no notice required to be given to people post petition in a Chapter 11?
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1306.509,1308.211,"--Notice is required, Your Honor."
1999.99-409,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1386.627,1392.262,Was this property... was the business ultimately sold as a going concern here?
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1392.262,1392.831,"Yes, Your Honor."

1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1450.749,1451.717,--I believe all of them.
1999.99-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1454.017,1454.753,Mr. Brunstad--
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1454.753,1455.419,"--No, all of them were, Your Honor."
1999.99-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1455.953,1477.066,"--Mr. Brunstad, in Midlantic, which you say is the case that stands for the proposition of bringing forward pre-code practice if Congress doesn't... we said in codifying the judicially developed rule of abandonment, Congress also presumably included the established corollary, et cetera."
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1477.066,1477.768,"Yes, Your Honor."

1999.99-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1488.374,1491.159,"Well, the tip of the iceberg really isn't a very... I mean--"
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1491.159,1492.611,"--Certainly, Your Honor."
1999.99-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1492.611,1501.884,"--It's certainly... Midlantic is much narrower than saying the statutory... is just the tip of the iceberg, that we bring all sorts of other things with it."
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1501.884,1511.489,"Well, I think, Your Honor, in this case, what should come with 506(c) is the undisputed established pre-code practice."
1999.99-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1514.607,1523.213,"Yes, but it's... Midlantic is talking about, they're codifying something and you can tell from the language of the section that they're codifying it."
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1529.284,1533.153,"Well, Your Honor, the bankruptcy codifies in section 553 rights of set-off."
1999.99-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1548.615,1555.784,"Yes, but set-off and recoupment seem much closer to one another than 506(c) and what you're talking about."
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1555.784,1566.742,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, that actually the opposite is true, and what we're talking about here is a rule that the administrative claimant can come, which is inextricably intertwined with the right of the trustee."
1999.99-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1586.038,1593.559,"Yes, but that's a general statement that really I don't see... how does that aid you in this particular case, when you're talking about 506(c)?"
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1593.559,1622.913,"Because Adair is the case, Your Honor, which articulated the rule which we're relying on here, the general rule that the administrative expenses must be paid out of the secured party's collateral to the extent of the benefit and the court... it would I think be... lead to an absurd result to say that if the trustee doesn't come to court, that the bankruptcy court has no authority to allocate the charges properly, and if the bankruptcy court has authority to do so, any party in interest in the case should be able to come to court to say to the court, this is how it must be done."
1999.99-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1622.913,1634.636,"Well, that would be all the more so if you interpreted 506(c) as allowing the trustee to recover only those expenses that he has paid."
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1634.636,1637.172,"Correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1637.172,1648.444,I think your case gets harder if you read 506(c) to say that the trustee may also recover on your behalf expenses that you've paid.
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1650.246,1652.848,"Well, Your Honor, I think Your Honor's reading is the correct reading."
1999.99-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1668.692,1669.81,Under what section?
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1669.81,1672.06,"Under what section, Your Honor?"
1999.99-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1672.06,1672.41,Yes.
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1672.41,1683.534,"Well, the bank... under pre-code practice, the lower courts often would invoke this rule as a gloss on the court's power to allow administrative claims in addition."
1999.99-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1683.534,1701.579,"But to me that is the difficulty with your position, and the cases where we've said pre-code practice, you can point to a section and say, yes, this brings... this says (a), but it also means the corollary to (a) under prior practice, but you don't have an alternative section to point to."
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1703.615,1710.869,"Well, neither does the doctrine of recoupment, Your Honor, or the doctrine of ear-marking or substantive consolidation, and those are all equitable doctrines which endure under the--"
1999.99-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1710.869,1720.909,"Mr. Brownlee, I'm not... you made a major shift from your brief in response to Justice Scalia's question, and so I'd really like to know what your position is."
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1736.769,1769.823,"--It does, Your Honor, because 506(c) clearly recognizes that expenses of the kind which we are talking about are chargeable against the secured party's collateral, and the question in an in rem bankruptcy proceeding where we're simply talking about dividing up assets, who's going to get what, the question is, can a party in interest come to court and say, this expense should be put in this bucket, or moved here, because the trustee has no incentive or ability to come to court to say it should be so."
1999.99-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1782.067,1784.483,Are you dropping your reliance on 506?
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1784.483,1785.399,"--No, Your Honor."
1999.99-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1813.816,1815.985,Come to court under 506(c)?
1999.99-409,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1819.989,1833.797,"--The Court, under 506(c), following pre-code practice, could rule, and... I think it doesn't make any difference, Your Honor, whether you rely on 506(c) directly or on pre-code practice, but I think that you can rely on section 506(c)."
1999.99-409,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1833.797,1837.332,"Well, if you can't, you lose on the question presented."

1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,1844.038,1849.508,"Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1999.99-409,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1911.064,1931.542,"Well, how could Hartford have avoided losing its claim here, do you think, if there was something that was obtained when the business was sold as an ongoing business, and assuming that the Workman's Comp insurance somehow benefited the property?"
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,1931.542,1948.587,"Justice O'Connor, Hartford's policies were such in this case... you can look at the record below... that it did not know that it was insuring a debtor for a period of some 15 months or so."
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2043.699,2059.243,"Well, what happens in... I don't know that that Meyer case really answers the question, but what happens in the case of a pre-petition, a pre-petition debtor, the pre-petition debtor has a giant claim against General Motors, a lawsuit--"
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2059.243,2059.71,Okay.
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2059.71,2065.813,"--and the trustee doesn't bring the claim, and one of the creditors says, I'd like to bring it."
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2083.109,2102.487,"Well, Justice Breyer, if I could just observe first of all in the Meyer case, it's my reading of the Meyer case that while the Court allowed the principle of the second debtor to proceed with the prefiled proof of claim in the first bankruptcy, it was clear that any recovery would be on behalf of the estate, which is not something that Hartford seeks here."
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2103.67,2124.566,"I know, but what I'm trying to do for my own purposes is to find an analogy, and I know it's a rough analogy, but I would like to know just for my own purposes what happens, and it must happen often, of when a trustee doesn't bring a lawsuit to get some money for the estate, that a big creditor thinks he ought to bring."
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2128.202,2128.935,It's not unusual.
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2128.935,2131.47,And in such circumstances there are two possibilities.

1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2141.978,2143.245,Both exist.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2143.761,2144.428,You can file a motion--
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2144.428,2144.544,--Fine.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2144.544,2146.713,--in the bankruptcy court to compel the trustee to act--
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2146.713,2146.913,Okay.
1999.99-409,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2146.913,2150.332,--or you can seek what is known in many of the cases as derivative standing.
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2150.332,2150.698,Fine.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2157.102,2161.137,Because in this circumstance Hartford didn't follow that procedure.
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2178.079,2183.566,"And now, in your view as a bankruptcy lawyer, if they had, I mean, is that a good way to resolve the problem?"
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2196.309,2202.047,"--Well, Justice, it's not the leeches issue, it's the quality-of-distribution-among-creditors-of-equal-rank issue."
1999.99-409,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2235.018,2235.334,Where does--
1999.99-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2235.334,2235.584,"--Well, can't--"
1999.99-409,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2235.584,2241.938,"--the court have the authority to allow Hartford to proceed, under what section of the code?"
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2241.938,2242.488,There is none.
1999.99-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2242.488,2243.457,Hartford--
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2243.457,2249.361,"I'm not aware of a statutory basis, Justice, for derivative standing."
1999.99-409,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2249.361,2250.078,"--All right, but--"
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2263.085,2271.874,"The bankruptcy courts have developed a body of law wherein they will... some will grant what is called derivative standing, and the cases are cited in the briefs."
1999.99-409,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2294.14,2297.508,"Are those proper cases, and proper holdings in your view?"
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2297.508,2315.72,"--Justice, I don't think... I know that this Court doesn't need to decide whether derivative standing is appropriate on a Nation-wide basis for us to win this case, because I don't think this Court should hold, and I hope it doesn't hold the 506(c), the word trustee means anything other than trustee."
1999.99-409,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2325.076,2335.383,"Well, then I'm not sure why your answer to Justice Breyer isn't that the Hartford goes to the Court, it asks to order the trustee, if the court and the trustee give no relief, there's nothing Hartford can do."
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2335.383,2336.149,"--Well, Justice Breyer--"
1999.99-409,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2336.149,2337.6,I don't know why you didn't say it that way.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2337.6,2340.151,"--I understood asked me a factual question, Justice Kennedy."
1999.99-409,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2362.034,2365.319,Is that pursuit in the bankruptcy court--
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2365.319,2365.786,--In the bankruptcy--
1999.99-409,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2365.786,2366.536,--or in the plenary action?
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2366.536,2367.355,--In the bankruptcy court.
1999.99-409,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2367.355,2367.638,In the bankruptcy--
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2367.638,2368.171,"Now, there is another--"
1999.99-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2368.171,2390.618,"--If we assume that is correct, then, if we assume that is a proper practice, then if Hartford had done two things differently, Hartford would be entitled to recover, I take it, on the assumption that there may be a derivative action, and the two different things are, number 1, Hartford would have to have gone to the trustee, and the trustee would have had to indicate refusal."
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2390.618,2390.951,--Right.
1999.99-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2390.951,2407.711,"And number 2, Hartford, in bringing its suit, would have to have captioned it, Hartford ex rel, or Trustee ex rel Hartford, rather than Hartford, and if those two facts had been different, assuming derivative actions are appropriate, Hartford could recover here."
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2409.746,2413.364,"I don't precisely disagree with the way it's phrased, Justice Souter."
1999.99-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2419.868,2420.137,Okay.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2425.022,2429.493,--I'm not here to argue whether derivative standing is the right approach.
1999.99-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2429.743,2439.349,"Right, but if we assume derivative standing is... I'm making that assumption... what difference does it make whether Hartford gets the court order or doesn't get the court order?"
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2439.349,2439.849,--Because--
1999.99-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2439.849,2441.301,Is it merely orderly procedure?
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2441.301,2444.753,"--No, because if Hartford recovers it has to share with all other creditors of equal rank."
1999.99-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2444.753,2452.672,"Well, Hartford has indicated that that's exactly what it will do, although that's I guess an easy concession, because it says there aren't any."
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2452.672,2455.541,If you could hear me for a minute on that.
1999.99-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2455.541,2456.06,Yes.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2456.06,2464.314,"I believe your question earlier to Mr. Brunstad was pre-conversion or post conversion, and his answer was pre-petition or post petition."
1999.99-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2472.402,2472.769,Ah.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2473.402,2478.204,"--in an 11 that goes to a 7, there can be a bundle of administrative creditors on both sides."
1999.99-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2486.626,2487.293,Well--
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2487.293,2490.928,"--while he says there wouldn't be any others, that's not so--"
1999.99-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2490.928,2491.264,--Okay.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2497.517,2497.85,--He did misspeak.
1999.99-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2497.85,2510.075,He's... I will make the further assumption that any recovery would be subject to the claims of all others in the same class that Hartford is in.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2510.075,2510.458,Correct.
1999.99-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2510.458,2527.703,"Now, if that would be the legal effect of Hartford's recovery here, is the only thing, then, that prevents Hartford from doing that the failure of Hartford to have gone to the trustee in the first place and said, let me bring a derivative action?"
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2527.703,2539.694,"If you are in a district where a judge will allow derivative standing in the name of the trustee, that's correct, because 506(c) talks about an action to recover by the trustee."
1999.99-409,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2610.357,2610.857,Mr.--
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2615.678,2619.379,"--It does not, Justice Stevens, and I did not have the case below--"
1999.99-409,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2619.379,2629.752,"I had understood the record to indicate that this was the only administrative creditor, and that in no event would there be money available for any other, either general creditors or post petition creditors."
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2629.752,2635.139,"--I can tell you this, Justice Stevens... I did not have the case below, so I'm not going to tell you something I don't know, obviously."
1999.99-409,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2677.168,2677.851,"Well, but let me just--"
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2677.851,2678.485,"--Go ahead, Justice Stevens."
1999.99-409,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2679.185,2679.785,--One other question.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2685.572,2692.261,They satisfied the requirements of 503(a) in that they... I'm trying to think which is which.
1999.99-409,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2698.498,2699.181,The bankruptcy judge allowed it.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2699.181,2702.95,"--Yes, and I made... I believe they made a request for allowance and payment."
1999.99-409,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2702.95,2703.3,Yes.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2703.3,2706.704,So I... it's my belief that they did follow 503 at least.
1999.99-409,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2706.704,2715.793,"You see, the thing that troubles me about your position... it's a very difficult case, but the thing that troubles me about your position is, it seems to me it makes 503(a) and (b) meaningless."
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2715.793,2717.876,"Well, let me try to respond to that."
1999.99-409,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2840.772,2846.224,"Is it ever used in these administrative expense areas, that section, 510?"
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2846.224,2854.346,"It's used a lot in winner liability type claims, or any kind of claim where you've got some sort of equitable misconduct, Justice O'Connor."
1999.99-409,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2859.85,2861.851,What about the--
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2861.851,2862.801,I do not know how often it is used.
1999.99-409,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2863.685,2871.707,"--Mr. Brownlee, what about the suggestions that petitioner made of the clean-up costs, or even the Government."
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2886.984,2888.086,Well--
1999.99-409,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2888.086,2890.453,--and the Government would get no tax.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2892.138,2902.762,"--Well, in the first place, in terms of... and I gather your question is, a volunteer comes along post petition and cleans up the property, which directly benefits the property, or the secured creditor."
1999.99-409,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2902.762,2906.63,"Well, he... I'm addressing... I don't remember precisely how he put it in his brief."
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2911.116,2911.784,I'm not sure about that.
1999.99-409,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2911.784,2919.822,--the clean-up costs that could be incurred by a private contractor or by a Government agency to decontaminate the property.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2919.822,2926.026,"Well, if the case is in a Chapter 7, the case is--"
1999.99-409,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2926.026,2927.626,This... it has to be--
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2927.626,2928.309,--Okay.
1999.99-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2928.309,2932.013,"--when it was in 11, because that's what made it possible for the thing to go on."
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2932.013,2969.769,"If the case is in Chapter 11, and the debtor hires a private contractor to come in and clean up dirty property, and that contractor does it, and the court finds that the reasonable and necessary, all of that is met, which it obviously sounds like on those facts, most bankruptcy courts would find that, and the estate becomes insolvent, and the contractor has not protected itself and gotten paid, then the contractor is his administrative claimant in the bankruptcy and is treated of equal rank with all others, and if that's unfortunate, and that means the statute's broke, then the Congress ought to fix the statute."
1999.99-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2969.769,2972.305,So you would... that's a very candid answer.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,2977.792,2996.003,"I'm not aware, Justice Ginsburg, of any super priority for administrative creditors inter se under the 507 priorities of the Bankruptcy Code, except for the one that Hartford asks you today to judicially engraft onto a statute which only provides for the trustee to recover."
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2996.436,3005.359,Is it the case that if the trustee... the trustee himself goes and brings this lawsuit against Justice... she can do it.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3008.161,3008.68,--Absolutely.
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3008.68,3014.048,"And, say, collects $10 million, which happened to be the cost of the contracted-for clean-up."
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3014.048,3014.667,Okay.
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3014.667,3015.117,All right.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3042.984,3044.453,"It's even worse, Justice Breyer."
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3047.705,3048.171,"Well, that's all right."
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3048.754,3050.387,"--And then it goes two-thirds, one-third."
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3050.387,3051.42,--It does.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3051.42,3052.12,I am not aware of--
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3052.12,3052.853,But then there's... that--
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3052.853,3053.339,--Unless there--
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3053.339,3053.822,--Yes.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3053.822,3056.791,--Make sure I don't misspeak as an officer of the court.
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3056.791,3056.791,"Yes, mm-hmm."
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3056.791,3067.897,"Unless there is some Federal statute that grants a priority outside of bankruptcy to clean up contractors because of the importance of the environmental laws, where you'd have a clash between Federal statutes."
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3067.897,3068.849,So then this is a bigger--
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3068.849,3070.999,I'm not aware of a bankruptcy priority.
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3070.999,3080.572,"--All right, so the... (c) has as its purpose simply getting money from the secured creditor into the estate."
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3089.262,3089.712,"Oh, no, Your Honor."
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3090.628,3091.395,Is different.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3091.395,3093.247,--is governed by 726--
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3093.247,3093.447,Wow.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3093.447,3095.249,--in a liquidation.
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3095.249,3096.366,And what was the prior practice?
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3119.864,3123.916,I am not sure that I'm aware of a toxic waste case pre--
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3123.916,3125.268,"No, no, it wouldn't have been toxic waste."
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3126.568,3128.137,--Certainly not in the 1800's.
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3128.137,3142.813,"--A 506(c)... a 506(c) creditor, and then there are non-506(c)'s, but 503(a) creditors, and when the 506(c) creditor brought the suit... I know there wasn't a 506(c) at that time--"
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3142.813,3143.28,I didn't mean to be cute.
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3143.28,3156.538,"--but I mean, that kind of a person brings the suit, collects the $10 million, did he get to keep the whole $10 million, or did he have to throw it in the pool and he only got one-third and the non-506(c) administrative creditors got two-thirds?"
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3157.157,3168.178,"My best answer, and I don't want you to think this is a dodge, because I don't mean it to be, is it's my understanding of the pre-code practice was that it was all over the lot in terms of the equitable rule--"
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3168.178,3168.578,So this is quite--
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3168.578,3169.547,--what the judges decided to do.
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3193.596,3206.553,"--Why would you want to allow such a person, i.e., a 506(c) person, to get from the secured creditor money that he isn't going to keep and he in fact is going to give to two other people--"
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3206.553,3206.87,--Because--
1999.99-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3206.87,3210.291,"--who, vis-a-vis the secured creditor, shouldn't get it?"
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3210.291,3216.195,"--Because, Justice... because of the equality of distribution rules of the Bankruptcy Code."
1999.99-409,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3230.955,3231.571,My question is--
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3231.571,3233.171,--to be... allow you to bring that case.
1999.99-409,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3240.726,3241.293,--Mr. Brownlee--
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3241.293,3241.793,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1999.99-409,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3241.793,3257.17,"--my question is related, and it seemed to me in reading the text of 506(c) and 503 that not every administrative expense under 503(a) would fit under 506."
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3257.17,3258.005,I agree with that.
1999.99-409,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3258.005,3267.128,"506 is limited to the reasonable, necessary costs and expenses of preserving or disposing of the secured property."
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3267.128,3268.661,I agree with Your Honor.
1999.99-409,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3268.661,3271.93,And presumably some wages and salaries don't fit under that.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3278.268,3279.335,"Yes, you're absolutely right."
1999.99-409,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3279.335,3280.235,"Mr. Brownlee, going--"
1999.99-409,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3280.235,3290.159,"--I mean, I could see that 506(c) would be related to things like painting the building, or paying the real estate commission to sell it."
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3291.926,3299.015,"Your Honor, I know you're way past this, but I wished at one point you'd been a bankruptcy judge in our district."
1999.99-409,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3299.949,3300.849,"Well, let me--"
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3300.849,3305.586,"But some courts will find an implied benefit, or find some reason--"
1999.99-409,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3305.586,3306.636,--But wait a minute--
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3306.636,3309.371,--to try to toss these things into 506(c) on the merits.
1999.99-409,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3310.505,3311.49,--But let's clarify one thing here.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3311.49,3312.09,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
1999.99-409,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3312.09,3321.012,"I thought you had agreed that if this action had been brought by the trustee, because the trustee had expended this very money, 506(c) would apply."
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3321.012,3323.63,If this action had been brought by the trustee--
1999.99-409,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3323.63,3327.749,So the fact that it's insurance premiums doesn't distinguish it from paint on the buildings.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3327.749,3328.968,--We fought it below.
1999.99-409,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3328.968,3329.501,And you lost on it.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3329.501,3330.084,And we lost.
1999.99-409,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3330.084,3330.651,Yes.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3330.651,3333.253,I don't think we'd lose in every court.
1999.99-409,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3333.253,3334.688,"No, but for the purposes of our decision--"
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3334.688,3335.388,For the purpose of this case--
1999.99-409,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3335.388,3338.307,--we assume that this is just like paint on the buildings or something like that.
1999.99-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3338.307,3338.774,Mr. Brownlee--
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3338.774,3339.207,--You're absolutely right.
1999.99-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3339.757,3343.878,"--do you have this answer to Justice Breyer's one-third, two-third hypothetical?"
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3392.858,3400.845,"Well, if every administrative creditor qualified to be a surcharging creditor under the standards of 506(c)--"
1999.99-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3400.845,3401.012,Right.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3401.345,3408.468,"--But you're assuming every administrative creditor in the estate does so qualify, and I suggest to you that that hypothetically is an interesting question--"
1999.99-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3408.468,3408.984,"Okay, dumb assumption."
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3408.984,3409.801,--but it doesn't happen in practice.
1999.99-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3409.801,3416.455,"But to the extent that that assumption would be true, is that the way we avoid the one-third, two-third problem?"
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3416.455,3426.028,"To the extent that that assumption is true, if every administrative claim in a case qualifies for a surcharge... let me make sure I understand your hypothetical."
1999.99-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3426.028,3426.18,Yes.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3426.18,3435.535,"And the trustee refuses to act, which is... I won't go into the inconceivability of that, because it would be such a large claim that very few trustees would not be highly incentivized, but if--"
1999.99-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3435.535,3439.737,"We'll assume the trustee is broke and so on, but assume it anyway."
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3439.737,3444.891,"--If it was a large case the trustee would be fixing to get unbroke very quickly when she won, but I don't mean to argue."
1999.99-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3444.891,3445.224,No.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3445.224,3482.782,"Under that assumption, the trustee refuses to act, the bankruptcy court refuses to direct the trustee to act, the bankruptcy court refuses to appoint a new trustee who will act, and the bankruptcy decides, in the exercise of its discretion, without any direct statutory authority, to grant derivative standing, and the Hartford brings the claim in the name of the estate on behalf of all the administrative claims in the estate, and wins on the merits of the individual little lawsuits it will have to prove reasonable, necessary, direct benefit, secured creditor, if that's the hypothetical, then yes, they'll recover and you'll avoid the one-third, two-third problem."
1999.99-409,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3482.782,3485.984,Okay. Suppose a pipe in the building is leaking.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3498.125,3498.808,In practice?
1999.99-409,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3498.808,3499.391,Yes.
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3499.391,3500.025,I'd call the bank.
1999.99-409,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3504.279,3504.962,And anything else--
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3504.962,3506.012,"--I'd call the bank and say, you're building's--"
1999.99-409,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3506.012,3506.545,--you're at risk of--
1999.99-409,1,38754,robert_h_brownlee,,3506.545,3507.731,--going to fall in and it's your collateral.
1999.99-409,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3511.183,3512.349,--And anything else you're--
