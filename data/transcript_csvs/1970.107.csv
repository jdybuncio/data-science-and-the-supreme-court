1970.107,0,38255,paul_a_rosen,,325.171,327.507,Our understanding Your Honor is that they are closed.
1970.107,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,347.246,353.339,There’s a statement on page 11 of the respondent’s brief that rather intrigued me.
1970.107,0,38255,paul_a_rosen,,364.728,365.508,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1970.107,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,400.686,402.828,But do you not -- you don’t actually do what the reference says here or do you?
1970.107,0,38255,paul_a_rosen,,402.828,406.078,"No, I checked on that and I do not know."

1970.107,2,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,2427.165,2432.625,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.

1970.107,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2739.219,2741.058,"What was that time, 1965?"
1970.107,2,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,2741.058,2742.238,"No sir, ’63."
1970.107,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2742.238,2742.86,63?
1970.107,2,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,2742.86,2744.538,63.
1970.107,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2756.738,2761.481,The city had charged admission when these pools were operating.

1970.107,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2773.72,2778.371,"Well, of course in those terms, I suppose, all public parks lose money?"
1970.107,2,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,2778.371,2781.122,"Exactly sir, exactly."
1970.107,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2781.122,2782.994,How many did you have?
1970.107,2,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,2782.994,2790.311,"I’d like to talk about that and I was going to get to it because you’ve asked some questions about it, and I want there to be no misunderstanding."
1970.107,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2808.98,2810.564,Was it from a natural stream?
1970.107,2,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,2810.564,2816.855,"No sir, it was a lake in which people – it had been used for swimming for a long time, but it --"
1970.107,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2816.855,2818.192,There was no stream there?

1970.107,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2898.76,2902.627,And Jackson State is a predominantly Negro institution?
1970.107,2,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,2902.627,2903.452,Predominantly.
1970.107,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2903.452,2905.498,Is it a state institution?
1970.107,2,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,2905.498,2906.766,Yes sir.
1970.107,3,38255,paul_a_rosen,,4188.983,4199.389,Thank you.
1970.107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4251.186,4268.075,"Mr. Rosen, if you were to prevail here, would the City of Jackson be locked in to operating pools irrespective of the economic consequences of that operation?"
1970.107,3,38255,paul_a_rosen,,4268.075,4284.302,"If the question is forever, if it was purely an economic problem having nothing to do with race or opposition integration, they could handle that problem the way any community handles that problem."
1970.107,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4304.497,4306.601,Well this is in the premise of my question.
1970.107,3,38255,paul_a_rosen,,4327.781,4336.37,"If the question is, are they locked in forever because of racial problems which cause a rise in the economic difficulties in operating the pool?"
1970.107,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4383.456,4392.755,"Speaking of the constitution then of your reference to freeman, was there any Thirteenth Amendment claims made throughout this litigation until we got here?"
1970.107,3,38255,paul_a_rosen,,4392.755,4393.432,Yes Your Honor.
1970.107,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4393.432,4393.958,There was?
1970.107,3,38255,paul_a_rosen,,4393.958,4395.503,It was not made in the complaint.
1970.107,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4396.89,4398.179,Not on the complaint you say?
1970.107,3,38255,paul_a_rosen,,4398.179,4399.488,That’s correct.
1970.107,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4408.411,4414.817,"I couldn’t find any reference to the Thirteenth Amendment and the either opinion in the Court of Appeals en banc, but maybe I read it too fast."
1970.107,3,38255,paul_a_rosen,,4414.817,4421.574,"I believe if you’ll look at the concluding paragraph of Judge Wisdom’s opinion, I believe it’s the one."
1970.107,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4426.85,4447.89,"Yeah, well he talks about the, I think the (Inaudible) something where I have the appendix, towards the end of the appendix it would be."

1970.107,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4453.312,4454.753,"Yes, I saw that."
1970.107,3,38255,paul_a_rosen,,4454.753,4458.79,He talks about subordinate or inferior beings.
1970.107,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4460.181,4464.172,"Then he says the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments."
1970.107,3,38255,paul_a_rosen,,4466.21,4467.347,That’s correct.
1970.107,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4467.347,4469.457,None on the court opinion?
1970.107,3,38255,paul_a_rosen,,4469.457,4470.812,None in the three-judge court.
1970.107,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4470.812,4471.607,Court reading?
1970.107,3,38255,paul_a_rosen,,4471.607,4472.378,That’s right.
1970.107,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4472.378,4475.126,"Right, thank you."
1970.107,3,38255,paul_a_rosen,,4475.126,4481.792,The city has maintained that we have not sustained the burden of proof in this case.
1970.107,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4519.485,4521.694,"Thank you Mr. Rosen, gentlemen."
1970.107,4,45219,william_m_kunstler,,4522.377,4525.502,"Before we go, my I introduce, we have two young men at the play."
1970.107,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4537.242,4538.354,Very well.
1970.107,4,45219,william_m_kunstler,,4538.354,4544.022,And then William Goodman who worked with us.
