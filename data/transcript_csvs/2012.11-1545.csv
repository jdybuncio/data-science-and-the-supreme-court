2012.11-1545,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.939,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-1545, City of Arlington, Texas v. The Federal Communications Commission and the consolidated case."
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,11.808,14.191,"Mr. Chief Justice, thank you very much."
2012.11-1545,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,63.573,83.201,"Mr. Goldstein, this case has been presented in a very complicated way, but it seems to me that what we're dealing with is a rule adopted by the Commission, and the Commission's rule-making power, as you know, is very broad."
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,103.615,110.118,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, the question on which you granted certiorari was how to decide that question, not what is the answer to that question."
2012.11-1545,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,119.308,119.641,All right.
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,120.824,121.041,Yes.
2012.11-1545,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,121.041,124.51,"Or I -- I grant you, I don't see any reason for that."
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,175.911,176.345,Okay.
2012.11-1545,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,176.795,181.548,"That -- at some point -- you don't have to go into it at all if you don't want to, but I just want to put that on the table."
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,182.048,186.083,"--Justice Breyer, I do want to talk about it."
2012.11-1545,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,186.833,190.154,"You don't have to talk about it now, but you can talk about it whenever you want."
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,190.504,191.087,--I appreciate it.
2012.11-1545,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,202.978,206.514,But the abstract question really isn't presented.
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,231.545,236.014,"--Justice Ginsburg, you and Justice Breyer have both asked me to turn to that question, so I'm going to do it."
2012.11-1545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,248.591,251.042,"Well, don't, because I don't -- I don't think it's so clear."
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,251.509,252.409,All right.
2012.11-1545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,252.409,262.248,"Look, what you've told us is jurisdiction means a lot of things, but what you mean by it is real jurisdiction, right?"
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,262.248,264.45,I mean -- what I mean by it--
2012.11-1545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,264.45,266.302,Chevron Step Zero jurisdiction.
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,281.145,282.028,--Yes.
2012.11-1545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,282.028,282.895,Okay?
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,285.097,285.847,That would.
2012.11-1545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,286.147,286.632,Okay.
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,296.987,298.856,--That is a different kind of jurisdictional question.
2012.11-1545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,355.11,357.228,I -- I don't think so.
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,380.141,380.943,I do.
2012.11-1545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,380.943,383.46,--to the -- to the entry question--
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,383.46,383.879,I do.
2012.11-1545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,383.879,393.151,"--of whether the FCC has the jurisdiction to administer the Federal Communications Act, I agree with you."
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,432.61,432.96,Okay.
2012.11-1545,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,450.572,464.931,"Are there some statutes where parts of the statute are subject to agency's Chevron rulemaking authority, and its zero plus one jurisdiction and other parts are not?"
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,490.482,490.782,Yes.
2012.11-1545,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,531.709,545.383,So your understanding of jurisdiction and what you're arguing for today is nothing more or less than this is a provision as to which Congress did not give the agency law-making authority.
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,554.489,555.424,--That is correct.
2012.11-1545,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,569.365,569.684,All right.
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,574.903,575.336,--Yes.
2012.11-1545,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,575.336,591.097,"--is simply because the means by which Congress made clear it was not giving the FCC authority to get deference, however that is phrased, is this 7(a) which speaks about nothing will limit the authority of the States."
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,591.097,591.314,It's that--
2012.11-1545,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,591.314,599.953,"If it weren't for that, if it were some other type of provision, we wouldn't call it jurisdiction, but we would just say the FCC doesn't get deference to it."
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,599.953,603.071,--It would be a very easy jurisdictional question.
2012.11-1545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,618.481,627.686,That's -- that's no different from our holding in any case that the agency has no authority to issue this rule.
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,636.792,637.709,--Justice Scalia--
2012.11-1545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,637.709,641.28,It's -- it's always a question of how much authority Congress gave the agency.
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,641.28,646.415,"--We disagree, and I understand that you have a vision of how Chevron deference operates."
2012.11-1545,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,672.382,674.084,"Mr. Goldstein, at one level you are right."
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,731.838,732.956,"Justice Kagan, I disagree."
2012.11-1545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,789.292,798.998,"Did it say in all of those cases, we give no deference to the agency's contrary determination because this is a jurisdictional question?"
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,800.098,800.684,--It did not.
2012.11-1545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,801.15,801.884,I didn't think so.
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,801.884,805.052,"--Justice Scalia, I will tell you this, I am not overclaiming the cases."
2012.11-1545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,809.706,822.848,"Very often I could decide a case -- you know, the lower courts are running away from the question of deference vel non because things have been so confused by Meade."
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,834.238,835.471,"Justice Scalia, let me tell you why--"
2012.11-1545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,835.471,837.773,"Whether it was or not, it would have come out this way."
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,840.575,842.011,"--Justice Scalia, here's why I disagree."
2012.11-1545,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,856.235,862.473,"And could you add that in those three cases, or at least Meade, some respect was given to the agency's due."
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,862.473,862.958,"Yes, absolutely."
2012.11-1545,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,862.958,866.626,It was just not the sort of deference that -- under Chevron.
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,866.626,867.692,Absolutely.
2012.11-1545,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,867.692,870.344,"But take Meade, Mister -- I'm sorry."
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,870.344,870.761,I did.
2012.11-1545,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,876.848,892.96,"Meade presented -- whatever you think of Meade, it's a very different question from this, because what the majority in Meade said was that the agency wasn't entitled to deference because it was acting by way of these opinion letters that weren't -- that didn't have the force of law."
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,916.392,916.642,Okay.
2012.11-1545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,945.976,961.235,"Before you get to that, I'm really surprised at your response to Justice Kennedy that you agree that, even where the agency has no jurisdiction, although you won't give Chevron deference, you will give whatever the other kind of deference."
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,961.235,961.552,--Skidmore.
2012.11-1545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,961.552,970.241,"Why would you give Skidmore deference if some non-jurisdictional agency comes in and says, hey, by the way, court, you know, I think this is the right answer?"
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,980.133,993.123,"Because, Justice Scalia, Skidmore deference is, as you know, of course -- and you have been a very powerful critic of it, obviously, in your opinions -- that it is the -- you give the agency the respect of the persuasiveness of its opinion."
2012.11-1545,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1003.081,1008.2,"And you might also have said, it seems to me, that that assumes the issue, assumes the premise."
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1010.752,1011.468,And that--
2012.11-1545,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1011.468,1019.191,"If you say there is no jurisdiction, why do you give deference, that assumes the very step, the very question we are trying to resolve."
2012.11-1545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1019.191,1020.96,And that's all you think that Skidmore deference means?
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1026.262,1028.214,--We -- the Court has -- I am quoting the Court.
2012.11-1545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1028.214,1031.065,"But just to agency opinions it makes sense, not to--"
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1031.065,1032.867,"It more than makes sense, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-1545,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1049.943,1059.049,"Mr. Goldstein, in following that, it seems to me you -- you are basing your argument on what is said in 7(a)."
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1081.848,1082.331,--Yes.
2012.11-1545,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1082.331,1094.239,I just don't understand how the FCC's general rule-making authority is removed as to a provision that limits what the State and local governments can do.
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1094.239,1094.508,All right.
2012.11-1545,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1157.462,1164.818,"But you are skipping over (2), which is the phrase “ reasonable time ”."
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1164.818,1166.603,"--I could read the whole thing, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.11-1545,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1173.439,1175.541,Just on a practical level--
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1175.541,1175.841,--Yes.
2012.11-1545,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1175.841,1190.818,"--what sense does it make to read this to say that each time there is a dispute that comes to the Court, the Court will decide in that particular case, with no guide at all, what the reasonable time is?"
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1190.818,1193.087,I will now turn to that question.
2012.11-1545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1231.176,1234.378,"--Suppose I didn't know that and I'm just looking at the text, okay?"
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1234.378,1234.68,--Yes.
2012.11-1545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1234.68,1248.905,"There are innumerable statutes which, after giving the agency rule-making authority, provide judicial -- you know, review under this statute shall be held in such-and-such a court."
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1264.08,1276.472,"Justice Scalia, my point is that it is a point in our favor, particularly when you compare -- (b)(5) has two parts, in addition to the statutory history which told the FCC to cancel the rule-making on this point."
2012.11-1545,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1344.612,1349.0,How do you know -- how do you know when it's 30 days after a failure to act?
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1349.0,1356.92,"That, Justice Ginsburg -- just to put this in context, the government says that the FCC was concerned that the wireless companies wouldn't know when to go to court."
2012.11-1545,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1361.141,1363.158,"Well, I wouldn't know when to go to court."
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1371.579,1372.179,Yes.
2012.11-1545,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1372.179,1378.602,Does that bear on the Chevron Step Zero analysis on the question of what you call jurisdiction?
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1378.602,1379.769,"It does, Justice Kennedy."
2012.11-1545,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1379.769,1380.102,All right.
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1392.743,1393.16,Okay.
2012.11-1545,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1422.896,1427.114,Where does that say anything about what you just read about what is a reasonable time?
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1427.114,1427.864,--Yes.
2012.11-1545,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1427.864,1429.05,Was that at 209?
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1429.05,1430.683,"That was at 210, Justice Kennedy."
2012.11-1545,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1447.661,1452.063,"Mr. Goldstein, could you go back to the question presented?"
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1452.063,1452.415,--Sure.
2012.11-1545,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1452.415,1465.306,"I have read a lot of briefs in this case and I don't have any idea what to tell a lower court, how to articulate the tests or how to apply it."
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1465.306,1465.706,Yes.
2012.11-1545,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1465.706,1477.031,Given that you started with saying it's almost impossible to talk about what's jurisdictional and what's an application of jurisdiction.
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1482.685,1490.521,The lower courts decide de novo whether the agency was given the power to interpret a particular provision with the force of law.
2012.11-1545,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1494.908,1496.258,So that's what the court here did.
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1501.062,1502.681,--It did not--
2012.11-1545,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1502.681,1505.633,--to pass regulations with respect to this Act.
2012.11-1545,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1528.378,1529.163,--Here's where it went wrong.
2012.11-1545,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1581.046,1581.463,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1587.166,1589.268,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1545,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1616.186,1618.455,As -- as to that specific provision?
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1618.455,1619.755,"No, in general."
2012.11-1545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1634.916,1644.955,"Well, that's right, but your argument it seems to me can't be -- let's say you have a general statute and you've got a provision at the beginning that says this is -- authority to interpret this is delegated to the agency."
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1658.08,1659.282,"I would not, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.11-1545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1659.282,1661.734,"No, you would say you don't get deference on 123."
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1713.416,1736.448,"Well, I'm not sure I agree with that, Mr. Chief Justice, because I think the point here is that to the extent, once you've satisfied that general threshold that I identified, then to the extent there is ambiguity -- if the statute is clear and in Your Honor's hypothetical I'd submit the statute is clear at that point that the agency -- that the agency's authority has been carved out with respect to that particular provision."
2012.11-1545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1744.388,1751.724,"Ambiguity in the provision that says, agency, you get no deference, or ambiguity in the substantive provision at issue?"
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1751.724,1753.159,"--Either one, because--"
2012.11-1545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1753.159,1761.73,"Well, but if there's no ambiguity on the provision that says you get no deference, then it doesn't matter whether there's ambiguity on the subsidiary one, right?"
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1761.73,1762.132,--That's correct.
2012.11-1545,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1888.58,1889.032,All right.
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1904.892,1909.796,--Our position -- let me walk through the steps of our position and how we answer the question presented.
2012.11-1545,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1909.796,1910.028,All right.
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1913.497,1933.225,"Here's our answer to the question presented, Justice Sotomayor: That there is de novo review of the question of whether Congress has delegated authority to the agency generally to act with the force of law and whether the interpretation claiming deference is an exercise of that delegated authority."
2012.11-1545,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1990.498,1992.148,So deal with the three cases he mentioned.
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1992.148,1998.686,"--Louisiana Public Service Commission, a little bit of confusion I think about that case."
2012.11-1545,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2115.109,2141.243,"Well, what worries me about it is you and I both have in our offices thousands of words which are in the U.S. Code and there are hundreds of thousands -- or millions of employees in millions of different kinds of agencies, and if we turn Chevron into the tax code, it's going to be a nightmare -- in my opinion, not necessarily in that of my colleagues."
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2212.153,2213.672,So--
2012.11-1545,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2213.672,2216.291,"I mean, that's such a simple -- I mean, that's Louis Jaffe."
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2226.996,2228.046,--Two points.
2012.11-1545,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2243.874,2244.624,I didn't make it up.
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2245.974,2249.944,--I understand that Your Honor is the most recent proponent of this approach.
2012.11-1545,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2249.944,2250.328,That's no better.
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2254.363,2286.134,"But -- but I think the Court is in a different place, and I think the Court is in a different place for a good reason, because I think it's our interpretation of Chevron that avoids turning it into the complexity of the Internal Revenue Code, because I think if you think about what my friends on the other side are proposing here, what they're suggesting is that once you've cleared that initial hurdle of deciding the agency has general authority to implement the statute with the force of law and that this is an exercise of that general authority and, therefore, not--"
2012.11-1545,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2286.134,2293.973,"I mean, I think I can show, which I will spare you at the moment, all the cases like Meade are consistent with what I said."
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2306.631,2309.817,--I guess I would beg to differ about that.
2012.11-1545,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2317.923,2327.378,"Justice Breyer would replace that with a rule where they like the agency to have authority, it has it, and where they don't like it to have authority, it doesn't."
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2329.396,2330.196,I guess--
2012.11-1545,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2330.196,2332.848,--a description of the Chevron--
2012.11-1545,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2332.848,2334.8,You don't have to -- I'm sorry I brought this up.
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2334.8,2363.967,"--With respect to the issue that's in front of the Court now, I think -- what my friends on the other side are asking is actually for an additional layer of complexity in the analysis, even after the general authority is established to make rules with the force of law, and even after it's established that the rule at issue is -- has been done in the exercise of that, my friends on the other side suggest that there is another layer of de novo review there to answer the question of whether this particular provision--"
2012.11-1545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2363.967,2365.236,"Right, well--"
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2365.236,2366.969,--gives authority to act with the force of law.
2012.11-1545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2366.969,2379.496,"--Your friend on the other side has another set of arguments about why you should treat this particular provision differently, and that is because it concerns the authority, or lack thereof, of state and local government agencies."
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2382.715,2383.565,Yes.
2012.11-1545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2383.565,2397.958,"We are not talk -- you know, obviously the dividing line between state authority and federal authority is a more significant one than some of the other questions as to which agencies get deference, which is whether rates are reasonable or not reasonable."
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2414.419,2420.656,"It is definitely a pertinent consideration, Mr. Chief Justice, and let me talk about that in general and then move to the specifics of this case."
2012.11-1545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2440.218,2446.521,"Normal -- I'm sorry I interrupt you, but the normal rules of statutory construction include a clear statement rule?"
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2446.521,2455.477,"--Well, when the question is whether Congress -- let me try to use this with a specific case, the Solid Waste of Cook County case."
2012.11-1545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2479.861,2482.095,Who has that -- who has to be clear on their statement?
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2482.813,2484.097,--Congress has to be clear in its--
2012.11-1545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2484.097,2486.764,That it intended to intrude upon state authority?
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2486.764,2488.448,"--To give that authority to that extent, exactly."
2012.11-1545,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2488.448,2497.656,"But the agencies have no historic responsibility or tradition, quite unlike Article III courts, of safeguarding the federal balance."
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2497.656,2505.726,"But Chevron Step One is, of course, applied by the courts, Justice Kennedy, and that's where the protection comes in, and with respect to this particular--"
2012.11-1545,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2505.726,2507.928,"--I don't understand the question, to tell you the truth."
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2543.101,2547.589,"--That is the -- was going to be my specific point in response to your question, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.11-1545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2547.589,2548.422,"No, it wasn't going to be that."
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2565.633,2583.428,"Yes, but there is a third variable here and that's what's key, which is in this situation, in 332(c)(7)(B), the limitations provision, Congress has spoken unambiguously and said that the following limitations on local zoning authority must be respected."
2012.11-1545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2583.428,2583.711,Yes.
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2583.711,2591.081,And no one has suggested that that was at the outer limit of Congress's commerce clause authority or anywhere closer to it.
2012.11-1545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2591.081,2603.739,"But it also said, it also said in (7)(a) that those are the only limits, not add on to this any limits that unelected bureaucrats might decide to impose, and will give them -- and the courts must give them vast deference in enforcing those limits."
2012.11-1545,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2603.739,2605.274,Unelected federal bureaucrats.
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2606.291,2617.816,"But I do think -- I do think that what Justice Scalia said is correct, that the question here is not whether the States will decide."
2012.11-1545,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2624.136,2625.838,Don't you think that the--
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2625.838,2629.123,--whether federal courts will make those decisions on a case-by-case basis--
2012.11-1545,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2629.123,2643.066,--Don't you think that the issue of whether unelected federal bureaucrats should decide it or unelected federal judges should decide it is an issue of separation of powers rather than an issue of -- of federal/state relations?
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2643.066,2648.87,--I do think -- in that respect I think this case is really just like Iowa Utilities Board in that the argument there--
2012.11-1545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2648.87,2650.403,Is it AT&T versus--
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2650.403,2650.753,--Yes.
2012.11-1545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2650.753,2651.739,--Okay.
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2651.739,2670.466,In that -- the argument there was that you ought not to interpret the FCC to have authority to implement particular rules because Congress gave to State public utility commissions the responsibility to carry out and execute the rules and then to federal courts the power to review them and cut the FCC out.
2012.11-1545,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2678.306,2678.722,Okay.
2012.11-1545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2679.139,2688.161,"But in rejecting that argument in Section 2 of the opinion, the author of that opinion in nowhere, in no place applied Chevron deference in answering that question."
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2696.565,2701.219,"--I -- I understand that the petitioners made that argument, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.11-1545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2767.661,2768.313,Does it cite--
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2768.313,2769.563,--It does not.

2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2780.588,2781.488,--It does not.
2012.11-1545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2781.488,2783.039,Does it say they are applying Chevron deference?
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2783.039,2783.939,It does not.
2012.11-1545,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2881.803,2883.519,"--I dissented in that, I think."
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2883.519,2885.488,"--Yes, you had a different view."
2012.11-1545,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2885.488,2886.088,Right.
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2919.292,2923.163,"That's certainly how we understand the situation, Justice Breyer, that the agency--"
2012.11-1545,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2923.163,2924.08,What was added?
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2924.08,2932.552,"--It interpreted the meaning of the language “ reasonable time ” to give it more precise content, to allow -- to deal with the failure to act situation."
2012.11-1545,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2932.552,2935.688,"Can you tell me, what is -- what is the ambiguity?"
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2952.799,2965.94,"Well, our view, Justice Ginsburg, is that there isn't any ambiguity, that the rule ought to be upheld no matter what standard of review applies, in fairness to my friends on the other side."
2012.11-1545,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2970.158,2977.629,"I thought “ reasonable ” was what people were talking about as being ambiguous, although I don't think “ ambiguous ” is the proper word."
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2981.616,2987.186,--I took that -- I think that's it's -- it's certainly susceptible to further elaboration in that sense.

2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2997.292,2997.458,--Right.
2012.11-1545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3024.859,3026.811,You're talking about (7)(B).

2012.11-1545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3140.633,3152.606,"Well, but your argument there is basically saying when the statute says something is reasonable, it means that the Commission doesn't have -- it's a jurisdictional question whether it's reasonable or unreasonable."
2012.11-1545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3175.787,3178.906,"No, I don't think it is, Mr. Chief Justice."
