2012.11-1175,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.82,"We will hear argument next in case 11-1175, Marx versus General Revenue Corporation."
2012.11-1175,0,17307,allison_m_zieve,,7.954,11.256,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,66.79,69.625,"Under -- under that provision, that's certainly true."
2012.11-1175,0,17307,allison_m_zieve,,107.783,118.425,"--Well, there's no need to consider repeal by implication in this case, Your Honor, because Rule 54(d) expressly states that its presumption does not apply for a Federal--"
2012.11-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,118.425,123.162,"Yes, indeed, but -- but you are assuming a conflict."
2012.11-1175,0,17307,allison_m_zieve,,158.133,178.647,"--Your Honor, if you look at Section k(a)(3) as a whole, the two sentences together confirm that this is not a provision about bad-faith plaintiffs, but, rather, the provision is addressing both fees and costs to -- to plaintiffs and defendants."
2012.11-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,196.877,198.893,"Well, there are a number of reasons."
2012.11-1175,0,17307,allison_m_zieve,,246.024,248.976,"--Well, you've made a few points, and I'll try to address each of them."
2012.11-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,314.052,321.274,Didn't -- don't district courts always have the authority to award costs for sanctionable behavior like bad faith?
2012.11-1175,0,17307,allison_m_zieve,,336.534,353.579,"--Well, if you read this sentence as a misconduct provision, then it does repeat the court's inherent authority; although, as this court has mentioned in a couple cases, sometimes statutes want to reiterate authority that exists elsewhere."
2012.11-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,366.803,367.653,It limits Rule 54.
2012.11-1175,0,17307,allison_m_zieve,,367.653,368.172,Right.
2012.11-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,368.172,373.724,I think your -- your answer is always that Rule 54 obligates court to give costs.
2012.11-1175,0,17307,allison_m_zieve,,382.996,388.132,"Well, Rule 54 doesn't obligate a court to give costs; it establishes a presumption--"
2012.11-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,388.132,388.684,True.
2012.11-1175,0,17307,allison_m_zieve,,388.684,394.221,--and this says the presumption is limited to cases brought in bad faith and for purposes of harassment.
2012.11-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,428.708,448.336,"Ms. Zieve, when I look at other statutes, it seems to me we would want to look at statutes involving lenders, so we would look at the Truth in Lending Act and the -- what is it, the Credit Organizations Act--"
2012.11-1175,0,17307,allison_m_zieve,,448.336,449.872,Fair Credit?
2012.11-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,449.872,453.424,--and those do not provide for attorney's fees.
2012.11-1175,0,17307,allison_m_zieve,,510.993,524.17,"Well, first, Your Honor, the Congress's purpose was not simply to -- this isn't just a defendant-friendly provision."
2012.11-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,781.987,790.76,"I would assume that if Rule 54, instead of saying what it currently does, said something like"
2012.11-1175,0,17307,allison_m_zieve,,809.154,821.029,--If Rule 54(d) incorporated a requirement that a statute expressly referred to Rule 54(d)?
2012.11-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,821.029,823.997,Expressly repealed 54(d).
2012.11-1175,0,17307,allison_m_zieve,,823.997,827.016,That would be a very different case.
2012.11-1175,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,864.641,865.558,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1175,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,873.062,879.817,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,976.612,985.551,"I mean, my problem with this is I don't -- I mean, I read the whole statute, and they have a good claim until I think you read the whole statute."
2012.11-1175,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1034.115,1039.185,"Well, Justice Breyer, I think it does expressly mention costs both in the first and the second sentence."
2012.11-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1039.185,1043.737,"I didn't say on some technical linguistic basis, it may do that, that's correct."
2012.11-1175,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1065.086,1065.636,"Well, Your Honor--"
2012.11-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1065.636,1069.288,I don't see anything in the consequences that suggests that you get rid of the background rule.
2012.11-1175,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1082.112,1090.035,"--Well, Your Honor, if Congress were satisfied with the background rule, then I think it's strange that they added the words “ and costs ” to a sentence that is expressly--"
2012.11-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1090.035,1090.385,"Oh, why?"
2012.11-1175,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1107.58,1116.686,"--Your Honor, I think that gets back to Justice Ginsburg's question of why weren't they just saying “ and costs ” here just to make clear that not only fees would be available but also costs."
2012.11-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1142.836,1144.22,"And that's if you had been drafting it, perhaps."
2012.11-1175,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1151.942,1153.311,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2012.11-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1153.311,1159.132,"And the -- the general instruction would be add attorney's fees on the plaintiffs, and add attorney -- all right."
2012.11-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1160.098,1162.666,We -- we have to assume ignorance of the drafter.
2012.11-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1162.666,1165.035,"Yes, ignorance of other laws."
2012.11-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1165.035,1165.935,As a general principle.
2012.11-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1165.935,1167.518,"That's right, general ignorance."
2012.11-1175,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1167.885,1169.97,"--Your Honor, let me -- let me address that directly."
2012.11-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1197.84,1199.157,"Well, then they shouldn't have put those words in."
2012.11-1175,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1222.205,1224.49,"--Your Honor, the words “ and costs ” appear in both sentences."
2012.11-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1232.078,1233.263,It doesn't -- where does it say that?
2012.11-1175,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1233.996,1234.546,"Your Honor, first of all--"
2012.11-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1234.546,1235.23,--I would like to read it.
2012.11-1175,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1235.23,1239.584,--you can look at -- there is no legislative history directly addressing the sentence we're trying to interpret today.
2012.11-1175,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1258.045,1260.247,"Well, that's a pretty odd way to balance."
2012.11-1175,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1266.067,1268.151,"Well, the reason not to give--"
2012.11-1175,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1268.151,1272.221,That's a very curious way to dilute what was otherwise a defendant-friendly provision.
2012.11-1175,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1272.221,1275.757,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't think the provision is uniquely defendant friendly."
2012.11-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1306.811,1308.278,Did you look up -- did you try to do any sampling on that?
2012.11-1175,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1334.478,1335.195,--Your Honor--
2012.11-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1335.195,1338.247,--But it isn't quite as good a point as you seem to suggest.
2012.11-1175,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1342.817,1344.351,"--Well, Your Honor, plaintiffs--"
2012.11-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1344.351,1344.851,--in order to make it.
2012.11-1175,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1344.851,1350.238,--Plaintiffs here are uniquely likely to be deterred because they're the kind of people who have been pursued by debt collectors.
2012.11-1175,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1414.563,1429.757,"Am I to understand your simple position to be that what Rule 54(d) says is if another provision deals with costs, you're relegated to that other provision."
2012.11-1175,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1429.757,1431.042,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2012.11-1175,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1431.042,1437.529,"Unless, and this -- you're inverting the express -- unless that provision refers you back to 54."
2012.11-1175,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1437.529,1439.429,"--Well, no, Your Honor, I'd qualify that a little bit."
2012.11-1175,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1480.54,1481.392,Finish that sentence.
2012.11-1175,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1481.392,1490.68,We don't think there's any need to adopt some new special rule for Rule 54(d) that's different from how this Court normally applies specific governance to general principle.
2012.11-1175,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1491.263,1492.063,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1496.151,1500.603,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1547.398,1567.793,"Ms. Blatt, it -- it seems to me that the -- the most natural way to read this statute, and it's not -- it's not your way, it's, look, we have this Federal Rule of Civil Procedure that -- that contemplates that Congress sometimes doesn't write -- it writes statutes authorizing lawsuits without providing a cost provision."
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1608.437,1609.003,Yes.
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1612.055,1612.506,I expected you might.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1613.323,1615.875,--This is not a field preemption case.
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1615.875,1617.942,It's not a question of field preemption.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1617.942,1618.244,"Yes, it is."
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1640.324,1640.941,Maybe I'm--
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1640.941,1641.591,--you don't get there.
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1641.591,1644.443,--not in the business of trying to figure out what Congress's intent is.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1652.899,1653.75,"Okay, here's why it doesn't."
2012.11-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1676.731,1689.924,"In -- in that respect, it is different from RadLAX, in which the two provisions -- where we held the specific covers the general, but we held that because the two provisions contradicted each other."
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1689.924,1700.112,"--Not only do they not contradict, this is not a specific -- when you said -- the other thing I disagreed with, when you said this comprehensively addresses costs, no, this comprehensively is about attorney's fees."
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1700.112,1700.612,It's both.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1701.398,1701.898,It is--
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1701.898,1728.899,"And if I might say, I mean, you object to this statute; it's perfectly reasonable to say Congress should have written a separate provision about costs and attorney's fees, but for whatever bad, good or indifferent reason, Congress didn't; and so this statute basically says, here's what prevailing plaintiffs get as to both costs and fees; here is what prevailing defendants get--"
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1728.899,1731.101,"--That's not correct, it doesn't mention prevailing--"
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1731.101,1734.786,"--under what circumstances, as to both costs and fees, and those are the rules."
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1734.786,1735.27,--Yes.
2012.11-1175,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1760.468,1764.67,"By all 50 titles, you don't mean each title, do you?"
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1764.67,1767.788,"--We've -- we've looked for all, we've looked at all the cost provisions."
2012.11-1175,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1767.788,1769.907,Like in Title IX--
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1769.907,1770.29,Yes.
2012.11-1175,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1770.29,1770.824,--And Title XI?
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1770.824,1771.174,Yes.
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1828.928,1833.997,"This statute is very -- is very normal if it were just about fees, right?"
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1853.644,1853.961,--Right.
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1853.961,1862.1,"Now you might say that's very uncommon, but in both sentences it says, we want the same rule for costs as we do for fees."
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1862.1,1866.201,"Well, I mean, a couple things about that."
2012.11-1175,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1874.491,1878.126,And with that is that there are some statutes that don't.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1878.126,1878.545,Yes.
2012.11-1175,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1878.545,1881.497,So it's not always peanut butter and jelly.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1881.497,1881.913,Okay.
2012.11-1175,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1881.913,1883.297,It's peanut butter and honey sometimes.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1883.997,1884.38,Yes.
2012.11-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1885.449,1886.199,Love and marriage.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1887.315,1888.084,--I don't know about that one.
2012.11-1175,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1925.49,1926.276,Suppose you're right.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1944.42,1945.67,Right.
2012.11-1175,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1945.67,1950.057,"And under theirs, it's if you win, you get 2 or $3,000, and if you lose, at least you don't lose anything."
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1950.057,1950.874,Yes.
2012.11-1175,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1954.909,1955.628,"Oh, it could be worse."
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1955.628,1957.261,"--No, it couldn't be worse, and here's why."
2012.11-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2002.609,2022.338,"Ms. Blatt, we do have in this case the views of the government regulators, the FTC and the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, and we have heard the government's position on the relationship between these two provisions."
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2030.443,2032.461,Obviously not.
2012.11-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2036.863,2045.019,We have a lot of cases that say that -- that the agency's views about what courts should do are not entitled to deference.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2046.971,2049.505,"--But that would be Ledbetter, and I don't want to cite that to Justice Ginsburg."
2012.11-1175,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2063.231,2066.1,"What about the -- how does this work, the canon?"
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2066.882,2067.149,They're--
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2067.149,2067.649,Sorry.
2012.11-1175,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2068.382,2078.505,"I'm very interested in canons, and I want to know on the canon, the traditional thing, which you've probably looked up, what about the specific governs the general?"
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2086.277,2088.062,"--Well, I'm happy to go canon to canon."
2012.11-1175,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2088.062,2091.347,--This is -- seems to be the one they feel is very important.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2091.347,2091.78,That's the government.
2012.11-1175,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2092.23,2092.547,Yes.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2093.716,2094.016,--Okay.
2012.11-1175,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2098.501,2099.703,That -- that's a different matter.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2099.703,2100.603,--But let's go to canons.
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2116.046,2117.582,"Well, you say that, but it says to both."
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2130.972,2131.572,--I don't wish for a different statute.
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2143.363,2146.332,--I'm not in the business -- I'm not in the business of trying to figure out exactly what Congress is doing.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2156.373,2161.777,It -- it affirmatively gives district courts emboldening power to sanction.
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2162.461,2163.827,That sounds very terrible.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2163.827,2168.347,--But not if you file a lawsuit in bad faith and for purposes of harassment.
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2197.95,2206.473,"Well, Ms. Blatt, you say it -- it's supposed to make defendants better off by focusing on just part of the provision, but the provision is -- as a whole, it does a set of things."
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2213.043,2214.126,It doesn't speak to prevailing defendants.
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2214.126,2223.684,"Prevailing defendants, but when -- prevailing defendants are treated worse than prevailing plaintiffs, because they have to show that there is a bad faith lawsuit."
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2223.684,2226.803,"Yeah, I'm going -- I'm going to keep repeating it because it's my position."
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2278.152,2279.854,"Ms. Blatt, let me try it a different way."
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2279.854,2280.388,Okay.
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2280.388,2283.64,Let's just suppose that 54(k) didn't exist at all.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2283.64,2284.406,54(d)?
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2284.406,2285.356,54(d) didn't exist.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2285.356,2285.892,Okay.
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2285.892,2288.225,"And all you had was this provision, okay?"
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2288.225,2288.627,Uh-huh.
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2288.627,2299.665,"So this provision says on a finding by the court that it's brought in bad faith, the court may award to the defendant attorney's fees and costs."
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2309.79,2313.175,"Well, we wouldn't -- certainly, we sought costs here under Rule 54."
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2313.175,2314.425,I'm saying that--
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2314.425,2314.859,I know.
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2320.313,2323.531,"--In my world, you would not get fees or costs."
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2323.531,2330.454,"I'm imagining then the world in 1936, and we rely on 1920 or 1919 or the long-standing practice of courts awarding costs."
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2331.587,2333.322,I'm just asking you a simple question.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2333.322,2335.188,"--We would not get costs under this provision, you're correct."
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2335.188,2336.357,You would not get costs under that provision.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2336.357,2340.409,"Because this -- in that sense, I think this was a question that another justice asked."
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2347.296,2347.748,Okay.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2350.95,2351.567,Under 1692.
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2351.567,2367.71,"--under 1692, a provision that talks about fees and costs generally as to both plaintiffs and defendants, then how does a rule that says what -- where you would get costs unless a Federal statute provides otherwise change matters?"
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2367.71,2373.28,"Because -- because, again, Rule 54 is not preemption, a field preemption."
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2436.64,2440.175,"You might be right, but suppose Congress wasn't thinking about Rule 54."
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2453.483,2455.101,"Yes, if you -- right."
2012.11-1175,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2486.589,2491.875,"Counsel, it was thinking about prevailing parties because the predecessor sentence--"
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2491.875,2493.143,"Prevailing defendants -- I agree, sorry."
2012.11-1175,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2493.143,2495.844,"--But it was talking -- no, prevailing parties."
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2508.152,2508.586,Yeah.
2012.11-1175,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2508.586,2511.419,It says you get fees or you can get fees and costs.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2511.419,2511.771,Right.
2012.11-1175,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2511.771,2517.608,So it then decides to limit what a prevailing defendant can do.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2518.475,2531.999,"No, because it says expressly in a case of successful action, it talks about prevailing plaintiffs, and then it says if there's -- to me, it's just -- it's natural when you just read it in light of sort of common sense in context in what Congress was doing."
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2540.288,2547.711,"Well, that's -- that's just a different way of saying the following: The first sentence says, when you're a prevailing plaintiff, you get costs and fees."
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2554.031,2554.448,Yeah.
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2554.448,2556.067,--that the suit was filed in bad faith--
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2556.067,2556.45,"Yeah, and I think--"
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2556.45,2557.85,--and then they get costs and fees.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2557.85,2558.25,--Right.
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2582.384,2583.25,I completely agree with that.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2597.394,2597.794,"--Right, and--"
2012.11-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2597.794,2600.346,--unless the Federal statute provides otherwise.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2600.346,2607.25,--And I think you can look -- the Petitioner did -- did a valiant job of trying to drudge up as many statutes as they can.
2012.11-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2660.517,2673.458,"--I guess in the first sentence of 3, the phrase “ the costs of the action ” is really superfluous in light of 54(d)(1)."
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2688.635,2689.737,--Successful action to enforce it.
2012.11-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2689.737,2695.308,"The costs of the action, together with a reasonable -- as determined by the court."
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2695.308,2695.908,Why isn't--
2012.11-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2695.908,2699.359,"They -- they have the costs anyway, if Congress didn't write anything, right?"
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2699.359,2702.794,"--I mean, I think that -- again -- I mean--"
2012.11-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2702.794,2703.111,I'm trying to help you.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2703.913,2704.563,"--Yeah, I know."
2012.11-1175,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2712.25,2718.554,You don't think that there's a serious argument that the first sentence does away with the discretionary nature?
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2718.554,2719.089,"No, it's clear “ shall ”."
2012.11-1175,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2722.208,2723.275,So it's a command.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2726.093,2726.443,"--Oh, yes, that's right."
2012.11-1175,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2727.06,2730.295,And so this does -- it's not superfluous because it went to mandatory.
2012.11-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2730.295,2730.731,Gotcha.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2730.731,2731.481,That's true.
2012.11-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2731.481,2731.831,Well taken.
2012.11-1175,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2731.831,2732.681,Yeah.
2012.11-1175,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2845.856,2846.389,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1175,3,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2850.058,2851.358,Thank you.
2012.11-1175,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2898.989,2900.372,Would you explain why we would look to other rules?
2012.11-1175,3,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2920.07,2930.609,"--Our position is that this provision, k(a)(3), discusses the allocation of fees and costs that come at the end of the case based on who won and who lost."
2012.11-1175,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2983.226,2998.986,"Isn't it -- isn't it the case that, in order to appeal to the proposition that the specific governs the general, you -- you have to read the second sentence of 3 as containing a negative -- a negative implication?"
2012.11-1175,3,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3000.855,3001.288,--Yeah.
2012.11-1175,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3007.009,3008.128,--It may not.
2012.11-1175,3,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3009.544,3014.698,"Just as this Court -- just as this Court read “ may ” in Cooper Industries or Crawford Fittings and said,"
2012.11-1175,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3023.803,3029.005,"I understood Ms. Blatt to actually agree with that, that if you put Rule 54 aside, this does say,"
2012.11-1175,3,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3037.544,3046.816,"Right, she did agree that without Rule 54 this provision -- that -- that no costs could be awarded to a defendant unless they had acted in bad faith."
2012.11-1175,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3088.059,3091.863,--Suppose -- suppose the words “ and costs ” were left out in the second sentence.
2012.11-1175,3,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3106.354,3107.187,"--No, I don't think so."
2012.11-1175,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3112.841,3113.791,--But you're saying “ negative implication ”.
2012.11-1175,3,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3121.114,3121.614,"--Justice Scalia, other--"
2012.11-1175,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3121.614,3126.416,"--you cannot -- you cannot, even in the case of a frivolous action, award costs."
2012.11-1175,3,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3127.517,3135.087,"--In other cases under other statutes, that argument has been made occasionally and rejected."
2012.11-1175,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3139.575,3140.375,Yes.
2012.11-1175,3,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3142.277,3143.427,--No.
2012.11-1175,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3143.877,3144.895,Because it seems the two are parallel.
2012.11-1175,3,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3144.895,3150.799,"--If the -- if the statute does not mention costs, then it doesn't provide otherwise with respect to costs."
2012.11-1175,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3150.799,3164.041,"So she says if I -- if I tease -- if you tease your sister, I'm going to give you -- give her your allowance and her allowance, that that doesn't mean that the sister loses her allowance if you don't tease her."
2012.11-1175,3,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3165.976,3166.493,Well--
2012.11-1175,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3166.493,3170.677,--where you put the “ and ” in and it doesn't mean that that's the exclusive place for giving it.
2012.11-1175,3,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3173.162,3178.966,"--Well, putting aside that I hope that Congress drafts a little more carefully than a mother may threaten her child--"
2012.11-1175,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3179.366,3179.716,I doubt that it does.
2012.11-1175,3,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3184.02,3191.591,But they're -- the presumption behind that hypothetical is that the one child is going to get their allowance no matter what.
2012.11-1175,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3200.664,3201.347,"Thank you, counsel."
