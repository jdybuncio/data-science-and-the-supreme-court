2007.06-637,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.54,"We'll hear argument next in Case 06-637, Board of Education of the City School District of the City of New York v. Tom F.."
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,11.492,13.246,"Mr. Chief Justice, and members of the Court."
2007.06-637,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,231.344,239.606,"Counsel, do you agree that if we conclude the language is ambiguous, we should defer to the Secretary's interpretation in the comments accompanying the regulations?"
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,239.606,249.884,The answer is no because the Secretary's interpretation on the note in common and the letter submitted to the educational consultant is inconsistent with its own Federal regulation.
2007.06-637,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,258.286,260.161,It just mirrors the statute--
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,260.161,261.552,--That's exactly... it does.
2007.06-637,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,261.552,262.395,"--Well, then--"
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,262.395,262.956,But the note--
2007.06-637,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,262.956,269.078,"--Assuming we would think the statutory language is ambiguous, we are likely to think the same language in the regulation is ambiguous."
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,269.078,282.714,"--Well, Chief Justice, if it's ambiguous and we ought to at least discuss the nature of the ambiguity, then that ambiguity under the spending clause should redound to the benefit of the local education district as well, for if it does not set forth--"
2007.06-637,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,282.714,288.306,"Well, which... which prevails, Chevron deference or spending clause presumption?"
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,288.306,294.053,"--Well, the Chevron deference requires notes and comments which are persuasive and analyzed."
2007.06-637,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,314.451,321.09,"If Gilbert F. had attended the public school for 11 days, would this case come out differently, in your view?"
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,321.09,321.9,--I'm sorry.
2007.06-637,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,321.9,335.834,"If the student here had attended the public school for let's say 11 days before being transferred to the public... to the private school, would your, would your arguments still fly?"
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,335.834,336.599,No.
2007.06-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,344.94,346.781,"You've added something to the question, though, didn't you?"
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,346.781,348.157,"--No, I don't think so."
2007.06-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,348.157,350.796,Attending public school and receiving--
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,350.796,351.826,"I... I thought, I'm sorry--"
2007.06-637,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,351.826,353.451,"Well, that was my assumption."
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,391.264,411.333,"--That... that would satisfy the statutory definition, but when it went before the impartial officer, or the State review officer, there would be a very compelling argument that there was a lack of cooperation, because it's not just that you're in the system, but that you articulate the problems that you have with the public placement."
2007.06-637,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,411.333,413.676,"Well, it depends on the particular circumstances."
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,425.579,439.543,"My only comment, Chief Justice, was that yes, that would satisfy the statutory section as long as the notice was given in triple I, but we would then have an argument in the individual case that the parent was not cooperating."
2007.06-637,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,450.678,454.52,"Well, why would Congress ever have wanted to adopt a scheme like that?"
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,471.421,476.293,The reason Congress wanted to provide it is the reason that this Court discussed in Burlington.
2007.06-637,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,488.07,494.552,So that enabled the parent to remove the child immediately and risk that--
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,494.552,495.488,--That's correct.
2007.06-637,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,495.488,498.659,--the public education would be found inadequate.
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,498.659,500.096,But the reason--
2007.06-637,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,500.096,506.313,But all that section does is to repeat the Burlington scenario.
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,518.683,520.715,"--That's correct, but it's a statute of limitations."
2007.06-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,569.475,570.647,--I thought it wasn't that.
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,607.007,607.273,I think--
2007.06-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,607.273,614.316,"--and without this condition, somebody, I think the plaintiff here was never in the public school, was he?"
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,614.316,614.957,--That's correct.
2007.06-637,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,622.095,640.104,Are there not children... I think there was a brief on behalf of the Autism Society that says many school systems simply do not have the facilities to attend to the needs of these children?
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,640.104,647.959,"Yes, but you don't know that until you've actually been subjected to the process itself."
2007.06-637,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,666.11,675.654,"Are there not cases where school districts have said from day one, look, we don't have facilities to handle this type of disability?"
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,675.654,687.694,"But if we don't... if the public schools district does not have the facilities, then it will consent to a private placement to deal with the particular problem it cannot deal with."
2007.06-637,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,722.259,726.366,But isn't it true that the parent will never be reimbursed?
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,747.857,755.605,--The parent in this case can never get reimbursed because they don't meet the predicate which is that their child had to previously--
2007.06-637,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,755.605,756.682,That's not the question I asked.
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,756.682,756.995,--Oh I'm sorry.
2007.06-637,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,756.995,768.131,"I said that the parent... let's assume that the parent never sends the child to public school, nonetheless seeks reimbursement."
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,781.281,782.156,Yes.
2007.06-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,785.39,795.167,"Yes, but that is... but the parent would not have to show that the parent would have used that available public remedy--"
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,795.167,795.495,That's correct.
2007.06-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,795.495,796.104,--if it were there?
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,796.104,820.797,"And Congress could have concluded that the parent you're referring to who placed that child immediately in a private school, and who may not have an interest in obtaining a public school education for that child, may not be as cooperative and as collaborative as someone who has a child in the system, to work out an individual education plan because of some of these--"
2007.06-637,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,820.797,830.262,Then the conclusion would be that that parent hasn't met the heavy burden of showing that there is no appropriate public education.
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,830.262,876.962,"--But the problem is, if you go to an impartial hearing officer as in this case, and you have a child that's been in a private school for a number of years and is doing very well, and the private school special ed teacher comes in and highlights all the successes of the kid, and then the New York City Department of Education comes in with is profit plan which is based on speculation, because the child has never been in the system, is it so unreasonable for Congress to conclude as a matter of statutory, explicit language that the child should go into the system so that at least with respect to your burden there's at least a participatory program where they try to help the child get an individual education."
2007.06-637,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,876.962,900.655,"If Congress's purpose really was what you... what you suggest and what I think Justice Scalia's question suggests, that there was a desire to make parents who really had no interest in the public school system give the public schools a chance, why is it that, even as you read the statute, there's no requirement that the child remain in the public school system for any significant period of time?"
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,902.171,904.169,"Indeed, Justice Alito."
2007.06-637,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,952.713,965.598,I think they may... they may well have to stay longer than 10 days to either realize that the program is inadequate or to feel comfortable that they'll be able to establish that on the record.
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,969.487,971.19,"Chief Judge, you're absolutely right."
2007.06-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1009.534,1021.874,"Of course, to be fair, this provision doesn't just apply to the rich person who wants New York City to pay 30,000 of his tuition to a private school."
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1046.691,1068.198,"That is correct, but your... first of all, Congress could weigh the balance between that particular problem and the need to give the school district an opportunity to try to provide a program, but it does run contrary to this Court's discussion in Schaffer which presumes that the school district is going try to accommodate the child, try to provide the needs of the child."
2007.06-637,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1202.769,1213.546,Is there any suggestion in the reasoning in the Burlington case that it was limited to a situation in which the student had been receiving public school special education?
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1213.546,1214.046,No.
2007.06-637,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1290.046,1307.241,"Oh, I don't think that's true, because the problem would be you would go to the hearing to see if you were getting the adequate education and you would have... you would essentially have to make a facial challenge rather than an as-applied one, and the school would say, well, you didn't give us a chance; we were going to do this and we were going to do that."
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1311.49,1312.27,--But that would--
2007.06-637,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1312.27,1312.582,--if they did--
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1312.582,1315.161,"--But that would be an individual determination, Chief Judge."
2007.06-637,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1348.959,1357.752,"--No, my suggestion is still that it would be easier to prevail at the impartial hearing, if you can say, look, we tried, it didn't work, as opposed to saying, we never even tried."
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1357.752,1359.283,--Except for--
2007.06-637,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1359.283,1364.235,"If I were the impartial hearing examiner, I would think that that's a harder burden for the parents to carry if they didn't even try."
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1369.389,1390.489,"--But there is a dynamic at these hearings that, if you come in and that you're in a private school and you show that your child is doing well in the private school, and we come in with a theoretical plan that has never been implemented, there is going to be a dynamic with the impartial hearing officer who will tilt towards keeping the child--"
2007.06-637,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1390.489,1404.483,"What is the basis for saying that, when the one thing that the statute is very clear on is that the starting premise of any reimbursement claim is that an appropriate public education is not available?"
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1412.341,1414.575,"--You're right, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-637,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1430.488,1431.316,But you don't have the burden; the parents do.
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1431.316,1432.957,Yes.
2007.06-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1437.908,1445.936,"The parent would presumably cover themselves, look it, he's getting X, Y... X, Y, and Z in the private school and you're going to give him Z; Z is not going to be enough."
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1448.653,1449.31,--That's correct.
2007.06-637,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1463.85,1470.52,"What about an exception if, in fact, the school district admits that they can't do anything for this child?"
2007.06-637,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1470.52,1494.652,"Well, then, Your Honor, that comes under Section B of the same section, 20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(10)(B), where the school district does not believe it can provide the service, then it will consent to a private school and will give reimbursement because that will be the equivalent of the free appropriate public education."
2007.06-637,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1595.468,1596.765,"Thank you, Mr. Koerner."
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,1601.405,1604.34,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2007.06-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1636.967,1638.295,"What did it do, then?"
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,1640.248,1644.387,"Your Honor, Congress was focused on the public school context."
2007.06-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1659.866,1661.083,I don't understand that.
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,1715.701,1718.966,"Your Honor, the first question is whether that is intended to be exclusive."
2007.06-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1731.413,1738.802,Where else does it say that the city will pay for the cost of a private education except there?
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,1751.92,1755.435,"--Your Honor, Congress did not intend that exclusive language."
2007.06-637,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1757.622,1769.774,Then why didn't Congress adequately give the equivalent of what you call the (iii) by saying the cost of reimbursement described in clause two?
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,1778.177,1781.239,"Because, Your Honor, the context is public school."
2007.06-637,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1785.705,1786.127,I'm sorry.
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,1789.422,1789.734,--Yes.
2007.06-637,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1830.78,1841.556,"So you read... hypothesize two statutes: One, the statute before the phrase ""who previously received special education"" was added and the statute after?"
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,1843.743,1845.321,"No, Your Honor, I don't."
2007.06-637,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1859.721,1860.018,I don't understand.
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,1867.218,1867.686,--No.
2007.06-637,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1874.309,1882.961,There would be no reason for Congress to put that language in if the same right to reimbursement existed if the child had not previously received special education services.
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,1882.961,1883.524,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.06-637,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1892.083,1901.252,"Because your friend reads that the exact opposite way and says, since (C)(iii) only makes sense if the child is in the public school, that that's a limitation on how you should read (C)(ii)."
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,1901.252,1902.438,"--I understand that, Your Honor."
2007.06-637,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1909.701,1917.589,"In that case, isn't it pertinent that the title to (C)(ii) says ""Reimbursement for Private School Placement""?"
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,1923.695,1926.007,"--But, Your Honor, (C)(ii) is not exhaustive."
2007.06-637,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1947.217,1952.638,That just means that (C)(ii) doesn't address the entire universe of issues that might arise.
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,1958.525,1968.412,"Your Honor, I believe it's probative on the issue of whether Congress intended (C)(ii) to set forth the requirements for private school tuition reimbursement and all the factual context in which that could be rendered."
2007.06-637,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1992.043,1994.026,Where is that set forth?
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,1994.026,2003.054,"1415(f)(1)(B)... I'm sorry, Your Honor, it's not in the appendix to the solicitor general's brief."
2007.06-637,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2042.585,2046.912,Were those provisions at issue when this dispute arose?
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2049.239,2056.69,"--These were 2004 amendments, Your Honor."
2007.06-637,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2056.69,2063.297,You haven't identified the statutory provision that you think provides the authority for the payment in this case.
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2063.297,2074.51,"Your Honor, I believe it begins with 1400(d)(1)(A) and 1412(A)(1); both of which impose the requirement on school districts to make available the free and appropriate public education for the child."
2007.06-637,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2098.688,2100.859,--I suppose it's how broadly you read legislative history.
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2107.466,2125.412,"Yes, Your Honor, and I think with respect to the children in the public school system, if you read (C)(3)... and again these are permissive... but if (C)(3) is applied, then I think Representative Castle's comments make perfect sense because they provide for certain notice obligations."
2007.06-637,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2125.412,2136.048,"So when it comes to reimbursement of tuition, the parents who never place their child in the public school are in better shape than the parent who place their child in public school and then want to remove him."
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2136.048,2136.657,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-637,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2185.841,2189.745,But cooperation does not require sending the child to the public school.
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2189.745,2190.48,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-637,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2225.762,2229.526,"Well in my case they would note have received any benefits, under the terms of the statute."
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2229.526,2241.473,"--But Your Honor, it highlights that if they can place the child in for one day, this is an utterly meaningless provision that Congress never could have intended to require because it serves no purpose."
2007.06-637,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2241.801,2250.173,That's why your friend says it serves the purpose of helping to make clear that the public school is... whether it is or is not able to provide the appropriate public education.
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2260.358,2263.685,--Let me give an example that highlights my point.
2007.06-637,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2280.505,2286.252,"What you're saying is it's not a very significant hurdle, but it is going to be a hurdle in some cases."
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2286.252,2294.109,"--It doesn't serve any useful purpose, Your Honor, and if it doesn't serve any useful purpose there is no reason to believe that Congress intended it to have that effect."
2007.06-637,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2294.109,2312.866,"The useful purpose it serves is allow the school district to show what it can do in ten days, as opposed to a mere theoretical statement, it allows some actual concrete practice to see if the plan that the public school has developed is going to work or not going to work, that the impartial hearing examiner can evaluate in a more concrete setting."
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2312.866,2325.206,"This Court has addressed that balance in Burlington, and the answer was no, the statute does not require that parents place their child in an inappropriate place."
2007.06-637,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2325.206,2327.61,But then the whole point is the statute was then amended after Burlington.
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2334.468,2343.104,"But again, Your Honor, there is no evidence in that amendment that it was intended to be exclusive or intended to be exhaustive of the circumstances and factual context."
2007.06-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2343.104,2358.926,I'm not sure I agree... Im not sure I would agree with you that you could get special services which... in third grade and then come back 10 years later and get private school tuition.
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2378.996,2380.589,Let me go back--
2007.06-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2380.589,2381.307,"You don't have to read it that way, anyway."
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2381.307,2382.807,"--Let me address that, Your Honor."
2007.06-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2398.223,2405.439,"Once you're in the private school reimbursement you're in the private school reimbursement, but you can't get into it 10 years later."
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2465.211,2484.438,"--The point we are trying to make, Your Honor, is that in light of Burlington, which obviously Congress had knowledge of when it enacted the 1997 amendments, is it credible to believe that they would have restricted, limited, overruled the holding of Burlington, and never said a word about it?"
2007.06-637,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2484.438,2485.797,But they have (b).
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2509.365,2513.691,There is no evidence that Congress intended a tryout period.
2007.06-637,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2513.691,2515.878,Just the language... the language.
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2515.878,2517.44,It's not just language.
2007.06-637,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2517.44,2521.72,"The language plus the fact that nobody can think of a reason for putting that in there, unless that's the--"
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2521.72,2526.653,"And it's the context that flows from Burlington, where the Congress was aware that this Court--"
2007.06-637,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2526.653,2528.029,--But my question was what about (b)?
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2538.898,2540.525,"--I'm sorry, I'm not understanding (b), Your Honor."
2007.06-637,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2540.525,2543.663,The case where the school district just can't do it.
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2543.663,2544.382,Right.
2007.06-637,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2544.382,2548.365,If they just can't do it then their job is to put the kid in a district--
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2548.365,2548.912,Right.
2007.06-637,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2548.912,2550.145,--in a place that can do it.
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2564.842,2595.643,"In a perfect world, Your Honor, school districts who are confronted with a situation would always make the decision to place the child in private schools at public expense, but unfortunately there are disagreements between school districts and parents about what is appropriate, and then sometimes school districts don't do what they are supposed to do under the statute and in fact the city's interpretation here would incentivize school districts not to provide services because if they never provided services they wouldn't be liable for the reimbursement."
2007.06-637,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2602.016,2603.937,"(b), that's my question, (b)."
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2621.946,2625.989,"--Your Honor, that relies on the good faith of the school district."
2007.06-637,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2643.654,2649.402,"You have review before the impartial hearing examiner about that alleged bad faith, correct?"
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2649.402,2650.027,Pardon me?
2007.06-637,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2650.027,2654.26,You have reviewed before the Hearing Examiner that alleged bad faith on the part of the school district.
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2654.26,2655.462,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2689.699,2690.463,Bingo.
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2691.666,2695.634,"--The point is, Your Honor, that Congress knew how to say ""only if""."
2007.06-637,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2720.201,2721.732,And what was that primary mandate?
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2721.732,2729.604,--The primary mandate was to provide or... or make available a free and appropriate public education to every child with learning disabilities.
2007.06-637,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2729.604,2732.399,There is no issue of mainstreaming in this case at all; right?
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2732.399,2733.04,"There is not, Your Honor."
2007.06-637,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2733.04,2735.664,Neither of the options are mainstream options?
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2735.664,2739.054,"That's correct, Your Honor, and that's at Second Circuit Appendix 168."
2007.06-637,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2803.512,2805.153,"You know, it... I'm sorry."
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2805.153,2806.855,"--Your Honor, my time is up."
2007.06-637,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2807.84,2808.058,So is mine.
2007.06-637,1,37932,paul_g_gardephe,,2810.696,2811.181,Thank you.
2007.06-637,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2811.181,2825.534,Mr. Garre.
2007.06-637,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2825.534,2838.857,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner takes the position that a school district may both refuse to provide a child with a disability with an appropriate public placement and refuse to pay for an appropriate private placement."
2007.06-637,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2842.887,2846.48,"No, he hasn't... he hasn't said that."
2007.06-637,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2846.48,2863.737,"--I think he does in the sense, Your Honor, Justice Scalia, that the... the school district can take the position, even if the IET that is proposed is inadequate and it's adjudicated to be inadequate, because the Schaffer presumption that was brought up earlier does not apply in this case."
2007.06-637,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2884.557,2885.807,Under a different statute.
2007.06-637,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2885.807,2896.569,--Under a different statute but interpreting the fundamental requirement of the statute that all children with disabilities are entitled to a free and appropriate public education.
2007.06-637,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2900.411,2902.082,You are interpreting some very general language:
2007.06-637,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2905.69,2915.687,--The... the part of the Burlington case I'm referring to Justice Scalia is the interpretation of the fundamental requirement of providing free and appropriate public education.
2007.06-637,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2931.726,2943.784,"So does the 10-business-days notice requirement for people who are in public schools also violate Burlington, because for 10 business days they are going to be subject to an inappropriate education?"
2007.06-637,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2943.784,2957.731,"The way the 10-business-days requirement works in practice is that all of the IEPs... virtually all of them are proposed towards the end of the school year; and, typically, the parent is submitted the proposed IEP during the summer."
2007.06-637,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2971.866,2988.484,"So in a situation where it's not in the summer, where they say, well, let's see how it works, and then they go to the public school, I would have thought your argument also would say it's not... they don't have to give notice of 10 business days because in Burlington you said you don't... you have to make available the tuition reimbursement."
2007.06-637,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2991.577,2994.513,--And we don't... we don't dispute that--
2007.06-637,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2994.513,2995.795,You don't dispute that limitation.
2007.06-637,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3000.683,3013.882,--In order... in order to qualify for reimbursment in that provision which is... which is followed by the provision describing in more concrete detail the circumstances that courts ought to take into account in determining whether reimbursement is appropriate.
2007.06-637,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3108.702,3108.874,Anywhere?
2007.06-637,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3113.45,3121.026,"And it would, Your Honor, insofar as we are dealing with flushing out the requirements for students enrolled in public school."
2007.06-637,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3200.29,3201.117,"Well, that's no problem."
2007.06-637,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3207.677,3211.316,--If you have previously received special-education services.
2007.06-637,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3273.073,3276.805,But the whole point is you don't necessarily know it's inadequate until later in time.
2007.06-637,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3279.774,3280.961,"That's true, Your Honor."
2007.06-637,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3297.329,3301.921,"Except those... there are a lot of parents who are going to send their parents to private school, no matter what."
2007.06-637,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3310.869,3322.849,"And Justice Scalia... two points on that, first the statute provides in clear and unambiguous terms that all children with disabilities are entitled to a free and appropriate education."
2007.06-637,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3326.332,3334.329,Even the child who would turn down the adequate education provided by the public schools.
2007.06-637,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3337.125,3346.886,"--And I agree with you on that, Justice Scalia, and that's why the way that school districts can avoid reimbursement is to offer an adequate placement in the first place."
2007.06-637,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3369.92,3377.746,"If they don't have an adequate placement, they should not have to pay the freight for people who would not be coming to public school any way."
2007.06-637,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3380.885,3382.356,"I disagree with that, Your Honor."
2007.06-637,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3428.947,3430.869,"Thank you, Mr. Garre."
2007.06-637,3,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3434.211,3437.179,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-637,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3542.807,3561.861,"During the period between Burlington and the enactment of this statute, would you have any doubt about your potential obligation to reimburse a parent... during the period of Burlington and the enactment of the statute, would the school board have had doubt about its potential liability for reimbursement, in a situation like this?"
2007.06-637,3,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3561.861,3562.814,I think so.
2007.06-637,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3596.833,3605.688,"I thought this statute was also premised on Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, in which case it wouldn't have spending clause notice argument."
2007.06-637,3,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3605.688,3608.64,"No, the... this is just a grant provision, Your Honor."
