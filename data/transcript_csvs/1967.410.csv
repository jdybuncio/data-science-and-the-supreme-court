1967.410,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,20.514,"Number 410, Gary Duncan, appellant versus Louisiana."
1967.410,0,40454,richard_b_sobol,,22.893,26.094,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1967.410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,120.44,122.613,Must the five-man jury be unanimous?
1967.410,0,40454,richard_b_sobol,,122.613,124.612,Yes it must.
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2025.414,2026.418,Wolbrette.
1967.410,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2026.418,2027.775,Ms Wolbrette.
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2027.775,2029.25,May it please the Court.
1967.410,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2132.607,2143.027,Are you saying that you've got to wait about determining whether you have a right to jury trial under the cases tried to see how much the judge contributes?
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2143.027,2144.248,Yes.
1967.410,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2144.248,2144.956,In other words --
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2144.956,2146.065,That's what Cheff said.
1967.410,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2147.307,2151.335,"In other words, you can't know at the beginning whether you're entitled to a jury trial or not."
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2151.335,2151.883,"Well, Your Honor --"
1967.410,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2151.883,2153.69,(Voice Overlap) you got to wait and see what the judge does with him?
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2153.69,2161.16,"There's no difference Your Honor, as between contempt and other crimes there are crimes with indefinite sentences."
1967.410,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2161.16,2163.199,I'm not talking about contempt or anything else?
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2163.199,2163.406,Yes.
1967.410,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2163.406,2164.428,Because as I understand this --
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2164.428,2167.501,Well I'm not saying it this is what Cheff held.
1967.410,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2168.948,2173.168,"But as I understand it, maybe I'm wrong."
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2176.936,2177.843,Any crime --
1967.410,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2177.843,2178.525,Anything else --
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2178.525,2188.113,That the rule which Cheff put up is what you just said. Now New York does this very thing and so does everyone (voice overlap)
1967.410,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2188.113,2203.953,"What I'm asking you is you're arguing to us that a defendant cannot learn whether he's entitled to a jury or not until he's tried by a judge, and convicted, and given less than a year?"
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2203.953,2211.641,"Well, I am merely stating to you what this Court in its latest decision on this particular point held and that's Cheff."
1967.410,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2217.458,2218.176,But wouldn't that be a --
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2218.176,2219.388,For its misdemeanor.
1967.410,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2219.388,2221.761,Wouldn't that be a very silly ruling in a court?
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2221.761,2224.417,New York doesn't think so and England doesn't think so.
1967.410,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2227.831,2235.864,"Do they use it to determine what you can give them when you start to try them, or what you have given them after the judge decides?"
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2235.864,2242.599,"They use it to determine -- what happens is, you go into the inferior court, the judge listens to some of the testimony."
1967.410,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2259.353,2263.126,Do you agree that this man could've been given two years?
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2263.126,2264.962,"In the Paris Jail, of course."
1967.410,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2266.845,2270.235,And yet you say that he could've been given two years.
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2276.732,2278.404,"Six months, that's the test which --"
1967.410,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2278.404,2281.035,Because the judge happened to give him that?
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2281.035,2285.399,"Well Your Honor, Cheff did not consider the potential sentence at all."
1967.410,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2307.447,2312.299,"May I ask you first, do you have double jeopardy clause in your Constitution?"
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2312.299,2313.949,"Yes, yes sir we do."
1967.410,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2313.949,2328.189,"Well how then could a judge partially try a man for a crime of that kind and then conclude that the punishment would have, or ought to be more than six months, and then send it to a grand jury for indictment?"
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2328.189,2331.202,Well he would not have determined guilt at that point and it wouldn't be double jeopardy.
1967.410,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2331.202,2339.595,"Well I thought when a man was placed on trial, witnesses had been summoned against him that he was in jeopardy?"
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2339.595,2343.683,Well we obviously haven't reached that problem yet.
1967.410,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2355.683,2358.969,"Well now, on what theory would they say that?"
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2370.46,2373.017,"Well frankly Your Honor, I haven't researched that point."
1967.410,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2394.521,2395.242,Alright.
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2395.242,2407.398,"Now under Cheff, the test recognized for determining of petty offense are one, the actual sentence imposed is six months or less and two, the character of the offense charged must be petty."
1967.410,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2450.095,2455.754,"Suppose the judge had given him seven months here instead of two, would your argument be the same?"
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2455.754,2457.113,Well of course.
1967.410,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2457.113,2458.281,I beg your pardon?
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2458.281,2462.098,"Well I mean, I would not argue that I fit it under Cheff now."
1967.410,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2462.098,2464.583,What would you put it on?
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2464.583,2465.99,What would I put my argument on?
1967.410,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2465.99,2466.421,Yes.
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2466.421,2470.175,Well of course I'm going -- then I would go into my -- Oh!
1967.410,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2477.048,2478.097,"Seven months instead of two, yes."
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2478.097,2488.132,"Yes, with my two-year maximum penalty of my statute then deprive him of due process, or would it require a jury."
1967.410,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2490.141,2492.473,It would not you say?
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2497.074,2497.438,No.
1967.410,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2505.545,2510.656,No I said if it was seven months that he had given him instead of the two.
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2510.656,2510.805,Yes.
1967.410,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2510.805,2511.944,What would your position be?
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2511.944,2526.082,"My position would be I would not be under Cheff, because the actual sentence would be more than six months but my position would be, that he would still not require a jury."
1967.410,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2526.082,2529.206,What basis would you shift to then from Cheff?
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2529.206,2531.207,Well then I would have to look at the maximum.
1967.410,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2554.069,2556.505,You mean adopted by this Court?
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2556.505,2557.206,Cited.
1967.410,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2557.206,2560.088,What do you mean by recognized?
1967.410,1,21706,dorothy_d_wolbrette,,2560.088,2566.639,Used as a basis for your opinion in District of Columbia versus Collins.
