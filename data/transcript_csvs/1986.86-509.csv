1986.86-509,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.308,"We will hear arguments next in two consolidated cases, No. 86-509, Bowen against Gilliard, and No. 86-564, Flaherty against Gilliard."
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,59.205,68.477,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-509,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,293.122,297.942,"Well, it comes back to the family... you say it works no hardship; it works no hardship on the family."
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,297.942,298.892,That's right.
1986.86-509,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,298.892,306.547,But one of the contentions here is that it does work a hardship on the child for whom the support is destined.
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,306.547,307.231,That's right.
1986.86-509,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,314.468,315.32,And give it to the family.
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,315.32,317.903,--and transmute that into AFDC and give it to the whole family.
1986.86-509,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,317.903,318.389,That's right.
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,319.922,321.089,Why is their theory wrong?
1986.86-509,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,328.361,329.028,xxx taking.
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,358.747,359.849,--She could.
1986.86-509,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,366.103,370.222,She's required to spend it in the best interest of all her children?
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,370.222,375.859,--I think the AFDC program also imposes obligations on mothers with respect to how they spend it.
1986.86-509,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,375.859,380.18,But she's not giving $200 to Joey because she thinks that's in the best interest of all her children.
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,386.084,389.035,"It could be Joey, she thinks, is more needy than other children."
1986.86-509,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,389.035,389.568,"No, that's not the reason."
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,413.567,414.684,I don't think it would.
1986.86-509,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,420.355,422.257,It would depend on what the other children needed.
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,428.927,435.914,"--With all probability, the money, the $200, would be going to pay things that are common expenses, like rent, utilities, gas and light."
1986.86-509,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,435.914,436.599,"I know, but just take my hypothetical."
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,440.884,444.086,I can't say that would absolutely violate the AFDC law.
1986.86-509,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,445.822,446.305,It could?
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,446.305,447.272,--on the family situation.
1986.86-509,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,447.272,452.859,It isn't clear that she can do that without violating the AFDC law?
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,452.859,460.898,It is clear that some use of that money could violate the AFDC reasons governing the duties of the custodial parent.
1986.86-509,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,464.0,487.115,"Mr. Lauber, tell us again, now if a child support payment has been ordered for one of the children in the family and not the others, in the amount of let's say $200 a month, not all of the $200 a month that must be assigned to the state would come back to the family, would it?"
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,487.115,491.584,"No, all of it would come back to the family, plus $50 extra."
1986.86-509,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,491.584,494.286,"Oh, that wasn't my understanding at all."
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,504.059,507.279,The $200 comes to the family in a different form.
1986.86-509,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,528.276,537.565,I thought the $50 was never given back to the family unless the parent ordered to pay the support in fact paid the support?
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,537.565,538.815,That's correct.
1986.86-509,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,549.573,552.057,"Well, they get AFDC benefits."
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,555.009,557.295,It would be $200 of it--
1986.86-509,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,557.295,570.436,"And indeed, the amount of money received by, or attributed, in AFDC to the child for whom the support payment was made is less than the $200."
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,570.436,570.853,--That's correct.
1986.86-509,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,573.305,582.244,"I mean, if you look at the child's pro rata share, it's substantially less than the $200 for whom the support has been ordered?"
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,582.244,583.261,--That's right.
1986.86-509,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,583.863,593.801,"And the whole basis of the father's support obligation in that example would be his obligation to that child that he fathered, is that not so?"
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,593.801,596.003,"--Well, that raises a question under state law."
1986.86-509,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,597.52,610.178,"Well, isn't that correct, that when state courts order child support, that they are ordering it on the basis of the father's obligation to the child he fathered?"
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,610.178,610.746,--That's correct.
1986.86-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,621.119,627.623,"Isn't under state law, in this case, didn't the mother have an obligation to spend the child support only on the one child."
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,627.623,628.658,--We think that's not correct.
1986.86-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,629.975,631.343,What if it were?
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,631.343,636.395,If the mother had an obligation to pay it only--
1986.86-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,636.395,644.151,To use the child support that's given her for this child to spend it on that child; for the benefit of that child.
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,644.151,647.603,"--Well, for the benefit of the child is different from giving him the cash."
1986.86-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,647.603,648.003,All right--
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,648.003,655.459,"And here, the state law clearly permits the mother to assign child support in order to get AFDC for the entire family."
1986.86-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,664.315,665.065,--Not only permits it; it seems to require it--
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,665.065,666.683,"It does require it, in fact, that's right."
1986.86-509,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,666.683,683.626,"--But Mr. Lauber, you could certainly have situations where a local state judge awards child support on the theory, for example, that a particular child needs orthodontic treatment, and orders child support in an amount to cover that."
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,683.626,684.228,"Well, that would--"
1986.86-509,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,684.228,687.763,And the father felt obligated to pay it for that purpose.
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,710.177,713.913,"--Well, that raises a question about how the support is paid."
1986.86-509,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,738.863,748.569,"Well, I thought we had examples in this record where North Carolina brought charges against fathers for making some in-kind contributions of diapers and so forth."
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,748.569,750.087,"Well, let me co-counsel respond to that."
1986.86-509,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,775.369,782.642,"Mr. Lauber, may I just follow up on Justice O'Connor's example of the orthodontic special need of one child for whom the support money is designated?"
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,802.805,803.888,I don't believe it would.
1986.86-509,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,807.807,810.225,"Well, it would depend on what the need of the other children were."
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,830.539,839.208,"--I think for something very quasi-optional or a cosmetic thing like that, she probably could prefer one child over another, as any mother could in deciding which kid is going to have braces."
1986.86-509,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,839.208,841.56,Even though the three have the same needs?
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,848.25,852.618,I think a mother always has the option of deciding how you are going to allocate a fixed... a small fixed pot of money.
1986.86-509,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,855.07,857.106,"Your answer is, it would not violate AFDC law?"
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,857.106,858.356,--I don't believe it would for orthodontics.
1986.86-509,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,859.039,859.556,Mr. Lauber--
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,863.01,863.676,--It would depend on the need.
1986.86-509,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,866.962,871.18,"--Well, of all three, three critical life-threatening needs, but the source of the money is because of the support for the one."
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,880.721,884.173,I don't think there's any rule that she has to treat them absolutely equally.
1986.86-509,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,886.791,898.766,"Gathering from your answer to Justice Stevens and Justice Scalia earlier, is there a fairly elaborate AFDC code of how the mother shall distribute the money to these various children?"
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,898.766,899.199,"No, there is not."
1986.86-509,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,910.574,914.276,"Mr. Lauber, I'll give you an easier question that I think will make it even clearer."
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,932.07,934.106,I think she probably could not.
1986.86-509,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,991.026,997.597,"Well, there may be individual examples where it isn't in the child's best interest, though."
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,997.597,998.413,It's possible--
1986.86-509,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,998.413,1016.074,"And there certainly are examples in this record where the burden of this arrangement has been so great that it has caused families to split up, and send children to live with someone else, so that they can have the benefit of that child's support."
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1018.443,1028.651,"--But that would follow from any decision by Congress to include the... any kind... wouldn't have to supporting him... any kind of income of a child, in determining the need of the family."
1986.86-509,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1083.302,1085.737,But they're not arguing that it's being taken from the mother.
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1094.526,1098.295,The Congress has made the family unit the applicant.
1986.86-509,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1098.295,1103.466,"Well, that's very nice, but it doesn't say anything about whether it's a taking from the child or not."
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1103.466,1108.353,"But if the child doesn't want to have his support assigned, he can tell his mother and she cannot assign the support."
1986.86-509,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1112.822,1133.218,"So you say... you suggest that if the child had a guardian, secured a guardian ad litem, talked to his or her uncle and said, mother is giving away my child support, let's sue her, do you think they could an injunction against her signing that?"
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1139.639,1145.459,"We think under state law they couldn't get that injunction, because it's not the child's absolute property."
1986.86-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1148.561,1152.013,So this case really then turns on the state law?
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1152.013,1153.249,--I think ultimately it does.
1986.86-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1153.249,1161.987,"And if... if we thought that... that this payment belonged to the child, then there must be a taking."
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1161.987,1163.153,"No, that doesn't follow."
1986.86-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1164.287,1164.687,All right.
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1165.305,1167.022,"--Well, first there's got to be property to be taken."
1986.86-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1167.022,1167.455,Yes?
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1167.455,1173.443,"Okay, then beyond that, you have to consider that going into the program is entirely voluntary to begin with."
1986.86-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1173.443,1176.295,"Well, the child say, I'm involuntary."
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1187.085,1192.756,"But if the child is wrong, and the mother in his best interest--"
1986.86-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1192.756,1193.456,What do you mean wrong?
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1200.26,1204.164,"--Well, if you're right about that, then she could be enjoined from going into the program."
1986.86-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1204.164,1204.514,--All right.
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1205.497,1207.866,"Well, there would be no taking if she weren't in the program."
1986.86-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1207.866,1208.849,"All right, so you say--"
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1208.849,1210.301,"Well, the point is, if he really has property--"
1986.86-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1210.301,1212.92,--You say that the remedy is the injunction?
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1212.92,1213.453,--Right.
1986.86-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1219.157,1223.592,The guardian ad litem didn't come along until six months afterwards.
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1238.987,1240.97,"--Well, I don't--"
1986.86-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1240.97,1247.324,"I mean, that seems to me what the case is all about."
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1247.324,1250.878,"--Well, if there is... if the child does have property such as you describe--"
1986.86-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1250.878,1257.032,There isn't any case at all unless the child has some property under the state law.
1986.86-509,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1257.032,1258.815,"--Well, that's the first problem with their argument."
1986.86-509,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1261.984,1263.385,"Thank you, Mr. Lauber."
1986.86-509,1,19532,catherine_c_mclamb,,1274.326,1280.48,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1315.903,1329.545,Do we have to disagree with the District Court's... or with the court's construction of North Carolina for you to prevail?
1986.86-509,1,19532,catherine_c_mclamb,,1329.545,1330.045,No.
1986.86-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1348.458,1352.91,What's the error... what's the error in North Carolina law that--
1986.86-509,1,19532,catherine_c_mclamb,,1352.91,1370.038,"In... Judge McMillan found that because these children lived together, and they must apply for AFDC as a family unit, and therefore, by law, assignment... there must be an assignment of child support rights."
1986.86-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1375.526,1376.259,--Of the child?
1986.86-509,1,19532,catherine_c_mclamb,,1376.259,1378.311,--Of the child.
1986.86-509,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1410.115,1416.769,Will we have to change that interpretation that the judge made of North Carolina law?
1986.86-509,1,19532,catherine_c_mclamb,,1416.769,1421.84,"--What I would like to show you is, that is an erroneous interpretation."
1986.86-509,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1423.273,1434.064,"We normally of course accept the interpretation of the lower Federal court on matters of state law, don't we?"
1986.86-509,1,19532,catherine_c_mclamb,,1434.064,1446.955,"You should, unless it is... I would not think that this Court would accept the interpretation of state law if it is clearly shown to be incorrect, and that is what I would like to show you today."
1986.86-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1446.955,1450.424,And your opposition will show us just to the contrary.
1986.86-509,1,19532,catherine_c_mclamb,,1450.424,1454.828,They will attempt to do the exact opposite.
1986.86-509,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1543.869,1548.504,Maybe that statute was a taking?
1986.86-509,1,19532,catherine_c_mclamb,,1548.504,1558.962,"--It was not so considered by the legislature of North Carolina, nor the courts of North Carolina, which has considered... which has passed upon this statute."
1986.86-509,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1567.115,1572.602,How did the court below deal with that particular statute?
1986.86-509,1,19532,catherine_c_mclamb,,1572.602,1574.971,--The court below ignored it.
1986.86-509,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1578.006,1579.975,But you had raised that with the court?
1986.86-509,1,19532,catherine_c_mclamb,,1579.975,1580.342,--Pardon?
1986.86-509,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1580.342,1582.508,You had argued and presented to the court--
1986.86-509,1,19532,catherine_c_mclamb,,1582.508,1585.294,This was raised to the court below.
1986.86-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1619.467,1631.358,"--You think that whatever... any property right the child might have had was modified by that statute, or it just couldn't have come about in the face of that statute?"
1986.86-509,1,19532,catherine_c_mclamb,,1631.358,1636.679,--You have to read the North Carolina child support law in conjunction with the statutes.
1986.86-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1641.664,1642.932,Which one prevails?
1986.86-509,1,19532,catherine_c_mclamb,,1645.45,1654.14,"--There is no statute in North Carolina that says, child support is an exclusive property right of the child."
1986.86-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1669.65,1677.756,"Well, would the mother be breaking the child support law if she received child support and just didn't spend it on the child?"
1986.86-509,1,19532,catherine_c_mclamb,,1677.756,1684.742,--And didn't... that would be that the mother was not spending the money for the benefit of the child.
1986.86-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1688.627,1695.115,"Well, what if the mother took the money and spent it on another child, all of it on another child, that she thought needed it more?"
1986.86-509,1,19532,catherine_c_mclamb,,1695.115,1702.037,"She is breaking... in that case, she is breaking her fiduciary to that child, if this... if she is leaving her child--"
1986.86-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1702.037,1713.929,"But she... you think if she was receiving child support and she wasn't on AFDC at all, she just received $250 a month, and she just split it three ways among her three children."
1986.86-509,1,19532,catherine_c_mclamb,,1713.929,1715.845,--And this was her only income?
1986.86-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1715.845,1717.797,"No, this was child support income."
1986.86-509,1,19532,catherine_c_mclamb,,1717.797,1727.152,"In your hypothetical, is that the only income that is coming into that family, is $250 child support for one child?"
1986.86-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1759.891,1765.961,And so she can use it for the benefit of all of her children?
1986.86-509,1,19532,catherine_c_mclamb,,1765.961,1770.098,It would be a decision that would be within the discretion of the mother.
1986.86-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1770.098,1770.431,Yes or no?
1986.86-509,1,19532,catherine_c_mclamb,,1772.883,1779.371,"The answer is yes if she, within her discretion, determines that that would best benefit her child."
1986.86-509,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1811.258,1820.948,"Well, what if the mother believes that it isn't at all in the best interests of the child for whom the support is paid that her other children are going to starve to death if she doesn't use that money?"
1986.86-509,1,19532,catherine_c_mclamb,,1820.948,1822.65,Then that is her choice.
1986.86-509,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1848.565,1852.085,And starve to death?
1986.86-509,1,19532,catherine_c_mclamb,,1852.085,1854.785,--This is a decision that she can make.
1986.86-509,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1865.31,1867.26,Thank You Ms. McLamb.
1986.86-509,1,19532,catherine_c_mclamb,,1870.345,1873.297,You will be able to make your entire argument.
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,1877.118,1879.968,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court:"
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1991.891,1996.778,And you think prior to that time she was pretty careful to spend... how much was it?
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,1996.778,2000.763,She had $189 to support the two older girls.
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2000.763,2006.466,"And she used to spend that $189 for those two, and how much did she get from AFDC for the other three?"
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2006.466,2007.852,$244 for the other three.
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2007.852,2011.97,"So they got $80 apiece, and the other ones got how much apiece?"
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2011.97,2013.322,$95 apiece.
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2013.322,2023.428,Do you think she was really careful to make sure that the family's... the child support money she was getting from the husband went to those two children?
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2044.691,2049.829,"Well, in most of these cases, the amounts of money were not significantly different."
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2070.659,2085.418,Because they were teenagers; not because that's where the support money was... the reality that Congress was addressing in this statute is a reality in which a mother spends whatever money she has for all of the children she's taking care of; isn't that right?
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2085.418,2091.072,--We don't think there's any evidence to show that mothers routinely are violating their court award.
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2099.095,2108.284,Do you know of any case in which a parent has been sued for spending the money on the wrong children?
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2110.903,2114.872,--I'm not aware of any suit that a mother was actually sued--
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2114.872,2119.342,And you think that's because everybody is really keeping close track of how much money they're spending on each of their children?
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2119.342,2121.292,"--Actually, I would like to take that back."
1986.86-509,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2160.503,2163.62,What about the North Carolina law on the right of the child?
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2167.656,2168.339,Yes.
1986.86-509,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2168.339,2168.972,Is that--
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2168.972,2170.458,We feel that--
1986.86-509,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2170.458,2172.258,--What about that law?
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2172.258,2172.926,--We feel that--
1986.86-509,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2172.926,2175.762,Judge McMillan thought there was a property right in the child?
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2175.762,2181.249,--We feel there is no reason that this Court should depart from the lower court's analysis of North Carolina law.
1986.86-509,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2181.249,2186.234,"Well, I know, but what about the... is there some other evidence besides the judge here as to what--"
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2186.234,2188.153,"Well, there's certainly... there's all the case law."
1986.86-509,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2188.153,2189.47,--what North Carolina law is?
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2189.47,2194.824,There's the case law that Judge McMillan of course relied on.
1986.86-509,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2200.478,2207.281,But how do you ignore the state statute permitting the mother to make the assignment?
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2207.281,2208.649,If... the assignment--
1986.86-509,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2208.649,2218.422,Doesn't that sort of undercut the notion that the child has his or her own right to the money?
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2218.422,2219.957,"--No, I don't think it does."
1986.86-509,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2261.701,2276.561,"Yes, but the state statute permits her to do it, but it doesn't say that when she is... if she would choose, because it's not in the best interest of the child not to do it; but she can't make... that's the problem with the Federal law."
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2310.115,2312.484,I think that's just incorrect.
1986.86-509,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2322.942,2325.459,"xxx voluntary, isn't it?"
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2327.677,2331.362,She is forced to apply for AFDC for particular children--
1986.86-509,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2331.362,2336.766,By what law is she forced to apply for AFDC?
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2336.766,2343.153,"--As a condition of getting AFDC for some children, she is forced to apply for all children."
1986.86-509,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2343.153,2345.022,"Oh, it's a condition."
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2345.022,2346.557,It's a... right.
1986.86-509,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2351.009,2353.794,xxx deal with the assignment statute?
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2353.794,2362.067,Judge McMillan talked at length about the assignment provision and how it is the procedural mechanism by which the state--
1986.86-509,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2362.067,2371.189,"Yes, but did he consider it in the process of determining whether the child has a property right?"
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2371.189,2371.972,--He was certainly--
1986.86-509,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2371.972,2383.747,"He didn't consider the state law that says if you assign the child support to get AFDC that it's deemed to be for the benefit of the child, did he?"
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2383.747,2389.384,"--Well, of course, the assignment law in state law doesn't say, and then it is deemed to be in the benefit of the child."
1986.86-509,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2408.714,2414.249,"But if that's what the state law says, doesn't that do something to the child's property right?"
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2414.249,2418.57,--I don't see how it would in any sense.
1986.86-509,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2459.313,2464.182,"But isn't it true that you always get at least the amount you assign back, and sometimes plus $50?"
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2473.573,2483.179,"They got $280 in AFDC and $50 of the support, so there was a net loss of $95."
1986.86-509,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2483.179,2485.096,So they only got... I see.
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2485.096,2486.398,So that's where the loss.
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2489.167,2499.974,They always get back more than the child support that they're trading in; but they don't get back more than the would have gotten had they had the child support plus their former AFDC without that child counted in?
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2499.974,2504.342,"--If you look at the whole family as a total family unit, the mathematics work out that way."
1986.86-509,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2511.162,2514.198,I just want to be sure about one thing.
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2531.175,2533.709,It depends on whose $189 it is.
1986.86-509,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2533.709,2534.527,It's the teenage daughters.
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2547.168,2551.703,I think you would have to look at what the state law says about that type of income.
1986.86-509,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2558.624,2562.844,You think that depends as a matter of... on state law whether that program is bad or not?
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2562.844,2570.783,I think it depends as a matter of state law what the nature of the $189 is.
1986.86-509,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2577.52,2587.143,"My bottom line question was, would you challenge the constitutionality of this basic arrangement if the child support were not a part of it, if it just applied to income that the children earned?"
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2587.143,2589.245,"Well, that wouldn't be the case."
1986.86-509,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2591.53,2595.482,Even though it might have precisely the same economic consequences?
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2595.482,2600.034,"--Again, I think you would have to look at the nature of the income that you're talking about."
1986.86-509,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2600.034,2601.569,"Well, I don't know anything about state law."
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2613.526,2627.036,"If in fact what was happening was that money was being taken from a child who had no obligation to support other children, then I think it would be precisely the same legal situation."
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2630.155,2658.139,"Isn't the logic of your position not only that the 1984 amendment is no good, but that the whole... even if a mother voluntarily wants to include a child who is entitled to child support in the AFDC program, because, let's say, the father is in fact not paying it, and she'd rather have the government try to pursue the father, assign it to the government and get back AFDC for it, even that would be invalid, wouldn't it?"
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2658.139,2659.055,Not if--
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2659.055,2659.991,She's giving away the--
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2659.991,2661.791,--she's not losing anything for the child.
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2661.791,2669.363,"--Oh, but she's not... when she gets it back, she's not going to just spend it on that child, she's going to have to abide by the AFDC regulations, and spend it on all the children."
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2675.351,2678.803,"It keeps it all but the first $50 of it, that's correct."
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2678.803,2680.671,"So that would be bad too, wouldn't it?"
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2694.578,2698.049,"That's a difficult example, because those are not counted for AFDC purposes anyway because--"
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2698.049,2698.982,They're not counted.
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2705.386,2717.778,"--If it were in... if it were in the best interests of that child, because it was only coming in, say, once every six months, then spread out, she's probably not violating any duty she has."
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2717.778,2722.415,"Oh, I see; one-fifth of something is better than a hundred percent of nothing."
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2738.691,2748.982,"Yes, Justice Blackmun, there is an example of that exact situation among the five named parties that are the moving parties in this case, where a child has received--"
1986.86-509,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2748.982,2750.934,"Well, I thought there were, but I haven't heard it mentioned all morning."
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2752.851,2773.53,"--In the Medland family, there was a child, and she was entitled to $200... her father was paying $200 worth of child support for her, and her mother and father decided, between the two of them, that she should move out of the house, because otherwise she would have to be included in the grant, and her standard of living would go down, and they did not wish that to occur."
1986.86-509,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2773.53,2777.668,"--Or if a guardian ad litem came into the picture, he might well take that position?"
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2777.668,2778.451,Indeed.
1986.86-509,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2783.672,2785.038,Where did the child move to?
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2787.19,2789.992,"--In that particular case, she moved with her father."
1986.86-509,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2796.38,2812.822,"Ms. Wettach, I suppose in your view we would have to make a case-by-case determination of how child support payments were used in each household to know whether the Federal provision could be applied or not?"
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2812.822,2828.651,"It seems that it would make more sense for the Court and the Congress to determine... to make a presumption that people were obeying their court orders, in the absence of some evidence to the contrary."
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2870.344,2889.056,"Ms. Wettach, wouldn't you say that one of the... one of the benefits that a child could receive, and one of the purposes for which a mother may use... or a father may use the child's support money is to enable the child to live with brothers and sisters?"
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2916.325,2919.444,There may be individual circumstances where that might be the case.
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2920.811,2934.62,"Wouldn't that be every circumstance in which the mother decides to trade in the support... the support money for AFDC benefits, which will be slightly more than the support money and enable her to keep the family together."
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2944.742,2949.38,"--There may well be some benefits there, and there may well be circumstances."
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2957.986,2958.936,"That's a different question, though."
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2978.149,2978.965,"Again, that may be--"
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2978.965,2980.232,The family unit as a whole.
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,2980.232,2984.803,--that would have to be made on an individual basis as to what is in the best interest.
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3025.63,3026.08,I don't know.
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,3047.477,3056.499,But that may be because there... she's being put under this unconstitutional condition that she has to do that.
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3070.492,3071.809,xxx though.
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,3073.611,3077.579,"Well, it certainly--"
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3077.579,3079.598,I think I'm right about that.
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,3082.55,3084.0,--That is a separate... that's right.
1986.86-509,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3089.971,3107.415,"Ms. Wettach, have you found examples of state court judges who have reduced child support orders because of the impact of this program on the use of the money for the child for whom support was originally ordered?"
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,3107.415,3147.492,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, there was one which was cited in our brief that we were aware of because it was local, and the state... it was a situation where the father was providing a certain amount of support, and he went in and said, look, this is what's happening and what happened in that case is, the state judge ordered that the family be severed for AFDC purpose, and he ordered the county to continue to pay AFDC for the other children, and allowed the father to make in-kind payments to off... so that they wouldn't be counted."
1986.86-509,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3239.419,3242.537,"There's not doubt it has that, it has Federal authorization now, is there?"
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,3242.537,3248.958,--It has Federal statutory authorization under their theory of the statute.
1986.86-509,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3248.958,3257.029,"I thought your case was purely a constitutional case here, since the passage of the more recent AFDC amendment."
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,3259.913,3272.473,We have in our brief suggested that the statute can be read in a different way which would not cause the constitutional problems that are caused by the application as it's been given by Secretary Bowen.
1986.86-509,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3272.473,3276.258,But the District Court didn't agree with you on that point?
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,3276.258,3279.044,That's correct.
1986.86-509,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3335.631,3337.499,xxx.
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,3337.499,3338.682,--Yes.
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3338.682,3341.784,"Has this been preserved below, the Eleventh Amendment?"
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,3341.784,3342.167,Yes.
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3415.266,3424.354,"Ms. Wettach, before you leave, what... what would you suggest the Federal Government have done instead?"
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,3471.334,3490.381,"We think it would be quite reasonable for the Federal Government, and constitutional, to have looked at that family, looked at the AFDC recipients, and determined how much their need was actually reduced by the fact that someone else in the household may have been sharing the burden of the joint expenses."
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3514.662,3517.948,But you wouldn't allow the support payments to be counted in at all?
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,3517.948,3518.983,--It's not that they're counted.
1986.86-509,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3548.836,3551.02,But that's not the reality that Congress has found.
1986.86-509,2,33456,jane_r_wettach,,3577.772,3580.891,"No, I think I told you that there is a way that they can do it."
1986.86-509,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3639.977,3640.827,"Thank you, Ms. Wettach."
