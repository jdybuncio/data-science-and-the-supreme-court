1967.700,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,53.361,"Number 700, Brooks Lee Anderson, petitioner, versus Wilburn C. Johnson, warden."
1967.700,0,32544,j_brad_reed,,55.211,57.707,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.700,1,22198,ed_r_davies,,3291.966,3294.442,"Yes, sir."
1967.700,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3424.654,3428.899,That's the approach that the Court of Appeals brought to this case.
1967.700,1,22198,ed_r_davies,,3428.899,3429.558,That is correct.
1967.700,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3453.377,3465.629,"Well that, Mr. Davies I gather on this puzzling business that although it's criminal prosecution conviction that's in state, always collateral proceedings are civil proceedings."
1967.700,1,22198,ed_r_davies,,3465.629,3466.715,"That is correct, sir."
1967.700,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3466.715,3468.574,But I'm just interested.
1967.700,1,22198,ed_r_davies,,3482.711,3483.763,"Not to my knowledge, sir."
1967.700,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3483.763,3484.717,Yes.
1967.700,1,22198,ed_r_davies,,3492.868,3493.635,"That's correct, sir."
1967.700,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3494.232,3506.156,When this comes up on the collateral federal habeas though we apply the ordinary limitations of review on factual questions decided in the civil cases.
1967.700,1,22198,ed_r_davies,,3506.156,3506.731,"Yes, sir."
1967.700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3520.183,3525.544,What do you think we do in federal criminal cases in direct review?
1967.700,1,22198,ed_r_davies,,3529.432,3534.045,"If Your Honor please, this does not come under Rule 52 (a) as I understand it because juries are involved."
1967.700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3534.045,3540.888,"I know but let's assume it's a trial of the Court, it makes findings."
1967.700,1,22198,ed_r_davies,,3540.888,3560.084,"If Your Honor please, I still don't know the answer to that question where a jury is waived and the district judge decided the case without the intervention of a jury, you frankly called me on the way as I do not know the answer unless it is controlled -- I think the answer to that is this."
1967.700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3560.084,3585.728,What do you -- what do you think happens in a federal criminal case when it's a pretrial hearing on -- to exclude some evidence as having been unconstitutional seized and the district judge make some finding and it's a factual determination not only as to what the historical facts were or are but as to whether these facts have the probable cause for example.
1967.700,1,22198,ed_r_davies,,3585.728,3617.128,"Well, I think from the term of your question, my answer is obvious that you make the federal determinations the Supreme Court does but I believe that his is the distinguishing point here because the federal rules of civil procedure do not apply to the criminal case that you've just discussed and I believe that that is the answer although I frankly not able to quote to you verbatim the terms of the statute but I think that is the distinguishing factor because this is a civil case and controlled by the federal rules of civil procedure for all of them a corrosive criminal procedure."
1967.700,2,32544,j_brad_reed,,5512.155,5514.12,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.700,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5856.245,5858.41,Thank you.
