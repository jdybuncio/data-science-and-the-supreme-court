2016.15-9260,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.44,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 15-9260, Dean v. United States. Mr. Stoler."
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,6.44,36.06,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question confronting this Court is whether a judge can exercise discretion at sentencing in light of congressional directives in Section 924(c) that a 30-year mandatory minimum must be imposed as part of the total sentence. Throughout the Sentencing Reform Act, in the myriad of factors set forth for a judge to consider at arriving at an aggregate sentence that meets the overarching goals of being sufficient, but not greater than necessary."
2016.15-9260,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,46.0,46.24,We don't have --
2016.15-9260,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,46.24,57.24,"We don't doubt that if the -- the mandatory minimums were out of the picture and all we had was the underlying offense here, that this sentence would be reversed on appeal, do you?"
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,57.24,62.71,"I would -- I would submit, yes. That would -- that would be accurate, Your Honor. But in addition --"
2016.15-9260,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,62.71,84.11,"You said nothing in 924(c), but there is a bar on concurrent sentencing. And reading the statute the way you do would shrink the concurrency to the vanishing point if we add only one day to the 924(c) sentence."
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,84.11,92.745,"Well, the concurrent provision requires that it does not -- it runs in addition to the predicate offense."
2016.15-9260,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,108.29,110.535,"But it's 20 years later, right?"
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,110.535,118.33,"It's 20 years later, but -- but 924(c) has -- has been recalibrated over time starting in 1968."
2016.15-9260,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,131.53,132.06,But just --
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,132.06,132.97,-- and things of that nature.
2016.15-9260,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,132.97,153.14,"Just assume the 1028 for a moment didn't exist and say you had to argue from this language, and this essentially repeats Justice Ginsburg's point, but this language says, ""It shall run consecutively, it shall not run concurrently."" And your version of this statute essentially allows a district court to negate that language."
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,159.9,168.08,"Well, we -- we submit that the district court has to give some sentence for the underlying crimes of violence, and then they --"
2016.15-9260,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,168.08,176.06,"Well, ""some sentence,"" you know, a day, six hours, whatever it is, but can essentially make that -- that disappear."
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,186.82,190.735,"Well, Congress, we assume, knows how to write the laws that they write."
2016.15-9260,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,199.86,200.59,"Well, you're right."
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,224.15,237.27,"Well, we would submit that the ""in addition to"" language is making sure that a separate crime is being separately punished, that being the 924(c) crimes that carry the mandatory minimums, in this case of 30 years."
2016.15-9260,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,249.59,266.985,"Counsel, during the time the guidelines were mandatory, but afterwards, many, many court of appeals basically told district courts you can't impose a sentence simply because you disagree with the guideline."
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,306.92,308.14,Correct.
2016.15-9260,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,308.14,315.215,So it's not negating Congress's purpose if a district court gives one day; correct?
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,315.215,316.99,"I would -- I would say not, no."
2016.15-9260,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,316.99,319.62,"And one day is a day of punishment, isn't it?"
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,319.62,321.07,"No question as to that, Your Honor."
2016.15-9260,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,321.535,323.28,Isn't that your point?
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,323.28,325.22,Basically it is that.
2016.15-9260,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,369.685,379.045,"Is -- is the -- 924(c) is a statute, it's nothing to do with the guidelines, and it does say sentences have to be consecutive."
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,389.51,390.88,"Well, just -- just --"
2016.15-9260,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,390.88,393.4,Just adding one day.
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,393.4,398.74,"Well, as Justice Kagan and I discussed, one day is an additional punishment."
2016.15-9260,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,399.62,400.6,She's Justice Sotomayor.
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,400.6,401.27,I'm sorry.
2016.15-9260,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,401.75,403.845,She was the one helping you. (Laughter.)
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,403.845,405.45,I'm sorry.
2016.15-9260,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,405.45,406.33,This is the --
2016.15-9260,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,406.33,409.42,I was the one who wasn't. (Laughter.)
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,409.42,410.595,I got my ends mixed up.
2016.15-9260,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,435.54,436.24,"Well, it seems to me that you --"
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,436.24,437.51,-- to which is something that should be decided.
2016.15-9260,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,437.51,455.215,"It seems to me that you have to concede that your position completely negates the -- or can completely negate the effect of 924, but that there are other reasons why Congress probably would have allowed that."
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,472.265,475.55,And I'm not -- I'm not suggesting that it should be read that way.
2016.15-9260,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,494.45,512.53,"I thought that you were -- I thought that your answer to the Chief Justice was perhaps telling, because you said that you thought that were it not for 924(c), this would be an unreasonable sentence under -- under 3551 and 3553. Isn't -- wasn't that your answer?"
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,512.53,512.99,Yes.
2016.15-9260,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,512.99,553.535,"And doesn't that show that Congress, although it generally conferred on district courts the authority under those provisions to determine what is a reasonable sentence in light of the enumerated factors, withdrew that discretion with respect to the component that is covered by 924(c)? So if that's what the -- if that's what Congress was doing, then why shouldn't that entire sentence be ruled out in determining the sentence that is reasonable under the count that is not governed by 924(c)?"
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,553.535,563.21,Because we don't read 924(c) as being in conflict with -- with 3553(a); you read all the statutes together.
2016.15-9260,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,630.61,631.72,But what about --
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,631.72,635.75,-- have done something; they didn't.
2016.15-9260,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,635.75,659.865,"But what about Judge Lucero's point that Congress can do a belt-and-suspenders operation, as if -- that there was -- there was additional insurance in 1028, doesn't mean that 924(c) shouldn't be read to have a real sentence for the predicate offense?"
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,659.865,671.34,"We would answer that the -- the Congress had the opportunity to do so, and they didn't do so, when they amended 924(c) at least two times since the advent of 1028A."
2016.15-9260,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,703.825,713.18,And you think that's a realistic -- a realistic assessment of the way a legislative body works? They -- so we put this in 924(c)
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,728.77,735.16,We would submit that Congress has --
2016.15-9260,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,735.16,740.2,"A circuit court's ruling -- there's at least one, the Tenth, that had ruled in your favor."
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,740.2,740.92,That's correct.
2016.15-9260,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,740.92,745.75,Had it done so by the time 924(c) was amended?
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,745.75,746.09,Yes.
2016.15-9260,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,759.875,762.35,Postdated or predated the changes in 924 --
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,762.35,765.48,Came out -- came out -- it came after the changes.
2016.15-9260,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,765.48,773.545,"Well, I'll pick up Justice Alito's question, then. Is there any indication that Congress was aware of those court of appeals decisions?"
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,773.545,783.03,"Well, Congress in the past has made changes to 924(c) based upon what courts have done. If we look at the Busic opinion, for example."
2016.15-9260,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,814.915,817.285,How old was your defendant? Do you know?
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,817.285,818.615,He was 24 years old.
2016.15-9260,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,823.1,825.6,So he would be 50-odd something?
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,825.6,830.19,"He would -- he -- under the current sentence, he would serve more time than he's actually lived."
2016.15-9260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,831.315,840.705,"This is something that a direct answer to, because the statutes have changed so quickly that I may have lost track."
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,863.08,865.15,"The judge calculated the guidelines, right."
2016.15-9260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,865.15,865.43,All right.
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,874.11,874.97,40 months in this case --
2016.15-9260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,874.97,875.09,Right.
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,875.09,875.645,"-- Your Honor, yes."
2016.15-9260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,875.645,875.87,All right.
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,936.965,942.94,"Your Honor, I would submit that this is not really a guideline analysis in that the judge made a determination --"
2016.15-9260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,942.94,943.14,No.
2016.15-9260,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,975.2,982.615,"The -- the sentencing judge did depart downward considerably, because the guideline range was --"
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,982.615,983.195,Yes.
2016.15-9260,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,983.195,984.205,"-- here, as in --"
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,984.205,984.81,That's right.
2016.15-9260,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,984.81,985.805,-- what was suggested.
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,989.725,997.885,It was 84 to 105 months without the -- the enhancement that would be under the guidelines if the guns were present.
2016.15-9260,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,997.885,1001.645,So it was a significant -- it was a significant departure.
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,1001.645,1006.79,"And he -- he gave various reasons for making that departure, that variance --"
2016.15-9260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1006.79,1010.6,But the basic reason was he thought that the mandatory was long enough.
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,1010.6,1022.195,"Well, he also -- the judge indicated that the -- the reasons he was considering this was the role that he had -- the role that Levon Dean, Jr., had played compared to the role that his brother had played."
2016.15-9260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1030.41,1035.49,"But the basic reason, I think it's fair to say, is he thought the mandatories were long enough."
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,1035.49,1038.02,If he could -- if he could have gone to --
2016.15-9260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1038.02,1039.73,Let -- let me assume that then.
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,1059.0,1072.99,"Well, and I looked at the -- the factors that are set forth under 3553(a), in which the guidelines are one of those factors, the same as policy statements are one of those factors, and they go, I submit, to the overall sentence that the court imposes."
2016.15-9260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1096.73,1097.51,I -- I know 3553(a)
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,1137.92,1151.35,"Well, I -- I -- I'd like to think I've thought about it from the context of -- of looking at the guidelines as a -- as a starting point and as a -- as a determination that helps to -- to guide a court to consider sentencing."
2016.15-9260,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1221.73,1247.52,"How -- how does that normally work, not in a mandatory minimum way, but if you've got three different offenses and -- and you're going to be sentenced on each of them? On appellate review, how is that reviewed? Is it the total sentence or do they go by one -- one, two, and three and say, we think you abused your discretion in only giving, you know, five months for this and then that doesn't affect the three years you gave for that."
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,1249.16,1290.49,"I -- my understanding is that the -- the -- the appellate review is based upon the reasonableness of the total sentence that's imposed. Now, if there is a portion of that sentence that -- that the court felt that the -- that it wasn't dealt with properly by the sentencing court, then they would address that either for clear error in -- in what was looked at and how the guidelines were applied or de novo as to the applications of the guidelines themselves. So there are those -- those considerations to be made from appellate review standpoint, but the over -- overriding consideration, I would submit, would be the substantive reasonableness for abuse of discretion."
2016.15-9260,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1290.49,1315.805,"In first looking at this case, my thought was that it would be very difficult for the judge to determine what the sentence should be for the underlying crime without looking at what he was require -- or he or she was required to do under 924. But then it occurred to me that judges and lawyers do this all the time."
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,1354.295,1359.93,"Well, that -- I -- I submit, Your Honor, that -- that turns around the determination to be made."
2016.15-9260,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1380.02,1380.93,"Well, that's -- that's -- that's --"
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,1380.93,1381.7,Keep that in mind --
2016.15-9260,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1381.7,1382.815,That's the question before us.
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,1382.815,1402.92,"And I -- and I believe the -- the Court in Smith, United States v. Smith, the Tenth Circuit case that we're relying upon, talks about that. You -- you can't have judges having blinders to look at just the underlying crimes of violence and then -- then doing so as the government is suggesting in this case --"
2016.15-9260,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1402.92,1403.86,"Well, you couldn't under 1028A."
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,1403.86,1407.4,But 1028A has the additional requirement.
2016.15-9260,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1407.4,1414.55,"Well, but you said you can't have this, but you can if we interpret the statute the way the government wants."
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,1414.55,1419.53,My argument is that the -- the Congress could have written the statute to include what they included in 1028A.
2016.15-9260,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1422.065,1472.93,"Now, in terms of that analytical difficulty, there is inherent in this scheme a bit of double -- a lot of double counting, because the substantive crimes almost always, in trying to judge the severity of punishment for that, you're always thinking of the gun, and -- and that always adds to whatever analytically separate punishment you think should be given for the substantive crime. So there is a little bit of twisting of a judge by saying you have to somehow put yourself in the position of punishing this person without knowing that he's going to be punished for the gun anyway for 30 years, and think of what the punishment should be without that punishment."
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,1476.795,1477.785,Yes.
2016.15-9260,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1477.785,1489.84,"The identity theft add-ons, one is -- for every crime except terrorism is only two years, correct?"
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,1489.84,1491.44,"Correct, the aggravated identity theft."
2016.15-9260,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1491.44,1501.51,And in many ways it's punishing for a separate activity than merely the possession of identity theft items.
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,1501.51,1507.49,"Well, there are -- listed within the statute are the specified crimes that it would apply to, yes."
2016.15-9260,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1507.49,1508.395,Exactly.
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,1511.01,1514.34,"In -- in those -- in those instances, yes."
2016.15-9260,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1522.26,1523.14,"Thank you, counsel."
2016.15-9260,0,62815,alan_g_stoler,,1523.14,1527.605,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2016.15-9260,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1527.605,1528.725,Mr. Yang.

2016.15-9260,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1559.805,1562.545,It -- it would circumvent it.
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1575.205,1595.315,"Well, I think it's true that Congress could have written it more clearly, but we think that Congress here, when you take a look at both the provisions of 924(c) and then read them in conjunction with the provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act makes sufficiently clear Congress's intent that --"

2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1627.83,1631.08,I agree that thrusts are not a thing.
2016.15-9260,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1633.08,1634.09,I know what you're quoting.

2016.15-9260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1662.87,1674.225,"It didn't say it anywhere. This is not taken into account by the commission, unless you can tell me there's a guideline on this particular application of the mandatory minimum."
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1694.59,1694.98,I -- I think the --
2016.15-9260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1694.98,1696.91,And therefore the language allows it.
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1715.91,1719.3,"Well, I guess to the whole argument, we have a few responses."
2016.15-9260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1719.3,1720.01,I know you do.
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1720.01,1729.04,"But -- but I think -- first of all, on the -- on the guidelines point, the guidelines have taken this into account since the very beginning when you were on the Sentencing Commission."
2016.15-9260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1729.04,1729.13,Where?
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1729.13,1729.24,Well --
2016.15-9260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1729.24,1731.16,Where did you take this? Where.
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1731.16,1747.95,"Well, the guidelines specifically address in Section 2K2.4, comment note 4, they talk about how you -- and as well as in Chapter 5 about determining a total sentence based on aggregate sentences, multiple terms of imprisonment."

2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1776.56,1787.7,"I don't think it cuts against us, as in -- in we're going to have multiple discussions about these various factors. First, I don't think the guidelines shed a lot of light on the statutory question here."
2016.15-9260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1798.31,1800.005,You look at 2.4.

2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1915.98,1916.39,Right.
2016.15-9260,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1916.39,1920.87,-- the district court can enlarge the original sentence for the predicate offense.
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1920.87,1925.77,"And because we think -- and this is what happens in -- in courts, courts are applying the guidelines."
2016.15-9260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1946.19,1952.53,"Where? Where? I mean, I -- my quick reading of 4, I promise I didn't memorize the guidelines."
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1989.03,2011.5,"Well, when you go to 5G1.2, which governs the total sentence, the -- when you have multiple offenses with terms of imprisonment, it says you -- you calculate the total sentence with respect to the non-924(c)'s and then you tack on --"
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2011.5,2012.875,"1.2, I believe."
2016.15-9260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2015.89,2016.255,Right --
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2016.255,2018.66,I think around page 42 of our brief.
2016.15-9260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2019.85,2027.87,Maybe I'll find it.
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2027.87,2036.76,"So the -- the point is the -- this is the way that the guidelines have been applied, and they were applied, in fact, in this way in this case."
2016.15-9260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2058.31,2058.62,Yeah.

2016.15-9260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2062.52,2062.65,Yeah.

2016.15-9260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2073.56,2073.78,No.
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2075.44,2075.66,He varied.
2016.15-9260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2086.78,2086.86,No.
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2111.13,2115.63,"Well, I would, I guess -- first of all, we're not relying on the --"
2016.15-9260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2115.63,2117.16,"My fault, not your fault."
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2117.16,2118.99,We're not relying on the guidelines as an affirmative.
2016.15-9260,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2122.45,2148.355,"But what are you suggesting ought to happen? I mean, presumably, the guidelines reflect an idea that there shouldn't be any double-counting of the gun, right? So what does -- how does the court do the -- the sentence on the underlying crime, taking away the fact of the gun? In other words, most robberies have guns in them, and the sentences are written to reflect that they have guns in them, don't they? Aren't they?"
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2148.355,2149.84,"No, actually."
2016.15-9260,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2169.76,2178.54,"What you think ought to happen is that the -- is that the judge should say, okay, imagine a robbery without a gun, what would be a reasonable sentence for that."
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2178.54,2191.01,"I think the judge should do -- take into account what judges normally do under a real offense sentencing approach, which is you look at the offense conduct, you look at the history and characteristics of the defender --"
2016.15-9260,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2191.01,2192.93,"Well, offense conduct, does that mean without a gun?"
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2192.93,2194.75,But -- but without the gun.
2016.15-9260,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2233.63,2242.2,"Well, that -- that's an excerpt from the legislative history that, it seems to me, is unimportant in light of what 3553 says."
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2252.08,2252.46,But the 3553 --
2016.15-9260,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2252.46,2259.6,And it seems to me you're asking us to say that 924(c) really supersedes 3553.
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2259.6,2260.68,No.
2016.15-9260,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2374.21,2383.48,"Well that's where I don't understand your -- your answer to Justice Kennedy, because you said, no, you're not saying that 924 supersedes 3553."
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2399.795,2411.035,"I guess in a sense we are saying that, but I don't think it -- it operates directly on 3553(a), because I don't think 3553(a) operates as a freestanding -- freestanding provision."
2016.15-9260,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2422.94,2431.745,"One way you might look at this, and this goes back to what the Chief Justice said, he said, well, when there's a 30-year sentence implicated, you better be pretty clear."
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2444.13,2444.41,But the --
2016.15-9260,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2444.41,2448.23,"And here, you're just not -- you just have not been clear enough."
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2457.005,2477.8,"We think that it's clear enough because 3553(a) applies by -- when you -- for purposes of setting the total term of imprisonment, the only reason 3553(a) applies is because Congress provided that they are to be considered in 3584(b) in setting the consecutive or concurrent sentence."
2016.15-9260,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2496.34,2506.714,"If this case had arisen before the Sentencing Reform Act was adopted, I -- I think that Dean's argument would certainly be correct, would it not?"
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2506.714,2509.99,I think we would have a more difficult --
2016.15-9260,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2509.99,2519.03,"The judge would have complied with the statute, the term wasn't consecutive, and other than that, it was discretionary."
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2521.18,2540.8,"I think what we would have to argue in that case is that the Congress would have known that the traditional place that judges determine the aggregate length of a sentence, when there are multiple offenses carrying terms of imprisonment, is in the determination that -- of whether the sentences run concurrently or consecutively."
2016.15-9260,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2540.8,2543.14,"At a minimum, you would have had a very tough argument."
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2558.335,2558.77,Yeah.
2016.15-9260,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2558.77,2570.68,"So we're in this kind of weird -- we're -- we're in this weird world that this Court has created where the guidelines are advisory, but then they're not advisory, and so that's why we have this problem; is that correct?"
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2570.68,2571.41,Well --
2016.15-9260,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2571.41,2573.95,You don't want to say that because -- (Laughter.)
2016.15-9260,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2573.95,2575.33,-- nobody but me would agree with you.
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2575.33,2582.61,We -- we -- we obviously accept Booker as the proper interpretation of the law -- of the Constitution.
2016.15-9260,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2591.73,2592.33,Mr. Yang --
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2592.33,2593.01,-- reason that we're correct.
2016.15-9260,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2593.01,2605.385,"-- I mean, the lack of beauty of the guidelines is they're so artificial on so many levels; all right? What differentiates a normal theft from a robbery is the use of force."
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2697.435,2701.5,"Well, I think -- I'm not here to criticize the guidelines."
2016.15-9260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2712.55,2716.495,"That's -- that's what I'm trying -- I'm not criticizing, not criticizing."
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2720.15,2720.63,"Well, we --"
2016.15-9260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2720.63,2722.78,"Now, if we had the guidelines there -- try this."
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2759.55,2760.35,"Well, I think --"
2016.15-9260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2760.35,2760.85,-- on the appellate part.
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2760.85,2763.08,-- that you'd have to look to the reasonableness of the sentence overall.
2016.15-9260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2763.08,2767.29,Over -- what -- what is it -- there's a word in the appellate part when they're doing the review.
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2771.19,2772.16,I think it is reasonable.
2016.15-9260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2772.16,2773.415,"Yeah, I think it is too. Okay."
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2773.95,2775.22,Reasonable always is a good word.
2016.15-9260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2775.22,2776.53,"Correct, correct, correct. (Laughter.)"
2016.15-9260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2776.53,2792.07,"So that's the -- that's the -- the question in this case beyond the case is really, how do we do that? And so -- so what I would try out is, it would be obvious if you're right and the statute is clear; okay? The -- the 924(c)"
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2799.12,2799.69,"Well, I think --"
2016.15-9260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2799.69,2814.645,"And now -- now, what about looking -- looking to see what the commission said about it, noting that this is an individual case, not general, not general where the district court has more power or other things."
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2818.6,2823.47,I -- I don't believe the commission gets any deference with respect to construing Federal statutes.
2016.15-9260,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2823.47,2824.79,"Well, I --"
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2824.79,2829.12,"With respect to the guidelines, yes, but with respect to construing Federal statutes, I -- I don't think so."

2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2852.47,2858.13,"That's 3584, and that's been taken away because Congress took away the power to -- to have concurrent sentences."
2016.15-9260,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2858.13,2868.84,"If you think the case is resolved at a higher level, it seems to me that your -- your friend has a very good technical argument that says these sentences have to run concurrently."
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2908.58,2908.73,"Well, our --"
2016.15-9260,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2908.73,2917.64,"What's your -- what's your best case when you have a very significant sanction in the balance, and you have technical compliance on one hand, but clearly contrary to purpose?"
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2917.64,2922.41,We don't think that the -- that they're technically correct.
2016.15-9260,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2922.41,2923.06,"Well, I understand that."
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2923.06,2931.37,"We -- we think that there is a plausible argument that they make on the text, but we think that the proper approach is you always have to approach statutes holistically."
2016.15-9260,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2935.52,2948.25,"Well, but then there are also these basic rules they -- I mean, you insist when citizens deal with the government that they turn square corners, and I think it's right for a criminal defendant when they're facing 30 additional years to insist that the government turn square corners."
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2948.25,2952.45,"Well, I think what you might be referring to is the principle of lenity."
2016.15-9260,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2964.42,2969.48,But I don't think you have to go to a principle of lenity for Mr. Stoler to be right.
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3016.79,3028.88,"I would say that it's true that it -- it eviscerates the purpose and the whole structure of the statute, but the statute says a lot by removing authority."
2016.15-9260,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3078.82,3083.125,"So you're saying that in this case, the judge says I can't look at 3553(a)?"
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3083.125,3084.24,"No, he does."
2016.15-9260,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3087.13,3089.615,But -- but -- but other than for the initial downward departure.
2016.15-9260,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3089.615,3107.91,"But -- but -- but for the total. You -- for -- you can look at 3553(a) in setting the individual terms, but Congress separately addressed how you make those terms, how you add them, make them -- the total, it depends on the aggregate; right?
