1997.96-1584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.998,"We'll hear argument next in Number 96-1584, Terry Campbell v. Louisiana."
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,48.231,51.151,"Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.96-1584,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,103.069,110.206,Is it true that there's never been a nonwhite foreman in Evangeline County?
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,110.206,117.391,I would not know past the evidence presented to the trial court.
1997.96-1584,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,125.325,132.745,But you're saying from the years... what time frame are we talking about that there has been no nonwhite?
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,132.745,141.225,--A 16-1/2 year time period during which generally there are supposed to be two grand juries selected each year.
1997.96-1584,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,148.91,159.733,"There's a difference in the way the foreperson is selected in New Orleans, is that right?"
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,159.733,161.186,"I believe there is, Your Honor."
1997.96-1584,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,161.186,164.825,Is the experience any different there?
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,164.825,166.543,I would not know that.
1997.96-1584,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,167.918,175.493,So you don't know whether Evangeline County is unique in Louisiana or represents the general way things are--
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,175.493,185.302,"I would say, Your Honor, that there have been cases brought up in a lot of the parishes in Louisiana, in Sabine Parish, I believe in Lafayette Parish and Lake Charles."
1997.96-1584,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,190.784,192.846,--This same issue?
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,192.846,196.906,The issue of nonselection of whites to the grand jury--
1997.96-1584,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,196.906,200.483,So apparently other parishes are doing the same thing.
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,200.483,203.466,"--To a greater or lesser extent, yes, sir."
1997.96-1584,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,204.232,204.763,Uhhuh.
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,218.367,219.82,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1584,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,224.099,229.19,"How would that work in connection with a single person, a foreperson?"
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,245.246,253.805,"--You're right, Your Honor, in prior courts... in prior cases this Court has found problems in applying fair crosssection to a single person."
1997.96-1584,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,258.741,260.788,"Right, so... but you're pursuing that claim, nonetheless."
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,260.788,262.537,"Oh, yes, Your Honor, definitely."
1997.96-1584,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,262.897,265.927,"Well, would you like to justify it, since you're pursuing it?"
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,265.927,266.818,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1584,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,311.002,312.86,How does this work?
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,317.313,322.108,"--Your Honor, I'm not 100-percent sure about the number of 300."
1997.96-1584,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,325.902,331.572,And the judge selects someone from that large number to be the foreperson of the grand jury.
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,331.572,332.697,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1584,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,332.697,342.77,And then subsequently the other members of the grand jury are selected at random by a clerk or something of that sort.
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,342.77,346.863,"Your Honor, that's the way the Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure Article 413 reads."
1997.96-1584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,373.587,377.132,What does the foreperson of a grand jury do in Louisiana?
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,377.132,382.754,"Your Honor, that is pointed out in the State's brief at page 26."
1997.96-1584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,399.186,400.42,Can he cast a vote himself?
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,400.42,401.092,"Oh, yes, he does."
1997.96-1584,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,404.357,409.509,And that was left out of the State's description of his powers at page 26.
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,409.509,411.992,--I don't think the State was trying to mislead.
1997.96-1584,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,418.989,426.472,"Well, it said it's ministerial, because he has some duties that might be called ministerial, but he's also a vote... or she is also a voting member."
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,426.472,430.19,--And that I believe is the very important fact in here.
1997.96-1584,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,448.323,453.32,"Is that different, then, from the situation in the Hobby case that we had?"
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,453.32,455.555,--In the Hobby case--
1997.96-1584,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,455.555,462.661,Where the Court said the grand jury foreman in that case had a ministerial role?
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,462.661,481.388,"--The basic difference is, in the Hobby case a grand jury, the entire grand jury is selected in a fair manner and then that one person, the grand jury foreman, is given the job of doing the clerk duties for the grand jury, but the point is that whole grand jury was chosen in a fair manner."
1997.96-1584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,481.388,484.356,But in Hobby how was the foreman chosen?
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,484.356,486.292,"I believe he was chosen by the judge, Your Honor."
1997.96-1584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,486.292,487.682,Why is that different?
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,490.071,495.804,"It's different because the judge is looking at the grand jury, the entire grand jury panel who was chosen in a fair fashion."
1997.96-1584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,513.39,516.655,"But in Hobby it was the same objection, wasn't it?"
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,519.466,523.308,"The objection... yes, the objection was that the foreperson was always white."
1997.96-1584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,538.506,542.956,But a choice was just made in a discriminatory fashion by people already chosen.
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,545.19,552.016,"Oh, there is a discrimination and at that point you would look to... and Hobby focused on what is the harm that is going to come from this."
1997.96-1584,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,560.872,562.526,"Well, Hobby focused on the remedy."
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,562.526,563.651,On the remedy.
1997.96-1584,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,563.651,566.729,"And what do we have to look at here, just standing?"
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,571.21,572.179,"Well, we would--"
1997.96-1584,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,572.179,572.96,--but just standing?
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,572.96,577.598,--We would submit that remedy is implicated and that standing is implicated.
1997.96-1584,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,606.665,620.816,"Well, I thought that all... of the questions in the petition refer to whether your client has standing to raise the equal protection claim, the due process claim, and the fair crosssection claim."
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,625.642,628.656,"--Your Honor, the questions do--"
1997.96-1584,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,628.656,632.717,Other than to rule on the standing claim.
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,632.717,636.637,"--Your Honor, we do need to have rulings from this Court on standing."
1997.96-1584,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,640.105,642.354,"Send it back, I assume."
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,642.354,643.963,"Well, Your Honor, that's--"
1997.96-1584,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,643.963,648.712,If we were to determine there was standing on some or all of these matters.
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,648.712,650.851,"--Your Honor, that is one option open to this Court."
1997.96-1584,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,651.335,671.826,"Mr. Burnes, going back from Peters v. Kiff on, in any case where this Court allowed someone to challenge as discriminatory the selection of the petit jury or the grand jury, in any one of those cases, has the result ever been anything other than the conviction got set aside?"
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,671.826,677.06,"--Well, of course, the Hobby case, Your Honor, the conviction was not set aside."
1997.96-1584,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,695.942,707.735,"Might... conceivably in this case if standing were recognized the Court could say, but you haven't shown that there was, in fact, discrimination in the selection of the--"
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,707.735,709.86,--Conceivably the Court could take that opinion.
1997.96-1584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,746.954,755.731,"--Mr. Burnes, if you wanted to bring that issue here you're obligated to put it in your question presented, I think, as Justice O'Connor has pointed out."
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,760.072,767.336,"--And again, Your Honor, those... the questions do raise the issue of standing, which has been a roadblock in this case."
1997.96-1584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,777.332,777.754,"Fairly subsumed, I think."
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,789.718,793.809,"--Your Honor is correct, standing and remedy are distinct."
1997.96-1584,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,849.193,857.518,"Now, in this case your client raised this... these claims all along--"
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,857.518,858.096,Yes.
1997.96-1584,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,858.096,859.424,--in the proceedings below.
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,864.671,875.074,"That's correct, Your Honor, and I haven't had a chance to say it yet, but the equal protection claim has that bare naive claim I just mentioned and also has the more sophisticated third party standing."
1997.96-1584,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,877.275,880.618,"I'm sorry, I didn't understand what you... has the bare what claim?"
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,880.618,883.366,"--The bare, or naive equal protection claim."
1997.96-1584,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,896.97,909.185,Are you also raising... urging that the... Campbell has standing to raise the denial of equal protection to the nonwhite who might have been selected?
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,909.185,910.794,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,928.738,935.111,"The first equal protection question is sort of... I mean, it's a very strange assertion of equal protection."
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,956.79,958.96,--In the--
1997.96-1584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,958.96,963.428,It's almost gameplaying to say that this is an equal protection violation.
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,968.207,977.063,"--It is a standing question, Your Honor, and that's the way the trial court and the supreme court of the State of Louisiana have ruled, is that Mr. Campbell did not have standing to raise--"
1997.96-1584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,977.063,992.057,"Right, and it would be perfectly equal protection if Louisiana rules a black man has standing to challenge the exclusion of blacks, and a white man has standing to challenge the exclusion of whites, and neither one has a standing to challenge the opposite."
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,994.197,1004.739,"--Well, the cases in the past, Your Honor, have held that, for instance in Batson, on a preemptory challenge, it doesn't matter whether the defendant is black or white."
1997.96-1584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1008.799,1009.049,That's right.
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,1017.953,1020.109,"Your Honor, I'm--"
1997.96-1584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1020.109,1021.624,The standing question is right or wrong.
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,1026.857,1045.114,"--Perhaps the reason I'm arguing this way is because the trial courts and the supreme court of the State of Louisiana have couched their rulings in terms of the fact that Mr. Campbell, you are a white man accused of killing a white man, therefore you don't have standing to raise this claim or that claim or the other claim, and--"
1997.96-1584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1045.114,1047.176,That's either right or wrong.
1997.96-1584,0,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,1047.176,1052.267,--That... and I believe in this case Mr. Campbell has a right to raise the equal protection claim.
1997.96-1584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1261.386,1263.744,"Very well, Mr. Burnes."
1997.96-1584,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1265.509,1272.475,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.96-1584,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1293.67,1293.967,But then it's not a problem.
1997.96-1584,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1297.777,1299.23,--That's correct.
1997.96-1584,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1299.23,1301.355,"And you'd say there wasn't, and he'd say there was, so we'd have an argument."
1997.96-1584,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1301.355,1302.056,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1584,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1352.927,1367.264,"General Ieyoub, you don't dispute, do you the figures that were presented that for the last 16 years there's never been a nonwhite grand jury foreperson in Evangeline County?"
1997.96-1584,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1367.264,1367.967,"No, Your Honor."
1997.96-1584,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1369.81,1373.012,So it wouldn't matter what went on in other counties.
1997.96-1584,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1391.427,1395.957,"Your Honor, Orleans Parish is treated differently throughout Louisiana law."
1997.96-1584,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1409.622,1415.573,But you wouldn't have this problem if you did it throughout the State the way they do it in that parish.
1997.96-1584,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1415.573,1422.398,"Well, Your Honor, in Orleans Parish the judge does choose the foreman and then the judge also selects the other 11."
1997.96-1584,2,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,2942.932,2946.4,May it please the Court--
1997.96-1584,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2962.378,2966.891,"But look... look... I mean, I have no problem with your due process standing."
1997.96-1584,2,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,3013.498,3024.103,"That he was denied the opportunity to have an impartial grand jury look at the evidence presented to that grand jury and say, we're only going to indict him for manslaughter, or we're not even going to indict him at all."
1997.96-1584,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3025.914,3033.834,"But there could be no possible mistake a grand jury's having found there to be probable cause, given that a petit jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that he's guilty."
1997.96-1584,2,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,3056.23,3059.072,Mr. Campbell was convicted.
1997.96-1584,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3065.43,3076.816,"He has that right and there was an error made and somebody should correct that, but did that error deprive him of... make his conviction fundamentally unfair?"
1997.96-1584,2,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,3088.216,3092.621,"Your Honor, we aren't arguing that the conviction was fundamentally unfair."
1997.96-1584,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3097.729,3114.894,"--Well, in the Mechanic case in the Federal courts we held that even though a Federal grand jury does not conform to the requirements set up by Congress, nonetheless, if the person is convicted, the shortcomings of the grand jury are harmless error."
1997.96-1584,2,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,3120.283,3127.763,"Your Honor, there's... because the long line of cases from this Court which find that racial discrimination at the grand jury--"
1997.96-1584,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3127.763,3130.262,But those are not due process cases.
1997.96-1584,2,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,3130.262,3151.083,"--Well, with respect to the due process, I believe there is a due process harm there when, in order to be convicted and sentenced to a life sentence in Louisiana, the citizen has a right to the indictment by the grand jury and the grand jury here was not impartial, did not have... he was not--"

1997.96-1584,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3168.544,3170.245,Which was an equal protection case.
1997.96-1584,2,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,3170.245,3173.573,--Which says that you cannot determine--
1997.96-1584,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3173.573,3179.883,"You're just melding together the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Due Process Clause, it seems to me."

1997.96-1584,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3255.961,3258.898,"And grand jury both, I think."
1997.96-1584,2,20528,dmitrc_i_burnes,,3258.898,3261.226,And extended to grand juries.
