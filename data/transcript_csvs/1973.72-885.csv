1973.72-885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,25.753,"We’ll hear arguments next in 72-885, William v. Richardson."
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,28.722,32.179,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-885,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,540.183,546.116,"Mr. Solicitor General, do I gather from your brief that no one can attack this?"
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,546.116,555.346,"I am -- Mr. Justice Marshall, I am unable for the moment to imagine how this particular provision could be attacked, but of course that is not --"
1973.72-885,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,555.346,556.219,The Court will be --
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,556.219,563.943,"Yes the Court, the Court yes, but that of course is not a unusual situation with constitutional provisions."
1973.72-885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,571.002,578.58,"But Congress could require them to render an account down to the last postage stamp if they wanted, could they not?"
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,578.58,580.136,"Undoubtedly, yes Mr. Chief Justice."
1973.72-885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,587.995,598.689,"Isn’t the issue in this case, who is to define what is a regular statement and account under --"
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,598.689,600.496,That --
1973.72-885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,600.496,603.129,-- whether it’s Congress or whether it’s the court or someone else?
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,603.129,625.687,"That is the -- a question we must get into it to some degree at least Mr. Chief Justice that it also impinges upon the ultimate question if the respondent were found to have standing, but I think the second Flast test which talks about what is the purpose of a constitutional provision necessarily requires to be talked about that as well."
1973.72-885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,627.578,630.711,"If we need to get to that at all that’s the point, isn’t it?"
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,630.711,631.446,Well --
1973.72-885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,631.446,636.867,"If we reach that, are you suggesting that it’s not necessary to reach that?"
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,636.867,640.188,"No, no I was about Mr. Chief Justice to discuss that very point."
1973.72-885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,640.188,642.625,Very well.
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,646.992,654.987,The second Flast test is of course the question of whether the taxpayer has stated a relationship and nexus between themselves and the constitutional provision.
1973.72-885,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,832.651,842.244,"Mr. Solicitor General if it's just for the benefit of Congress, I would think Congress could have provided for that by law for finding it the Constitution?"
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,849.291,851.488,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I wouldn’t think so."
1973.72-885,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,878.897,879.711,Oh!
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,889.429,891.411,Entirely true Mr. Justice Stewart by hypothesis.
1973.72-885,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,891.411,893.54,And for every member the American Public?
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,893.54,894.076,I beg your pardon?
1973.72-885,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,894.076,895.442,For every member of the American Public.
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,895.442,896.201,That is entirely true.
1973.72-885,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,896.201,904.432,"I mean that the President has to be a national born citizen or that the Senator has to be, what is it, 30 years old or whatever."
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,913.187,914.105,That’s entirely true.
1973.72-885,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,949.718,953.267,To convince Congress even that is their constitutional duty to do so?
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,953.267,953.98,That is correct.
1973.72-885,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,953.98,955.443,Even if they don’t want to?
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,955.443,959.355,That is correct.
1973.72-885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1056.914,1070.542,What is the practice now? I am not very clear on it with reference to publishing details of the expenses of the operation of the Congress itself and perhaps it’s not relevant?
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1070.542,1076.125,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice I hope it’s not because I cannot answer the question."
1973.72-885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1076.125,1089.063,I have the impression that there are complaints from time-to-time and others by various people that Congress does not ever publish any account on the detailed expenditures?
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1089.063,1095.301,"I have not -- I have heard those complaints, I have not inquired into the details here."
1973.72-885,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1262.469,1265.181,"Mr. Solicitor General, if I may interrupt you and to go back a moment."
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1273.066,1278.954,"Ex parte Levitt, Mr. Justice Stewart is found at 302 U.S. 633."
1973.72-885,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1278.954,1282.856,Thank you.
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1282.856,1307.685,"So I think the Laird v. Tatum is also a direct holding and a more recent one, Laird than Ex parte Levitt, that there is no standing in this case, I think I should say why I think it’s important, why I think standing is much more than a rule of judicial self-restraint or discretionary rule as the respondent’s brief puts it and as some of the cases put it, I think it is."
1973.72-885,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1643.792,1651.46,"General Bork, may I ask you a question that has nothing to do really I suppose on the merits."
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1663.061,1664.349,I don’t know the authority.
1973.72-885,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1664.349,1669.471,Could be that if he was on the panel he is automatically on it?
1973.72-885,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1669.471,1677.788,"Well, this is what I question because Section 46 (c) makes no reference whatsoever to a District Judge who sat on the panel."
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1711.926,1718.703,"In our brief or in our petition Mr. Justice Blackmun, I am sorry to say that I am having difficulty at moment locating the footnote."
1973.72-885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1718.703,1721.842,I think you have pointed out that it made no difference in the end result.
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1725.734,1733.269,"I think Mr. Chief Justice that we did say that there was only some doubt, probably it was incorrect, but in this case we do not make a big point."
1973.72-885,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1733.269,1735.617,"You are making no point of it, but I am --"
1973.72-885,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1735.617,1739.789,"This is in the footnote 5, Mr. Solicitor General of your petition."
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1741.025,1742.153,Page 6.
1973.72-885,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1742.153,1747.261,Page 6.
1973.72-885,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1747.261,1765.027,"Mr. Solicitor General, you do not address yourself in the brief or to the -- or in your oral argument to the question of justifiability it’s -- the District Court said -- How do you view the District Court’s decision to dismiss?"
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1765.027,1765.155,Oh!
1973.72-885,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1767.671,1769.501,On what ground did he dismiss?
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1769.501,1774.28,District Court dismissed on both grounds of standing and political question.
1973.72-885,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1783.421,1793.45,And you don’t -- your suggestion is that if we disagreed with you on standing I take it you anticipate we would remand to the Court of Appeals to consider political question or --
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1793.45,1794.902,Or to the District Court --
1973.72-885,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1794.902,1797.778,You do not address yourself to that issue here?
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1797.778,1810.548,"No, I think that Mr. Justice White, I think the Court of Appeals was correct that the political question issue could be resolved much more effectively if we were into the full merits of the case than we can at this stage."
1973.72-885,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1816.948,1827.962,"So the Court of Appeals did say that it did not reach here the political question -- it must have reversed to District Court on that too, it must have?"
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1827.962,1838.122,"Well, in the sense that if -- I suppose it did in the sense that it said political question was not properly considered until we got to the merits."
1973.72-885,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1838.122,1842.971,So the dismissal on that ground was reversed also by the Court?
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1842.971,1849.517,"Yes it was Mr. Justice White, but not on the ground that the District Court was wrong about political question but --"
1973.72-885,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1849.517,1851.879,"And then do you agree with that, I take it that you agree with that."
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1860.211,1862.2,I think that’s correct.
1973.72-885,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1862.2,1868.716,And how about the motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action?(Voice overlap)
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1870.291,1872.758,"That would be the merits, we have to reached the question of whether --"
1973.72-885,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1872.758,1876.475,"No, it wouldn’t be that – it would be the --"
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1876.475,1879.041,"In the meaning of Article I, Clause -- Section 7 --"
1973.72-885,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1879.041,1884.838,As to whether we're satisfied perhaps by the congressional -- by the statutes on the books?
1973.72-885,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1884.838,1886.993,That is correct.
1973.72-885,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1886.993,1892.864,Did the motion to dismiss properly raise the issue of justiciability?
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,2031.961,2035.697,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-885,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2193.934,2212.476,"Do you think Mr. Fraenkel that there would be the same standing and the same justiciability in a claim brought to -- by a taxpayer, your client for a full statement of account receipts and disbursements on the building of the Rayburn building for example?"
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,2212.476,2213.686,No.
1973.72-885,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2285.602,2291.53,"I am puzzled then, why you should have any difficulty with the costs of the Rayburn building Mr. Fraenkel?"
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,2299.095,2300.854,"No, but I don’t say that --"
1973.72-885,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2300.854,2302.892,Why shouldn’t you be able to get it?
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,2324.786,2326.686,"Oh, I think that Congress reaches all agencies --"
1973.72-885,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2326.686,2327.161,The clause.
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,2327.161,2330.157,Because it reaches all agencies of the Government.
1973.72-885,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2350.896,2359.323,"Well, we will resume there after lunch.[Luncheon Recess]"
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,2364.407,2389.496,"To come back to your question Mr. Chief Justice, I suppose if we come to the merits of this case as I think if I am correct on my issue of standing the District Court will come to as to Justice Rehnquist's question earlier, I think that will go back to the District Court."
1973.72-885,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2532.077,2546.759,The applicant or the movement or whoever he was in Levitt was a member of the Bar of this Court interested in the -- being an officer of a Court that was constitutionally valid?
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,2546.759,2547.781,Yes!
1973.72-885,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2576.263,2580.633,"But then his claim would be under the Bill of Rights and not under the Republican form of Government law, was it?"
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,2580.633,2587.643,That’s true and that of course brings us to the question which I do not think can be decided or should be decided here.
1973.72-885,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2623.261,2627.709,Let me come back if I may for a moment to the Levitt case.
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,2656.784,2677.348,"I would say that I suppose it’s a matter general interest to the public of this country whether one of our present Executives could be subject to impeachment perhaps, but I don’t think anyone could contend that the individual could bring a proceeding towards that end."
1973.72-885,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2696.782,2723.938,Similarly the -- at least the claim of the government who would be undoubtedly be if it isn't already that the constitutional clause and question here has been implemented by Congress by a statute tender a general rather than a detailed annual account or periodic account?
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,2723.938,2741.832,"A particular statute which we say Congress had no power to enact because excluded, it didn’t merely describe categories, but it is excluded an important organ of Government from any disclosure."
1973.72-885,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2741.832,2757.27,But couldn’t it just as well had been argued in Levitt that the Senate had no power to confirm Justice Black because he had voted to increase the emolument of the office which was sum of the constitution then prohibited him from taking?
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,2757.27,2782.811,"Well, I would say that if the constitution -- provision of the constitution that we are now considering said that the accounts of agencies of the Government shall be published to the extent that Congress may provide."
1973.72-885,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2939.472,2954.389,"Mr. Fraenkel on the point of the right of the public to know about expenditures by the Congress, the Solicitor General mentioned the Manhattan Project during World War II."
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,2972.017,2979.257,I think that in time of war many considerations exist which do not otherwise.
1973.72-885,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2993.266,3003.574,Would you think it perhaps equally important to have information that how Government to have information that might prevent war?
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3003.574,3007.046,"Well, of course it’s important to say have information."
1973.72-885,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3029.662,3030.064,Mr. Fraenkel --
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3030.064,3038.541,But we’re dealing here with an agency which had been in existence now for some 25 years.
1973.72-885,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3038.541,3040.085,Do you know?
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3052.686,3054.392,"I do not know, Your Honor."
1973.72-885,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3054.392,3063.05,"There is a special oversight committee of the Congress, is there not, which does have access to all the details."
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3063.05,3074.994,Of course there are also specific appropriations enacted by the Congress for particular agencies of government which are public acts and therefore available to the public.
1973.72-885,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3093.445,3098.812,You could win on your standing argument and still lose on that argument?
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3098.812,3101.74,We could lose in the Court below said --
1973.72-885,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3101.74,3102.634,"On the merits, on the ground?"
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3102.634,3103.498,We can lose on the merits --
1973.72-885,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3103.498,3105.228,-- that the law wasn't violated?
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3105.228,3108.624,We could lose on the merits certainly.
1973.72-885,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3133.778,3146.642,"Mr. Fraenkel, I do not still understand that why you say we don’t -- we aren’t -- we would not be compelled to reach the political question issue if we agreed with you on standing?"
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3146.642,3147.17,"Well, if you being --"
1973.72-885,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3147.17,3158.671,"Because the Court of Appeals did reverse the judgment of the District Court and at least dealt with standing -- dealt with political question to the extent that by -- upholding that it was right, that it was intertwined with the merit."
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3158.897,3173.693,"Of course this Court has the -- I am at loss to find the right word to say the privilege may I say, of deciding anything that this Court thinks should be decided, that’s happened before."
1973.72-885,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3175.809,3186.239,If we affirm the judge -- if we have affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals we're also affirming their judgment that political question doctrine did not justify the dismissal by the District Court?
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3186.239,3196.333,"You are affirming that judgment, the two questions are closely intertwined and should be reconsidered by the District Court in that light."
1973.72-885,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3196.333,3207.623,So that we -- we do then even if we don’t say anything about it if we affirm saying nothing we would at least be affirming their dealing with the political question to that extent?
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3207.623,3209.186,"Yes, I would say so."
1973.72-885,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3233.962,3245.344,"But then do you think we at least need to say something if we agreed with your understanding, mustn’t we at least then say at least something about political question say we also agree with the Court of Appeals, political questions often is intertwined (Voice Overlap)"
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3245.344,3246.049,You can say it.
1973.72-885,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3251.289,3257.623,"Well, are you suggesting that we really should decide something about saying so?(Voice overlap)"
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3257.623,3265.615,Every time a judgment is affirmed you decide that lower was correct.
1973.72-885,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3267.349,3268.778,It's not necessary in your view?
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3268.778,3270.894,"It’s not necessary, I think --"
1973.72-885,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3270.894,3272.911,It’s the judgment that’s affirmed if it is affirmed.
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3274.363,3276.557,That’s right.
1973.72-885,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3284.536,3293.933,"Mr. Fraenkel, do you think there is a fairly sharp line between the concept of standing and concept of political question?"
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3293.933,3303.572,"Well, I assume that if the question is purely political then the Court will say, no one has standing to raise it."
1973.72-885,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3338.442,3342.149,I thought Baker and Carr was the first pronouncement of the Court on that --
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3342.149,3345.384,"Yes, but --"
1973.72-885,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3345.384,3348.84,Even the case that Baker and Carr was a reversal of a prior --
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3348.84,3349.206,"No, no, no."
1973.72-885,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3354.084,3359.838,"I don’t think the Court ever held that the issue was political, some members of the Court had --"
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3359.838,3364.266,"Well that was the impression I think that the bar had it at that time, but in any case --"
1973.72-885,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3364.266,3366.501,I refer you to my brother Brennan’s question --
1973.72-885,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3366.501,3367.724,They didn't know the case really --
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3367.724,3390.08,In any case -- there are certain issues which I assume are so attenuous that can be formulated with such difficulty in legal litigating terms as for instance the question of the guarantee of the Republican form of government.
1973.72-885,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3391.007,3397.597,"Well that was pretty well explored, wasn’t in Hughes; opinion opinion in Sterling versus Constantine?"
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3397.597,3399.0,"Well, yes I know."
1973.72-885,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3406.626,3407.136,Oh!
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3409.497,3415.371,"Well, but it was taking -- it was taking property without due process of law in effect."
1973.72-885,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3415.371,3418.439,"Well, that’s part of the Republican form of government I suppose."
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3418.439,3434.46,"Well, that every violation of the Bill of Rights could be argued to be denial of the Republican form of government, but in any event to come back to what we considered to be the elements here."
1973.72-885,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3599.99,3608.203,"After he has, but suppose Mr. Fraenkel he got everything that you think he ought to have and you were satisfied with it, then what?"
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3608.203,3608.786,Maybe nothing.
1973.72-885,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3608.786,3610.063,What does he do with it?
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3610.063,3616.267,Maybe nothing and if he satisfied then he need take no further actions.
1973.72-885,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3624.994,3627.299,Such as what?
1973.72-885,1,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,3627.391,3643.958,"Well, it might turn out if the CIA had acted unconstitutionally in some respects and might result in litigation for a declaratory judgment to that effect."
1973.72-885,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3663.722,3667.794,Thank you Mr. Fraenkel.
1973.72-885,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3672.947,3674.63,I think not Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.72-885,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3674.63,3675.665,Very well.
