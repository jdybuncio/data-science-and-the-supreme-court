1989.89-789,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.987,"We'll hear argument next in Number 89-789, Alabama v. Vanessa Rose White."
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,50.633,53.718,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1989.89-789,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,109.887,113.173,"Also, there the question is probable cause."
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,113.173,113.773,"Yes, sir."
1989.89-789,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,114.706,116.541,And... and this case is... you say reasonable suspicion?
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,116.541,117.358,Reasonable suspicion.
1989.89-789,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,131.05,136.372,And Gates involved activities which on their face looked sneaky and underhanded.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,177.116,180.734,"Justice Scalia, I... first of all, I would disagree with you."
1989.89-789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,269.625,271.927,You say... you say this related to a specific purpose... person?
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,271.927,272.377,--Person.
1989.89-789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,272.377,275.612,How did the officer at the time know this was a specific person?
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,275.612,282.683,"Well, they did not get the identification of Ms. White before they stopped the car."
1989.89-789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,283.385,287.853,"Well, then, how can you possibly rely on the identification as a justification for stopping the car?"
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,287.853,292.324,"--No, sir, I'm not suggesting that they... the fact that they knew, because they didn't."
1989.89-789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,307.0,310.368,But they didn't know she came out of 235-C and they did know she was... whatever her name was.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,310.368,312.987,They saw her come out of building 235.
1989.89-789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,312.987,315.004,They saw a woman come out of that particular building.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,315.004,320.491,And get into a brown station wagon with a broken right tail light.
1989.89-789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,320.491,320.824,Yeah.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,320.824,323.593,And then proceed to the Doby Motel.
1989.89-789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,323.593,324.01,She was--
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,324.01,325.395,They stopped her just short of the Doby Motel.
1989.89-789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,325.395,327.112,--She was supposed to be carrying a brown brief case and she wasn't.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,327.112,331.366,"She was supposed to be... no... yes, sir, she was, but they didn't see it until they got the car stopped."
1989.89-789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,331.366,333.366,"Well, she wasn't carrying it when she got in the car."
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,333.918,334.334,No.
1989.89-789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,334.334,335.568,--It was just in the car before she got in it.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,335.568,337.536,"Yes, but the tipster didn't say she'd be carrying it."
1989.89-789,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,345.541,348.743,I... I... does it say that she would have it in the car?
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,350.027,354.981,The tipster said she would be... she would go to the Doby Motel and be carrying a brown brief case.
1989.89-789,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,371.041,378.763,"Well, the record shows they didn't even ask for her name until after she was out of the car and a search commenced."
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,380.43,381.049,"Yes, sir."
1989.89-789,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,386.184,386.868,"Well, but then--"
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,386.868,387.619,And it's the stopping of the car--
1989.89-789,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,387.619,391.57,--but then... the... the name just doesn't help you at all in this case.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,391.57,392.087,"--No, sir."
1989.89-789,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,406.314,410.734,Did the tipster also say that she would do that at a particular time of day?
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,410.734,411.984,He said now.
1989.89-789,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,420.007,424.892,I thought the stop was made before arrival at the motel.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,424.892,425.328,Yes.
1989.89-789,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,425.328,428.362,"So, we don't know if the destination was the motel."
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,428.362,431.897,"No, ma'am, but she's... it was just short of the motel."
1989.89-789,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,439.718,441.437,But not at the motel?
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,441.437,442.387,"Not at... no, no, ma'am."
1989.89-789,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,442.872,445.741,"So, you don't have that factor to rely on."
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,445.741,447.041,--That she got to the motel?
1989.89-789,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,456.78,461.434,What do you think the test is for reliability of anonymous tips?
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,461.434,471.272,"I would suggest that... that... that there should be any... any strict test, but rather should be if the tip is verified."
1989.89-789,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,477.176,479.859,"Well, how many of the factors and what factors?"
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,479.859,482.878,"--Well, see, that is going to depend on the situation."
1989.89-789,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,535.612,542.368,Does it make any difference in your view if it's a potentially dangerous crime?
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,558.428,571.452,"Justice O'Connor, I would suggest, as we have in brief, that basically the requirements should be the same except that in the case of a bomb or something you've got exigency."
1989.89-789,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,606.525,626.288,"Suppose the anonymous tipster says that... that Vanessa White is going to leave the building at a certain time, she's going to be wearing a certain... describes her clothes in exact detail, describes the car in exact detail and... is that... is that just generally enough?"
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,626.288,628.907,Describes her clothes and the car in exact detail?
1989.89-789,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,628.907,629.674,Yeah.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,629.674,633.878,That would be enough to say that whoever it is knows this person.
1989.89-789,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,633.878,635.744,"Oh, yeah, knows the person."
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,635.744,636.244,Okay.
1989.89-789,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,636.663,644.834,But don't you have to have some basis for thinking that the person knows what is in the bag?
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,644.834,648.971,"--Well, again, we don't engage it in the same thing."
1989.89-789,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,648.971,650.388,All... all... all--
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,650.388,650.821,See--
1989.89-789,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,650.821,661.461,"--anybody could know that this person is going to be driving down the street to a hotel, but have no basis whatsoever for believing there is something in her handbag."
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,661.461,663.563,"--Justice White, I don't think anybody would know."
1989.89-789,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,702.688,709.676,"Suppose somebody calls up and says, I just saw Mrs. White leaving the building."
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,718.782,720.667,"That, again... I mean, that would be--"
1989.89-789,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,720.667,722.436,"Well, all it means is that somebody saw her--"
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,722.436,722.969,--That's right.
1989.89-789,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,722.969,724.686,--get in a car dressed so and so.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,724.686,727.438,But they know her as Vanessa Rose White.
1989.89-789,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,727.438,728.09,"Oh, yes."
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,737.728,738.378,Right.
1989.89-789,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,761.727,763.846,But the tip was false on the crucial--
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,763.846,765.813,That would... that would open them up to that.
1989.89-789,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,765.813,774.702,--The tip was false in the sense that they didn't find in the... in the case what the tipster said would be found.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,774.702,776.57,"They did find controlled substances, though."
1989.89-789,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,780.772,782.39,"Well, they didn't find... the tip was wrong."
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,784.176,784.876,"That's right, sir."
1989.89-789,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,799.736,819.497,But you... you do agree that you have... know enough facts that... that... what the tipster... you must eventually say that we can conclude that the tipster knew this person well enough to have a reasonable belief that she had cocaine in the... in the case?
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,819.497,820.099,"--Yes, sir."
1989.89-789,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,820.099,822.015,Unless it's a serious crime?
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,822.015,824.217,"Well, again, yes."
1989.89-789,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,852.071,853.704,"Well, I'm not sure what rule you're recommending."
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,856.356,865.461,"--No, I'm making... I'm suggesting that the seriousness of what the anonymous tipster alleges is not... does not affect the value of the tip."
1989.89-789,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,873.734,879.488,"So, it really doesn't matter, you're saying, whether the tipster gives any indication of knowing the person well."
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,886.458,888.577,"In that situation, no, sir, because--"
1989.89-789,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,888.577,890.862,"Well, now, you can't have it both ways."
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,890.862,897.682,"--Well... my position is... I mean, that would not bother me if the Court was to say, you don't have to verify it."
1989.89-789,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,898.1,898.433,Right.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,905.288,906.671,"--Well, the fact--"
1989.89-789,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,906.671,909.257,Does the nature of the crime make a difference or doesn't it?
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,909.257,914.644,"--It does... it does not... it makes a difference as to exigency, as to the need to move."
1989.89-789,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,914.644,915.577,"Well, that's just giving it a fancy name."
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,915.577,916.677,"No, sir, it's not."
1989.89-789,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,988.625,989.275,When you talk about--
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1004.452,1019.645,"I know of one case where that was done, and... and it really is not completely logical except that it is traditional and it does look to the legislature as the determiner of the seriousness of the crime."
1989.89-789,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1041.66,1049.164,"Well, was the crime to which the respondent here pleaded guilty... was that a felony or a misdemeanor under Alabama law?"
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1049.164,1050.433,That was a felony.
1989.89-789,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1060.622,1069.644,"So, suppose there's an anonymous tip that just says the people standing on the corner of 4th and M are engaged in a drug transaction?"
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1069.644,1070.596,The people?
1989.89-789,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1070.596,1073.548,The people standing on the corner of 4th and M are engaged in a drug transaction.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1073.548,1074.948,Right now?
1989.89-789,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1074.948,1076.081,Right now.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1076.081,1077.25,Okay.
1989.89-789,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1077.25,1077.9,And that's all.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1077.9,1078.483,All right.
1989.89-789,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1084.487,1094.212,"So, you would say that if the police officers then proceeded and saw some people standing there talking he could not engage in the stop based on the tip?"
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1100.299,1102.465,"--Well, there's just some people standing on the street."
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1102.465,1110.888,"--Well, you get... the problem with it is in the case of an investigative stop, it's got to be specific, and that's what you're going to have problems with there."
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1195.91,1196.994,I'm sorry.
1989.89-789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1196.994,1206.468,The one... does the record tell us why they used a second patrol car and stopped the woman before she got to the motel?
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1206.468,1210.087,"The record does not tell you that, sir, but I can tell you if you'd like to know."
1989.89-789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1213.889,1214.389,I see.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1215.741,1218.276,And they didn't have a light and probably a rather strange car.
1989.89-789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1223.895,1225.679,That would explain why they would use the second car.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1225.679,1226.346,They used the second car.
1989.89-789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1226.346,1230.0,But it wouldn't really explain why they wouldn't wait until she got to the motel.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1230.0,1233.035,"Well, that record also doesn't explain that."
1989.89-789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1233.035,1233.452,It doesn't.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1233.452,1243.058,"But I would suggest to you that probably they figured one she got in the motel... of course, the tip would have been exhausted at that point because the tipster said she would be going to the motel and that's all."
1989.89-789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1244.525,1249.562,"But they stopped her in front of the... and actually they called the other car and told them to stop her while she was on the Mobile Road, didn't they?"
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1249.562,1250.262,"--Mobile... yes, sir."
1989.89-789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1250.262,1250.847,Mobile.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1250.847,1251.214,"Yes, sir."
1989.89-789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1251.214,1252.264,But isn't that kind of a main highway?
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1252.264,1253.164,Yeah--
1989.89-789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1253.164,1254.533,Is that a limited access highway?
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1254.533,1255.666,"--No, it's not limited access."
1989.89-789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1258.401,1258.851,I see.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1258.851,1260.937,Both of these streets... all the streets involved are.
1989.89-789,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1280.433,1282.766,Why did they want to make the stop?
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1285.818,1286.554,"Yes, sir."
1989.89-789,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1286.554,1289.206,"--I mean, why at that particular time?"
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1289.206,1289.639,All right.
1989.89-789,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1293.574,1294.091,Yeah.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1294.091,1302.614,"--all of that time, from the time she got out of the car up until the time she got almost to Doby's, they were... they were verifying the things that this informer had told them."
1989.89-789,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1302.614,1304.381,But she didn't have a bag.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1304.381,1306.416,They didn't see a bag when she came out of the building.
1989.89-789,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1308.25,1311.369,"Well, then what... if she had... was carrying the bag, they would have seen it."
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1311.369,1312.102,"Yes, sir."
1989.89-789,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1312.102,1313.321,And they didn't see it.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1313.321,1314.054,"No, sir."
1989.89-789,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1314.054,1317.273,"Well, now why all of a sudden do they want to look for the bag?"
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1317.273,1320.658,Because that is where the tipster said that the cocaine--
1989.89-789,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1320.658,1324.712,"Well, why didn't they stop her there and look in the car, when she first got in the car?"
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1324.712,1331.783,"--Well, that would have been fine, but at that point, Justice Marshall, they had relatively little verification."
1989.89-789,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1337.67,1341.489,"Well, what happens to give them additional information?"
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1341.489,1347.994,--The fact that she got that brown Plymouth station wagon with the broken right tail light and then headed to Doby's Motel.
1989.89-789,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1355.581,1355.914,Yeah.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1355.914,1357.1,--out of the apartment right there.
1989.89-789,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1368.924,1376.328,"Mr. Marston, how many... how likely is it that somebody that left where she left in the car would have gone by the Doby Motel?"
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1376.995,1377.514,I don't have--
1989.89-789,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1377.514,1387.119,"--is it a circuitous route to get there or is the Doby Motel, you know... if you went one of two ways on the main street when you left where she was, you were bound to go by the Doby Motel?"
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1387.119,1387.769,"--No, sir."
1989.89-789,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1396.141,1396.791,Circuitous.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1396.791,1397.325,--Circuitous.
1989.89-789,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1397.325,1398.26,"I missed it the first time, too."
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1398.26,1402.962,"It goes down one, two, three, four turns."
1989.89-789,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1402.962,1403.445,Uh-huh.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1403.445,1405.914,And it's not... it's a relatively small motel.
1989.89-789,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1418.322,1419.757,Let me ask you another thing.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1432.414,1433.866,--Possibly.
1989.89-789,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1435.733,1436.885,But you don't think that's necessary to your case?
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1436.885,1437.302,"No, sir."
1989.89-789,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1449.26,1451.728,"Well, why does the tip give justification to do that?"
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1462.351,1471.039,"--Well, it justifies a stop because it creates... it is articulable, objective reasons that this specific person is engaged in criminal activity."
1989.89-789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1529.978,1530.828,What if she'd said no?
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1532.697,1534.132,We're... we're back to--
1989.89-789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1534.132,1534.582,That's the--
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1534.582,1535.549,--Justice Scalia's question.
1989.89-789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1535.549,1536.349,--I guess that's the question.
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1536.349,1545.155,"That if seeing... and they had at that point seen the attache case in plain view... if that was enough to turn this to probable cause, yes, they would have been justified in searching."
1989.89-789,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1548.44,1552.927,Do you think the fact that she might have said have no could be taken as evidence supporting the search if they--
1989.89-789,0,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1552.927,1568.453,I have always... and I cannot cite a case on this that this Court has handed down analogous rulings... but I have always taken the position in... in training police officers that you cannot cite the invocation of a constitutional right as evidence of guilt.
1989.89-789,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1573.274,1574.724,"--Thank you, Mr. Marston."
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,1582.363,1587.184,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court:"
1989.89-789,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1695.37,1697.588,That for an articulable suspicion?
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,1718.318,1720.02,I think one might look to see if--
1989.89-789,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1720.02,1720.437,Why?
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,1720.437,1724.239,"Because I would have... I would have a suspicion, an articulable suspicion."
1989.89-789,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1769.834,1786.23,"Well, but they... they had someone emerging from 235-C Lynwood Terrace Apartments, and they had it at a certain time of day, which certainly suggests that the informant knew something about the movements of the person."
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,1786.23,1813.03,"--Chief Justice Rehnquist, if you look at the joint appendix at page 16, I think that there is not a suggestion that the person later identified as Vanessa White came from that particular apartment, but rather she would be... the fact the informant gave would be that she would be leaving the area."
1989.89-789,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1851.488,1851.922,"Well, in the--"
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,1851.922,1853.107,--But they didn't do either.
1989.89-789,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1853.107,1867.098,"--In the opinion of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, which is at page 22, 23, 24 of the... what is it, the petition +/?"
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,1887.661,1890.48,"Yes, sir, at page 16 of the joint appendix--"
1989.89-789,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1890.48,1894.101,"Well, I'm talking about the opinion... we're reviewing the court of appeals' opinion."
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,1894.101,1897.303,"--I agree, sir, that is... Chief Justice, that is what it says."
1989.89-789,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1900.005,1902.957,What how... what about page 5--
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,1902.957,1903.44,But it is--
1989.89-789,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1903.44,1906.442,--of the joint appendix?
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,1919.982,1921.584,"--Yes, sir."
1989.89-789,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1921.584,1928.172,"Now, is there... is there something that appears in the transcript that indicates he later recants that?"
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,1928.172,1935.761,"The cross-examination of Corporal Davis, beginning on page 13 of the joint appendix--"
1989.89-789,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1935.761,1947.486,"Well, I think... I think what he's saying there... that exchange that you quoted... I think all he meant to say is that the caller didn't say that 230... whatever the number is... 30... 235-C... was her residence."
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,1969.149,1985.944,"--I think that if the Court does that, it would not change the result because in this case the officers did not verify that the lady who appeared and ultimately got in the brown Plymouth station wagon came from 235-C."
1989.89-789,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1995.4,2003.572,"Again, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals says the officers observed appellant leave the 235 building."
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,2003.572,2004.788,"Yes, sir."
1989.89-789,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2010.392,2019.832,So you... you say they saw... they saw her observe the building but not the 235-C?
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,2019.832,2021.534,"Yes, sir, not the particular apartment."
1989.89-789,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2034.258,2052.136,"Well, do you think the anonymous tip would have been significantly left... less precise if it had said a woman will leave the 235 building and get into a brown station wagon than if it had said a woman will leave 235-C in the 235 building and get into a Plymouth station wagon?"
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,2052.136,2052.835,I think that--
1989.89-789,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2052.835,2057.123,"Both of them seems to me to be, you know, narrowing it down to a--"
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,2057.123,2072.05,"--I think that would be still pretty minimal corroboration, Your Honor, because in this case, absent a specific description, we don't know who was getting into that vehicle."
1989.89-789,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2234.756,2238.191,"--Well, Gates, too, was a probable cause case, was it not?"
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,2238.191,2240.06,"Yes, sir, no question about it."
1989.89-789,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2317.477,2318.093,I said that.
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,2319.845,2324.063,"--I'm sorry, sir."
1989.89-789,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2427.381,2430.0,"What if you had these... these facts and the caller added,"
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,2443.76,2461.721,"I think reasonably articulable suspicion is a standard that is reasonably fixed, but I think reasonable men, dependent upon what the crime is, must react differently."
1989.89-789,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2485.319,2486.036,What does that mean?
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,2492.223,2493.342,"No, sir."
1989.89-789,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2495.025,2496.71,Or you don't care in that case?
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,2496.71,2498.16,"--Yes, sir, I care."
1989.89-789,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2509.435,2510.235,You don't care.
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,2514.756,2519.208,I don't think there is reasonably articulable suspicion.
1989.89-789,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2519.208,2526.979,Then the law should not protect the officer in that case if he is sued for a violation of the Fourth Amendment?
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,2526.979,2542.073,"In my... in my... in my judgment, Your Honor, given those... those facts, I believe that his true exposure to suit would be de minimis."
1989.89-789,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2542.073,2548.577,"Well, that doesn't really answer my question."
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,2548.577,2552.881,"If the question is could he be sued, yes, sir, it could be."
1989.89-789,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2552.881,2558.285,And a... and a court would find that he violated the Fourth Amendment?
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,2558.285,2565.605,"If the question is whether or not there was a Terry stop as opposed to a complete search, I think that would break a difference."
1989.89-789,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2579.114,2588.637,"Mr. Byrne, a much more common situation is an anonymous tip that a drug transaction is taking place."
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,2621.525,2629.131,"Your Honor, there is no question that... that drugs are a serious national concern."
1989.89-789,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2648.342,2653.996,"But with reference to somebody having a bomb or committing a murder, there's... there's usually not much reason for anonymity."
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,2657.281,2659.316,"Yes, sir."
1989.89-789,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2722.224,2733.364,"Of course, it's even rarer for them to disclose an anonymous informant, and if my life were at stake, I suppose I'd play the odds and want to remain anonymous."
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,2733.364,2737.4,I think that is... I think that is clearly... clearly true.
1989.89-789,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2865.618,2869.92,"But... but under your view, of course, they couldn't have made that stop."
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,2875.641,2885.497,"At this point, I think they clearly... they had a reason to under our code to have done it without regard to the reason they gave for the stop."
1989.89-789,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2886.249,2887.249,Because... because of the broken tail light?
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,2887.249,2888.782,--Broken tail light.
1989.89-789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2926.074,2931.728,I think that we... we judge this case as though the consent was valid.
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,2931.728,2932.411,"--Yes, sir."
1989.89-789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2942.118,2945.153,"And if it wasn't a valid stop, then the consent is a fruit?"
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,2947.52,2953.491,"In my view, Justice White, this is more akin to an arrest than it was a stop."
1989.89-789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2956.176,2959.628,"Yeah, but what... what invalidates the consent?"
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,2961.847,2962.413,--Given the--
1989.89-789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2962.413,2963.715,It's the fact that the stop is illegal.
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,2963.715,2964.515,"--Yes, sir."
1989.89-789,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2964.515,2967.401,And that... and that the stop produced the consent.
1989.89-789,1,20603,david_b_byrne_jr,,2967.401,2986.314,"Yes, sir, and given... given the opinion of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, they reached and attacked this question only as a stop case, not as an arrest situation."
1989.89-789,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3043.067,3047.869,But... but you don't... you don't need a warrant for a... for a Terry stop.
