1967.267,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,5.78,"Petitioner, versus Neifert-White Co."
1967.267,0,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,6.769,9.81,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.267,1,38020,patrick_f_hooks,,893.738,896.824,May it please the Court.
1967.267,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,951.543,953.009,"Well, it isn't even a loan, is it?"
1967.267,1,38020,patrick_f_hooks,,953.009,954.28,It isn't really a loan.
1967.267,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,954.314,954.992,It's a guarantee.
1967.267,1,38020,patrick_f_hooks,,954.992,956.471,It's a purchase.
1967.267,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,960.452,962.586,"Yes, but in Rainwater, what is it?"
1967.267,1,38020,patrick_f_hooks,,962.586,973.373,"I -- the facts aren't set forth in sufficient length in the opinion, Mr. Justice White, for me to understand the cotton loan, but it looks just like a wheat loan that I am familiar with."
1967.267,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1015.685,1021.432,"Yes, but what would you say if there was a -- the Government was really obligated?"
1967.267,1,38020,patrick_f_hooks,,1021.432,1024.127,"Well, I think if they were obligated, the Circuit Court would be wrong."
1967.267,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1024.127,1030.358,"So, it wouldn't make any difference whether it was a loan or not or a secured loan."
1967.267,1,38020,patrick_f_hooks,,1030.358,1036.673,"No, but we do point this out, that this is a situation."
1967.267,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1050.86,1051.905,"Yes, but they put out the funds."
1967.267,1,38020,patrick_f_hooks,,1051.905,1053.695,They put out the funds but they take back the security.
1967.267,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1053.695,1059.302,"The security could be destroyed, especially when it doesn't change the possession, which it doesn't."
1967.267,1,38020,patrick_f_hooks,,1059.302,1067.808,We believe that the concession made by the Government was dictated by the facts that there was no legal obligation on the part of the Government.
1967.267,2,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2341.641,2343.794,If the Court please.
