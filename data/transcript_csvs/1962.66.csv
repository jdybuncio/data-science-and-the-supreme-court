1962.66,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,29.641,"Number 67, F.L. Shuttlesworth et al., Petitioner, versus City of Birmingham."
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,39.192,43.446,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1962.66,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,269.148,272.485,Does the record show how the police got there?
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,272.586,272.916,Yes sir.
1962.66,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,272.916,273.641,-- why they came there?
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,273.641,273.952,Yes.
1962.66,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,285.509,287.707,It doesn't show the chain behind that.
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,287.707,288.738,"No, it doesn't."
1962.66,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,301.042,301.071,There's no --
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,301.071,301.941,-- and that was clear.
1962.66,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,301.941,305.347,No indication in any of the cases that the police were already there when (Voice Overlap) --
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,305.347,309.124,"No sir, I don't believe there's any indication to that effect."
1962.66,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,309.124,320.75,"Your case differs from the other then and that as I understand it, if the restaurant owner could not have chosen to serve --"
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,320.75,321.195,"Yes, I would say --"
1962.66,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,321.195,325.232,-- without making himself a violator of the city law?
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,325.232,348.094,"Oh, I would say in this case like -- unlike the others, we have the ordinance which was clearly in the record I think or the Court certainly was required to take judicial notice of it but I want to make it clear that even if they were not an ordinance in this case, the rest of the petitioners and their conviction in this matter in these circumstances would still violate the Equal Protection Clause if this --"
1962.66,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,348.094,349.911,I understand that's your argument but --
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,349.911,351.14,Yes.
1962.66,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,351.14,358.527,"-- certainly in this case, you have a city law which he would've violate -- would've violated had they served this."
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,358.527,359.316,That's right sir.
1962.66,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,359.316,367.181,And they could not make a choice of their own free will but that's if -- if there'd been the other way without subjecting in there the prosecution and conviction for --
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,367.181,367.893,Yes sir.
1962.66,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,367.893,368.677,-- of this ordinance.
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,368.677,368.942,Yes sir.
1962.66,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,368.942,374.462,(Inaudible) of law by the -- (Inaudible) that's the constitution?
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,374.462,388.75,"Yes sir, on page 24 of the record, the representative from Kress' Department Store was on the stand and he was asked what the petitioners have been told."
1962.66,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,435.19,438.851,"Oh, I assume the -- I assume that such an ordinance would be unconstitutional."
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,438.851,439.462,"Oh, certainly."
1962.66,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,439.462,455.996,"And a -- but and a -- is there anything -- is there -- there is some evidence in the record that this wasn't a dead letter of ordinance, it was just a -- hadn't been cleared from the books (Inaudible) but that it really had some teeth in it that it was a meaningful ordinance in this context at this time?"
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,455.996,473.578,"Well, as I say that the Court was not -- have been to develop it but I think this case shows -- this record shows that this ordinance was what was being enforced because each police officer came in to the store and on the stand he was asked, “What did you see unusual as you came in to the store?”"
1962.66,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,480.396,483.958,Isn't -- this didn't have specific reference to the ordinance now --
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,483.958,491.217,"No, he didn't refer to -- specifically to an ordinance but in one case, he said, “I arrested them under the authority of the City of Birmingham”."
1962.66,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,515.172,524.319,It doesn't simply get a reference to the ordinance as being a factor in the storeowner's decisions in any of the cases --
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,524.319,525.225,"Well, what I just read --"
1962.66,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,525.225,526.909,Except that it's against the law.
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,526.909,527.493,That's right.
1962.66,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,527.493,528.737,But that's just in one case.
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,528.737,529.661,That's right.
1962.66,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,529.661,531.432,And there's nothing I gather in the other cases.
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,531.432,536.55,"Well, in the other cases, I think the Court made it clear to the lawyer, he wasn't (Inaudible) -- have that testimony."
1962.66,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,536.55,538.133,He was -- yes.
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,538.133,551.722,"And then in another place, the lawyer for the petitioners wanted to bring out that these people would have been served if it hadn't been for the ordinance and the Court cuts that off."
1962.66,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,551.722,552.672,What page is that Mr. Motley?
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,552.672,554.151,Yes sir.
1962.66,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,580.65,585.253,What did the Alabama -- what did the appellate court say about that --
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,585.253,585.658,The appellate --
1962.66,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,585.658,587.397,-- its evidentiary ruling?
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,587.397,590.199,Pardon me?
1962.66,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,590.199,594.341,What did the appellate court say about this evidentiary ruling?
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,594.341,597.405,He -- they didn't say anything about that specific ruling.
1962.66,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,619.596,622.126,But the Alabama Supreme Court ruled they didn't have to.
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,622.126,623.017,The Court of Appeals of Alabama.
1962.66,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,623.017,624.798,"Court of Appeals, yes."
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,624.798,630.903,"Well, they said that it should have been pleaded that we should have by some pleading set forth that ordinance."
1962.66,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,644.487,647.905,How is the State in a position despite all that?
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,655.953,672.448,"Well, of course they're not and I -- the Court in making its decision just ignored all of the evidence here that the police came in, that the storeowner did not call the police that even after the police arrived, the storeowners did not request the arrest."
1962.66,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,689.596,696.216,"In the absence of an or -- of the ordinance, would we have the Garner case here?"
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,697.585,697.959,Yes.
1962.66,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,706.007,706.93,No evidence.
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,706.93,719.478,"Well, I think that in each of these cases, the petitioners were asked to leave the store by some representative of the store and in that sense, this evidence that they were asked to leave."
1962.66,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,719.478,720.533,I see.
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,720.533,735.948,"Now, as to the Garner case, what we say with reference to that is that this situation is like the opinion of Mr. Justice Harlan in Garner that here, the storeowners were apparently willing to endure this controversy."
1962.66,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,778.708,787.286,"Mrs. Motley, do I understand (Inaudible) to say that the (Inaudible) in the application?"
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,787.286,788.047,No sir.
1962.66,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,799.98,800.626,Not to other?
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,800.626,801.36,No sir.
1962.66,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,812.843,826.328,Now with reference to the (Inaudible)?
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,826.328,827.107,That's right.
1962.66,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,840.126,844.57,Yes but I understand that but there is no (Inaudible) by counsel.
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,844.57,845.075,That's right.
1962.66,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,845.075,846.888,Or the defendant in the other case.
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,846.888,847.403,That's right.
1962.66,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,847.403,849.42,(Inaudible)
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,849.42,849.907,That's right.
1962.66,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,849.907,850.716,(Inaudible)
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,850.716,851.426,Yes sir.
1962.66,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,851.426,853.532,And were these cases tried in sequence (Voice Overlap)?
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,853.532,854.882,"Yes, one after the other."
1962.66,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,854.893,856.24,Before the same judge?
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,856.24,857.161,Before the same judge --
1962.66,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,857.161,858.268,Same counsel?
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,858.268,859.757,"Yes sir, same counsel."
1962.66,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,859.757,860.032,Same day?
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,860.032,862.279,They were treated as a whole.
1962.66,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,865.242,867.121,Filed all in the same day then?
1962.66,0,19602,constance_baker_motley,,867.121,868.046,"Yes, they were."
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1116.562,1119.618,May it please the Court.
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1205.681,1209.52,"Well, he just said immediately before, he cannot serve them there."
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1212.227,1228.948,"I would like to go back to that page 24, Mr. Justice Black, and follow that if we may of the language, the comptroller, both Pizitz -- I believe his name is Mr. Gotlinger who was testifying at the time and this was cross-examination."
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1270.424,1271.184,Mr. Davis.
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1271.184,1271.203,Yes sir.
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1271.203,1278.532,Do you suppose that any merchant in Birmingham even if he hadn't been there as long as he possessed the store there.
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1283.597,1291.351,"Mr. Justice Black, it's my sincere thought on this matter that the ordinance never comes in to the thought process."
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1291.351,1294.082,I understand that but is there --
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1294.082,1294.773,I can make a confession --
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1294.773,1304.768,How can anybody think in Birmingham just live there and knows it but Mr. Pizitz's store all these years didn't know that it was against the law to serve them together.
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1315.086,1321.033,"Well, of course I'll say this, I believe there are some 40 odd years and I have never heard of it being enforced."
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1321.033,1326.898,"Well, you've only heard of it being enforced because it was obeyed."
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1326.898,1327.686,That's a possibility.
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1327.686,1329.581,"But certainly it's not obeyed, its just hadn't been (Voice Overlap) --"
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1329.581,1332.448,But I think it was obeyed long before it became an ordinance.
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1332.448,1336.398,"The merchant wouldn't dare to break it even if he wanted to, wouldn't he?"
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1336.398,1345.252,"Well, I think it goes back to the question of which comes first, the chicken or the egg.Wasn't that the custom existing at the time the ordinance went into effect so there was no occasion for any change."
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1373.48,1380.201,"You hadn't been a merchant running a restaurant, merchants running a restaurant know who can they serve and who they can't."
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1380.201,1387.898,"Well, let's get back if I may to the basic question that I think is basic in this question -- in this whole controversy."
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1396.902,1397.624,"Yes, but it (Voice Overlap) --"
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1397.624,1397.936,-- that they didn't.
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1397.936,1401.017,But they hadn't trespassed after warning.
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1405.545,1408.819,"Well, we have a void ordinance which we concede is void."
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1411.241,1411.77,"Well, the merchant --"
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1411.77,1412.757,-- before (Inaudible) come in.
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1412.757,1419.545,A merchant can't be put at the risk of having -- saying that maybe they'll hold it void for him to set up against the validation.
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1419.545,1419.823,I --
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1419.823,1436.394,"I personally do not see how in this case, it's possible to say for anybody to reach a conclusion in a matter of this importance that this merchant acted because he wanted to rather than because it was against the law."
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1440.094,1441.439,"Well, I think there is --"
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1441.439,1443.275,"Now, I see a great difference."
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1462.057,1466.673,"Well, Mr. Justice Black, my answer to that is this."
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1469.378,1471.343,(Voice Overlap)
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1471.343,1479.215,You know that there's an abundance of attorneys down in the City of Birmingham and notwithstanding this whole expression you can't fight City Hall.
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1484.059,1486.888,Many of them fight City Hall on this issue?
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1486.888,1487.542,On this issue?
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1487.542,1488.487,On this issue.
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1488.487,1497.119,"No sir, but many others and if the merchant wanted to bring this thing ahead and see what their rights were, well I think it would've been very long ago."
1962.66,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1507.239,1507.49,"Well, in any case --"
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1507.49,1508.3,-- theres no issue on that.
1962.66,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1508.3,1511.339,"In any case, you have the State putting a person in jail."
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1513.332,1514.64,"Oh, 30 days --"
1962.66,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1514.64,1515.243,(Voice Overlap)
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1515.243,1515.41,Yes.
1962.66,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1515.41,1524.578,Any -- can either case whether it's the proprietor doesn't like Negroes in his store or whether the city ordinance says that he shan't serve.
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1531.062,1531.981,"Well, no sir."
1962.66,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1538.261,1539.0,"No, that's a matter as to (Voice Overlap) --"
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1539.0,1541.968,"-- which he actually admit, which (Voice Overlap)."
1962.66,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1541.968,1543.401,(Inaudible) managed as to --
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1543.401,1549.026,"But -- what the point is, and I don't think we have yet touched the basic point in that in the City of Birmingham's case."

1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1553.022,1554.285,Very definitely.
1962.66,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1573.348,1584.274,I suppose if you're right on that then what you do would be to use the constitution to drive the wedges of segregation deep into all of our society.
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1584.274,1584.993,No sir.

1962.66,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1596.6,1607.699,But if you can use private property in this way and what you will do would be to use it to -- in a constitutional way to engraft segregation as the way it wanted.
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1607.699,1615.027,"Well, some people use the word segregation, some use the expression of racial discrimination."

1962.66,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1842.616,1843.288,I beg your pardon.
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1844.671,1849.482,"Mr. Breckenridge was saying, this is case is quasi criminal and you asked the question what pleadings are required in criminal cases."

1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1901.121,1901.489,-- they didn't do it.
1962.66,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1901.489,1902.808,In a case of this kind.
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1902.808,1904.224,They didn't do it.
1962.66,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1904.224,1908.813,"Well, they can enter, yes, but what issues can be raised under the plea of not guilty."
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1908.813,1912.802,"Oh, the question that they didn't do the act complained of then the complaint --"
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1912.802,1923.982,"What is that -- what is required as I understand it, it used to be was that the State or the city proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt every element in it."
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1940.597,1943.603,If it were brought up by a plea or a defense what --
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1943.603,1944.623,We are not guilty.
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1944.623,1944.759,Well --

1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1956.085,1956.155,Yes.
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1956.155,1957.156,-- that says you must not do.
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1957.156,1972.132,"But the ordinance is based on the principle I suppose that he was ordered by the owner of his own choice with his own knowledge making up his own mind not to stay there, isn't it?"
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,1972.132,1974.159,"Well, I would assume that someone wants to tell him --"
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1974.159,1975.216,Suppose they didn't do that?

1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1977.119,1980.078,-- if you believe from the evidence in this case on the plea of not guilty.

1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2000.78,2000.797,You could --
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,2000.797,2004.279,-- the State has carried its burden and then the defense takes over.
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2004.279,2012.818,"You could convict even though the evidence showed beyond the shadow of a doubt that the man had a gun in his back when he did it that somebody telling him, “You've got to do this”?"
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,2012.818,2014.363,You have to tell him to get off the premises?
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2014.363,2015.105,Yes.
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,2015.105,2017.337,No sir that would not be a voluntary act.

1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,2024.04,2028.416,"Well, you're assuming of course that they acted under this invalid law and I am assuming that --"
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2028.416,2028.782,I'm not assuming.
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,2028.782,2029.236,(Inaudible) we hadn't filed a charge.
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2029.236,2037.799,I'm assuming that the State has to show that they acted and they exercised their own judgment and their own choice in ordering him to get out.
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,2045.032,2063.929,"Well, as I interpret Your Honor's question or statement, it looks like that the State in prosecuting any case, somebody shoot somebody else, they don't have to show that it -- they voluntarily did it, they're going to have to show that they were not insane that the State has got the negative ever defensive element."
1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2063.929,2064.438,But they get --

1962.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2075.126,2084.938,"Well, it would certainly be a bad ordinance wouldn't it if it was based on the fact that the owner did that because the law told him to."
1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,2086.659,2090.82,"Well, I think the ordinance is telling he's got to make that election as bad and void, yes sir."

1962.66,1,44542,watts_e_davis,,2250.754,2256.467,It is beyond a reasonable doubt but may I say this at this point?

1962.66,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4380.149,4390.779,"Does that mean that in -- I think maybe it does that in criminal cases now, what they call criminal state cases, they're not required to file assignments of their own."

1962.66,2,19602,constance_baker_motley,,4470.227,4471.053,-- but it didn't.
1962.66,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4473.934,4474.677,(Inaudible)

1962.66,2,19602,constance_baker_motley,,4558.853,4565.901,"In the brief, I believe they did mention it because the Court itself says that it was not raised by a pleading."
1962.66,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4571.252,4574.729,But did they in fact consider it?
