1972.71-6193,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.783,"We will hear arguments next in 71-6193, Brown against The United States."
1972.71-6193,0,34761,lowell_w_lundy,,11.929,20.066,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1420.24,1423.2,Mr Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-6193,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1599.328,1621.765,"What about a traditional conventional kind of partnership, let's say, a law partnership and if something is wrongfully seized, can anyone of the partners complain about it under the Fourth Amendment?"
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1624.915,1636.232,"Well, the question is a hard one to pose, I think because in most instances the situation will be such that the partner has an interest in the premises that were searched."
1972.71-6193,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1648.914,1661.727,"Well let's say, I'm just kind of thinking out loud, that I agree that most law offices, they would have a lease in an office building and every partner would have an interest in that piece of real estate."
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1682.09,1683.49,I think it's a close question.
1972.71-6193,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1685.954,1694.767,"Because here rightly or wrongly the Trial Judge did tell the jury that this was a partnership, he used that word, didn't he?"
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1696.242,1698.559,Yes sir.
1972.71-6193,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1710.886,1718.9,But I wondered if you have -- the way you begun your arguments you have absolutely ignored the arguments of your opponents.
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1737.985,1741.686,My answer to the argument is there are several problems with it.
1972.71-6193,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1797.235,1813.067,"You would really argue then, if you ran across a fellow with a stolen car you -- under any circumstances you can search the car as long as it's stolen?"
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1813.067,1813.558,Mr. Justice --
1972.71-6193,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1813.558,1817.45,"Just because it’s stolen, not getting to any other basis for the search?"
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1817.45,1823.232,I think that when we are dealing -- a stolen car is a slightly different situation.
1972.71-6193,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1823.232,1825.099,No property interest?
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1825.099,1826.119,"Right, there is no property interest."
1972.71-6193,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1848.298,1849.536,Just because it’s stolen?
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1849.536,1855.136,"That’s right, now there is a consideration that might lead to a different result, which is --"
1972.71-6193,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1855.136,1857.059,"There are no cases around like that, are there?"
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1857.059,1858.515,Not that I know of.
1972.71-6193,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1883.896,1886.834,Does it make any difference in this case whether there is standing or not?
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1898.804,1902.272,"Well, if there is standing in the petitioners to assert the Fourth Amendment claim --"
1972.71-6193,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1902.272,1904.217,"He has the claim, he has --"
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1904.217,1905.723,I believe that --
1972.71-6193,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1905.723,1909.448,But not with respect to the store.
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1921.35,1922.57,"Well, I think not because the --"
1972.71-6193,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1922.57,1924.404,"It's stolen property, isn’t it?"
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1924.404,1925.275,It is stolen property.
1972.71-6193,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1925.275,1928.909,"The officers have probable cause to seize it, don’t they?"
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1944.48,1946.593,"Yes, that’s right."
1972.71-6193,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1946.593,1958.23,I gather your colleague on the other side conceded that he wasn't arguing that partnership in crime gave his clients any any interest in the store that they could assert into the Fourth Amendment?
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1958.23,1962.816,That’s right and in our view nor do they have any interest in the property.
1972.71-6193,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1962.816,1965.464,"Well, even if they did they would lose?"
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1965.464,1972.115,"I suppose that’s right, yes."
1972.71-6193,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2239.174,2255.142,"As -- because they “partners” and joint venturers, at least if I understand his argument, then Knuckles was the agent of Brown and Smith for Fourth Amendment purposes?"
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2255.142,2256.408,"Well, it's difficult to --"
1972.71-6193,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2256.408,2259.973,At least I think that's what he is --
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2259.973,2266.618,"I believe that this is in essence that had been decided in Alderman, at least, appears to be to me."
1972.71-6193,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2288.821,2297.707,There wasn't any personal property involved in Alderman that was allegedly the joint property of co-conspirator?
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2297.707,2298.816,That's right.
1972.71-6193,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2298.912,2302.385,The question was one of personal perhaps the – of the conversation?
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2302.385,2305.968,"I think the same principles is applied here, nonetheless."
1972.71-6193,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2305.968,2311.877,"But in the end, I think it's a wavier of Fourth Amendment right, can't they?"
1972.71-6193,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2318.3,2320.001,Cupp – Frazier against --
1972.71-6193,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2320.001,2335.305,"Frazier against Cupp, where Charles said sure you can go ahead and search my duffel bag and in there, he found of John Smith's effects and we said John Smith has no -- John Smith's rights were waived by the owner of the Duffel bag?"
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2335.305,2340.368,"Well, in a sense, John Smith had no rights in the Duffel bag."
1972.71-6193,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2343.418,2346.333,They were in John Smith's duffel bag?
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2346.333,2347.167,That's right.
1972.71-6193,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2348.378,2354.454,"Frazier and Cupp initially was, one was the warden --"
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2354.454,2355.989,Yes.
1972.71-6193,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2355.989,2360.509,"Well, what if the man is wearing a stolen overcoat to spin this thing at one more step."
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2371.689,2382.338,"I think not Mr. Justice because I think in that instance, it would be difficult to argue that his person was not invaded, that his interest in his own person."
1972.71-6193,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2384.285,2387.729,What if it was stolen from a person who is in the market?
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2387.729,2391.207,The same answer as I have given to Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1972.71-6193,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2404.698,2406.165,You would argue that?
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2406.165,2408.011,Yes.
1972.71-6193,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2408.011,2411.938,I have to argue within a border of search case?
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2411.938,2413.56,That's right.
1972.71-6193,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2413.56,2428.837,"And wouldn't you also take the position that after they broke in, after they searched Knuckle's place, if they had gone into any of the materials that they found, that might have a problem, but they didn't go into them, is that right?"
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2428.837,2429.362,You mean if they don't --
1972.71-6193,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2429.362,2437.989,"(Inaudible) No one can open the machines that were in the cartons. But they didn't, they just took the cartons, am I right?"
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2437.989,2439.666,"Well, they did."
1972.71-6193,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2447.007,2448.039,But they didn't go into any --
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2448.039,2449.087,They didn't go in.
1972.71-6193,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2450.962,2454.128,"Well, (Inaudible) it really wasn't the property of these people?"
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2454.128,2454.788,That's right.
1972.71-6193,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2454.788,2463.456,"And that does put them in pretty good dilemma because they claimed that it is their property, they hung and if they don't they hung --"
1972.71-6193,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2463.456,2474.924,"Well, I think not because as I have indicated -- they gave up a possessory interest in the property some two months before the search was made."
1972.71-6193,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2654.251,2655.161,Thank you Mr. Evans.
1972.71-6193,2,34761,lowell_w_lundy,,2656.781,2657.871,"No, Your Honor."
1972.71-6193,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2657.871,2658.894,Thank you gentleman.
