1962.541,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,28.944,"Number 541, Local 100 of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices, Petitioner, versus H. N. Borden."
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,31.402,35.285,Mr. Chief Justice and if the Court please.
1962.541,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,817.573,821.46,What is the amount of that -- what was the amount of the judgment then Mr. Wells?
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,821.46,826.733,"$1900 and something, doubled to $3800 and a little more."
1962.541,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,826.733,829.783,On what theory did it double?
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,829.783,833.42,Just on the theory that Texas gives punitive damages.
1962.541,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,833.42,836.648,"Well, if -- I thought you said the punitive damages was out."
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,836.648,838.553,"Your Honor, I said mental suffering."
1962.541,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,838.6,838.952,"Oh, just about (Voice Overlap) --"
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,838.952,845.187,"He had three crutches on which he was moving, actual mental suffering and punitive damages."
1962.541,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,852.899,853.573,I see.
1962.541,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,853.573,861.225,"Well, under Texas law, does the finding in malice a requisite for an award of punitive trust then?"
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,861.225,862.544,"Judge, we always thought so."
1962.541,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,890.35,898.493,"Well, I'm just wondering, are we -- are we to suppose that the punitive damages rest on some finding in malice then?"
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,898.493,899.92,"I don't believe youcan, Judge."
1962.541,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,907.212,910.313,Maybe it's not material of the issue that you're presenting.
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,910.313,921.618,"Well, I would certainly take the view that that is immaterial, that Texas has no business supplementing the Board's remedy, and in that connection the --"
1962.541,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,921.618,924.098,Did they give him the $5000?
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,924.098,930.324,The jury did but Judge Stout would doubt much as he -- had he cut it down to the $1900 which were -- was --
1962.541,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,930.324,942.217,I always thought malice is in the record too but wouldn't it be implicit in that affirmance of the $1800 -- the $1900 on punitive that there was malice?
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,942.217,946.017,We asked the judge to give us -- to inquire as to whether or not there was malice (Voice Overlap) --
1962.541,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,946.017,950.568,How did that charge you asked the judge to make?
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,950.568,952.435,"Judge, I don't believe we printed that."
1962.541,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,957.255,967.438,"Well, this is a -- this is a regular stock suit, isn't it, under the title of malicious immaterial -- the contract rather."
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,971.367,982.388,"As I read the plaintiff's pleadings and as the Texas Court read the plaintiff's pleadings, it was in tort of the type that Your Honor has indicated."
1962.541,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1008.362,1009.902,"Now, is the Texas law different?"
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1034.712,1041.013,My understanding has been that it means more than willful acts -- willful-wrongful act.
1962.541,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1061.142,1062.432,I didn't think so either --
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1062.432,1062.873,"Yes, sir."
1962.541,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1062.873,1068.606,-- but you were discussing it and I seem to be putting some emphasis on whether it was malicious or not.
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1068.606,1069.161,Well --
1962.541,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1069.161,1090.206,"And I had understood that in this kind of enactment, you do not look into the general meaning of malice if some person wants -- very anxious to do somebody wrong because of hatred or envy or malice or something, but is simply that he's done a wrong and the law enforced malice in this particular kind of action from that wrongful conduct."
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1090.206,1098.467,This I gather was the trial court's view in the -- in the instruction which he gave on page 62 of the record.
1962.541,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1153.126,1166.717,"What you are saying now, I assume is, that if the federal law does authorize as remedy to farther extend under the Act, fix the amount, Texas can't use a state remedy in order to add to it."
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1166.717,1176.006,"Exactly so, and as the Texas Appellate Court makes crystal clear right on the face of its opinion, that is exactly what Texas has done here."
1962.541,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1195.197,1196.777,Do you agree in this case?
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1196.777,1197.392,Pardon?
1962.541,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1197.392,1211.974,Do you agree in this case that this man had a remedy before the Labor Board and that the Labor Board could -- it could establish wrong has been done that the Labor Board could have awarded back pay as damage.
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1211.974,1212.445,"Yes, sir, that --"
1962.541,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1212.445,1213.489,You concede that?
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1213.489,1217.565,I do that depending on what the Labor Board had found.
1962.541,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1271.898,1274.545,Do you say that it was privileged under the Act?
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1274.545,1275.198,"No, sir, I --"
1962.541,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1275.198,1281.451,"Do you say that if it was privileged conduct under the Act, the Board -- neither the Board and other states could give a remedy?"
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1281.451,1281.6,"Yes, sir."
1962.541,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1281.6,1287.653,But if they go beyond that privilege which the Act gives them then the Board can give a remedy for the wrongful conduct.
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1287.653,1288.862,"Exactly, so."
1962.541,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1290.139,1295.394,What the -- what is the arguable (Inaudible) under what section?
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1295.394,1300.299,"8 (b) (1) and 8 (b) (2), it's the Radio Officers' case."
1962.541,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1336.932,1340.011,Is this the 8 (a) (3) violation?
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1340.011,1340.87,Well --
1962.541,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1340.87,1342.819,"At that time that was against the employer, was it?"
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1342.819,1351.627,"At that time it was -- well, that Fowler -- the Radio Officers' case was against the union, and as I recall against the union alone."
1962.541,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1353.536,1355.699,8 (b) (2) then or 8 (b) (3) or --
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1355.699,1357.055,8 (b) (1) and (2).
1962.541,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1357.055,1358.041,8 (b) (1) and (2).
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1358.041,1358.497,"Yes, sir."
1962.541,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1404.904,1411.429,"I gather from what you said earlier, having failed to file a charge within the record, the six-month period."
1962.541,0,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1416.397,1417.937,"Yes, sir."
1962.541,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1421.266,1423.592,"You may, Mr. Wells."
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,1429.831,1441.105,"Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Members of the Supreme Court."
1962.541,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1499.912,1509.874,"Well, I must say in my state, we do distinguish malice as they're defined under willfully from actual malice."
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,1514.936,1516.54,"Well, in Texas, sir, there is no distinction, the willful or --"
1962.541,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1516.54,1517.294,There's none at all --
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,1517.294,1522.19,-- malicious action taken is treated the same.
1962.541,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2116.626,2117.02,"Mr. Smith, would --"
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2117.02,2118.069,"Yes, sir."
1962.541,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2118.069,2126.631,-- would the conduct of the petitioners in this case constitute an unfair labor practice under the Act?
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2126.631,2128.752,It is my view that it would not.
1962.541,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2128.752,2134.411,Do you -- it's your view that the -- that Borden would have no jurisdiction at all.
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2134.411,2134.847,"Yes, sir."
1962.541,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2134.847,2136.073,Alright.
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2140.962,2143.323,"Yes, sir, I will go this -- this far."
1962.541,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.442,2180.352,Do you -- do you think your case really is substantially distinguishable to the cases which the union had attached to their reply brief?
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2180.352,2181.374,"Yes, sir, I do."
1962.541,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2181.374,2183.57,And what is that?
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2183.57,2194.757,"Mr. Justice White, it is our duty that the NLRB and particularly in the Miranda Fuel case, they explained in detail what they mean."
1962.541,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2245.307,2259.922,"Oh, I'm not sure you've got the -- it got to do with distinguishing these two cases, the (Inaudible) case and the Walker case, that's the --"
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2259.922,2268.914,"Well, I think -- I think in both of those cases, Your Honor, there -- they were the majority agents and I think that the Board found -- I'm not too familiar with them, I've read --"
1962.541,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2268.914,2275.782,We simply found that the employer had to have it or it was the festive of hiring only through the hiring hall.
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2275.782,2276.359,"Well, it did establish --"
1962.541,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2276.359,2289.081,"And -- only in the -- and based their finding, mostly on the fact that the union member who was complaining, had been told by the employer, he wouldn't be hired unless he was referred."
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2289.081,2289.225,"Yes, sir and --"
1962.541,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2289.225,2292.485,I think that then -- which is exactly what happened in this case.
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2292.485,2293.248,"No, sir."
1962.541,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2317.011,2328.535,"It can't be covered though you -- you couldn't recover at any court, could you, without showing that -- without showing that the union really was of the operative factor and your client must recover it?"
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2328.535,2330.0,They are --
1962.541,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2330.0,2330.368,And not being (Voice Overlap) --
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2330.368,2331.945,They are the operating the factor.
1962.541,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2331.945,2354.781,"Oh, which is -- which is establishing precisely what the Board had found to be true in these two cases, namely that the -- the employer had enough regard to what the union thought at least that it passively was in agreement, would it, not to hire, unless there was a referral."
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2354.781,2390.793,"Yes, sir, and I think it goes to the Radio Officers' case and also to Local 357 wherein the Court found that it was a true motive of the employer in not hiring in which the Board must look that the failure to hire by itself was not the only criteria, but if they had an agreement that they would only hire if they were referred by the union then in that event, they were encouraging union membership by refusing to hire and by refusing to refer."
1962.541,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2470.457,2471.388,This argument --
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2471.388,2471.49,"Yes, sir."
1962.541,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2471.49,2473.341,"-- could you finish, that isn't what was (Inaudible)"
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2473.341,2474.755,That's -- that's all.
1962.541,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2474.755,2477.788,Why wasn't it alright to raise it by plea in abatement?
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2479.266,2492.484,"It was alright to raise it by plea in abatement, Your Honor, but what I am saying is, that they did not come in to Court and say, “Yes, we took an action against Borden for this reason -- for that reason.”"
1962.541,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2522.6,2533.289,"Well, in either event, I presume, even if there's preemption, they would still be free to try out the issue of whether they were guilty of the unfair labor practice --"
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2533.289,2533.693,Legally --
1962.541,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2533.693,2535.64,-- if it is an unfair labor practice.
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2535.64,2537.501,"That's legally correct, Mr. Justice Black."
1962.541,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2537.501,2547.132,So that I -- I still probably due to my fault but I still don't understand where you get by this particular argument --
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2547.132,2554.471,"Well, all I'm saying is that they have never contended that they were taking any action against Mr. Borden."
1962.541,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2554.471,2564.207,"But they've contended they were not but they've also contended, have they not, as to issues as to whether they had or not but one for the Board, and that was properly raised by a plea in abatement."
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2564.207,2565.348,That's right.
1962.541,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2635.628,2635.979,Did they --
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2635.979,2636.696,But we're not guilty under this law.”
1962.541,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2636.696,2639.492,Did they (Voice Overlap) -- did they quite admit that?
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2639.532,2640.259,Sir?
1962.541,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2640.259,2649.753,"I thought what they admitted was that if what you charged was true, they had committed an unfair labor act but did not admit whether the charge was true."
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2649.753,2652.099,"Well, Justice Black, it's beyond that point."
1962.541,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2653.354,2659.425,"I understand that but the question is who should have found those facts, the jury or the Board?"
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2659.425,2660.467,"Yes, sir."
1962.541,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2660.522,2671.281,"And what they're saying is that whatever the -- whether the finding was right or wrong, it can't be accepted because that was for the Board to find and not for the jury."
1962.541,1,40460,robert_weldon_smith,,2671.281,2680.289,"Well, I think they did admit in their -- in their brief in this case that regardless of what happened, Borden was being disciplined in this instance."
1962.541,2,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,3255.947,3261.71,"If the Court please, unless there are questions of the Court, I'll waive rebuttal."
1962.541,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3262.75,3267.709,Very well.
