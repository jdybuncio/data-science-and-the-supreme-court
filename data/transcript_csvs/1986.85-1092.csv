1986.85-1092,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.606,We will hear arguments next in Keystone Bituminous Coal Association against Nicholar DeBenedictis.
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,62.906,65.692,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1092,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,262.814,273.42,"Mr. Lee, are you... are your clients complaining only about parcels as to which they have acquired the support estate?"
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,273.42,274.055,--Yes.
1986.85-1092,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,274.055,276.574,Nothing else is at issue here?
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,276.574,276.974,That is correct.
1986.85-1092,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,279.09,305.657,"As to such parcels, do you think that under the regulatory power of government, that there's any leeway for the State of Pennsylvania to prevent and prohibit the taking of any portion of the coal to prevent contamination of water, underground water, or to prevent destruction of utility lines?"
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,311.295,315.58,"--Those are... I think it is not totally beyond the regulatory power of the State, Justice O'Connor."
1986.85-1092,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,321.381,322.881,I thought it was part of it.
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,329.385,329.751,--Yes.
1986.85-1092,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,376.616,385.537,"Well, but applying that to protection of aquifers and utility lines: What is your view?"
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,386.287,393.357,"Our view is... now, of course, aquifers and utility lines is different factually from what happened in Pennsylvania Coal."
1986.85-1092,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,438.718,448.157,"Well, as I understand it, the State requires only a small percentage of the coal to be left in place, from one to nine percent?"
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,448.157,450.073,"No, that is not correct."
1986.85-1092,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,555.057,559.342,Does the record really tell us how much has to be left in place?
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,559.342,559.758,"Oh, yes."
1986.85-1092,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,559.758,562.96,"And therefore, is this right for our decision?"
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,562.96,563.66,"Oh, it is indeed right."
1986.85-1092,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,613.023,616.725,"Mr. Lee, let me get back just a minute to the question Justice O'Connor asked you."
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,627.532,628.265,--That is correct.
1986.85-1092,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,628.265,634.036,That as much as 50 percent can be required to support a particular building.
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,634.036,635.036,That is correct.
1986.85-1092,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,635.036,636.286,"But now, 50 percent of what?"
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,636.286,641.873,Of the coal underlying the particular structures that are protected by Section 4.
1986.85-1092,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,679.712,681.514,Let me just follow up on that for a second.
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,683.2,683.866,--Yes.
1986.85-1092,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,683.866,687.418,"What you're saying is, 50 percent of the coal under the house has to be retained."
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,687.418,687.602,That is correct.
1986.85-1092,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,687.602,690.37,But the rest of it on the farm wouldn't.
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,694.556,696.091,"No, it really isn't."
1986.85-1092,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,696.091,698.96,It's just the structures out in the--
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,698.96,700.912,The coal reserves in this area just aren't in urban areas.
1986.85-1092,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,700.912,701.328,--I see.
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,710.6,712.719,"Would that that were the case, Justice Stevens."
1986.85-1092,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,713.785,719.139,Does the record tell us what proportion of the given coal fields have structures on them?
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,719.139,721.323,--The record tells us--
1986.85-1092,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,721.323,724.61,"What does the 50 percent reduce to in terms of the total field, in other words?"
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,724.61,730.245,--What the record tells us... it doesn't tell us what it reduces to in terms of the total field.
1986.85-1092,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,731.18,734.399,Except insofar as the exhibit on page 284 indicates it's about nine percent.
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,734.399,736.418,--That is correct.
1986.85-1092,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,777.725,779.542,"Mr. Lee, how much of that do you think you have a Constitutional right to remove?"
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,779.542,780.827,"Oh, all of it."
1986.85-1092,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,780.827,782.227,You have a right to remove all of it?
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,782.227,792.884,"Yes, that is the thrust of Pennsylvania Coal, that... because from 1890 to 1920 we acquired those rights."
1986.85-1092,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,795.836,797.303,You acquired the support rights.
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,797.303,798.038,--Support estate.
1986.85-1092,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,798.038,804.859,A support estate in every piece of the land affected by this that you're bringing before us?
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,804.859,805.142,That is correct.
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,918.532,935.909,"Mr. Lee, suppose you hadn't taken what you think you've taken in the transaction, namely, the support estate; that you bought the mineral right... mineral rights, but you didn't take the support estate."
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,939.878,940.595,I wouldn't have any.
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,941.28,942.93,Because?
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,942.93,952.552,"Because the State of Pennsylvania then wouldn't be taking anything, because then they would just be adjusting something that the parties themselves unadjusted."
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,954.086,959.19,"Well, what if in the contract the surface owners just waived any right to any damage?"
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,959.19,960.09,It's the same thing.
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,961.575,963.208,Then it would just be a contract?
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,963.208,964.343,--Then it would be the contract clause.
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,966.878,971.763,"All right, where did the support estate... is that Pennsylvania law?"
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,971.763,972.696,It is Pennsylvania law.
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,976.567,986.09,"Well, have you... you're really saying, then, that what they've taken here is not 25 million tons of coal directly."
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,987.44,988.207,That is correct.
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,991.242,994.86,You think that's what was taken in the Pennsylvania Coal case?
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,994.86,999.312,"Yes, it is, because the support... Pennsylvania is unique in this respects."
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1004.714,1009.101,But then you would just be a contract claimant.
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1010.151,1011.803,"--That is arguably correct, though I think--"
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1011.803,1012.17,Arguably?
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1014.003,1014.586,"--No, arguably."
1986.85-1092,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1022.757,1031.346,"--It is correct, is it not, that your... that Pennsylvania law differs from, say, West Virginia, Indiana, and Illinois with regard to this underground support estate?"
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1031.346,1032.464,It's unique in that respect.
1986.85-1092,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1032.464,1038.117,"And so that your... there at least would be a different takings argument in the rest of the country, basically?"
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1038.117,1038.467,That is correct.
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1038.467,1042.653,But the same contract argument that you're making here?
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1042.653,1043.368,Identical.
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1043.368,1047.671,"And if it wouldn't be any good in those other cases, it wouldn't be any good here."
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1049.273,1051.989,The statement is a correct one.
1986.85-1092,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1051.989,1055.76,--Does any other State have a law like Pennsylvania?
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1055.76,1056.877,"It really doesn't, Justice Powell."
1986.85-1092,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1056.877,1057.96,You say it's unique?
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1057.96,1058.629,It's unique.
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1078.173,1083.494,"Well, what's the citation of the case?"
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1083.494,1084.594,The Captline?
1986.85-1092,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1100.604,1103.972,May I just one other question about the three estates?
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1114.328,1114.678,--It really doesn't.
1986.85-1092,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1123.45,1140.828,"Mr. Lee, what if the State here had simply passed a law allowing owners of the surface estate to compel your clients to convey to them for a fair price the support structure estate."
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1140.828,1141.328,I get your question.
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1162.157,1166.359,xxx has Pennsylvania ever recognize a support estate?
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1166.359,1166.859,"--No, of course not."
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1172.527,1175.146,Is that a common law rule in Pennsylvania or is that statutory?
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1175.146,1177.431,I think it has both common law and ancient statutory roots.
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1177.431,1180.716,Ancient statutory roots in Pennsylvania?
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1180.716,1183.018,"Ancient... ancient for... I don't... yes, ancient for Pennsylvania."
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1188.571,1197.261,And is there any notion of why such an estate came to pass?
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1197.261,1200.296,"Oh, I think there's little question why it came to pass."
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1207.783,1213.704,Some reason other than just an action for damages or a duty to support or--
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1213.704,1220.258,"I'm really not sure, but I've always assumed that it was because of something more than an action for damages."
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1293.889,1308.399,"--Mr. Lee, what precautions are taken in Pennsylvania, or required in Pennsylvania, under Federal law, when you mine coal for the safety of miners to keep the mine from collapsing?"
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1308.399,1309.517,Those are extensive.
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1309.517,1310.817,Do you leave pillars of coal?
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1310.817,1311.884,"Yes, indeed we do."
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1311.884,1315.754,"Or do you put in steel supports, or what?"
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1315.754,1320.873,Mostly... there can be artificial supports; it's a combination of both.
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1320.873,1335.752,Would you suppose that... why aren't those precautions... why wouldn't those be sufficient to satisfy any requirement for support and to prevent damage to the surface areas?
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1335.752,1340.637,The reason that they don't... let me give you a twofold answer.
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1357.348,1357.748,Safety.
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1357.748,1358.515,For safety purposes.
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1381.981,1382.314,Sure.
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1382.314,1390.884,"And the second is, that it was only temporary; that whereas... it was only temporary during the period of time that the coal is in the ground."
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1395.852,1413.563,"Well, what I really want to know, as you well know, is why do you... why is it so impossible that you couldn't satisfy the act, this act's requirements, by saying, well, if we're going to mine, we can easily supply the support in another way?"
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1413.563,1415.165,"Yes, yes."
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1418.951,1422.736,"Suppose that were true, that you could prove that, would you have any kind of a claim?"
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1428.807,1431.192,"--Yes, we would have a claim."
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1505.14,1510.258,"Well, the act does say that... provide a mechanism whereby you can at least try to get--"
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1510.258,1511.044,"--That's right, and we do."
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1511.777,1512.394,--And have you?
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1512.394,1513.027,Of course.
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1513.027,1514.496,In all of these areas?
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1514.496,1515.096,"Oh, no, no, no."
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1527.736,1530.755,So any statutory remedies you've had you've exhausted?
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1530.755,1531.54,Yes.
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1532.857,1543.765,"And you've never been able to prove up, or to demonstrate, that there's some other way of doing this?"
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1543.765,1550.585,"We not only have not been able to demonstrate it, Justice White... the answer to that question is no, we've never been able to demonstrate it."
1986.85-1092,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1617.746,1624.383,"You really... I take it you're really submitting that even though you lose on the takings clause, you should win on the contracts clause?"
1986.85-1092,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1624.383,1625.299,"No, I'm really not saying that."
1986.85-1092,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1640.309,1641.176,"Thank you, Mr. Lee."
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,1642.928,1656.085,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1092,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1694.36,1697.562,Do you think that makes it difference from the Kohler Act in Mahon?
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,1697.562,1701.716,"Well, it certainly has a far broader focus."
1986.85-1092,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1756.984,1757.803,But as much as nine percent?
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,1757.803,1759.803,"It goes up to nine percent, that's correct."
1986.85-1092,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1763.207,1766.591,And as much as 50 percent under a particular structure?
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,1766.591,1768.075,"--That's right, that's correct."
1986.85-1092,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1829.499,1847.277,"But I don't suppose you would contend that if during these years instead of doing what the State did, the State said, by the way, we would like to have 50 percent of your coal under these structures and we're going to mine it, and they just went and mined it; they would have to pay for it, I suppose?"
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,1847.277,1850.228,--If they went... if the mined the coal--
1986.85-1092,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1850.228,1855.096,"If the State just mined the coal and said, you can make plenty of profit without this coal; we just want it."
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,1855.096,1865.738,"--Well, obviously, as I will elaborate on more in the rest of my argument, the character of the government action makes a difference."
1986.85-1092,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1866.821,1869.023,"Well, you're arguing that the quantity of it makes a difference."
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,1888.402,1891.954,"--Well, but the question here, of course, is: Is there a taking."
1986.85-1092,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1893.037,1895.238,But does that have anything to do with what proportion you're taking?
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,1895.238,1905.777,"--It does in the... when you're talking about a regulatory taking that affects the use and enjoyment of property, it makes a big difference what the economic impact and the relative impact is."
1986.85-1092,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1905.777,1911.248,xxx it does if you haven't established that there's a taking.
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,1916.902,1921.77,"Well, if Pennsylvania Coal establishes that there is a taking here, then obviously, we don't prevail."
1986.85-1092,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1939.415,1954.241,"General, before you move on, do you agree with Mr. Lee that perhaps up to, what, 30 million tons of coal will have to be left in the ground with no economic value under this act?"
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,1954.241,1957.293,--We might have a slight difference on the amount.
1986.85-1092,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1960.645,1961.764,It could be 27 to 30?
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,1961.764,1963.781,"--Yes, somewhere in that amount."
1986.85-1092,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1963.781,1978.024,Is it possible that that could be... I don't know too much about the particular petitioners here... but is it possible that there could be a very small owner of coal that substantially all of which could be taken under this act?
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,1978.024,1988.498,"My understanding is, like most industries which are capital intensive like the coal industry is, it's becoming more and more large companies."
1986.85-1092,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1989.664,1991.164,"Yes, I would agree with that."
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,1991.164,1991.297,I don't know.
1986.85-1092,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1991.297,1997.068,"But let's assume, for example, you own a hundred or a thousand acres, and you leased it to a coal company."
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2016.231,2017.131,It could be.
1986.85-1092,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2017.131,2019.266,"It would be, wouldn't it?"
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2019.266,2027.27,"Well, I'm not sure... would be no compensation?"
1986.85-1092,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2062.126,2070.382,"You'd be in much better shape if Pennsylvania had never recognized the support estate, wouldn't you?"
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2070.382,2077.302,"Well, I'm not sure that we ascribe the features to it that the petitioners do."
1986.85-1092,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2077.302,2079.237,"Well, you might address that."
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2088.344,2100.317,"My understanding of the effect of the support estate, or a waiver of liability, whether it's in Pennsylvania or in most coal mining States is, it's pretty much the same."
1986.85-1092,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2115.091,2116.677,But that would eliminate the takings argument.
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2120.195,2125.766,"--Well, I don't know that it would eliminate the takings argument entirely, really, for two reasons."
1986.85-1092,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2139.574,2148.846,"I don't think, unless I mistake their argument, I think they're saying you're taking the support estate, whose value is measured by the coal."
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2148.846,2150.632,They're really saying both.
1986.85-1092,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2367.806,2386.167,"It sounds to me like your argument there would take you to saying that they... by regulation you could reduce the value of a piece of property to zero, and deny the owner any economic value of it, without effecting a taking."
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2386.167,2387.969,"No, we certainly don't say that."
1986.85-1092,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2387.969,2389.987,"Well, that's where your argument goes."
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2389.987,2393.856,Our argument goes that you take a look at what the owner has.
1986.85-1092,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2395.123,2398.558,"Well, what value is left to the owner of this 25 million tons of coal?"
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2398.558,2403.545,"--The value is the coal mine, an operating, a profitable coal mine."
1986.85-1092,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2404.279,2405.331,Go ahead.
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2405.331,2411.735,--That is the economic unit under which coal miners operate.
1986.85-1092,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2419.59,2429.379,"Well, could you take 5 percent per year, and over 20 years you would take the entire thing; but so long as you do it in 5 percent increments, is that permissible?"
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2429.379,2444.289,"I think in each case you have to take a look at the overall regulatory scheme, at the complete package of property rights which the owner controls, and assess the economic impact of that regulation."
1986.85-1092,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2465.135,2469.071,It's only economically viable use of the property.
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2478.629,2479.695,Absolutely.
1986.85-1092,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2500.208,2503.76,"But Pennsylvania has a mineral right, doesn't it?"
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2503.76,2504.776,--Yes.
1986.85-1092,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.776,2508.045,"I mean, it recognizes the rights to minerals as a separate piece of property."
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2508.045,2508.512,Yes.
1986.85-1092,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2509.83,2513.949,And it also says that there is a support estate.
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2513.949,2516.251,"Well, it does."
1986.85-1092,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2516.251,2527.625,"At least, this takes a piece... or this reduces the economic value to zero of a piece of the mineral estate."
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2527.625,2530.191,"Well, let me say this--"
1986.85-1092,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2530.191,2533.362,That's a Pennsylvania law; it's a piece of property.
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2533.362,2539.349,"--What Pennsylvania law says is, that there is a support right."
1986.85-1092,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2542.301,2543.718,"No, but just think of the mineral estate."
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2543.718,2544.501,Okay.
1986.85-1092,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2544.501,2550.722,You say there's 25 million tons of that mineral estate whose value is reduced to zero.
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2550.722,2552.074,That is correct.
1986.85-1092,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2578.891,2583.193,Don't we... the crucial word in all of this discussion is property.
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2623.337,2629.757,"Yes, you are bound to respect State law with respect to the definition of property."
1986.85-1092,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2670.234,2673.103,"Well, excuse me, you could say about any estate in land."
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2681.726,2684.244,--I think that's precisely our point.
1986.85-1092,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2684.244,2688.446,"So you can take the surface right, too, without any consequences."
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2688.446,2691.148,"Let's take your example, the right to cultivate."
1986.85-1092,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2712.711,2713.846,"No, but you've reversed what happened."
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2729.856,2737.277,"That gets me to point two, which is, if you look at the record in this case, we haven't completely destroyed the support right."
1986.85-1092,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2766.612,2772.516,"Well, that's just like saying, if you take only one of my hundred acres of surface estate, it's not a taking."
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2772.516,2781.788,"Well, again, the question is, if we are restricting your use... the use of your land, that'll get back to my example with the setback regulations or the height restrictions."
1986.85-1092,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2791.727,2792.893,You haven't restricted.
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2806.07,2815.426,"--Well, Justice White was asking Mr. Lee a little bit about the support estate and how it came about and what does it all mean, and maybe this will help a little bit."
1986.85-1092,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2910.055,2915.291,"Mr. Gordon, let me ask you something about one of your responses to Justice Scalia's question."
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2934.17,2939.907,I take it in your hypothetical you mean to restrict the use of it as opposed to physically occupying it.
1986.85-1092,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2939.907,2943.442,"No, let's say, simply, the State wants one of your ten thousand acres."
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2943.442,2953.166,"It is our view, based on the State law, that if the State takes and occupies any of your land, however small, that that is a taking under Loretto."
1986.85-1092,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2953.166,2965.224,"But regulatory... but so-called regulatory takings, which you say involve something less than a complete taking, are to be judged by the percentage of the estate that is disabled or impaired?"
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2965.224,2966.657,That's an important factor; it is.
1986.85-1092,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2976.199,2986.638,"Don't you think that you're making the very arguments that Justice Brandeis made in dissent in the Mahon case, and that were rejected by the majority?"
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2986.638,2989.173,--We're making one of the arguments that he made in dissent.
1986.85-1092,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2989.173,2992.141,And that was rejected by the majority?
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2992.141,2995.41,I will assume it was rejected since it wasn't accepted and he mentioned it in his dissent.
1986.85-1092,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2997.862,2999.128,Fair inference.
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,2999.128,3000.064,I think that's a fair inference.
1986.85-1092,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3003.099,3005.801,"Mr. Gordon, over here."
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,3052.18,3064.304,"--The State would have to pay for the same reason that payment was required in Loretto, because no matter how small the area that's involved, when there is an authorization for a physical invasion, that is a different case."
1986.85-1092,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3074.926,3079.313,"But here there's no taking because the coal remains in the ground, even though it has no value?"
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,3079.313,3080.547,That's right.
1986.85-1092,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3083.365,3084.315,Mr. Gordon--
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,3091.205,3094.072,"Well, it is value."
1986.85-1092,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3110.166,3113.634,"You're assuming that the support estate, even when owned by the owner, is totally valueless?"
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,3113.634,3114.967,"--No, I'm not."
1986.85-1092,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3130.327,3132.262,It's valueless as part of the mineral estate.
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,3133.929,3134.647,That's right.
1986.85-1092,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3134.647,3147.705,"Mr. Gordon, the Pennsylvania statute deals in part with taking support estate rights under publicly owned buildings, does it not?"
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,3147.705,3149.973,"Yes, public buildings are one of the categories."
1986.85-1092,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3149.973,3160.429,"And doesn't that fall just squarely within one of the concerns if Pennsylvania Coal, where the State takes land or an interest in land for its own use?"
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,3160.429,3164.733,It was one of the concerns expressed in the Pennsylvania Coal opinion.
1986.85-1092,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3172.571,3176.474,"To that extent, it's awfully hard for me, anyway, to distinguish it."
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,3176.474,3181.778,"--Well, let me say this about the comment earlier about Justice Brandeis' dissent."
1986.85-1092,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3307.175,3326.173,"Well, Mr. Gordon, wouldn't it be more fair in your view for Pennsylvania to tell the coal companies that they would have to sell back the support estate to a surface owner if there were a structure on it that required protection?"
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,3330.125,3333.077,"Well, of course, the way this program is set up, we've done that to a certain extent."
1986.85-1092,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3360.094,3362.027,Can't the owners waive it?
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,3373.535,3380.557,"--Yes, in 1980 the statute was amended to provide for a waiver under limited circumstances."
1986.85-1092,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3380.557,3383.759,"So it's for the benefit of the surface owner, and not for the polity at large."
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,3387.311,3390.829,"Well, except there are two reasons why it doesn't go quite that far."
1986.85-1092,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3402.068,3406.672,"Well, maybe that's because nobody's willing to buy the waiver, since that might be taken away by some later statute."
1986.85-1092,1,16004,andrew_s_gordon,,3407.872,3416.611,"--I think you need to also note, with respect to the waiver provision, that it only applies if the miner has the consent of the present owner."
1986.85-1092,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3424.933,3427.668,"I think your time has expired, Mr. Gordon."
1986.85-1092,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3431.52,3432.103,Mister--
1986.85-1092,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3432.103,3439.19,"xxx 25 million tons, that's just what's involved in the 50 percent of--"
1986.85-1092,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3439.19,3440.542,--That is correct.
1986.85-1092,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3441.209,3448.363,"--Now, I take it, then... I take it, then, that you do not contend that it would be uneconomical to mine the other 50 percent?"
1986.85-1092,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3448.363,3451.415,--I'm not sure I understand the question.
1986.85-1092,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3453.933,3457.551,This statute says you can't mine any more than 50 percent.
1986.85-1092,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3457.551,3461.039,--Well... I understand the question.
1986.85-1092,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3461.039,3462.505,Would it be economical to mine the other 50?
1986.85-1092,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3462.505,3465.824,It is economical to mine the other 50 percent.
1986.85-1092,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3465.824,3474.647,"So under every underground acre of mineral estate, you can take out half the coal, and do it economically?"
1986.85-1092,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3474.647,3475.597,That is correct.
1986.85-1092,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3478.751,3479.601,Yes.
1986.85-1092,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3479.601,3482.869,And that is what this case really comes down to.
1986.85-1092,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3482.869,3487.171,"Mr. Lee, could you settle the theoretical quandry that was raised?"
1986.85-1092,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3492.059,3493.075,Yes.
1986.85-1092,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3493.075,3494.26,--or that there is a taking of the coal?
1986.85-1092,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3494.26,3496.01,We're arguing both.
1986.85-1092,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3536.631,3536.714,"Mr. Lee, doesn't that cut against you, then?"
1986.85-1092,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3536.714,3536.964,Excuse me?
1986.85-1092,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3536.964,3539.081,Doesn't that demonstrate... cut against you?
1986.85-1092,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3545.737,3546.57,No.
1986.85-1092,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3549.772,3555.009,"The support estate, as I understand, to be a bunch of pillars of coal or solid coal underground."
1986.85-1092,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3557.794,3562.829,--It does have some value if you can use it in connection with supporting your mining operations.
1986.85-1092,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3566.233,3570.518,"Well, I suppose if you didn't have a waiver of surface subsidence, it would also protect you against liability."
1986.85-1092,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3570.518,3570.902,--That is correct.
1986.85-1092,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3578.905,3579.172,I understand.
1986.85-1092,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3593.332,3594.565,It clearly would not be Constitutional.
1986.85-1092,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3606.758,3609.008,Why would that be?
1986.85-1092,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3610.96,3612.662,It would not be a taking.
1986.85-1092,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3622.684,3623.284,But not a taking?
1986.85-1092,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3623.284,3627.07,"--from the one that's here, which under Pennsylvania Coal, clearly does go too far."
1986.85-1092,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3627.07,3628.588,"Thank you, Mr. Lee."
