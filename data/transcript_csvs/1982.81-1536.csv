1982.81-1536,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.932,The Court will hear arguments first this morning in Commissioner of Internal Revenue against Tufts.
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,11.274,17.552,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1536,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,309.527,315.977,"Mr. Smith, isn't what the Court of Appeals did quite consistent with the intimation in the Crane footnote?"
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,315.977,325.836,"No, we don't... no, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we don't think it is consistent with the intimation in the Crane footnote, as I shall point out in greater detail."
1982.81-1536,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,349.747,350.215,No.
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,350.215,350.745,--Yes.
1982.81-1536,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,350.745,366.148,"No, I agree with you, but how much practice and usage among the tax bar and the courts that decide tax cases, more often than we, has grown up in reliance on the idea that what you have described as ""a dictum"" is at least--"
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,366.148,367.692,Absolutely not.
1982.81-1536,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,507.635,509.9,--Why do you think Footnote 37 is there?
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,509.9,520.694,"Well, I think footnote... there has been a lot of ink spilled on this, Mr. Justice Blackmun, and I could only perhaps summarize it, you know, in a few sentences."
1982.81-1536,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,670.742,672.491,"Now, you are at the level we understand."
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,674.131,679.769,--And it doesn't fit you anymore; perhaps the excesses of the holiday season.
1982.81-1536,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,709.462,714.02,"That isn't quite fair, because he owed the bill for the suit."
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,714.02,714.6,--Sure.
1982.81-1536,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,717.724,725.796,"Well, everybody agrees, everybody agrees you realize an amount if you have one of your obligations assumed."
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,725.796,733.31,"--Well, but, Mr. Justice White, under our system, since Crane, we have been equating recourse and nonrecourse liabilities."
1982.81-1536,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,735.451,736.715,"No, you're just bootstrapping."
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,736.715,737.292,--No.
1982.81-1536,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,737.292,744.541,You're saying the Crane principle just covers this case like a blanket even though it was reserved.
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,744.541,764.658,"I am suggesting, and I think that the decisional laws, apart from the decision in this case, is uniformly to the effect that really the reservation in the case only dealt with the economic benefit aspect of the analysis."
1982.81-1536,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,764.658,775.121,"You're bound to get around to saying, why is... why did this seller here, why did this seller realize anything?"
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,775.121,776.291,"Well, he--"
1982.81-1536,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,776.291,777.651,What did he realize?
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,781.15,781.634,--Right.
1982.81-1536,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,784.18,784.96,And why?
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,784.96,792.926,"He realized $1.8 million because he borrowed $1.8 million, the code gave him basis for that."
1982.81-1536,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,792.926,793.488,Yes.
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,793.488,802.125,"At the other end of the transaction, he had not amortized that debt, he had not paid out one bit, and somebody else is going to pay that debt."
1982.81-1536,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,820.211,823.854,So what you're really saying is that he realized something when he took the deduction?
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,823.854,828.256,"Well, I don't think I am really saying that because--"
1982.81-1536,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,828.256,830.521,"But you want to get it back, anyway."
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,831.707,833.131,"--Well, we don't want to get the deductions back."
1982.81-1536,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,834.706,838.39,--You're going to pay gain on the deduction.
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,838.39,851.247,"--Well, I think the response to that is that the numbers here are fairly comparable, given the fact that the property is practically 100 percent financed, and the debt has not been amortized one penny."
1982.81-1536,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,864.881,868.865,"Mr. Smith, suppose there'd been no deductions taken at all."
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,870.207,871.225,--It'd be exactly the same.
1982.81-1536,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,872.8,875.205,Would there be any gain realized?
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,876.909,889.434,"--There would... well, I suppose if there were no deduction, if there were no deductions taken, there would be no... then in that case, the taxpayers' partnership bases would be $1.85 million."
1982.81-1536,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,889.434,890.012,Yes.
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,890.012,895.978,"But... and his amount realized would be $1.85 million, in which case there would be gain or loss."
1982.81-1536,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,895.978,900.647,"So you are saying that the deductions constitute the gain, in effect?"
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,902.506,906.581,"Well, we don't think... in effect, in a rough way."
1982.81-1536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1042.137,1048.819,"Mr. Smith, why wouldn't the approach taken by the amicus Barnett solve your problem?"
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1048.819,1070.34,"It would solve the problem to an extent, Justice O'Connor, but our response to that simply is that over the last 45 years, property transferred with liabilities has always... has always been considered by... by the Treasury to be transfers of the property along with the liability."
1982.81-1536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1072.54,1080.319,Do you take the position that the Treasury Department could subsequently decide to approach it exactly that way; that that's within--
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1080.319,1081.337,I think it would--
1982.81-1536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1081.337,1082.569,--the framework of the statute?
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1082.569,1084.316,--I think it would be a radical transformation.
1982.81-1536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1092.891,1093.426,Would it be--
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1093.426,1093.941,And that's why--
1982.81-1536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1093.941,1096.939,--consistent with the statutory structure to take that view?
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1096.939,1101.061,--One can read the statute the way the amicus reads the statute.
1982.81-1536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1135.049,1136.921,Let me ask you a hypothetical.
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1146.638,1147.262,Uh-huh.
1982.81-1536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1147.262,1169.096,"--and the taxpayer had then taken that $1.4 million and paid the secured party the 1.4 in full satisfaction of the $1.8 million debt, I assume you would recognize then that the amount realized on the property was the 1.4 million, not the 1.8?"
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1169.096,1169.767,No.
1982.81-1536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1169.767,1170.363,No?
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1170.363,1171.627,I think it would still be 1.8.
1982.81-1536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1189.775,1193.148,"But it doesn't occur on the sale of the property, does it?"
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1193.148,1211.031,"--Well, but you know, it's part and parcel of... I mean I think the Commissioner would take the position that since the liability secured the debt, it's part and parcel of the same thing, without meaning to make a pun, and that that would still be... I mean there's obviously, in your example, still gain."
1982.81-1536,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1265.824,1268.495,The professor would give you more than you asked for.
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1268.495,1272.257,The professor would give us more than we asked for; that is true.
1982.81-1536,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1272.257,1275.365,Let me ask you one other question about Crane.
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1285.129,1287.048,No.
1982.81-1536,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1291.173,1297.015,"Leaving Footnote 37 aside, I take it then that it is your position that Crane controls this case?"
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1297.015,1319.675,"--That the rationale and teaching of Crane controls this case, and that the Court of Appeals... in fact, if there need be any evidence of that, it's the fact that the Court of Appeals denied, explicitly denied, a connection between basis and amount realized."
1982.81-1536,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1370.31,1375.917,May I ask you one question about your position as applied to Crane itself?
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1400.017,1400.676,Exactly.
1982.81-1536,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1406.907,1408.015,"--In fact, about half the opinion couldn't have been written."
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1408.015,1410.795,"--and I wouldn't be standing here, because presumably all of this would have been solved."
1982.81-1536,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1417.904,1422.057,But your loaves-and-fishes argument is not very persuasive when you have inherited property.
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1422.057,1422.728,--Yes.
1982.81-1536,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1422.728,1430.897,"Someone inherits property and inherits no obligation, but the property is encumbered, and then they dispose of it by just abandoning it."
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1433.834,1439.082,"Well, right, although tax lawyers have no problems with that sort of thing only because... but the point is that--"
1982.81-1536,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1439.082,1439.784,"No, but--"
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1439.784,1447.532,"--if you get... if you get basis in something, then it has to be... it has to be considered... it has to be... there has to be a reconciliation at the other end and--"
1982.81-1536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1447.532,1452.169,"--Maybe tax lawyers don't, but taxpayers do, wouldn't you say?"
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1452.169,1487.077,"--That's true... that's simply... that's true, although we think... we think in this particular case where the concept of basis requires an economic outlay either now or sometime, here where the Respondents have paid not a penny other than the small cash contributions that they made to the partnership, it seems absolutely anomalous, to say the least, that they could... that they could achieve permanent exclusion of $400,000 of gain."
1982.81-1536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1493.028,1499.103,"Now, the basis that the purchaser has in this property is only $1.4 million?"
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1499.103,1500.885,"Yes, that is true, Justice O'Connor."
1982.81-1536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1530.483,1540.539,It's just a little hard to understand how the basis of the property would be the lower figure but what the seller received is a higher figure.
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1540.539,1550.834,"Well, I don't think it really is hard to understand if one... if one looks at it from the seller's point of view, the seller put $1.8 million in his pocket."
1982.81-1536,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1623.833,1625.053,"Mr. Smith, let me ask you one other question."
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1635.61,1637.563,His basis is $1.4 million.
1982.81-1536,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1637.563,1648.088,"--So that what you're saying is that if fair-market value puts a ceiling on it, then it puts a ceiling on at both ends of the transaction; if the amount of the indebtedness is the major basis, it is at both ends of the transaction?"
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1648.088,1686.7,"Well, the reason for that at the Bayles end of the transaction is simply because... and there's case law to support this... that when the value... when the value of property is greatly... it has great disparity between that and nonrecourse debt, that basis ought not to be the nonrecourse, the value of the nonrecourse debt because it's almost like not real debt in the sense that it has... there's only a fanciful aspect of that, a loan you pay, very much like a contingent debt, and the courts have uniformly rejected inclusions of basis in that circumstance."
1982.81-1536,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1686.7,1696.242,"So going back to my Crane question earlier, if the value of the property at the time of the death of the person from whom it was inherited, had a fair-market value of less than the indebtedness, that would have been her basis at the time?"
1982.81-1536,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1696.242,1696.804,Yes.
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,1713.409,1716.154,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1536,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1762.075,1765.323,"Well, is it fair to say has your position been consistent on that all the way through?"
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,1765.323,1769.213,"Your Honor, we raised the issue at the opening of the Tax Court case."
1982.81-1536,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1778.694,1781.459,So your position has not been consistent all the way through?
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,1781.459,1784.364,"No, Your Honor, it was not consistent in the Tax Court below."
1982.81-1536,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1801.966,1803.963,"I would like to waggle it at you, too, because--"
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,1818.535,1822.365,Because losses and deductions are a matter of legislative grace.
1982.81-1536,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1831.673,1843.651,"But even if it's a matter of legislative grace, and maybe you don't want it in this case but the next taxpayer comes along and says, well, if these words mean what the Fifth Circuit said they mean in this case, we're entitled to take the loss."
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,1845.43,1847.446,Because there is no economic detriment.
1982.81-1536,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1847.446,1850.57,But what in the statute requires an economic detriment?
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,1850.57,1858.302,Section 165 of the Internal Revenue Code says that losses shall be allowed unless compensated for by insurance or otherwise.
1982.81-1536,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1935.299,1944.95,"When you say somebody, by the depreciation of the property somebody has suffered a loss, but is it the taxpayer if he hasn't suffered any economic harm?"
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,1944.95,1945.34,No.
1982.81-1536,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1945.34,1948.483,It's probably the bank.
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,1948.483,1949.731,Probably.
1982.81-1536,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1949.731,1951.385,But it isn't the taxpayer's loss?
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,1951.385,1952.511,Clearly not.
1982.81-1536,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1954.258,1956.353,Let me put this hypothetical to you.
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,1961.6,1967.177,"I would prefer to reserve... actually, it should make a difference, sir, because--"
1982.81-1536,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1967.177,1968.347,Let's assume for--
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,1968.347,1969.193,--All right.
1982.81-1536,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1969.193,1976.657,"--to simplify the hypothetical, it's an individual, and the transaction is exactly the same."
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2009.471,2013.297,"Well, he certainly has suffered... he has realized no gain."
1982.81-1536,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2016.845,2017.251,"Well, in the first place--"
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2017.251,2017.984,--of the property.
1982.81-1536,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2017.984,2021.576,"--In the first place, he wouldn't list this liability--"
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2021.576,2022.578,Exactly.
1982.81-1536,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2022.578,2025.966,--as a liability on his first statement because it was nonrecourse.
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2025.966,2026.481,Exactly.
1982.81-1536,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2026.481,2026.918,Do you agree?
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2026.918,2028.041,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-1536,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2028.041,2032.37,"Now, after the transaction is completed, would you make that comparison for me?"
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2032.37,2043.49,"Well, actually, I think at the start of the transaction, there would be balancing entries; that is, there would be an asset and a liability in equal amount, whatever those amounts were, $1.8 million million of asset, $1.8 million of liability."
1982.81-1536,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2078.727,2089.781,"Well, in the Chief Justice's example, though, when you're making up your statement to the bank after you purchase the property and build the building and complete the loan and you close it... but this is before the sale--"
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2089.781,2090.58,Yes.
1982.81-1536,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2090.58,2091.813,--before you sell.
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2094.999,2098.248,I would say we have $1.8 million asset and $1.8 million of liability.
1982.81-1536,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2098.248,2101.605,"Well, he doesn't owe the liability."
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2104.151,2109.401,"Well, are you saying, sir, that it would be appropriate to say zero asset because it's on a--"
1982.81-1536,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2109.401,2111.042,"Well, that's what I am asking you."
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2112.805,2115.959,--Let me say I am free of any misconceptions because I am not an accountant.
1982.81-1536,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2118.162,2119.27,--Your tax accountant knows.
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2119.27,2127.501,"--The... the accountants, you know, when faced with this situation, say, my goodness, if something has happened on the left side, we must act on the right side."
1982.81-1536,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2222.728,2239.925,"Mr. Mankoff, in the corporate reorganization context, I assume you would concede, though, that the cancellation of the indebtedness is the amount received for tax purposes under sections 357(c) and 358?"
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2239.925,2249.969,"357(c), which has to do with the contribution of assets subject to liability, does not appear to have a limitation on it based upon the value of assets."
1982.81-1536,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2277.535,2279.364,May I ask you a question?
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2279.364,2280.129,Yes.
1982.81-1536,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2280.129,2299.212,"Supposing we have a transaction similar to this, but before the owner of the property disposed of it, they realized the fair-market value declined from $1.8 million to $1.4 million, and the owner went to the bank and said, we can't carry the $1.8 million loan, would you reduce the indebtedness to a more realistic figure?"
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2316.253,2320.722,I would say first there should be no immediate tax consequence.
1982.81-1536,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2335.544,2345.164,"And suppose if they did that, and then after owning it for 2 or 3 years, and then after another year or so then he disposed of it, as he did in this case, fair-market value at $1.5 million."
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2350.866,2352.566,We'd have exactly the situation we have here--
1982.81-1536,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2352.566,2353.459,--What we have here.
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2353.459,2357.347,"--which is, there is no gain realized without economic benefit."
1982.81-1536,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2357.347,2367.921,"And even though the liability was reduced in amount, that that still didn't result in any taxable benefit of any kind to the owner of the property who was not on the note?"
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2367.921,2370.542,"Not if he's not liable for the note, Your Honor, no."
1982.81-1536,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2557.984,2568.556,"I am not sure, Mr. Mankoff, whether you had completed your response to my hypothetical or whether you did complete it and I didn't follow you."
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2576.99,2581.942,"Mr. Chief Justice, in my opinion, the net worth--"
1982.81-1536,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2581.942,2583.252,"If you're making a statement form, how would you make it up?"
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2583.252,2583.818,--Yes.
1982.81-1536,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2593.407,2594.687,In the first statement?
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2594.687,2595.953,"That's right, in the first statement."
1982.81-1536,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2604.279,2606.26,He's neither richer nor poorer?
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2606.26,2607.855,--Exactly.
1982.81-1536,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2620.879,2628.69,"Of course, on the first statement, he has no personal liability for the obligation, does he?"
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2628.69,2630.484,"No, he does not, Your Honor."
1982.81-1536,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2630.484,2648.511,"Well, what if his income from the property, though, the rental income from the property, just paid the... was such that it didn't earn any income but he had a cash flow equal, net cash flow that he could put in his pocket equal to the depreciation."
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2648.511,2652.477,He would have gross income measured by the rental income.
1982.81-1536,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2655.662,2656.255,Yes.
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2658.396,2659.254,--Yes.
1982.81-1536,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2660.958,2661.613,Yes.
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2671.737,2673.827,"He would also have, if I may submit--"
1982.81-1536,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2673.827,2674.813,Isn't that right?
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2674.813,2675.999,--Yes.
1982.81-1536,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2675.999,2676.888,He'd have that much--
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2676.888,2677.575,Given those two situations.
1982.81-1536,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2677.575,2679.949,--more money afterwards than he had before.
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2679.949,2680.795,Yes.
1982.81-1536,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2692.303,2697.067,"Well, I know, but... I know, but that's the very amount of money that they would like to tax on."
1982.81-1536,1,39967,ronald_m_mankoff,,2697.067,2708.204,"--The question then becomes, can we rewrite section 1001(b) to correct earlier undeserved deductions?"
1982.81-1536,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2895.05,2898.469,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Smith?"
1982.81-1536,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2898.469,2901.843,I just have a brief point.
1982.81-1536,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2942.858,2946.48,"When you say they don't have to worry about the debt anymore, they never did have to worry about it."
1982.81-1536,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2946.48,2953.933,"They never had to worry about the debt anymore, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but at the time, if they wanted to hold on to the property, they had to worry about the debt."
1982.81-1536,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3011.001,3026.573,"But Mr. Smith, why couldn't... I mean your opponent says that in Crane the court read something into the statute that wasn't perfectly clear that was there, why couldn't the court, in effect, say, well, looking at the code as a whole, a loss is not recognized unless there's an economic detriment."
1982.81-1536,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3030.527,3033.572,--A loss is not recognized--
1982.81-1536,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3033.572,3035.553,No; a loss is not recognized.
1982.81-1536,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3040.662,3043.692,"--Well, I mean one can do lots of things."
1982.81-1536,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3044.896,3048.784,--But I mean would it be inconsistent with the way the court has construed the code in the past?
1982.81-1536,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3048.784,3052.641,"--Well, what these statutes mean the same, you know, what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander."
1982.81-1536,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3062.105,3069.697,"Well, is he right in saying there are no cases in which a loss has been recognized for tax purposes without an economic detriment?"
1982.81-1536,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3069.697,3071.651,I think that's absolutely right.
1982.81-1536,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3110.864,3111.633,"Thank you, gentlemen."
