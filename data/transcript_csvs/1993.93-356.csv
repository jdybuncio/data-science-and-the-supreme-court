1993.93-356,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.659,"Well, we'll hear argument now in No. 93-356, MCI Telecommunications Corporation v. AT&T and United States v. AT&T."
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,13.951,16.533,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-356,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,58.881,61.443,Could it go so far as to say nobody has to file a tariff?
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,61.443,69.516,"That is the position that the FCC has taken, and, of course, the D.C. Circuit struck that down."
1993.93-356,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,80.383,85.646,Modify including AT&T or just the nondominant carriers?
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,95.934,98.275,"--Well, that's certainly all we're arguing about today."
1993.93-356,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,112.346,113.805,"Why do you draw the distinction, market power?"
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,113.805,115.756,"Yes, that's exactly the--"
1993.93-356,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,115.756,119.169,"That's a reason, but where do you find that in the text?"
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,119.169,122.862,"--Well, the Commission has the authority."
1993.93-356,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,134.229,137.661,And your position would be it would not be reasonable.
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,137.661,142.383,I don't... I... the Commission hasn't taken any view on that.
1993.93-356,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,142.383,145.335,You think it would be reasonable for us to take the position that it would not be reasonable.
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,145.335,153.961,"Well, right now the Commission has not articulated any reason for relieving dominant carriers of such a requirement, but--"
1993.93-356,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,153.961,160.986,"No, but I think we just want to know whether we accept your position here... and if your position here, do we, in effect, and by implication, go the whole hog?"
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,160.986,172.043,"--Our reading of the statute, ""modify any requirement"", yes, would allow the Commission, for appropriate reasons, to relieve all carriers of the tariff filing requirement."
1993.93-356,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,172.043,180.18,"Sort of the Act is no longer necessary, it's a fully competitive industry, and we'll simply modify the Act to no longer exist."
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,180.18,198.4,"If and when it happens that the industry is fully competitive, then we believe Congress has authorized the Commission to do away with a tool to enforce just and reasonable rates that would no longer have a purpose."
1993.93-356,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,198.4,217.023,"Well, why is it that... I think you acknowledged that the only purpose of the... that the purpose of the Act is not only to assure reasonable rates, but also to prevent price discrimination, and I don't know why it is so self-evident that when there is competition there cannot be effective price discrimination."
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,218.335,219.104,"Well, I--"
1993.93-356,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,219.104,220.026,Have you ever bought a new car?
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,230.951,251.164,"--Well, unreasonably discriminatory, as construed by the Commission, includes... I'm sorry, competition assumes that there'll be give-and-take of negotiation, and that... the fact that different rates get determined does not necessarily show that something's unreasonably discriminatory."
1993.93-356,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,266.435,268.127,"You're not urging us to believe AT&T, are you?"
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,268.127,269.987,"In this particular instance, Your Honor."
1993.93-356,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,269.987,270.768,In this particular.
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,270.768,284.236,"I also wanted to make the point, in response to Justice Souter's question, that so far all the Commission has done is relieve part of one of three markets of the tariff filing requirement."
1993.93-356,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,312.566,316.857,So another way to put it is that it's been eliminated for all of the interstate market except AT&T.
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,316.857,323.553,"For... and for carriers who choose to... choose to file tariffs, and--"
1993.93-356,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,323.553,327.126,The requirement's eliminated for everybody in that whole market except AT&T.
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,327.126,328.285,--Yes.
1993.93-356,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,393.307,401.234,"There was a time when the Commission took a different view of 203, was there not, that 203 required rates to be filed?"
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,401.234,412.541,"There's a 1980 order of the Commission that in the text says something that sounds like that, and in the accompanying footnote says, but, of course, section 203 is very broad."
1993.93-356,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,427.772,432.753,"Well, was the 1980 case a case where the Commission had been requested to modify the requirement?"
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,432.753,433.615,"No, Your Honor."
1993.93-356,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,435.616,447.394,"To give ""modify"" a very broad reading... and you are explicit about that, you say it means more than the word ""exempt"", is that your position?"
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,447.394,453.057,"Well, yes, we define it in light of Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary."
1993.93-356,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,453.057,467.176,"But, yet, in legal litany modify is usually a kind of an inbetween word, like courts have authority to affirm, modify, or reverse a lower court decision."
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,467.176,472.919,"And I would concede even that one of ""modify"" 's meanings would even be more limited than that."
1993.93-356,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,478.682,480.315,Not one of its meanings.
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,514.226,522.554,"--Well, Justice Scalia, Webster's Collegiate Dictionary very clearly... the FCC's construction fits within its definition."
1993.93-356,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,540.336,545.488,"To make a basic or important change, that's what ""modify"" means, to make a basic change?"
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,545.488,547.84,--That is one of the definitions--
1993.93-356,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,547.84,550.09,Which meaning is that in terms of numbers?
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,550.09,552.581,"--I'm not sure, Your Honor."
1993.93-356,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,552.581,559.426,And wasn't there a point made that at the time this Act was passed perhaps that definition wasn't there?
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,559.426,561.647,"Well, AT&T has not actually said this."
1993.93-356,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,578.608,584.953,"There's a wonderful... wonderful line sung by the bass in the Messiah, Mr. Wright, where it says ""and we shall be changed""."
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,593.259,601.824,"Well, on a practical level, it's occurred to me that before I went to law school I thought edit meant, you know, change a few tenses."
1993.93-356,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,689.722,692.363,"What about the other language, Mr. Wright?"
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,697.016,699.149,That's one of... it says
1993.93-356,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,709.394,715.138,"And you say the ""special circumstances"" could be that the entire industry is now competitive."
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,718.87,725.966,"--Well, we think looking at the situation today from what Congress saw in 1934, that--"
1993.93-356,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,725.966,727.157,Today is a special circumstance.
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,727.157,736.003,"--The fact that AT&T no longer holds a monopoly over long distance service, but that there are 481 other nondominant carriers--"
1993.93-356,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,736.003,737.653,They're not specified circumstances.
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,749.01,755.004,"--Well, it's not yet... I mean, as I've said, it's only applicable to one part of one of three markets here."
1993.93-356,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,757.456,767.524,"Well, okay, now we're just arguing about how special ""special"" has to be, but that already backs you off of your initial position, which is that really it could extend to the entire--"
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,767.524,786.557,"--No... well, that's another... we would think that the Commission has authority to define what 1934, that... when there was really no competition at all, that today's telecommunications world is very different."
1993.93-356,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,786.557,791.222,"--So ""special circumstances"" can include everything; the entire realm of communications can be special circumstances?"
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,791.222,792.591,"If, in fact--"
1993.93-356,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,792.591,793.993,"Yes, if the Commission says so."
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,793.993,797.806,"--If, in fact, the communications industry has changed that dramatically."
1993.93-356,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,797.806,810.753,"So your rule is that when the general circumstances are different from the predicate for the original legislation, as long as this modification power is in there, in effect the legislation can, in effect, be repealed by the Commission."
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,810.753,812.846,"Well, I wouldn't phrase it that way, but--"
1993.93-356,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,812.846,816.399,"Well, I wouldn't either, if I were arguing your side of the case."
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,818.439,823.372,"--But, look it, in this... in 203 there are... there are seven sentences."
1993.93-356,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,870.665,871.987,"Well, maybe you're both wrong."
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,882.504,895.422,"Well, the logic of AT&T's position may be that we can go as far as we've gone and detariff part of one of three markets and not go as far as to detariff it if that becomes appropriate, but I don't really think that they've made that argument."
1993.93-356,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,895.422,906.649,"Have we held, Mr. Wright, that Chevron deference is equally applicable to an independent commission as is to an agency of the Government?"
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,906.649,909.782,I believe so.
1993.93-356,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,924.441,929.824,More deference is due to a body that is not controlled by elected representatives directly?
1993.93-356,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,929.824,936.599,"Well, I'll stand on the Amtrak case and the fact that that case is almost exactly like this one."
1993.93-356,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,939.38,940.61,"Very well, Mr. Wright."
1993.93-356,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,941.752,953.319,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.93-356,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1029.819,1052.032,"Mr. Verrilli, in terms of the MCI's position that the FCC must require rate filing and it could not do away with that requirement either on a mandatory or even a permissive basis?"
1993.93-356,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1052.032,1056.185,"10 years ago, Your Honor, MCI took that position in the court of appeals."
1993.93-356,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1077.291,1096.323,"I just wanted to establish that the 10 years ago, so at least you found a plausible basis for making the argument that you made successfully 10 years ago."
1993.93-356,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1096.323,1098.705,"--Yes, Your Honor, 10 years ago MCI made that argument."
1993.93-356,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1107.591,1115.506,"Well, all that that gets you is that you can remove some... you can modify tariffs, just as you can modify other things."
1993.93-356,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1131.346,1131.844,But--
1993.93-356,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1131.844,1134.127,"I mean, all it shows is that you can affect tariffs."
1993.93-356,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1134.127,1134.947,--It shows--
1993.93-356,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1134.947,1139.961,"You're still left with the problem of, you know, how far ""modify"" takes you and what are ""special circumstances""."
1993.93-356,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1139.961,1141.751,"--Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1993.93-356,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1188.442,1192.295,"Just a textual justification, the word ""modify"" and the word ""special circumstances""."
1993.93-356,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1192.295,1197.358,"Well, Your Honor, so long... there are special circumstances here, which is the lack of market power."
1993.93-356,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1204.504,1210.188,"Are you still of the view that the mandatory no filing would be impermissible, so that you--"
1993.93-356,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1210.188,1212.067,"--No, Your Honor, we're not."
1993.93-356,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1218.322,1220.475,--So you really have come 180 degrees.
1993.93-356,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1220.475,1224.115,"With respect to the meaning of section 203, yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1993.93-356,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1224.115,1227.968,"But then so has the Commission, so has AT&T."
1993.93-356,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1229.811,1232.383,"Thank you, Justice Scalia, I think that's correct."
1993.93-356,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1237.245,1242.518,"Of course, the position you advocate today is advocated by an older, wiser, and more experienced lawyer."
1993.93-356,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1243.38,1245.51,"--That's correct, thank you."
1993.93-356,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1297.615,1302.437,"Well, it's also... those statutes are applied to competitive industries as well."
1993.93-356,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1317.989,1340.412,"But they do operate on the assumption, Justice Scalia, that the very existence of competitors is likely to ferret out the price discrimination, and that competitors have an incentive to find out what the other competitors are charging, and that customers have an incentive to disclose the best offers they're getting from one competitor in order that another competitor can come in and meet or beat that price."
1993.93-356,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1439.766,1446.872,You want to let... you want us to allow the FCC to do for communications what the Federal Power Commission did for the energy industry?
1993.93-356,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1446.872,1458.088,"We think that the proper role of the agency ought to be respected here, just as it was in Permian Basin, recognizing that the tariff mechanism needs to be adjusted in light of changed circumstances."
1993.93-356,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1458.088,1467.145,My impression is that Permian Basin was the first step to a real regulatory diaster which we've ended up sorting out during the past decade with great difficulty.
1993.93-356,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1467.145,1472.939,"Well, that may or may not be correct, Justice Scalia, but that seems to me to be in the bailiwick of the agency."
1993.93-356,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1512.586,1513.745,"Thank you, Mr. Verrilli."
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1515.717,1525.503,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.93-356,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1594.258,1596.341,"Excuse me, I don't... I really didn't... I didn't follow you there."
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1596.341,1597.721,--Didn't follow that.
1993.93-356,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1597.721,1598.151,Yes.
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1604.927,1619.195,"Well, as I say, we say the statute is not... 203(b) can't be read as authorizing what they want to authorize, which is exempting carriers from the requirement of 203(a) that they file all their rates, or the requirement of 203(c) that they charge only filed rates."
1993.93-356,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1619.195,1626.441,"And your position is that they cannot exempt any carrier at any time, no matter the circumstance and no matter how narrow the circumstance, right?"
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1626.441,1627.951,"That is our position, that's correct."
1993.93-356,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1633.164,1635.735,"Well, what's the difference between modification and exempting?"
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1635.735,1654.939,"They cannot remove the requirement that carriers file all their charges somehow, someplace, somewhere, and the requirement that they charge only the rates that they'd filed, except in the situations where the statute explicitly authorizes exceptions, and there are many such exceptions."
1993.93-356,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1654.939,1658.331,"Then what does exemption mean, which you say they can't do?"
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1658.331,1659.791,They cannot do.
1993.93-356,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1693.645,1700.66,"May I ask, Mr. Carpenter, do you think they could modify the filing requirement by changing the agency where the rates are filed?"
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1700.66,1700.797,Yes.
1993.93-356,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1708.935,1713.186,What if they said we'll file them in the sales office of corporate headquarters?
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1713.186,1719.701,"Well, we're now quibbling... we're now quibbling about the--"
1993.93-356,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1719.701,1720.993,"Well, I'm not quibbling, because I imagine they may do that."
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1728.157,1738.174,"--Well, the question ultimately... I think they have to be filed in some public... public agency, but the question ultimately boils down to this, you cannot enforce the other provisions of the statute--"
1993.93-356,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1738.174,1739.503,"Well, let me just interrupt you a minute."
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1739.503,1739.823,--Yeah.
1993.93-356,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1739.823,1746.429,"If you will agree they don't have to file them with the Commission, what is it in the statute that says they must file them with some other public agency?"
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1746.429,1775.698,"What is it... what is... my position ultimately is that they can modify the requirements of 203(b), and... but they can't modify the other provisions of the statute, which they concede, and the courts have, you know, long held that the publication and filing of the rates somehow, someplace, somewhere, is ultimate... is central to the enforcement of all these other provisions of the statute that can't be modified: the ban on unreasonable discrimination, the requirement that rates be just and reasonable."
1993.93-356,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1784.523,1789.947,Somewhere must... could not be their own corporate offices open to the public if anybody wants to come in and look at it?
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1789.947,1805.637,"--The... that being so far from this case, I'm... you know, I guess my position is it should be a public agency because I'm not confident that they really would be open anywhere else."
1993.93-356,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1808.038,1818.126,"But as I understand, your opponents' position is that we should really treat this as sort of a Robinson-Patman Act; as long as they're nondiscriminatory and they adhere to uniform rates and so forth, that the purpose of the statute is served."
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1818.126,1826.631,"--No, the purpose of the statute wouldn't be served in that event because the purpose of the statute is to assure that all similarly situated customers pay equal rates."
1993.93-356,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1846.755,1851.199,"Yes, but most economists take the view that in a true competitive market there cannot be economic discrimination."
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1851.199,1863.294,"--There... absolutely, there cannot be economic discrimination and there cannot be anticompetitive discrimination in a competitive market, but there will be rate differences between similarly situated customers, and this statute rests on the ground that you want to prevent those."
1993.93-356,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1981.25,1988.677,"Well, Mr. Carpenter, what provisions do you think the modification provision applies to?"
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1991.498,1994.25,What provisions of 203 can be modified?
1993.93-356,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1994.25,1994.811,--Yes.
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1994.811,1995.181,Yes.
1993.93-356,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2042.833,2056.552,"Yeah, but the point I'm getting at is are you willing to apply your categorical notion that modify cannot include elimination, not even elimination in narrow circumstances."
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,2071.42,2075.333,"I fear I may be, to some extent, misleading you."
1993.93-356,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2164.721,2182.744,"--Suppose a Federal Agency gets into the telecommunications business and its rates are published in the Federal Register pursuant to its statute, could the FCC say that the rates of that particular carrier do not have to be filed under the Act?"
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,2182.744,2193.121,"Well, to answer your hypothetical question, I could imagine someone arguing that the statutory purposes were adequately served in that circumstance."
1993.93-356,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2199.783,2201.706,"No, but I'm just testing about whether you're really categorical--"
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,2201.706,2202.066,--Right.
1993.93-356,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2202.066,2203.136,--About you must file tariffs.
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,2203.837,2205.119,"What I'm categorical... no, Your Honor--"
1993.93-356,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2205.119,2206.559,--I find that a very hard argument to sustain.
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,2206.559,2213.605,"--Well, I think you... I think what I'm categorical about is that carriers cannot be excused from the obligation that they file their rates."
1993.93-356,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2239.621,2252.25,What about the argument put forward by the FCC that the statute would be redundant if all that 203(d) would do that job?
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,2252.25,2253.69,--203(c).
1993.93-356,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2253.69,2255.272,Is it... 203(c).
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,2255.272,2255.811,Yeah.
1993.93-356,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2425.558,2428.881,Was the additional provision subject to any restrictions?
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,2431.562,2437.406,"--It was subject to the restriction the ICC had to find it to be in the public interest and consistent with, I believe it said national transportation policy."
1993.93-356,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2467.066,2475.481,"--Mr. Carpenter, just on the example you just gave us about the grant relief and how broad that, when did Congress enact that statute?"
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,2475.481,2476.312,1935.
1993.93-356,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2476.312,2478.102,"Oh, that's in the original, okay."
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,2478.102,2478.673,Yes.
1993.93-356,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2506.77,2516.577,"Mr. Carpenter, what do you respond to the argument that the existence of competition is a special circumstance?"
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,2516.577,2523.253,There's no doubt that the existence of competition is an extremely significant fact in this regulatory scheme.
1993.93-356,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2586.933,2603.654,"Does the FCC have a developed body of law to define what is a dominant participant in an industry, or is this a category... a juridical category that is new for this regulation only?"
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,2603.654,2628.009,"The FCC has had this classification for a number of years, I believe it dated from the early 1980's, and they define dominant carriers as carriers possessing market power, and it has significance for tarrifying requirements and for other provisions, because dominant carriers are subject to some FCC regulations, I believe, that others--"
1993.93-356,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2628.009,2633.833,Is there support in the statute for that category in these areas where the FCC has been applying it?
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,2633.833,2641.549,"--We, I don't believe, have ever argued that the FCC doesn't have the authority to make that distinction for some purposes."
1993.93-356,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2870.748,2875.861,But Mr. Verrilli said that our guide should be Permian Basin and not Maislin.
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,2875.861,2878.673,"--Yes, he did."
1993.93-356,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2937.222,2938.012,They didn't file at all.
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,2939.314,2940.483,The small producers did not file.
1993.93-356,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2947.538,2948.83,"And that's okay, you think?"
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,2948.83,2963.49,"I think if you could ever have a situation like that, comparable to that in the telecommunications industry... which I can't imagine, but if you ever could it would okay because the rates would be on file and the Commission would be in a position to assure that the rates were lawful."
1993.93-356,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3068.949,3074.914,"Mr. Carpenter, I'm a little troubled about TOCSIA."
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3076.504,3077.375,"Yeah, that's our acronym."
1993.93-356,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3077.375,3078.396,Telephone TOCSIA.
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3078.396,3079.627,Yes.
1993.93-356,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3079.627,3086.642,It seems to me that that legislation did assume that there was no filing requirement.
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3089.474,3090.623,"No, I do contest that."
1993.93-356,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3116.591,3118.602,"But why did the legislation make any sense, then--"
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3118.602,3119.424,The legislation--
1993.93-356,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3119.424,3120.182,--If there was a filing requirement?
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3120.182,3123.134,--The legislation made absolute sense.
1993.93-356,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3159.458,3169.025,"And you'd say the carriers would have had to... in addition to that, although it overlapped, would have to comply in it... with 203 generally?"
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3169.025,3170.735,"--Oh, absolutely, absolutely."
1993.93-356,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3182.553,3183.614,Noncarriers.
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3183.614,3187.397,And the problem that led to the statute wasn't that the FCC wasn't receiving rate filings.
1993.93-356,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3216.877,3218.697,"Thank you, Mr. Carpenter."
1993.93-356,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3218.697,3219.218,--Thank you.
1993.93-356,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3219.218,3224.851,"Mr. Verrilli, you have 4... or Mr. Wright or Mr. Verrilli, whoever wants to take the rebuttal time, you have 4 minutes left."
1993.93-356,3,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3224.851,3229.483,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.93-356,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3292.325,3302.712,"I don't think your opponent would agree that that's... I don't think your opponent would agree that that statute would be... you would be right under that statute, because he says this is not a modification requirement, including the filing requirement."
1993.93-356,3,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3302.712,3312.718,"--Well, I was going to say one thing that's come out is that AT&T clearly thinks that under no circumstances at all can the FCC lift the tariff-filing requirement."
1993.93-356,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3312.718,3313.168,No.
1993.93-356,3,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3320.935,3327.488,"Well, the first requirement is that they shall be filed, and AT&T says that we... that the FCC doesn't have that authority."
1993.93-356,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3388.881,3392.984,Do you know if a provision like this existed under the Civil Aeronautics Act?
1993.93-356,3,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3392.984,3395.486,"I do not know that, Your Honor."
1993.93-356,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3428.247,3429.627,"Thank you, Mr. Wright."
