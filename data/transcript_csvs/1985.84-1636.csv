1985.84-1636,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.32,We will hear arguments first this morning in Morris against Mathews.
1985.84-1636,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,19.562,22.746,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1985.84-1636,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,94.01,99.814,"Mr. Drake, would all the same evidence be admissible, in your view?"
1985.84-1636,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,99.814,119.26,"In the case before the Court, all the evidence would be admissible had the Respondent in this case been indicted for murder; in other words, had the prosecution not sought the enhanced penalty, and we are talking here about an enhanced penalty case, the evidence would have been identical."
1985.84-1636,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,119.26,130.551,I guess your... the Respondent takes the position that not every bit of that evidence would be admissible at the new trial?
1985.84-1636,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,130.551,142.693,"In the brief of the Respondent before this Court, he fails to identify one iota of evidence that came in, in the jeopardy barred trial, that would not have come in in the murder trial."
1985.84-1636,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,438.132,451.173,"Mr. Drake, why would the State allow the entry of the guilty plea to robbery when it knew that there was a murder charge that should have been made?"
1985.84-1636,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,451.173,453.324,"Your Honor, at the time they did not know that."
1985.84-1636,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,466.384,473.955,"Well, I thought that the correct information had been made available before the entry of the guilty plea."
1985.84-1636,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,473.955,482.144,"The forensic pathologist from Cincinnatti, Ohio, had forwarded his findings to the prosecutor, that's correct."
1985.84-1636,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,515.615,520.019,"Mr. Drake, he was prosecuted for aggravated murder, was he not?"
1985.84-1636,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,520.019,520.586,"Correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1636,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,520.586,530.542,"And did the State concede in the federal court, not just state court, that the trial for aggravated murder violated double jeopardy?"
1985.84-1636,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,530.542,532.61,"Yes, that was a concession that was made."
1985.84-1636,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,536.645,539.43,Does that have any bearing on the issue we have to decide?
1985.84-1636,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,539.43,545.251,"--No, in light of Garrett versus United States, there's much to be said for the proposition that this is not a double jeopardy violation."
1985.84-1636,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,552.488,557.059,"So, there's still the issue of the modification of the sentence?"
1985.84-1636,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,557.059,560.111,"The case before this Court is one of remedy, at this juncture."
1985.84-1636,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,560.111,572.984,"May I go back, since you have been interrupted, to Justice O'Connor's question earlier about whether the same evidence would have been admissible in the trial for the lesser offense than was actually received."
1985.84-1636,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,591.696,592.046,Yes.
1985.84-1636,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,611.309,620.965,"At the time of the remand in light of Vitale, was there another argument before the Ohio Appellate Court or did the Court just take the case and then issue its judgment?"
1985.84-1636,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,620.965,625.786,"--Your Honor, I honestly do not know if there was additional briefing or additional argument."
1985.84-1636,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,625.786,641.296,"One of the things that's worrying me about the case, if the issue should be controlling, and I'm not saying it should but as Justice O'Connor raised the question, I'm just wondering, where in the first instance should the decision be made as to whether there would have been some admissibility problem in another case?"
1985.84-1636,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,647.217,652.853,"Most assuredly, had the issue been raised the Ohio Appellate Court would have been forced to make that assessment."
1985.84-1636,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,656.405,660.792,"But you're also not sure they had a chance to raise it, as I understand, because there may not have been briefing at that time?"
1985.84-1636,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,660.792,663.009,"I really do not know, Your Honor, correct."
1985.84-1636,1,35673,michael_g_dane,,1032.55,1036.485,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1985.84-1636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1058.318,1060.318,"Well, do you defend those reasons, or not?"
1985.84-1636,1,35673,michael_g_dane,,1060.318,1078.181,"Your Honor, I think that the Sixth Circuit decision was right in its consideration of the fairness of the trial, but I don't believe that it appropriately considered fairness because I believe that the issue presented here is one in which fairness of the trial is not dispositive."
1985.84-1636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1078.181,1080.414,Did you represent the--
1985.84-1636,1,35673,michael_g_dane,,1080.414,1081.549,"No, I didn't, Your Honor."
1985.84-1636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1084.418,1087.87,"--So, you don't... well, but you were in the Court of Appeals?"
1985.84-1636,1,35673,michael_g_dane,,1087.87,1088.32,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1088.32,1092.589,"Well, did you make the arguments to that Court that you're going to make here?"
1985.84-1636,1,35673,michael_g_dane,,1092.589,1092.941,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1093.607,1095.557,"They rejected them, or just ignored them?"
1985.84-1636,1,35673,michael_g_dane,,1095.557,1107.081,"They rejected the argument that the fairness issue should not be reached, but when they reached the fairness issue they decided it in favor of the Respondent."
1985.84-1636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1107.081,1114.354,"Do you contend, Mr. Dane, that the relief awarded by the Sixth Circuit is the proper relief?"
1985.84-1636,1,35673,michael_g_dane,,1114.354,1118.972,"Your Honor, I agree that granting the writ of habeas corpus is proper."
1985.84-1636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1132.816,1139.97,It struck me as a rather odd form of relief for a claim of double jeopardy violation to award the prisoner a new trial.
1985.84-1636,1,35673,michael_g_dane,,1139.97,1144.306,I don't believe I disagree with the Petitioner that that is what the Sixth Circuit did.
1985.84-1636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1167.572,1171.691,But it would also be free under the Sixth Circuit's reasoning to retry him?
1985.84-1636,1,35673,michael_g_dane,,1171.691,1172.257,That's correct.
1985.84-1636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1172.257,1174.576,Would it be under your reasoning too?
1985.84-1636,1,35673,michael_g_dane,,1174.576,1176.178,"On a new indictment, yes, sir."
1985.84-1636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1176.178,1179.213,And that's the relief he gets for a claim of double jeopardy?
1985.84-1636,1,35673,michael_g_dane,,1179.213,1185.533,"I suggest that the Sixth Circuit should not have reached the consideration of the fairness of the trial, Your Honor."
1985.84-1636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1234.364,1240.62,"But he did not have a right, did he, to be free of a trial on the lesser offense for which he now stands convicted?"
1985.84-1636,1,35673,michael_g_dane,,1240.62,1242.887,He does not have that right now.
1985.84-1636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1242.887,1244.505,And he didn't at any time?
1985.84-1636,1,35673,michael_g_dane,,1244.505,1246.355,"No, he did not, Your Honor."
1985.84-1636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1247.607,1252.345,"And what their contention is, is that what he got was the equivalent of a trial he could have gotten?"
1985.84-1636,1,35673,michael_g_dane,,1252.345,1252.861,--No.
1985.84-1636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1255.297,1256.73,"Well, that's their contention, not yours."
1985.84-1636,1,35673,michael_g_dane,,1256.73,1274.091,"--The State was permitted under the double jeopardy clause, having accepted guilty pleas to both robbery and burglary, was permitted to charge him with murder or aggravated murder by prior calculation and design."
1985.84-1636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1302.61,1310.447,"Well, why do you want your client to go through another trial on an offense you admit he can be tried for?"
1985.84-1636,1,35673,michael_g_dane,,1310.447,1338.884,"Justice White, I don't want him to go through another trial, but the danger here is that if they can, consistent with the clause, prosecute him for the same offense again, then while this trial had been taking place, the felony murder trial with robbery as the predicate felony, the State could have sought and obtained an indictment charging him with felony murder with burglary as the predicate felony."
1985.84-1636,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1429.506,1434.493,Do you agree that you can't show any prejudice?
1985.84-1636,1,35673,michael_g_dane,,1434.493,1453.721,"Your Honor, I believe that much of the evidence at a second trial on a murder charge would not have been admissible, but I also take the position that the question of fairness or unfairness... I'm not here to argue that the right was violated because the trial was unfair."
1985.84-1636,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1472.368,1487.377,"But in the peculiar circumstances of this case, where the Respondent could in fact be re-charged and tried again, what is to be gained by going through the process again?"
1985.84-1636,1,35673,michael_g_dane,,1489.527,1496.4,"Justice O'Connor, what is to be gained is protection of the right, identification of the interest protected."
1985.84-1636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1609.472,1632.42,"Well, Mr. Dane, a long time ago Justice McLean of this Court, in the days when the double jeopardy clause was thought to bar even a motion for a new trial and of someone who had been sentenced to be hung made a motion for a new trial, and the Government said, you can't have a motion for a new trial because it would violate his right against double jeopardy to have a new trial."
1985.84-1636,1,35673,michael_g_dane,,1651.482,1653.751,"Your Honor, I am not advocating another trial."
1985.84-1636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1657.385,1663.372,"But you can see that if it were granted, he would be tryable on the same murder charge on a new indictment?"
1985.84-1636,1,35673,michael_g_dane,,1663.372,1668.176,"I can see that, but that procedure would protect the right."
1985.84-1636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1676.782,1678.532,"Of course, Abney was a federal case."
1985.84-1636,1,35673,michael_g_dane,,1680.884,1681.568,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1681.568,1689.84,We've never held that a state has to accord an interlocutory appeal to... prior to trial to protect the double jeopardy--
1985.84-1636,1,35673,michael_g_dane,,1689.84,1690.39,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1977.093,1981.997,--May I ask one other question.
1985.84-1636,1,35673,michael_g_dane,,1999.106,2008.647,"Your Honor, I believe that language did not survive Price versus Georgia, but I also would point out to the Court that Benton was not a successive prosecution case."
1985.84-1636,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2303.554,2305.756,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Drake?"
1985.84-1636,2,39112,richard_david_drake,,2305.756,2306.872,"Very briefly, Your Honor."
1985.84-1636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2367.427,2378.035,Could the defendant have appealed prior to his trial?
1985.84-1636,2,39112,richard_david_drake,,2386.874,2395.061,"I believe counsel for Respondent is correct, that the decision he cites, the report decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio, had not been cited at that time."
1985.84-1636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2416.873,2431.9,And let's assume that there was an interlocutory appeal after his motion to dismiss was denied and the trial court was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Ohio.
1985.84-1636,2,39112,richard_david_drake,,2440.156,2443.275,"As a matter of fact, that has happened as of the time of this case."
1985.84-1636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2447.743,2451.046,"So, there are ways now to avoid the trial?"
1985.84-1636,2,39112,richard_david_drake,,2451.046,2451.98,Correct.
1985.84-1636,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2471.877,2472.544,"Thank you, gentlemen."
