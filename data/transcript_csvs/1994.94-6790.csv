1994.94-6790,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.278,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-6790, Harvey Garlotte v. Kirk Fordice."
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,67.271,71.098,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-6790,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,111.519,117.814,"What do you mean by saying Mississippi treated it as kind of a generic sense, or something like that?"
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,122.578,164.468,"Well, we argue, Mr. Chief Justice, that Mississippi essentially aggregates, or treats as unitary, a series of consecutive sentences, and by that I mean the prisoner is assigned a single date of parole eligibility, which turns on the total period of confinement, not on the individual sentences, the order in which those sentences have been prescribed is irrelevant to the prisoner's release date, and such penalogical functions as calculating earned time, calculating good time, those functions are made on the basis of the total term of confinement, so I analogize consecutive sentences to a general sentence for multiple convictions."
1994.94-6790,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,164.468,166.499,And what is a general sentence?
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,166.499,167.42,A general sentence--
1994.94-6790,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,167.42,169.622,That's simply a single sentence?
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,169.622,177.167,"--Your Honor, a general sentence at common law was a single term of confinement for convictions upon multiple counts."
1994.94-6790,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,179.9,181.446,What you didn't have here.
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,184.571,185.835,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-6790,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,185.835,195.956,"You say Missouri... Mississippi treats consecutive sentences much like a general sentence for multiple con... would have been treated at common law, is it?"
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,195.956,206.779,"That's basically our point, Your Honor, that for all intents and purposes Mississippi treats consecutive sentences, administers them as a general sentence in which--"
1994.94-6790,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,206.779,220.712,"Well, the practical effect is, if the marijuana conviction were set aside the petitioner would be entitled to an earlier release date from the remaining sentence, I gather."
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,220.712,223.413,"--That's basically correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-6790,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,227.865,228.927,At an earlier date--
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,228.927,229.615,"--At an earlier date, that's correct."
1994.94-6790,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,229.615,230.973,--if this were set aside.
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,230.973,231.442,That's correct.
1994.94-6790,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,231.442,241.017,Was the challenge to the marijuana conviction brought during the period of time when the petitioner was still serving a sentence on the marijuana conviction?
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,241.017,251.139,"Our argument, Justice O'Connor, is that Garlotte is being held under all of his convictions, including the marijuana--"
1994.94-6790,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,251.139,251.53,I know that.
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,268.494,273.443,"--Looking at the marijuana sentence alone, Your Honor, no, he was not marking time on that sentence."
1994.94-6790,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,273.443,275.426,When he first challenged it.
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,275.426,278.222,"When he first brought his Federal petition, when he first went to Federal court."
1994.94-6790,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,286.953,293.701,"Of course, your position is that he was serving time on that, because you can't separate the time on that from the time on the rest."
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,293.701,308.555,"That's precisely our position, that it's impossible to parse the consecutive sentences that Mr. Garlotte is serving under, and indeed inappropriate to do so, because the State doesn't do so for any penalogical purposes."
1994.94-6790,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,308.555,312.054,"Well, surely it's not literally impossible to parse."
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,318.927,321.599,"I think that's right, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.94-6790,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,342.699,344.479,That had expired by the time he--
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,344.479,348.369,"--Well, the State insists that it expired at that point."
1994.94-6790,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,348.369,355.148,"--Well, if it was a sentence for 3 years, one can tell simply by looking at State law, I suppose, whether or not it had expired."
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,355.148,358.163,"Looking at the sentence individually, that's correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-6790,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,358.163,358.757,Yes.
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,358.757,364.566,"But you have a different argument, as I understand it, based on Peyton."
1994.94-6790,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,418.405,421.185,"Well, maybe it wasn't principle that was driving Peyton."
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,455.171,484.677,"Oh, undoubtedly there were practical considerations that motivated the Court in Peyton, and those you described, and it is clear that the rule that we propose would permit Mr. Garlotte to challenge his marijuana conviction for as long as he remains in iron bar confinement in Mississippi, just as it would permit another prisoner serving a life sentence to challenge that life sentence for as long as he remains confined."
1994.94-6790,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,510.65,514.6,"Was there any rhyme or reason to the sentence order, Mr. Boyle?"
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,518.006,521.239,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.94-6790,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,544.776,555.162,"Is there a reason the judge might put the longer sentence first and the shorter sentence second, or the other way around, as in this case, the shorter one first and the longer one second?"
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,555.162,569.47,"No reason that occurs to me, except perhaps... and we don't make this argument at all here... except perhaps to foreclose collateral review if we're wrong here."
1994.94-6790,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,612.999,620.043,May I ask... you've been very careful each time to say he's eligible for parole earlier if the shorter sentence is set aside.
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,643.894,647.033,My understanding of Mississippi law is that he would.
1994.94-6790,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,647.033,648.752,So it's not just eligibility for parole.
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,650.047,650.906,Right.
1994.94-6790,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,683.596,699.684,"--Whereas if you had been sentenced to that separately and then had been released, and then committed another crime, and then later it was disclosed that you didn't actually commit the earlier crime, that's just tough luck."
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,702.059,704.167,"I think it's tough luck, and for this reason."
1994.94-6790,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,803.035,807.175,Why is that reversible?
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,807.175,830.245,"The Mississippi statutes which are cited in the... or quoted in full in the appendix to our brief provide for the computation of earned time, or commutation on the basis of the total period of confinement when a prisoner is under consecutive sentences, and separate provisions of Mississippi law provide for forfeiture--"
1994.94-6790,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,830.245,841.037,"So if he misbehaves later, the earned time that he got earlier which shorted his marijuana conviction will be put back on the marijuana--"
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,841.037,842.896,"--That's right, Your Honor, for as long as he remains in prison."
1994.94-6790,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1003.456,1013.983,"--Do you think it's fair to say, Mr. Boyle, that neither Maleng nor Peyton cover the facts of this case, that one is on one side and one is on the other?"
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,1013.983,1016.122,"I think that's fair, Your Honor."
1994.94-6790,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1025.618,1035.521,And the actual facts of Maleng were that the sentence had been served and was not affecting his present custody at all.
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,1035.521,1039.834,"That's correct, but the sentence at issue in that case was not imposed consecutively."
1994.94-6790,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1104.823,1110.321,"Mr. Boyle, I'm concerned about the practical effects of what you urge us to do here."
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,1150.556,1156.632,"--I agree that, Your Honor, that concerns about delay are legitimate concerns."
1994.94-6790,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1193.507,1207.597,"Well, I take it, Mr. Boyle, Rule 9(a) mitigates that argument somewhat in that a petition can be dismissed if there's been lack of diligence in filing... if the State... at least if the State can show prejudice, I believe, under that rule."
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,1207.597,1221.53,"--Absolutely, Your Honor, and so I would regard the jurisdictional question as ill-suited to... or the jurisdictional inquiry as ill-suited to try to deal with concerns about delay."
1994.94-6790,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1244.71,1250.91,"Certainly the Court in Peyton used the jurisdictional analysis to solve a practical concern, didn't it?"
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,1260.187,1266.872,--I don't contend that practical considerations are irrelevant here.
1994.94-6790,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1266.872,1270.824,But do you take the position that Peyton does not control?
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,1270.824,1284.975,"I think, Justice Souter, the principle of Peyton does control this case, the principle being that a prisoner serving consecutive sentences is in custody under each conviction supporting those sentences throughout the aggregate duration of the confinement."
1994.94-6790,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1284.975,1289.332,So you are saying we cannot rule against you without overruling Peyton.
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,1289.332,1291.909,Without overruling or modifying its principle.
1994.94-6790,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1328.348,1340.14,"But I think you would have a hard time justifying your characterization of that as arbitrary, saying that you have to challenge a sentence during the time in which you're serving it."
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,1360.023,1385.606,"Our threshold position, Mr. Chief Justice, is that each of the convictions supporting the consecutive sentences poses a present restraint throughout the duration of confinement, and in light of that I think that permitting the availability of redress to turn on the order in which the sentences appear in the commitment order when that order makes no difference for purposes of... for penalogical purposes in Mississippi would, indeed, be arbitrary."
1994.94-6790,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1418.093,1425.247,"Of course, that happens when a prisoner hasn't gotten any more than the one sentence as well."
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,1441.462,1442.851,"That's true, Your Honor, but here, of course--"
1994.94-6790,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1442.851,1447.819,"--even if it has continuing future effect, at least for purposes of recidivism and so forth."
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,1447.819,1473.278,"--But the difference here, Your Honor, is that the marijuana conviction will pose restraint on Mr. Garlotte, will have custodial, real custodial effects on Mr. Garlotte throughout the time he is confined in Mississippi, an iron bar confinement, and in that circumstance, I think it's unfair to leave those... the claims he may have against that conviction at the mercy of the exhaustion process."
1994.94-6790,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1520.306,1523.726,How would this rule be applied in States other than Mississippi?
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,1529.817,1546.327,"--There may be some, Mr. Chief Justice, and there may... those variations may have significance for purposes of the Federal question, but my understanding of Mississippi's rules is that these are the customary rules under which consecutive sentences are administered, for good reason."
1994.94-6790,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1567.912,1570.428,I'm not sure why that would happen.
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,1582.627,1593.546,"--Under consecutive sentences he would, Justice Kennedy, and that's because the commencement date for each subsequent consecutive sentence is a function of the termination date of the prior."
1994.94-6790,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1608.681,1609.118,"Oh, I see."
1994.94-6790,0,17432,brian_d_boyle,,1609.118,1623.942,"So the State sees real advantages in aggregating, amalgamating consecutive sentences and treating them as a general sentence, and our submission is that, given that election, Mississippi has to accept the consequences that turn on long periods of confinement."
1994.94-6790,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1638.934,1640.371,"Very well, Mr. Boyle."
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1642.417,1650.29,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-6790,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1695.911,1710.656,"Well, regardless of the reason, what happened in Peyton was that the Court said you could aggregate the sentences and a habeas challenge would lie immediately, even to one that technically hadn't started to run yet."
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1710.656,1711.343,That's correct.
1994.94-6790,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1711.343,1728.086,"And if you apply that principle here, then there is jurisdiction even though the marijuana conviction sentence has expired because it has an effect on the length of time the prisoner will actually serve on the second conviction."
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1728.086,1729.976,But that was not the basis of Peyton.
1994.94-6790,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1731.053,1740.065,"There were reasons given, but it nonetheless adopted a principle of aggregating them and letting the habeas challenge be brought."
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1740.065,1744.83,"--But the Court repeatedly said, for sentences to be served in the future, not in the past."
1994.94-6790,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1746.799,1763.542,"No, but Peyton was construing a statute, and it was construing the word ""custody"" in the statute, and it said that term is going to be construed on the theory of in for one sentence, in for all, and I don't see how that construction can vary depending on whether we are looking forward or whether we are looking backward."
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1776.474,1784.768,"--Well, we contend that it's a totally different fact situation, and that it is... the basis--"
1994.94-6790,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1784.768,1794.733,"So you're saying, therefore, or you're implying that the same word in the same statute has radically different meanings, depending on whether we look forward or whether we look back?"
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1794.733,1795.702,--Absolutely.
1994.94-6790,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1795.702,1796.53,That's a tough row to hoe.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1796.53,1797.309,Absolutely.
1994.94-6790,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1797.309,1801.183,Can you explain how we have that freedom?
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1801.183,1806.338,"If the sentence has already been served, he is not in custody on that sentence any longer."
1994.94-6790,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1806.338,1813.085,"No, but you're... it's fine to say that, but you're in effect rejecting the premise of the question."
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1844.26,1856.381,"Well, I don't... and of course I don't read Peyton that broadly, as being the answer to the whole question."
1994.94-6790,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1858.225,1858.725,"No, you see--"
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1858.725,1859.771,"--paragraph, I think--"
1994.94-6790,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1859.771,1867.691,"--not broadly, but the Court did not say, for purposes of looking forward statutes are or sentences are continuous."
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1870.736,1871.782,--In that last paragraph.
1994.94-6790,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1871.782,1872.563,And therefore we can look forward.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1872.563,1873.438,In the last paragraph.
1994.94-6790,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1875.89,1876.624,"Well, it--"
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1876.624,1877.546,"In the future, in the future."
1994.94-6790,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1877.546,1880.312,--It went through... I just skimmed Peyton again.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1947.019,1967.573,"Well, the policy considerations certainly weigh heavily in this case, because once this Court says that it can retroactively do so, somebody that has been, even with Justice Kennedy's concern, or I mean, comment about Rule 9, this does not mean that these people can't raise these claims that are 40 years old."
1994.94-6790,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1970.308,1971.275,"Well, it does but--"
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1971.275,1971.978,--The question that's--
1994.94-6790,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1971.978,1983.802,"--It does, but your argument suggests that there is somehow an inducement for their delay, and I don't see that, because I don't see why the inducement is not likely to work against them."
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1993.798,2004.465,"--Well, this very petitioner belies this whole argument about not delay, of the lack of delay that they make, saying that everybody's going to rush in and file their habeas as quick as they can."
1994.94-6790,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2025.132,2028.803,"Well, you're not contending that he lacked diligence in filing this petition, are you?"
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2028.803,2029.129,--No.
1994.94-6790,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2029.801,2030.364,All right.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2030.364,2041.939,"--But he had already... his sentence had expired in this case and, of course, they say... the petitioner is arguing that aggregate sentences don't make any difference under Mississippi law, that they're all amalgamated."
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2060.121,2063.837,"Well, his point is that that's just a paper distinction."
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2088.827,2089.405,No.
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2089.405,2089.873,"It's moot, right?"
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2089.873,2092.248,Not under Coffey v. LaVallee.
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2097.404,2102.324,"Suppose he files it 3-1/2 years plus 1 day, all right?"
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2103.433,2104.307,That's right.
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2104.307,2109.869,What if the good time that he's earned on his 4-year sentence is later restored?
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2109.869,2113.134,Is later--
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2113.134,2113.618,Right.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2113.618,2114.165,--restored?
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2114.165,2115.462,He's still serving his sentence.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2129.816,2131.316,"Oh, and it--"
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2131.316,2133.051,By virtue of his good time credits.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2133.051,2134.379,"--And it's later taken away, is what we're saying."
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2134.379,2136.125,"And it's later restored... yes, right."
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2137.407,2137.969,That's what I didn't understand.
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2137.969,2138.985,--later eliminated.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2140.546,2141.046,No.
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2141.046,2143.451,--become a timely habeas petition?
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2143.451,2144.201,"No, and--"
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2144.201,2145.701,It doesn't?
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2149.839,2152.557,"--I was not saying no to your question, there."
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2152.557,2153.104,Oh.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2153.104,2158.601,I'm saying that retroactively we don't take away good time as a matter of policy.
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2158.601,2159.539,"Oh, just policy."
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2159.539,2160.945,"Of course, there's been no--"
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2160.945,2161.523,"The statute permits it, I see."
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2161.523,2172.691,"--There's been no evidentiary hearing in this case to bring out the... these ifs, ands, and buts in the interpretation of the statute, in the application there, but that doesn't happen, you know."
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2178.751,2184.982,"It is permissible for that to happen, isn't it, during his entire time of incarceration?"
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2184.982,2199.571,"Under the statute, but the practice and procedures right now that are in effect and every decision of our supreme court has said that any benefit, and that's why it's been refigured, is that the benefit goes to the--"
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2199.571,2206.256,"Well, if you wrote the statute differently so that what you do is in fact what you... only what you can do, then we'd have a different case."
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2213.691,2216.003,"--Well, our supreme court has held that they're not unitary, though."
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2216.003,2221.36,"Well, but your supreme court has not held that you can't take away good time credits previously given."
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2230.059,2231.793,Well--
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2231.793,2240.993,I'm troubled by the fact that this thing can be filed in a manner that's declared to be untimely and then retroactively it can be rendered timely.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2247.179,2255.207,"--Well, the point being that if it, at some later point it did, I think that that... you know, he could then file."
1994.94-6790,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2269.952,2274.732,Could he say thanks but no thanks to the good time because I want to challenge the sentence.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2278.98,2284.62,"It is credited... well, there are two types."
1994.94-6790,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2307.313,2317.684,"You mean, if you're sentenced to 10 years, and you start serving your sentence on March 1st, 1995, you are said to have a 5-year sentence?"
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2317.684,2318.153,That's right.
1994.94-6790,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2318.153,2326.291,Is there any rhyme or reason to do the order of these sentences?
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2335.335,2336.474,Certainly.
1994.94-6790,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2384.985,2394.56,"May I ask as a matter of Mississippi law, what is the condition that must be met in order to file a collateral attack in Mississippi?"
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2396.076,2396.56,Yes.
1994.94-6790,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2396.56,2402.776,"And would that mean that as a matter of Mississippi law he would be too late to attack his sentence, or has that not been decided?"
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2402.776,2418.678,"Well, of course, he timely filed it here, within the 3-year... we have a 3-year statute of limitations from the time that you enter a guilty plea or the time the State supreme court decides it's a case on direct appeal."
1994.94-6790,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2418.678,2421.475,It's a 3-year statute or limitations regardless of the length of the sentence?
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2421.475,2421.959,Regardless.
1994.94-6790,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2421.959,2422.631,I see.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2422.631,2428.348,"And if you don't bring it within the 3 years, it's... you know... there are some exceptions."
1994.94-6790,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2428.348,2428.754,Yes.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2428.754,2433.171,"I mean, there are exceptions to the statute, but basically we have a 3-year statute of limitations."
1994.94-6790,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2433.171,2442.87,"Well, if you were within one of the exceptions, would you be able to file after the 3 years... after the short sentence had expired?"
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2449.463,2454.04,"That... I mean, if he... if his time has been served, he--"
1994.94-6790,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2454.04,2455.695,It's too late in this--
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2455.695,2456.195,--He's out of court.
1994.94-6790,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2456.195,2456.68,--It's--
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2456.68,2457.258,It's too late.
1994.94-6790,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2460.444,2461.365,--Right.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2461.365,2467.175,"--And he serves that 1-year sentence, he can't wait 2 more years to attack that... collaterally that 1-year sentence."
1994.94-6790,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2467.175,2475.407,So the statute of limitations is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the habeas petitioner to meet.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2485.887,2486.778,That's correct.
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2491.307,2493.51,--But there's no statute on Federal habeas.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2493.51,2494.852,"--No, not yet."
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2542.334,2546.909,"Well, he's able to challenge his life sentence conviction for the rest of his life."
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2546.909,2547.643,"Well, that's true."
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2547.643,2548.69,Right?
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2548.69,2549.985,That's correct.
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2549.985,2558.014,"What's wrong with being able to challenge this other one for the rest of his life, if, indeed, the two are sort of mish-mashed together, and he's serving them all together--"
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2558.014,2559.67,"Well, they're... the thing is they're--"
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2559.67,2560.248,--each having an effect on the other.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2560.248,2561.607,--They're separate convictions for separate crimes.
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2587.05,2588.268,Or if this is put last.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2588.268,2589.44,--Or we put it--
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2589.44,2598.016,"You acknowledge if the short sentence were put after the life convictions he would have been able to challenge that short sentence for his entire life, both when he originally--"
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2598.016,2598.733,--Right.
1994.94-6790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2598.733,2600.452,--went in and later when he was serving it.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2600.452,2601.638,Right.
1994.94-6790,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2645.917,2655.398,"Maybe he has no reason to challenge those life sentences, and his reason is only to challenge the marijuana sentence, as to which you're not making any claim of lack of diligence."
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2659.834,2664.427,"Well, that happens every day, that people exhausting their--"
1994.94-6790,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2664.427,2666.537,But there's no lack of diligence.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2675.175,2677.299,"--No, that was not the argument I was making."
1994.94-6790,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2745.241,2746.069,--Is--
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2746.069,2755.16,--and basically reexhausted them in the second petition and wasted a year's time filing a second petition in State court.
1994.94-6790,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2805.39,2812.216,--Do you think that there is a way... suppose you thought... I'm just trying this one.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2842.563,2843.844,As it will.
1994.94-6790,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2843.844,2848.202,"--As it will, and then that day comes, and then he isn't released."
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2848.202,2849.311,He's not going to be.
1994.94-6790,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2849.311,2849.999,Right.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2851.827,2852.234,Under the present--
1994.94-6790,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2852.234,2886.25,"--after that day comes and goes, then if he wanted to challenge that first sentence, intuitively that seems much more like the case where a person's been out for awhile, and at worst what happens is that that earlier sentence is sort of taken into account as an aggravating factor in his life that stops parole, whereas before that 10 years and 10 months runs, it seems much more like that that earlier sentence is having an active effect at forcing him to be confined for an additional 10 months."
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2894.858,2905.401,"--Under... petitioner's theory is that he is still, will be on parole for the marijuana sentence at the same time he is on parole for the murders if and when he ever gets out--"
1994.94-6790,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2905.401,2905.979,Yes.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2906.979,2920.271,--and that... and so therefore he contends that that collateral consequence of being on parole extends whether it's 10 or 15 or 20 years before Mr. Garlotte is released from custody.
1994.94-6790,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2927.893,2929.175,--That's why I wanted to know what you thought.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2936.297,2940.921,"--Of course, our argument is that when he served--"
1994.94-6790,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2940.921,2941.499,"Yes, I know."
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2941.499,2945.357,--that he was required to on the marijuana conviction.
1994.94-6790,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2945.357,2945.857,Right.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2945.857,2951.713,And we have a... in the penitentiary recs we have an earliest parole date and discharge date.
1994.94-6790,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2951.713,2952.088,Right.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2952.088,2964.411,"I mean, in the records there that are presented to the inmate, and there is a mistake in the one here, as we pointed out in the footnote, and as Mr. Garlotte points out to the Court in his petition for certiorari on page 9 and 10."
1994.94-6790,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2983.498,2993.885,"Yes, yes, but I mean, if you lost on your basics theory you'd still prefer that he lose his right to challenge the initial conviction once the 10 years and 10 months comes to pass."
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2993.885,2994.76,"--Oh, absolutely."
1994.94-6790,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2994.76,2999.056,And so I wondered if there... if you've thought of... you might... you probably haven't thought about it.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,3010.318,3010.771,Yes.
1994.94-6790,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3073.637,3077.198,"General White, have you finished your argument, because I wanted to ask you one question--"
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,3077.198,3077.495,Yes.
1994.94-6790,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3077.495,3078.822,--not directly related to the case.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,3084.601,3090.677,"Yes, I think it is."
1994.94-6790,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3094.051,3099.456,"You think that outweighs the delay that it causes, is the question that runs through my mind?"
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,3099.456,3137.879,"--Well, you know, if... in our Federal system, yes, I think it outweighs heavily the fact that the... the State courts are catching most of these things, and they're making corrections in these cases and vacating... I know I, my court has changed, in the 17 years I've been with the Attorney General's Office has changed, where it was a perfunctory denial on post conviction rules, where they're seriously considered, and many, many vacations of sentences are... you know, you see opinions written in post conviction cases where you didn't used to see that."
1994.94-6790,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3137.879,3138.424,Yes.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,3138.424,3141.236,"There were many, many just perfunctory denials."
1994.94-6790,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3141.236,3142.174,Thank you very much.
1994.94-6790,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,3142.174,3142.736,Thank you.
