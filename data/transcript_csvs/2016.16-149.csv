2016.16-149,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.57,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 16-149, Coventry Health Care Missouri v. Nevils. Mr. Estrada."
2016.16-149,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,7.57,17.0,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue in this case is whether FEHBA preempts State laws that forbid subrogation by insurance carriers."
2016.16-149,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,136.14,144.985,Is there any -- any room at all for State regulation of carriers who have these contracts with OPM?
2016.16-149,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,144.985,215.005,"Well, to be sure, the -- the statute, if you focus on the last clause -- now, the statute appears in page 2 of the blue brief -- if you focus on the last clause, the statute only reaches those State laws that, quote, ""relate to health insurance or plans."" And there are any number of subjects that may not be reached by these laws, or by other laws, and also subjects that are not related to benefits, coverage or payments with respect to benefits. Congress dealt separately in Section -- in Section 8909(f) with the subject of taxation in the context of these plans and generally provided that carriers may be subject to generally-applicable laws that are applicable to all businesses under profits and -- and the like, but that States, you know, may not tax, you know, the benefits and the payments. And so Congress has, in fact, crafted a limited preemption provision that singles out those laws that are most likely to apply to the insurance plans at issue, and then only say that the scope of the preemption will be defined by particular terms of the contract."
2016.16-149,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,251.38,258.89,"Before you do, I mean, we appeared to find this a difficult question in McVeigh. We said there were two plausible readings."
2016.16-149,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,266.79,271.595,"I actually was going to be the headline on my second point, Justice Kagan."
2016.16-149,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,397.285,402.245,"Counsel, in this case you have an express-preemption provision."
2016.16-149,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,446.245,447.15,"Well, of course."
2016.16-149,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,526.65,548.16,"Well, maybe one doctrine has to do with the delegation issue. Suppose Congress passed a law that said, well, any professional responsibility -- any professional responsibility rule adopted by the ABA will preempt contrary State law. Is that okay under preemption doctrine?"
2016.16-149,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,548.16,569.46,"Well, it seems to me likely not, but let me take apart what I think are the key aspects of the consequence of the -- of that answer. First, Congress has to identify a part of Article 1, Section 8 that gives it a head of constitutional authority to do what you just described. Second, to my --"
2016.16-149,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,569.46,572.16,Are you just -- are you just saying this is beyond -- regulating the --
2016.16-149,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,572.16,572.56,Well --
2016.16-149,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,572.56,574.335,-- profession is beyond Congress's power?
2016.16-149,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,574.335,578.57,"-- as described, is not self-evidently connected to any one of the --"
2016.16-149,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,578.57,578.69,Right.
2016.16-149,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,582.27,587.895,When -- then there's a question of identifying what it is that Congress is trying to do.
2016.16-149,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,622.45,627.08,"I guess, is it -- you know, in some of those areas, you're talking about State governments."
2016.16-149,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,635.95,640.15,I think it depends on how it does it.
2016.16-149,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,694.655,694.97,Well --
2016.16-149,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,694.97,709.29,"But in that event -- if I could just finish -- but in that event, you would also have the additional layer of involvement having to do with the limit that this Court itself has placed on the -- on the delegation by Congress -- Congress of any authority."
2016.16-149,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,710.94,723.45,"But what about two private parties, whether, you know -- whatever they are, a railroad and a shipper, in other words, and Congress says, whatever you agree to will preempt contrary State laws."
2016.16-149,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,723.45,724.02,I believe --
2016.16-149,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,724.02,725.38,I know you're going to suggest --
2016.16-149,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,725.38,725.56,No.
2016.16-149,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,725.56,726.47,-- it's not this case --
2016.16-149,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,726.47,726.92,"No, no."
2016.16-149,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,727.44,728.17,-- but assume it is.
2016.16-149,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,728.17,729.75,"I understand that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.16-149,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,752.51,759.59,"Well, before you get -- get to that, I mean, it would seem to me that you could deal with the concerns you have and still address the problem."
2016.16-149,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,787.065,791.175,"Again, it seems to me that this is a question to some extent of conceptualizing."
2016.16-149,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,799.57,809.005,"The question, I think, which is perhaps truly speculative, but it is rather interesting, if we go back to the sick chicken, Schechter --"
2016.16-149,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,809.005,810.11,"Well, I was going to go there."
2016.16-149,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,810.11,811.225,-- there first is a question --
2016.16-149,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,811.225,811.555,Uh-huh.
2016.16-149,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,811.555,816.08,-- of whether Congress has this Article 8 power to legislate at all in the area.
2016.16-149,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,816.08,816.515,Uh-huh.
2016.16-149,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,816.515,824.08,"You assume the answer's yes. The second is a nondelegation question. There, the delegation had run riot."
2016.16-149,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,860.59,876.07,"I find it hard to say that there's an independent limit on the basis of preemption, because, as I understand the power of Congress, Congress could pass a statute that displaces all law in a subject matter and renders it a law-free area, for example."
2016.16-149,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,889.185,889.32,Yeah.
2016.16-149,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,894.6,894.93,Uh-huh.
2016.16-149,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,894.93,897.465,But we're talking about the preemption of State law.
2016.16-149,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,911.825,928.91,"But if I could just pivot to what -- why the -- the argument doesn't really fit what the problem is that we have in this case, even though it is preemption, is that it arises ostensibly because the statute literally says that the terms of its statute would supersede and preempt."
2016.16-149,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1027.075,1044.03,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Tripp."
2016.16-149,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1044.03,1053.84,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: OPM's regulations answer the question presented here, and I'd like to just make three points about how they work, why they're important --"
2016.16-149,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1053.84,1054.8,Do you think the statute --
2016.16-149,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1054.8,1054.955,-- and --
2016.16-149,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1054.955,1056.775,Do you think this is ambiguous?
2016.16-149,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1056.775,1058.04,I guess --
2016.16-149,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1058.04,1061.075,Whether we get to Chevron deference at all.
2016.16-149,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1061.075,1069.96,I guess our basic take is that the answer to that doesn't really matter because we've picked one of the two interpretations and it's really up to Respondent to show that our interpretation is not even reasonable.
2016.16-149,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1076.06,1083.71,So why is the agency better than a court suited to define its own jurisdiction?
2016.16-149,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1083.71,1084.26,Right.
2016.16-149,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1130.54,1157.12,"You -- you've already -- you just slid into the Chevron question; right? I -- I understood Justice Sotomayor to want to know if you -- well, at least as I would want to know, do you need Chevron to get around the ambiguity? Because once you say that, it's -- you get into somewhat serious questions about whether Chevron applies, basically, to the decisions of private entities to -- I mean, I think the concern is it's bad enough that they're preempting State law, but now they get deference."
2016.16-149,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1160.85,1161.08,Right.
2016.16-149,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1258.52,1265.69,"Now, you understand the problem, and I understand the argument that it's semantic, but sometimes semantics matter."
2016.16-149,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1271.145,1271.39,Yeah.
2016.16-149,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1272.01,1272.49,But you don't.
2016.16-149,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1275.53,1275.83,Sure.
2016.16-149,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1313.28,1317.02,"If -- if you edit the statute, it's perfectly clear."
2016.16-149,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1319.86,1334.445,"And -- and I think what I was getting at is, I think it's a perfectly natural reading of shall supersede and preempt to interpret that to mean shall apply notwithstanding, because the -- the Supremacy Clause itself has similar language about notwithstanding."
2016.16-149,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1356.555,1365.245,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wessler."
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1365.245,1373.905,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A decade ago in McVeigh, this Court stressed that FEHBA's express-preemption clause requires cautious interpretation."
2016.16-149,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1415.59,1422.985,"Does the -- does the statute 8902(m)(1), does it preempt anything?"
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1422.985,1455.545,"Well, we think that the statute is unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause, and so, as written, it has -- it should have no effect. I think if you carve that out for -- for one second, I think what Your Honor is asking is are there a subset of laws that Congress was attempting to displace by virtue of these contract terms, and I think the answer to that is yes and you can get that from the legislative history. There were -- I think, just to back up for a second, when Congress first passed FEHBA in 1959, it did not attempt to enact a uniform area of Federal law."
2016.16-149,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1549.08,1572.43,"Before we get to the legislative history, could you say something about the terms of this provision? Would you argue that the terms of a sub -- of a subrogation -- of a contract that has a subrogation provision do not relate to coverage? They do not relate to benefits, that they do not relate to payment of benefits? Could you explain how you would reach that conclusion?"
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1572.43,1576.455,"That's right, Your Honor. That -- that, we think, is the best reading for three reasons."
2016.16-149,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1598.46,1603.005,It doesn't -- it doesn't affect the benefits that the participant receives?
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1603.005,1603.79,That's right.
2016.16-149,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1603.79,1608.01,"If -- if it -- if there's no subrogation claim, the benefit receives a certain amount."
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1615.195,1617.08,"I don't think that's quite right, Your Honor."
2016.16-149,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1631.595,1632.14,Right.
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1632.14,1636.215,"Because that claim is necessarily contingent, it may never occur."
2016.16-149,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1651.27,1655.36,"But money is money, and, you know, one dollar is as good as the next."
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1684.71,1689.63,"Well, I think -- I think that that is certainly possible, although I do think the money matters."
2016.16-149,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1732.48,1733.68,"The point is, is your point."
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1771.03,1771.935,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2016.16-149,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1771.935,1780.295,"Well, if that's the point, then what about payments with respect to benefits? The -- the sub -- those payments are not even with respect to benefits?"
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1780.295,1785.475,"Again, I don't think that's the best reading of the statute for largely the reasons that Justice Breyer gave."
2016.16-149,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1803.13,1813.33,"But the question isn't whether it's benefits; it's whether it relates to benefits, and not even whether it relates to benefits, whether it relates to payments with respect to benefits."
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1813.33,1814.69,I -- I -- yes.
2016.16-149,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1874.01,1875.13,There is no ambiguity.
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1909.97,1912.25,"Well, I think -- I mean, I think --"
2016.16-149,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1912.25,1921.635,Because what is it that the insurance company did that entitles them to receive that money from Mars? What is it that they did?
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1921.635,1924.99,"Well, they -- they included in their contract this requirement --"
2016.16-149,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1924.99,1925.27,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1931.615,1932.05,Sure.
2016.16-149,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1933.0,1933.58,Exactly.
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1947.265,1953.615,"Well, Your Honor, I think, again, the question is -- is largely what did Congress intend when it passed this statute."
2016.16-149,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1981.36,1982.345,How do we know that?
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1982.345,1990.14,"They said in the legislative history, it is purposely limited and not intended to displace otherwise applicable State insurance law."
2016.16-149,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1990.14,1997.185,"You know, our colleague Justice Scalia, is not here any longer, but he would be having a fit at this point, so maybe -- (Laughter.)"
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1997.185,1998.82,Sure.
2016.16-149,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2037.05,2042.71,"Mr. Wessler, what is -- how do you differentiate our holding in Hillman?"
2016.16-149,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2042.71,2044.54,How is this --
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2044.54,2044.96,Yes.
2016.16-149,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2044.96,2049.38,"-- any more or less ""relates to"" than in Hillman?"
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2049.38,2050.165,"Well, I --"
2016.16-149,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2050.165,2052.485,Almost identical language.
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2055.425,2061.22,"Well, the critical distinction, Your Honor, in Hillman, is that Hillman was decided on an implied form of preemption."
2016.16-149,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2085.61,2087.35,Why -- why isn't there a conflict here?
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2087.35,2088.99,We -- we think that there --
2016.16-149,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2088.99,2106.49,"There's a direct conflict between what the benefits paid here demand -- it's benefits minus later subrogation -- and what the State law says, which is you can't honor that contractual term."
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2106.49,2107.66,I -- sure.
2016.16-149,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2170.4,2170.58,But -- but --
2016.16-149,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2170.58,2171.58,And so I do.
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2182.66,2186.31,"Well, I think, Your Honor, that is what happened in Hillman v. Maretta."
2016.16-149,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2203.47,2217.205,"Well, it just seems to me as orderly proceeding for us to ask the first question: Is there express preemption? And that displaces the whole necessity for going through the very difficult exercise of implied preemption."
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2217.205,2218.08,"Well, I --"
2016.16-149,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2218.08,2220.915,You seem to indicate it has some priority.
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2222.115,2231.38,"Well, I don't -- I don't know -- I wouldn't -- I don't think there's necessarily a priority, but I don't think the express-preemption clause in this case can bear the weight of the interpretation that the challenger is --"
2016.16-149,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2231.38,2232.02,"Well, that's quite another thing."
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2232.02,2232.725,-- trying to place on it.
2016.16-149,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2232.725,2247.53,"But, for example, just a couple of years ago, we said with respect to an express-preemption clause, we said that the presumption against preemption just didn't apply in a case like this -- like that; that it was only applicable in a case of implied preemption."
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2247.53,2247.97,Right.
2016.16-149,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2257.14,2258.66,So that was just a careless statement --
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2258.66,2258.77,No.
2016.16-149,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2259.08,2259.42,-- on our part?
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2259.42,2272.33,"I think in that case, the point the Court was making was that where the language of an express-preemption clause is clear, where we know that Congress intended to displace a -- a particular State law, the presumption does not need to apply."
2016.16-149,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2359.07,2380.73,Does your -- does your argument depend on the wording of this provision? Does it depend on the fact that it says the terms of the contract shall supersede State or local law? Would -- would you have a -- would you make the same argument if it said this statute hereby supersedes and preempts any State or local law that conflicts with the terms of the contract?
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2380.73,2391.71,"I think that is -- I think that is a -- a far better approach that would -- would likely not raise these problems, because it points back to a -- a statute that actually does the preempting."
2016.16-149,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2391.71,2399.065,"Well, boy, if you're willing to concede that, I don't see what there is to your argument because that's, in essence, what this is -- what this is saying."
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2399.065,2405.76,"But the difference, Your Honor, is that here the terms are -- the terms of these contracts are determining the scope of preemption."
2016.16-149,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2432.53,2439.38,But Congress doesn't know the term -- doesn't know what's in all these plans. They didn't know what would be in all these plans when they enacted it.
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2439.38,2440.11,"Well, that --"
2016.16-149,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2440.11,2442.71,It depends on the -- it -- on -- on the formulation.
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2459.545,2461.52,"Well, it depends on what the statute says."
2016.16-149,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2536.77,2542.81,I think I don't quite understand your -- your answer to Justice Alito's first question.
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2560.38,2563.15,I may have misheard -- I may have misheard Justice Alito.
2016.16-149,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2563.15,2567.53,Because those contracts are just as indefinite as the -- as the contracts in this --
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2567.53,2567.95,That's right.
2016.16-149,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2567.95,2568.51,-- statute written here.
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2568.51,2569.06,That's right.
2016.16-149,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2596.17,2598.12,"Well, but that -- that, again, is true of ERISA, too."
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2606.03,2616.17,"Well, I think the difference is that when this Court does -- when this Court considers preemption in ERISA, the Court looks to the substantive provisions of the statute."
2016.16-149,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2627.26,2641.0,Doesn't -- doesn't specify everything that's in -- in a State -- in a -- in a plan. And things that are in a plan that are not required by ERISA supersede State law; isn't that true?
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2641.0,2641.54,That's true.
2016.16-149,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2711.68,2714.53,I think Mr. Estrada referred to this situation.
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2730.355,2738.29,"I think that -- I think if you are in a world where there's field preemption, where Congress has displaced everything, you -- you might not run into this problem."
2016.16-149,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2740.46,2741.9,You might not run into the problem.
2016.16-149,2,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2743.12,2748.175,"I think, again, it depends specifically on what the Federal law says and how it's operating."
2016.16-149,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2921.41,2924.805,"Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Estrada."
2016.16-149,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2924.805,2932.855,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to start with the last point counsel made about how Congress did not expressly delegate the power to preempt."
2016.16-149,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3110.32,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
