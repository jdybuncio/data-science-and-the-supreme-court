1957.105,0,30847,joseph_s_hertogs,,23.268,30.158,"Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, may it please the Court."
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,1703.528,1708.352,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1794.751,1820.402,"You -- are you saying that there is outstanding an in -- an uncontested legally valid order of deportation, that the Attorney General out of the goodness of his heart can't say, “Oh well, this is a hard case.I'll give relief,” but he has no power to do that, but the Congress in 243 has given him power under certain circumstances that you find conditionally and that as a matter of law."
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,1824.869,1828.443,"Yes, I'm saying -- I'm saying almost that."
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1918.479,1925.365,"Well, that -- I haven't -- you haven't made clear to me at least why -- why he couldn't act under Section 212 (d)?"
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,1925.365,1942.721,"He could and in fact what has -- what has occurred is that while the case was pending in this Court, applications were made for relief by petitioner in this case and respondents in the succeeding case for relief under to 212 (d) (5)."
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2021.232,2033.542,"Is that the only difference between 212 -- 212 (d) and -- and 243, namely that 212 isn't restricted by whatever within the United States may mean, whereas 243 is?"
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2033.542,2047.995,"That -- that is the basis for the -- for the distinction with respect to this relief, because 212 (d) (5) talks of parole into the United States and talks of applicants for admission to the United States."
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2070.025,2094.081,"Did I understand you to say that the application with 212 (d) was rejected, because as a matter of -- on a finding of fact by the Attorney General, by the immigration federal, by the authorized officials, it was with the suggestion that she would be returned to a physically dangerous country which found (Inaudible) is that right?"
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2094.081,2094.85,Well --
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2094.85,2096.36,Is that why it was rejected?
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2096.36,2100.069,It was rejected because among other reasons.
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2105.127,2117.68,"Well, not the same -- if that -- if that would be an allowable finding of fact, why are we not discussing an abstract case here, in fact that would equally buy him from exercising power under 243 (h)?"
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2117.68,2129.536,"Well, when you say allowable finding of fact, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, this was a -- it's the same reason --"
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2129.536,2132.843,"Well, it's (Voice Overlap) or it wasn't found with reason."
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2138.885,2139.212,"Yes, sir."
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2139.212,2150.861,"And if it is wasn't founded in reason for 243 (h) then although 212 (d) may not be before us, but it's not a very attractive kind of a situation to present."
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2150.861,2170.18,"Under -- I think there would -- there's still a case before this Court, because under -- under -- the practice has been under 243 (h) to accord the -- the alien a -- a hearing and for findings to be made under 243 (h)."
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2175.949,2177.15,Is it just taking out of the alien (Voice Overlap) --
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2177.15,2206.423,"No, the -- the alien was -- was afforded an opportunity to submit whatever material it saw fit and then there was the rejection of the claim by the -- by the Director of Immigration in the letter to the alien which set -- set forth the fact that because for other reasons -- because among other reasons, petitioner has failed to establish in the view of a service that she will be subject to physical persecution."
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2209.567,2212.311,I must say you -- you baffle me.
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2212.311,2213.295,Well --
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2213.295,2228.981,"The Attorney General has been given under two sections with the important difference that you indicate, restricted within the other issue, this compassionate power, this power of -- of relief in human situations."
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2251.476,2253.059,Because among other reasons.
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2262.809,2267.345,"I am aware of that, but you specifically used the language of physical danger?"
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2267.345,2274.328,That -- that was the language which we are told by the service and -- and the petitioner was told with the grounds for the rejection of the (Voice Overlap) --
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2274.328,2275.793,So that the ground would have --
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2275.793,2276.483,-- under 212 (d) (5).
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2276.483,2283.627,The basis for judgment made in 212 is the same as the basis for judgment in 243.
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2283.627,2286.899,"But not necessarily, because there are other factors which may -- may also be considering."
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2286.899,2289.374,"Well I know, but other means in addition to and have excluded off --"
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2289.374,2289.447,"Yes, that's correct."
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2289.447,2292.578,-- not excluded.
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2292.578,2300.091,"There are also maybe differences, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, with respect to the burden of proof which -- to which --"
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2300.091,2301.197,"Well, I'm still bothered."
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2312.698,2328.87,"Well, I -- I think what comes down to is this, that if -- if it is found that there is power, if this Court should hold that there is power under 243 (h) for the Attorney General to act, it may very well be that -- that the end result with be the same."
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2329.756,2332.126,That doesn't help in this light.
1957.105,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2348.482,2363.375,"Mr. Sand, is it the position of the Government that -- if this Court should decide the case in favor of petitioner that that would adversely affect the Immigration Service?"
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2363.375,2365.632,Is it -- yes.
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2472.894,2475.311,"Well, that -- that is the point."
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2502.382,2502.44,Yes.
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2502.44,2524.06,"-- that leads to a very serious thing to make a ruling and to be asked to make a ruling, the upshot of which will be, people won't be led out of the detention place, the places of detention, because it will then be suggested they're within the United States, so that a particular case that may appeal to our emotion maybe of a greatest disservice to aliens coming into this country."
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2524.06,2546.566,"Well, I think, I think that the -- that the whole thrust of the argument which is advanced on behalf of the aliens in this case is that -- is hostile, as I've stated, to this -- to the concept of parole, because it would seek to attach to parole the consequences of changing the immigration status."
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2546.566,2548.83,"Well, they won't parole them a year after."
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2548.83,2570.761,"It -- certainly, it would have to be a factor in determining whether or not to parole an alien, what consequences that would have on the status of the alien and -- and the whole -- we -- we're dealing here with the legal fiction, the legal fiction being that an excluded alien paroled in the United States is not in the eyes of the law within the United States."
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2630.866,2633.157,You call that a legal fiction.
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2649.87,2650.048,Well --
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2650.048,2652.895,-- the -- the whole line of cases from Ju Toy.
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2659.462,2662.461,"Well, that's -- that's correct, Mr. Justice Frankfurter."
1957.105,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2767.069,2801.423,"Well Mr. Sand, suppose that this young woman, instead of coming into the country by parole had sneaked across the border and had been in this country for the same length of time and the Attorney General wanted to send her back, the country she came from, say it was the same country, would he have jurisdiction under 243 (h) there to -- to consider her case?"
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2801.423,2804.16,"He -- he would, Mr. Chief Justice --"
1957.105,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2804.16,2804.459,Yes.
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2804.638,2805.34,-- because --
1957.105,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2805.34,2808.712,Why then -- why then wouldn't he have it -- would he have it here?
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2808.712,2829.211,"Well, because it's basic to the Government's argument that there has always been in the immigration laws of this country, a distinction between the excluded alien and the alien who is in the eyes of the law in the United States."
1957.105,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2890.853,2895.063,"Well, she wouldn't be legally within the United States as she sneaked towards the border (Voice Overlap) would she?"
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2895.063,2897.662,"She would be -- you're right, Mr. Chief Justice."
1957.105,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2921.832,2921.96,In other words --
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2921.96,2923.262,A concept which as I have said --
1957.105,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2923.262,2934.048,"In other words, you based your -- your argument on the fiction as to whether this -- this young woman is actually within the United States now or not?"
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,2934.048,2969.659,"I base my argument, Mr. Chief Justice, on the fact that reading the Immigration Act of 1952, the Government finds in it over and over again instances that Congress has adhered in this statute as it has in old prior statutes, to the fact that there is a difference between an excluded alien, who is subject to exclusion and -- and an alien who is within the United States and in subject to deportation."
1957.105,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2989.749,3028.916,"Yes, but referring back to your -- to your fiction, don't you believe that the -- that the fiction as to whether one who sneaks into the country is -- is in the country and one who is here under parole is not within the country, becomes a distinction without a difference when the Government permits the person to come into the country and permits the person to remain here for a period of time for the purpose of -- of -- for any purpose, whether it's for the purpose of -- well, for any purpose."
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,3053.412,3069.396,"Well, I -- I think Mr. Chief Justice, that when we're dealing with this fiction and -- and I -- I think is not term of disparagement."
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3069.586,3073.584,I just want to disassociate myself from your notion that it's a fiction --
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,3073.584,3073.766,Well --
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3073.766,3075.01,-- in a derogatory sense.
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,3075.01,3076.246,I -- I will.
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3076.629,3078.718,A fiction that has no reality.
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,3080.32,3081.817,I want to associate my --
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3081.817,3084.917,"I know about this, because I came on an immigrant ship."
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,3089.857,3096.239,I -- I want to join in -- in associating myself from -- from any notion that's a term of disparagement.
1957.105,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3096.644,3103.313,All that it -- that -- that it's a harsh term whether it's irrelevant to this Court's determination of what statutes mean?
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,3103.313,3105.795,I think it's in a humanitarian term.
1957.105,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3246.583,3267.929,"Well, how can you say that there's such a great danger of the change of status when all she ask for is to have the same kind of consideration under Section 243 (h) that you say the Attorney General is entitled to give her under the other Sections?"
1957.105,1,35094,leonard_b_sand,,3270.979,3283.857,"Well, the -- the consequence is, Mr. Justice Warren, this is not a question of whether the Attorney General saw fit or did not see fit to act under 243 (h)."
1957.105,2,30847,joseph_s_hertogs,,4012.66,4013.449,If I might --
1957.105,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4013.449,4014.326,"Yes, you may."
1957.105,2,30847,joseph_s_hertogs,,4014.326,4014.993,-- Mr. Chief Justice.
1957.105,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4014.993,4015.518,Yes.
1957.105,2,30847,joseph_s_hertogs,,4015.518,4020.947,There is one comment I would like to make in the argument by counsel for the respondent.
1957.105,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4054.808,4063.416,"But that is -- you're leaving out of account or vast constitutional difference between procedures, between exclusion and deportation."
1957.105,2,30847,joseph_s_hertogs,,4063.416,4064.414,There is a difference.
1957.105,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4064.483,4067.484,"Well, then, why do you say that they're -- they're the same thing?"
1957.105,2,30847,joseph_s_hertogs,,4067.484,4070.648,As far as -- he said one is deportation and one is exclusion.
1957.105,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4072.492,4086.17,"Well, I know but they're sent out, but the -- the protective -- the protection, the legal protection in the case of an incoming alien and one who is here and thought to be sent out are vastly different."
1957.105,2,30847,joseph_s_hertogs,,4086.17,4087.048,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1957.105,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4087.048,4088.886,"Well, then, don't say they're the same."
1957.105,2,30847,joseph_s_hertogs,,4088.886,4099.219,"Now, under -- under one of the answering -- one of the questions of Mr. Chief Justice with regard to whether or not a person who had sneaked in the United States would be eligible to fall in this Section."
1957.105,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4110.429,4123.495,But we can't construe these statutes according to the particular appeal of a particular case or how close a particular case on one side of the line comes to another side of the line.
1957.105,2,30847,joseph_s_hertogs,,4138.511,4138.755,But it's --
1957.105,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4138.755,4141.667,"So, although you are saying they're the same and yet, very different."
1957.105,2,30847,joseph_s_hertogs,,4141.667,4141.908,"Yes, Your Honor."
1957.105,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4141.908,4149.216,"And the fact that a person comes in and he's here, doesn't mean that the fellow who isn't here, in the eyes of the law is here."
1957.105,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4149.216,4151.653,You -- you may have two or three minutes --
1957.105,2,30847,joseph_s_hertogs,,4151.653,4151.724,"Yes, sir."
1957.105,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4151.724,4154.654,-- if you wish to -- to conclude.
1957.105,2,30847,joseph_s_hertogs,,4154.654,4155.973,"Thank you, Your Honor."
