1983.82-940,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.237,We will hear arguments next in Hishon against King and Spalding.
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,16.563,19.695,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-940,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,52.436,55.458,High compensated as compared to the judiciary?
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,56.368,58.972,Yes.
1983.82-940,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,64.914,65.693,I see.
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,70.508,74.749,I don't think the Court was misinformed as to the intent.
1983.82-940,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,279.514,281.364,Did they all become partners?
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,281.364,284.457,"No, Your Honor, they all did not become partners."
1983.82-940,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,323.373,335.421,"But, you would still be here if the ultimate decision was that based on sex or race?"
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,335.421,337.261,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-940,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,337.261,342.036,"So, consideration isn't what you are really talking about I don't suppose."
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,357.917,359.156,That is correct.
1983.82-940,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,361.199,362.748,You are using too many words then.
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,369.143,372.806,"--Certainly from among associates, that is true."
1983.82-940,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,459.652,478.145,"So, if you win on that basis, if, in hiring associates, the law firm says that we will make our selection of partners unrestricted by the terms and conditions of Title VII, would that get them off the hook?"
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,478.145,479.415,"No, Your Honor, it would not."
1983.82-940,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,480.536,484.929,"Well then, it isn't a term and condition of employment."
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,484.929,486.33,--I disagree with Your Honor.
1983.82-940,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,490.871,492.243,"So, it is a legal term."
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,492.243,496.227,I am not sure what Your Honor means by that.
1983.82-940,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,496.227,500.13,"Well, I mean it is imposed by the operation of law, not by contract."
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,500.13,519.603,"It is imposed by the operation of law, it is reinforced, whereas in this instance, the complaint alleges that the firm explicitly held out as an inducement fair, non-discriminatory consideration for partnership after five or six years of employment."
1983.82-940,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,546.968,554.294,"Mr. Bondurant, what part does the representation by the firm play over and above what the law otherwise requires?"
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,554.294,560.318,"Your Honor, it plays no part other than reinforcing the notion."
1983.82-940,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,560.318,564.302,"Well, if it plays no part, how can it reinforce?"
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,564.302,566.613,"Well, let me put it in this sense."
1983.82-940,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,639.299,650.688,Supposing... Do they still have that 15-employee limit in Title VII where people employing less than 15 aren't covered by it?
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,650.688,658.773,The 15 or fewer employee limit excludes business establishments with fewer than that number of employees.
1983.82-940,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,658.773,674.222,"Supposing a firm with 15 or fewer employees made a representation that we are an equal opportunity employer and we follow all the guidelines of the EEOC, would that be actionable under Title VII even though they had less than 15 employees?"
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,674.222,683.808,"No, Your Honor, it would be actionable, if at all, under state law, because Title VII explicitly excludes coverage from employers with fewer than 15 employees."
1983.82-940,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,683.808,711.337,"Mr. Bondurant, let's assume that the Petitioner had been admitted to partnership in King & Spalding and two or three years after young partners of the same rough age and experience were up for promotion within the firm, be entitled to a greater percentage of participation, would your position be the same?"
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,711.337,715.288,"Your Honor, let me answer it in two ways."
1983.82-940,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,717.211,718.41,I know that.
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,718.41,723.015,This question is a denial of the admission to partnership itself and whether it is actionable under Title VII.
1983.82-940,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,775.118,778.57,You have touched on two or three factual situations.
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,793.48,794.692,"Well, not quite any partner."
1983.82-940,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,797.773,799.484,Don't go quite so fast.
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,800.756,802.666,Pardon me.
1983.82-940,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,827.313,832.005,You are saying that a partner is an employee of the firm always?
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,832.005,840.48,We are saying that for purposes of Title VII the relationship between a partner and a law firm has sufficient attributes of--
1983.82-940,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,840.48,842.042,Can't you just answer that question?
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,858.533,860.492,"--For purposes of Title VII, the answer is yes."
1983.82-940,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,860.492,861.324,Yes.
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,872.681,889.704,"The only consequences, Justice Powell, of applying Title VII to either the admission decisions of partnership or the compensation decisions of partnership are to outlaw prohibited forms of discrimination."
1983.82-940,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,901.72,904.754,What has that got to do with this case?
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,904.754,908.705,--The question of compensation at some later point.
1983.82-940,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,920.143,933.723,"Well, is it relevant whether your view of the case or your friend's view of the case would enhance or do otherwise to a particular law firm or to law firms generally?"
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,935.273,946.208,"--Your Honor, it is not relevant other than it is a broad policy consideration to reinforce the applicability of Title VII to law firms."
1983.82-940,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,988.537,999.825,"Mr. Bondurant, would you concede that judgments are made with respect to a variety of qualifications when the partnership decision is made?"
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,999.825,1001.407,Absolutely.
1983.82-940,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1001.407,1003.428,"And, many of those judgments are subjective."
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,1003.428,1018.928,"I would also concede they are subjective just as they are in the question of whom an ordinary business enterprise would employ for a particular position, particularly one of higher than a menial capacity."
1983.82-940,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1018.928,1034.476,"So, it is possible a firm may need somebody to do damage suit litigation and if an individual in competition with that associate was very good at corporate law, would those factors be considered?"
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,1034.476,1054.131,"As long as none of the prohibitive factors covered by Title VII were factors in the decision, the firm is free to provide and apply subjective criteria in determining who to admit to partnership and how to award those who it has admitted to partnership."
1983.82-940,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1065.157,1066.747,"And, one more question."
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,1082.399,1092.306,"Your Honor, under the broader argument which we make, we would take the position that it does apply, but the Court need not go far as to decide that question in this case."
1983.82-940,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1092.306,1095.749,"Well, I asked you whether it would apply and you answered yes."
1983.82-940,0,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,1095.749,1097.519,The answer is yes.
1983.82-940,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1125.297,1134.664,Mr. Bator?
1983.82-940,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1134.664,1139.289,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-940,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1220.07,1230.686,"Mr. Bator, I hate to interrupt you so early, but it would help me if you could tell me... Perhaps this is not a fair questions... Does Title VII apply to the faculty of a law school?"
1983.82-940,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1230.686,1231.738,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-940,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1231.738,1234.68,"And, what about the tenure decision?"
1983.82-940,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1236.052,1244.356,The lower courts have unanimously held and the government's position has been that the tenure decision is covered by Title VII.
1983.82-940,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1244.356,1246.016,Are there cases so holding?
1983.82-940,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1246.016,1247.609,There are cases.
1983.82-940,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1247.609,1248.758,Are they cited in your brief?
1983.82-940,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1249.519,1252.802,They are cited and in the Second and the Third Circuit.
1983.82-940,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1261.197,1266.15,"--Does that apply all the way up the line to associate professor, to full professor, to chair professor?"
1983.82-940,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1266.15,1266.791,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-940,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1266.791,1270.535,To the dean?
1983.82-940,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1270.535,1273.697,Yes.
1983.82-940,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1281.933,1285.825,What about the very bottom of a law firm?
1983.82-940,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1287.176,1294.159,I believe that it is universally conceded that in hiring associates a law firm may not exclude.
1983.82-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1337.747,1340.301,What about lateral entry to partnerships?
1983.82-940,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1340.301,1342.762,--Directly into the partnership?
1983.82-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1346.674,1348.917,It is withholding a position?
1983.82-940,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1348.917,1350.947,--It has not taken a position.
1983.82-940,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1350.947,1368.808,"Mr. Bator, is there anything in the legislative history of Title VII to indicate that Congress intended to insulate decisions regarding the selection of partners from Title VII's provision?"
1983.82-940,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1368.808,1371.68,Selection of partners from the outside.
1983.82-940,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1371.68,1372.421,Right.
1983.82-940,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1377.093,1380.115,There is nothing directly related to law firms.
1983.82-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1497.523,1514.185,Could you have... I take it then the government would say the law firm couldn't take sex into consideration at all even for affirmative action purposes or for quota purposes.
1983.82-940,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1514.185,1516.837,In promoting or--
1983.82-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1516.837,1519.718,"No, entry into the partnership."
1983.82-940,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1519.718,1533.477,"--Our argument is restricted to the proposition, Justice White, that insofar as admission to the partnership is a term, condition, and privilege of an employment relationship."
1983.82-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1536.869,1554.071,"No, I know, but I am talking about this case where there was an employment relationship and the law firm says, well, I think we ought to have six or eight lady partners but no more or we should have 20 or 30 but no more."
1983.82-940,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1554.071,1568.422,"--Your Honor, that, I guess would become then subject to the more general and obviously very sensitive question of whether rectifying previous discrimination, to what extent affirmative action or other plans would be a problem."
1983.82-940,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1579.988,1618.304,"Would Title VII apply to a situation where a woman or any other person claiming the protection of the Act has pointed out that for the ten years that she had been in the firm she had never been assigned a case to argue in the courts of appeals or the Supreme Court and that was an area reserved for men... that would be the claim... and, in fact, the record would show that only men had been assigned those assignments."
1983.82-940,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1620.985,1621.614,--Yes.
1983.82-940,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1623.437,1624.656,"Wait a minute, a partner now."
1983.82-940,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1624.656,1625.918,--She is now a partner.
1983.82-940,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1625.918,1627.789,We have gotten over the hump.
1983.82-940,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1627.789,1629.201,She is now a partner.
1983.82-940,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1629.201,1629.711,She is now a partner.
1983.82-940,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1629.711,1640.839,"That is a question which I am unable to answer, Your Honor, because it would depend on this additional question, whether the partners themselves are employees."
1983.82-940,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1643.369,1647.162,Your friend said the partners aren't employees.
1983.82-940,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1647.162,1650.845,We have not joined the Petitioner on that submission.
1983.82-940,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1675.69,1677.353,May I just ask you another question?
1983.82-940,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1677.353,1678.592,--Yes.
1983.82-940,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1678.592,1689.12,"In the year 1983, with a third of the students in the law schools of the United States, is this really a problem."
1983.82-940,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1728.194,1743.895,"Your Honor, this may be a decreasing problem, but when Congress acted, first in 1964, and in 1972, it was a very active problem, it was really a virulent problem."
1983.82-940,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1790.986,1793.109,You are now using your friend's time.
1983.82-940,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1793.109,1796.169,I think I will back off and leave my friend his time.
1983.82-940,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1796.169,1796.8,Very well.
1983.82-940,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1796.8,1797.851,Thank you.
1983.82-940,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1797.851,1806.596,Mr. Morgan?
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1806.596,1808.817,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-940,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1877.934,1884.385,I am not sure I grasp what you meant by the statement that they are the most regulated.
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1887.337,1887.958,"Well, sir--"
1983.82-940,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1887.958,1893.732,--The structure of the bar or the potential of a particular court?
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1893.732,1901.299,"--The structure of the bar as well as the structure of sundry courts, that lawyers are a member of the bar over a period."
1983.82-940,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2066.346,2073.181,"What sort of a partnership do you suppose Senator Cotton was thinking of coming, as he did, from New Hampshire?"
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2073.181,2084.329,"Well, he came from New Hampshire, but he was also, as I recall it, the senior partner in a law firm in New Hampshire, Cotton, Tesreau... I have forgotten the names."
1983.82-940,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2092.753,2103.352,"But, a lot of the partnership problems that you refer to in your brief, seems to me are covered by the 15 employee requirement, you know, if you are talking about a small partnership."
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2115.529,2119.723,"I thought there might be one, maybe two, but I certainly don't know."
1983.82-940,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2121.283,2137.072,"Mr. Morgan, you concede though, I guess, that the law partnership of over 15 associates is an employer of the associates within the meaning of Title VII, don't you?"
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2137.072,2140.494,We have not taken a position to the contrary.
1983.82-940,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2142.177,2143.707,"Well, I am asking you now."
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2150.602,2160.319,"--It is an employer of associates under Title VII which poses certain problems for a portion of my case, for example."
1983.82-940,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2160.319,2161.288,All right.
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2161.288,2175.968,"If King & Spalding, or any other law firm employs lawyers who then sues King & Spalding, there may be an invasion of the attorney/client privilege."
1983.82-940,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2224.921,2227.462,"Well, we don't have to decide that, do we?"
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2227.462,2232.085,"Well, I think when looking at congressional intention, you have to see at what Congress had in mind and Congress--"
1983.82-940,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2232.085,2237.179,"Well... But, the Petitioner in this case says you don't have to decide that."
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2251.448,2257.472,"--Well, in response to Justice White's question, he stated, of course, she would be here anyway going right into the firm."
1983.82-940,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2447.234,2456.363,May I ask you about the hypothetical question the Solicitor General gave?
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2473.024,2477.025,"The Act is not applicable to partnerships, so consequently they could do that."
1983.82-940,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2477.025,2481.058,That would be a permissible disparate treatment on the basis of sex?
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2481.058,2487.041,It would be permissible as a... It would be permissible as a disparate treatment if they just did that.
1983.82-940,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2489.392,2490.574,"If they write it out, that is the rule."
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2496.989,2503.361,"Put it in the employment booklet, just like is happening all over the country now as these job-right cases are developing under state law."
1983.82-940,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2512.27,2512.648,No.
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2527.798,2530.309,If I lay it out when the associate is hired--
1983.82-940,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2530.309,2530.88,Right.
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2530.88,2539.185,--and I tell the associate at the time of hire that later the associate will have to work here for ten years before the associate could become partner.
1983.82-940,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2544.899,2554.106,"No, but your legal position, I think, has to say that in the eighth year the male and females are not being discriminated against... are not being treated differently on account of sex."
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2554.106,2555.287,--I am saying two things.
1983.82-940,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2626.674,2645.745,"Mr. Morgan, on this... on carving out this exemption for law firms, with the number of law firm representatives in Congress, why didn't they spell it out if they intended to do it?"
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2660.374,2661.145,Yes.
1983.82-940,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2661.145,2663.366,They drafted this bill.
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2667.51,2668.799,"Well, sir--"
1983.82-940,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2668.799,2670.362,"That is your position, isn't it?"
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2670.362,2672.102,--That is my position.
1983.82-940,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2731.06,2742.638,"You mean out of all the partnerships that you can imagine, law partnerships were alone exempt or are you suggesting that all kinds of partnerships were exempt?"
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2742.638,2746.46,"Well, I am suggesting that as far as Congress was concerned all of them were."
1983.82-940,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2753.216,2759.6,"So, your submission really is that no partnerships are covered by this insofar as entry is concerned into the partnership?"
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2759.6,2760.199,--Sure.
1983.82-940,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2767.654,2775.489,"So, we should judge this case as though this were a partnership of engineers or--"
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2775.489,2776.28,"No, no."
1983.82-940,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2776.28,2777.98,--Rather than lawyers.
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2779.413,2781.453,"No, no, no."
1983.82-940,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2788.799,2794.203,I understood Justice White's question and your response has confused me.
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2806.531,2811.333,"No, sir, but in most of those you do not... Are they all in the same category, yes, sir."
1983.82-940,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2811.333,2817.728,I thought you answered me that no partnership was subject to Title VII in terms of entry.
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2817.728,2820.249,"Yes, that is what... Let me complete that."
1983.82-940,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2833.148,2837.43,"Your submission, as I understand it, would cover any partnership."
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2837.43,2838.892,--I beg your pardon?
1983.82-940,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2838.892,2842.863,Your submission would cover any partnership for rationale for your position.
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2842.863,2843.664,"Oh, no."
1983.82-940,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2874.435,2885.793,What cases from this Court support you in suggesting that lawyers have this very high claim to resist government regulations because they are advocates.
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2885.793,2900.963,"No, no, that is not... What we say is that law firms are advocacy organizations which handle litigation as was pointed out in NAACP in Button."
1983.82-940,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2937.675,2955.787,"Well, supposing that Congress is not trying to deter advocacy expressly, it is saying that law firms are going to be subject to minimum wage laws, maybe they have to bargain collectively with representatives of their employees, they are subject to the Civil Rights Act."
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2960.983,2964.884,"Your Honor, as I recall, on the minimum wage, they would come off as a professional exemption, but--"
1983.82-940,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2964.884,2968.606,Let's assume Congress decided to repeal a professional exemption.
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2968.606,2969.976,--All right.
1983.82-940,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2983.737,2990.29,"But, we are not dealing with purely business... You apparently feel there is some higher, loftier goal of law firm than making money."
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3002.45,3011.973,Because what it does is it takes in this particular instance and places an advocacy agency of the federal government overseeing the law firms.
1983.82-940,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3068.872,3074.886,That assumes that lawyers in their dealings would need confidentiality in a way that lots of other organizations don't.
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3096.808,3099.48,"I certainly hope not, but lawyers are different."
1983.82-940,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3104.865,3112.57,"Mr. Morgan, now Congress knew full well how to write exemptions from Title VII and it put in three."
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3125.76,3126.519,"No, no."
1983.82-940,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3132.642,3135.394,That is precisely what we are talking about.
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3135.394,3143.001,--Congress exempted partnerships as employees and partners as employees.
1983.82-940,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3194.393,3195.364,It is a little different.
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3199.087,3199.976,"--But, you see--"
1983.82-940,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3199.976,3203.609,"And, your client is not a non-profit--"
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3203.609,3205.392,--I hope not.
1983.82-940,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3206.151,3209.934,"--If it is, I was getting ready to say you are in bad shape."
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3211.016,3212.425,"If it is, nobody would want in."
1983.82-940,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3218.929,3219.34,Excuse me.
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3252.652,3254.984,"--Yes, sir, the Eleventh Circuit."
1983.82-940,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3268.191,3276.248,You haven't mentioned the right of association which we have said is guaranteed by the First Amendment.
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3276.248,3281.311,We go into it in depth in brief.
1983.82-940,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3310.8,3316.754,Does that apply to stockbrokerage partnership firms in New York?
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3316.754,3322.017,"As far as partnership coverage of Title VII, yes, the same rule would apply to them."
1983.82-940,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3324.028,3328.933,"So, they can exclude all women and all minorities?"
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3328.933,3331.775,"In their partnerships, yes."
1983.82-940,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3331.775,3332.345,In--
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3332.345,3334.666,"In partnerships, yes, sir."
1983.82-940,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3337.006,3349.575,--What you want us to do is to write an exemption that Congress didn't write and then there would be people... I won't say you... but there will be some people who will say we are legislating.
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3352.978,3353.496,"Well, sir--"
1983.82-940,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3353.496,3355.649,Do you want us to legislate?
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3355.649,3367.828,"--I think what we are talking about here in not you legislating it, but since there is not a word in the record of Congress that they desired to cover partnerships as anything other than employers--"
1983.82-940,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3367.828,3370.399,Is there a word that says they didn't intend--
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3370.399,3380.016,"--Only one sentence that would indicate it and that is Senator Norris Cotton, and he comes close to saying, this is crazy folks, this would be as bad as--"
1983.82-940,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3380.016,3382.496,--You are not really saying there is only one question.
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3396.095,3403.79,--It excludes partners as employees by including them as employers.
1983.82-940,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3403.79,3413.407,"That may be so, but neither... The government's position doesn't go to whether a partner is an employee."
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3421.75,3423.613,I understand the government's argument.
1983.82-940,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3423.613,3437.402,"Let me ask, what if it were perfectly clear on the face of the statute or the legislative history that Congress intended to cover law firms and intended to cover the admission of partners."
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3442.324,3443.897,"Yes, I would."
1983.82-940,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3443.897,3446.258,You would have to say that I would suppose.
1983.82-940,2,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3446.759,3450.151,I understand the problem with the phrase.
1983.82-940,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3505.126,3510.939,Do you have anything further--
1983.82-940,3,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,3510.939,3514.492,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-940,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3514.492,3521.616,You haven't mentioned the right of association which we have given a very high place to in our opinions.
1983.82-940,3,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,3528.902,3530.482,"Not in this case, Your Honor."
1983.82-940,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3530.482,3539.828,People are compelled... They are compelled by some legal process to take on a partner in a consensual relationship.
1983.82-940,3,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,3539.828,3544.452,"Your Honor, the aspect of the case is a consensual relationship is a red herring."
1983.82-940,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3545.652,3546.563,Wait a minute.
1983.82-940,3,21882,emmit_j_bondurant_ii,,3549.335,3550.967,--Is a red herring.
1983.82-940,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3730.675,3732.037,"Thank you, gentlemen."
