1986.86-87,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.967,"We will hear arguments next in No. 86-87, United States against Anthony Salerno and Vincent Cafaro."
1986.86-87,0,18942,charles_fried,,71.08,75.939,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-87,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,418.302,439.151,"But in fact, General Fried, to go back to your terrorist example, had the same situation, except he isn't arrested for a past offense yet; he has just gone around saying, I am going to blow up an airline."
1986.86-87,0,18942,charles_fried,,460.066,461.877,"That is correct, Justice Scalia."
1986.86-87,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,756.384,758.884,What happened to the Eighth Amendment in this case?
1986.86-87,0,18942,charles_fried,,758.884,762.881,--The Eighth Amendment was not part--
1986.86-87,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,762.881,764.069,Wasn't it in the case?
1986.86-87,0,18942,charles_fried,,764.069,767.693,"--It was not urged, and it was not part of the decision below."
1986.86-87,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,767.693,769.082,Wasn't it in the case originally?
1986.86-87,0,18942,charles_fried,,769.082,785.248,"I'm not aware that an argument was made on the basis of the Eighth Amendment, and if it were, it would quite properly have been rejected."
1986.86-87,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,807.536,810.785,"There is a provision for bail, isn't there?"
1986.86-87,0,18942,charles_fried,,810.785,814.065,There is a provision for bail under some circumstances.
1986.86-87,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,814.065,817.095,"But somebody dropped it, didn't they?"
1986.86-87,0,18942,charles_fried,,819.921,827.403,"I'm not sure who first raised it, but by the time it got here, it was gone."
1986.86-87,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,839.899,850.144,xxx from affirming on an alternate ground?
1986.86-87,0,18942,charles_fried,,850.144,861.561,"It would be unusual to affirm on a ground which was not urged, and was not part of the decision below."
1986.86-87,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,877.071,895.673,"General Fried, before you get off this, this really doesn't... I suppose it doesn't relate to the Eighth Amendment; it could, but would you say that you could... that a state could simply say, henceforth, there will be no bail for all felonies?"
1986.86-87,0,18942,charles_fried,,895.673,900.047,--It might say that.
1986.86-87,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,926.8,928.55,What would that violate?
1986.86-87,0,18942,charles_fried,,928.55,933.595,"I think that would violate, if it violated anything, due process."
1986.86-87,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,947.277,955.352,"That is, because that system would pick up nondangerous accused felons as well as dangerous accused felons; is that it?"
1986.86-87,0,18942,charles_fried,,955.352,966.8,"It would be because persons would be deprived of their liberty for insufficient reasons, for inappropriate and insufficient reasons."
1986.86-87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,966.8,971.111,No one would be entitled to any kind of a hearing?
1986.86-87,0,18942,charles_fried,,974.343,981.169,"The violation, if it were one, would be one of substantive, not procedural, due process, Justice White."
1986.86-87,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1019.795,1022.153,But that depends on how good your predictive factors are.
1986.86-87,0,18942,charles_fried,,1043.41,1052.421,"Justice Scalia, there's no doubt that this system assumes that some measure of prediction is possible."
1986.86-87,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1104.839,1107.837,Over dissents.
1986.86-87,0,18942,charles_fried,,1107.837,1109.744,Over dissents.
1986.86-87,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1113.306,1120.755,"Not only this Court, but the American Psychiatric Association."
1986.86-87,0,18942,charles_fried,,1120.755,1129.642,"I suppose there were dissents within the American Psychiatric Association, but I doubt they publish them in the same way."
1986.86-87,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1257.249,1264.95,"Mr. Solicitor General, do you think that the promptness of the trial has anything to do with the propriety of seeking pretrial detention?"
1986.86-87,0,18942,charles_fried,,1278.287,1300.06,"--Well, a number of judges, and serious and respected judges, have certainly thought that the period of detention, and indeed, the reasons why the period of detention might be quite long, bear on the due process of this provision."
1986.86-87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1312.665,1316.211,But it wasn't of concern to the Court of Appeals here?
1986.86-87,0,18942,charles_fried,,1316.211,1318.225,It was not of concern to the Court of Appeals.
1986.86-87,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1329.767,1334.609,"But underneath it all, there is 11 months in this case, at least."
1986.86-87,0,18942,charles_fried,,1334.609,1337.125,There have been 11 months in this case.
1986.86-87,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1360.349,1374.532,"Mr. Fried, while I have you interrupted, I think in your brief you haven't mentioned the two rebuttable presumptions that are in Section 3142(e)."
1986.86-87,0,18942,charles_fried,,1384.276,1390.368,"--Well, I should say first that in this case, those rebuttable presumptions were not invoked."
1986.86-87,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1390.368,1391.743,That's correct.
1986.86-87,0,18942,charles_fried,,1391.743,1411.641,"Those rebuttable presumptions have, I believe, universally been interpreted by the Courts of Appeals to simply shift the burden of going forward onto the defendant, the burden of going forward as to dangerousness."
1986.86-87,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1497.7,1499.075,"Yes, General Fried."
1986.86-87,1,15719,anthony_m_cardinale,,1509.21,1509.898,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-87,2,18942,charles_fried,,3393.864,3399.455,A number of factual matters.
1986.86-87,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3421.448,3426.649,How many motions are usually handled in part one in the Southern District in a day?
1986.86-87,2,18942,charles_fried,,3426.649,3429.29,"--I have no idea, Justice Marshall."
1986.86-87,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3545.351,3547.179,"Thank you, General Fried."
