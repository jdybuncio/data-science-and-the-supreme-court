1992.91-1695,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.249,"We'll hear argument next in number 91-1695, Pioneer Investment Services Company v. Brunswick Associates Limited Partnership."
1992.91-1695,0,18833,craig_j_donaldson,,39.948,44.779,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1695,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,415.523,422.938,"Well, Mr. Donaldson, I guess this case may turn on what we mean by excusable neglect under the statute."
1992.91-1695,0,18833,craig_j_donaldson,,423.879,426.491,"I would agree wholeheartedly, Justice O'Connor."
1992.91-1695,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,426.491,430.131,And what's our test for excusable neglect?
1992.91-1695,0,18833,craig_j_donaldson,,431.994,447.773,"Excusable neglect, as I'm sure the Court knows, is nowhere defined in the bankruptcy code or the rules and, for that matter, is nowhere defined in the similar rule 6 of the Federal Rules."
1992.91-1695,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,470.419,474.082,"Well, why is that definition any improvement on the statutory language?"
1992.91-1695,0,18833,craig_j_donaldson,,477.343,482.956,"I think it is an improvement, Mr. Chief Justice, for this reason."
1992.91-1695,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,513.206,519.179,Doesn't the provision of the... what does the Federal... provision in the Federal Rules that talks about default judgments say?
1992.91-1695,0,18833,craig_j_donaldson,,521.702,529.609,"--If Your Honor please, rule 55(c) that talks about the entry of default only is for cause shown."
1992.91-1695,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,538.976,543.656,Why do we need a definition of excusable neglect?
1992.91-1695,0,18833,craig_j_donaldson,,553.083,557.285,"I think the answer is yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.91-1695,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,591.748,603.276,"Well, don't you think it's rather strange to talk about events beyond somebody's control when you're trying to define excusable neglect?"
1992.91-1695,0,18833,craig_j_donaldson,,612.961,616.414,"Justice White, the answer to your question--"
1992.91-1695,1,31572,john_a_lucas,,1628.139,1640.857,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1695,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1685.527,1694.343,"Well, in this case, Mr. Lucas, the bankruptcy court ruled against your client, and then the district court in the exercise of its discretion ruled against it, didn't it?"
1992.91-1695,1,31572,john_a_lucas,,1694.343,1704.04,"The bankruptcy court did, Your Honor, and we believe that the bankruptcy court, in effect, abused its discretion because of the way that it weighed the factors."
1992.91-1695,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1704.04,1714.895,"Well, do you think that is something that should be reviewed on a legal basis every time a bankruptcy court reaches a conclusion?"
1992.91-1695,1,31572,john_a_lucas,,1714.895,1722.872,"Your Honor, I think that the review on an abuse of discretion standard will be a very rare review."
1992.91-1695,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1753.2,1762.998,"But the line, I take it, is bright enough so that there would be an abuse of discretion in this case if the bankruptcy court ruled against your client."
1992.91-1695,1,31572,john_a_lucas,,1762.998,1800.381,"I believe there was an abuse of discretion in this case, Your Honor, and that's one of the points of our appeal is that the bankruptcy court erred in the way it weighed these factors because the way it weighed them... and I'll come to this in a moment, but it weighed them in a way that inevitably would find against clients like mine who moved expeditiously to correct their error, to correct their neglect and, in effect, weighed these factors in a way that put undue emphasis and put sole emphasis on this beyond reasonable control test that the bankruptcy court had accepted in the first instance and which was continually urged by petitioners."
1992.91-1695,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1802.962,1832.233,"I understand one of your arguments to be that excusable neglect cannot consist of circumstance... exclusively of circumstances reasonably beyond the control of the party for the reason that that would not be neglect because there would not be any negligence or blame attachable, if it were circumstances beyond the control of the party."
1992.91-1695,1,31572,john_a_lucas,,1833.623,1834.845,"--That is correct, Justice Scalia."
1992.91-1695,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1834.845,1848.112,"Am I to understand then that where you are negligent or blameworthy, but you have some excuse, you are in better shape for purposes of this rule than if you're not blameworthy at all?"
1992.91-1695,1,31572,john_a_lucas,,1848.112,1849.824,"No, Your Honor, because--"
1992.91-1695,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1849.824,1855.218,What do you do with a person where the circumstances are beyond his control?
1992.91-1695,1,31572,john_a_lucas,,1860.872,1863.233,"--Your Honor, I think that that is covered in other rules."
1992.91-1695,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1893.523,1894.584,That's the only thing?
1992.91-1695,1,31572,john_a_lucas,,1899.407,1900.646,"No, Your Honor--"
1992.91-1695,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1900.646,1902.469,"That isn't covered by 906(a), is it?"
1992.91-1695,1,31572,john_a_lucas,,1902.469,1907.982,--9006(a) covers where the courthouse is physically... is inaccessible.
1992.91-1695,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1907.982,1913.635,That's just one small example of absolute... circumstances that absolutely prevent it.
1992.91-1695,1,31572,john_a_lucas,,1918.718,1919.399,"No, Your Honor."
1992.91-1695,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1959.924,1966.159,"That's another single instance, but why don't you just cover my one instance of the car being swept away on the way to the courthouse."
1992.91-1695,1,31572,john_a_lucas,,1967.211,1972.463,"Your Honor, I would say that either the... either section 105 of the bankruptcy code--"
1992.91-1695,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1972.463,1973.525,What does that say?
1992.91-1695,1,31572,john_a_lucas,,1973.525,1979.529,"--Your Honor, that's a section that essentially grants the court inherent equitable powers, makes the bankruptcy court a court of equity."
1992.91-1695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1997.18,2003.165,Are you defending entirely the court of appeals opinion?
1992.91-1695,1,31572,john_a_lucas,,2003.165,2006.477,"Your Honor, we would articulate the rule slightly differently."
1992.91-1695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2006.477,2008.067,"Well, let me ask you specifically."
1992.91-1695,1,31572,john_a_lucas,,2016.903,2025.078,"Your Honor, in this situation I believe the court of appeals did say that under the circumstances, it would be unfair to penalize the client."
1992.91-1695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2025.078,2033.913,"So, they didn't really inquire whether the attorney's negligence was excusable."
1992.91-1695,1,31572,john_a_lucas,,2033.913,2040.879,"Well, I believe that they did ultimately because they were addressing the question at the outset of excusable neglect."
1992.91-1695,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2046.522,2049.114,Do you think the court of appeals accepted it as good law?
1992.91-1695,1,31572,john_a_lucas,,2049.114,2062.364,"I believe it did, Your Honor, because the question is not whether or not we're going to... whether or not the client is chargeable with the acts or omissions of attorney, it's what are the consequences of that."
1992.91-1695,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2084.366,2091.282,"Well, you can't imagine more severe consequences than in Link when the plaintiff's complaint was dismissed."
1992.91-1695,1,31572,john_a_lucas,,2091.282,2094.213,"That's correct, Your Honor, but here's an important point about Link."
1992.91-1695,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2122.742,2126.605,And here the bankruptcy court denied your motion.
1992.91-1695,1,31572,john_a_lucas,,2131.687,2140.384,"Well, they did both deny, but let me jump, if I may, to the last point of my argument, which is to why the bankruptcy court abused its discretion."
1992.91-1695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2189.52,2197.574,"So, it wouldn't make any difference whether the attorney's error would subject him to a malpractice suit or not?"
1992.91-1695,1,31572,john_a_lucas,,2197.574,2200.247,"I don't think that makes a difference, Justice White."
1992.91-1695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2200.898,2208.761,"So, you're not really talking about whether it was just a human error in the sense that almost anybody would make it."
1992.91-1695,1,31572,john_a_lucas,,2208.761,2210.003,--It was a human error.
1992.91-1695,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2257.634,2285.711,"That's an argument certainly why the bankruptcy court was wrong in exercising its discretion in this case, but it... do you support the view taken by the Sixth Circuit, as Justice White reads its opinion, as I do, that whatever the consequences... whatever the neglect of the attorney, it should not be visited on the client?"
1992.91-1695,1,31572,john_a_lucas,,2285.711,2287.193,"Your Honor, I don't think--"
1992.91-1695,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2287.193,2288.443,Can you answer it yes or no?
1992.91-1695,1,31572,john_a_lucas,,2288.443,2292.847,--I don't support it the way Your Honor just articulated it.
1992.91-1695,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2347.653,2352.965,"So, then if the Sixth Circuit said otherwise, you don't find it necessary to uphold that part of the Sixth Circuit--"
1992.91-1695,1,31572,john_a_lucas,,2352.965,2353.957,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1992.91-1695,2,18833,craig_j_donaldson,,3167.298,3174.354,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3261.521,3284.577,"Well, if you want to... I suppose the real party in interest is the client, and if you want to impose a rule that this is excusable if it's due to something... some act beyond your control, surely in this case the negligence of his lawyer was beyond his control."
1992.91-1695,2,18833,craig_j_donaldson,,3284.577,3304.4,"But I think the rule looks, Justice White, at the negligence of the party and the party's counsel, and if one of them is at fault... well, at least in the context of the client, if the lawyer is at fault, the client I think under Link has to suffer the consequences."
1992.91-1695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3318.347,3320.009,Or whatever damages he could recover.
1992.91-1695,2,18833,craig_j_donaldson,,3320.009,3320.718,Or what he could prove--
1992.91-1695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3320.718,3323.81,"I mean, or whatever damages the lawyer could pay for."
1992.91-1695,2,18833,craig_j_donaldson,,3323.81,3324.391,"--Yes, sir."
1992.91-1695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3360.766,3362.185,Can that be amended?
1992.91-1695,2,18833,craig_j_donaldson,,3362.185,3365.749,"Pardon, Justice White?"
1992.91-1695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3365.749,3371.362,Can the court set a file date and then change it?
1992.91-1695,2,18833,craig_j_donaldson,,3371.362,3387.483,"If it does so before the expiration of the date set, the plain language of rule 3003 says for cause shown, that the court may extend it provided that it's done before the expiration of the original period."
1992.91-1695,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3392.178,3393.537,"Thank you, Mr. Donaldson."
