1987.86-651,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,60.789,"Mr. Silberman, you may begin whenever you are ready."
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,60.789,63.907,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-651,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,309.232,316.136,"You don't say that there isn't any public policy exception, you just say it is a good deal narrower than the Fifth Circuit thought it was?"
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,316.136,317.338,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-651,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,330.663,357.796,"Mr. Silberman, if the finding had been that indeed this employee had had a marijuana cigarette out in the parking lot of the employer's premises, and had been smoking it, and the arbitrator had further concluded that he should be restored to his job, could the public policy exception apply there to justify saying, that's an improper remedy?"
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,357.796,359.832,"--Your Honor, we believe not."
1987.86-651,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,377.458,396.171,"Do you think that there conceivably could be a valid recognizable public policy to the effect that employees will not, if they are under the influence of drugs or alcohol, be allowed to work with dangerous machines?"
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,400.039,412.681,"--Certainly there could be a public policy in the sense that a legislature could say that people who have committed this wrong should not be employed in that category of jobs, and we certainly have no quarrel with the notion that there could be a public policy in that sense."
1987.86-651,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,435.379,443.985,"So that an employee, an airline pilot, who drinks, should be nevertheless allowed to fly if the arbitrator so decides?"
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,443.985,461.113,"--Fortunately, that is precise instance where there is a Federal Aviation Administration which decides are or are not entitled to fly, if there is an FAA regulation, and there is indeed a regulation covering pilots who have been using alcohol."
1987.86-651,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,498.037,521.568,"If I understand Judge Easterbrook's thesis, it is that the arbitrator does nothing but give content to the words of the contract, and if the contract, as worded by the arbitrator, would not, if it had been written that way, be contrary to law, neither is the arbitrator's decision."
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,549.235,554.02,"That's precisely how I understand Judge Easterbrook's approach, Justice Scalia."
1987.86-651,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,582.356,591.01,There is still a good deal of room between that and saying you do nothing but enforce the statutes that are on the book.
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,628.901,642.578,"--I think Judge Easterbrook does go precisely that far, and we do think that that is indeed the appropriate in the particular 301 context in which we find ourselves here."
1987.86-651,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,642.578,648.03,What if the fellow had been a truck driver and was found two or three times to have been driving while under the influence of marijuana?
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,671.645,673.228,"Yes, we do, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-651,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,701.628,712.817,"Then there really isn't any sort of public policy... room for a court's public policy determinations under 301, in your view, as there traditionally has been in the law of contracts."
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,716.971,722.707,"I would say two things in response, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1987.86-651,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,776.926,787.9,Would you adhere to your view even in circumstances when the employer might be a public employer charged with a specific mandate or duty to provide a certain service?
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,801.708,806.028,Section 301 does not apply to public employers.
1987.86-651,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,819.669,822.537,What about a school bus driver for a private school?
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,835.397,837.981,--Our answer does not change.
1987.86-651,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,878.708,883.862,"Of course, that's what common law courts did, was to occasionally substitute their judgment for the party's judgment."
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,893.217,895.419,--We say that the principle in--
1987.86-651,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,895.419,898.621,What evidence do you have that Congress thought about this?
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,898.621,902.406,"--I think what we say is slightly different than that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-651,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,964.647,969.884,Is that any different from what the law says with regard to any contract?
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,981.609,984.311,"I think the difference is this, Justice Scalia."
1987.86-651,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1084.474,1095.198,Can he adopt the public policy principle and say he will not interpret any provision of the contract to be contrary to sound public policy?
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,1098.067,1106.09,The question of what the role of the arbitrator and public law is is a complex question.
1987.86-651,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1223.583,1236.157,"Mr. Silberman, there are example in case law where courts have overturned decisions of arbitrators for a variety of reasons, including sometimes gross misjudgment."
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,1243.878,1258.304,"Certainly since this Court's decision in Enterprise Wheel, the courts have been empowered to ask, has the arbitrator gone about his job of interpreting the contract or is he substituting his own brand of industrial justice."
1987.86-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1308.467,1332.317,Do you think that your questions presented include or subsume an issue about what the arbitrator found with respect to whether the employee was actually smoking marijuana?
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,1332.317,1338.923,"I'm not quite sure I understand the question, Justice White."
1987.86-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1340.156,1344.492,"Well, the arbitrator found, in effect, there wasn't cause they hadn't proved that he was smoking marijuana."
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,1344.492,1349.861,--Because they hadn't proved either that he was smoking marijuana or that he had brought marijuana on the plant premises.
1987.86-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1351.063,1351.446,That's right.
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,1355.532,1359.169,"Well, the Court of Appeals said--"
1987.86-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1359.169,1362.454,And the only issue you've brought here is the public policy issue.
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,1362.454,1366.823,--The Court of Appeals did base its judgment precisely on the public policy issue.
1987.86-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1366.823,1368.358,"I know, and that's the only issue you bring here."
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,1368.358,1370.075,"Correct, and we--"
1987.86-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1370.075,1377.714,"Are we free to dispose of the case and say, well, the Court of Appeals really ignored what the arbitrator found?"
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,1377.714,1379.181,"--I think so, Justice White."
1987.86-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1379.75,1380.75,You think so what?
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,1380.75,1382.183,--That you are free to do so.
1987.86-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1382.183,1383.702,"Well, you didn't ask us to."
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,1383.702,1384.535,I think we did.
1987.86-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1384.535,1385.986,Not in the questions presented.
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,1385.986,1386.669,I think we did.
1987.86-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1389.355,1392.24,"Of course, I can't find the questions presented in your brief."
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,1393.873,1396.092,--I was having the same difficulty.
1987.86-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1396.092,1397.461,Exactly.
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,1397.461,1402.913,"Fortunately they are in the petition for cert., where they also should have been in ours."
1987.86-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1418.291,1420.491,But you are still just talking about public policy.
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,1433.05,1443.59,"Well, the Court of Appeals says that because of the evidence... the arbitrator also found that the company had proffered evidence of these gleanings of marijuana in the Grievant's car."
1987.86-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1443.59,1446.025,"That may be so, but the arbitrator didn't find it."
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,1446.025,1449.31,The arbitrator did acknowledge the existence of that evidence.
1987.86-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1449.31,1453.798,"No, but he didn't find that there was cause to discharge."
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,1456.014,1456.666,Correct.
1987.86-651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1466.188,1470.307,"Well, but I don't think you brought that issue here."
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,1470.307,1473.442,--I understand.
1987.86-651,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1530.298,1538.535,"Of course, Mr. Silberman, what bothers me is that there is more than just the workplace here: there is the safety of other people also."
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,1552.877,1563.435,"Justice Blackmun, we are certainly not suggesting that smoking marijuana is all right or even that a school newspaper couldn't put an article against smoking marijuana."
1987.86-651,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1578.945,1582.064,And you say the same thing about a D.C. taxicab driver?
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,1582.064,1589.836,"I think so, yes, although I would not look to the ICC for help in that regard."
1987.86-651,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1591.819,1593.288,And you'll be the next fare?
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,1593.288,1597.49,"--If I can get a cab after court this afternoon, Your Honor."
1987.86-651,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1660.063,1663.634,What I am saying is that there is somebody more than the parties involved.
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,1663.634,1677.541,"We suggest that the public authorities are also there to protect the public, and that the parties themselves are not going to agree to an irrational system like that."
1987.86-651,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1714.898,1717.266,Was that the prevailing opinion in the Black case?
1987.86-651,0,21542,david_silberman,,1717.266,1723.753,"No, that was the dissenting opinion, although I believe the opinion has prevailed in the verdict of history."
1987.86-651,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1727.557,1729.44,"Thank you, Mr. Silberman."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1731.259,1735.377,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1758.992,1765.563,Didn't the arbitrator say that there had been a failure of proof that this employee was smoking marijuana?
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1765.563,1767.182,"--He did find that, sir, but he also--"
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1767.182,1768.815,"Well, were the courts free to disregard that?"
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1768.815,1769.415,"--But, the--"
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1769.415,1770.8,Were they or not?
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1770.8,1781.525,"--The court is not free to disregard that, but the Fifth Circuit found, and the arbitrator did find that the officers found this extra quantity of marijuana in the Grievant's car."
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1782.625,1793.932,"I know, but the arbitrator didn't think that was... since the employer didn't know that, he construed the collective bargaining agreement, in effect, as not saying that this wasn't cause for discharge."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1793.932,1795.815,"--That's what the arbitrator did, Your Honor."
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1795.815,1803.271,Was the court really free to overturn that construction?
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1803.271,1811.377,"Well the problem was, that we argued in our brief to the arbitrator, that reinstatement was inappropriate because of this after discovered marijuana."
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1820.65,1821.583,As a remedy--
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1821.583,1822.769,--As a remedy problem.
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.952,1887.592,"--But the same limits don't apply to an arbitrator's judgment about what a remedy should be, as he isn't entitled to the same deference that he is when he construes the contract."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1887.592,1893.163,"No, I think the courts would give the arbitrator the same deference they would normally give him, but then you've got--"
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1893.163,1894.448,On remedy as well as--
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1894.448,1897.067,"--On remedy, and I think that Enterprise Wheel--"
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1897.067,1898.95,"--Well, they didn't give any deference here."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1898.95,1902.637,--But he didn't make a finding as to our remedy.
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1903.904,1905.337,"Well, he did: he said reinstate."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1905.337,1908.17,--But he didn't address the question in his decision.
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1908.17,1909.205,I know it.
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1914.359,1915.459,That's correct.
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1915.459,1916.726,And he ordered reinstatement.
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1916.726,1917.978,You can view it that way--
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1917.978,1918.995,And rejected your argument.
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1918.995,1920.513,--But he didn't even address our argument.
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1920.513,1922.88,"Well, he rejected it."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1924.982,1926.0,I understand what you are saying.
1987.86-651,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1926.0,1939.641,"Well, wouldn't it be more consistent with ordinary judicial review of arbitration if the Fifth Circuit felt that he had ignored a submission or ignored... to send it back to the arbitrator rather than for the Fifth Circuit to simply make the finding itself?"
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1939.641,1942.943,That has happened in some cases; I have seen cases do that.
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1960.055,1966.626,"Mr. Gear, when you say it was a blatant violation of public policy, on what facts do you conclude that it was blatant?"
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1992.074,1992.857,"No, I wouldn't."
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1992.857,1997.978,So your argument depends on the fact that there was also marijuana found in the back seat?
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1997.978,1998.428,Absolutely.
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1998.428,2002.882,And does it further require you to draw the inference from that that this employee was smoking marijuana?
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2002.882,2003.832,Yes.
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2003.832,2005.417,And that nobody has found that?
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2005.417,2013.671,"It doesn't require it, but the rule prohibited possession of marijuana in addition to smoking marijuana, so the fact that it was in his car indicated that possession--"
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2013.671,2017.059,"No, but, marijuana was found in the back seat of his car."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2021.261,2022.011,--That is correct.
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2022.011,2024.213,And he was sitting in the back seat of that car.
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2024.213,2024.763,That is correct.
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2024.763,2029.699,So which is the blatant public policy violation?
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2035.353,2036.253,I would agree.
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2036.253,2042.573,So that the asserted basis for the discharge is no longer relied on.
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2042.573,2057.081,"Because the after discovered evidence established very clearly that he was in violation of the plant rule prohibiting possession of marijuana on the premises, and that he operated the paper mill device called a slitter-rewinder that has large circular blades about the size of cymbals that are razor sharp."
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2057.081,2057.998,I understand what the equipment is.
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2065.07,2065.772,That's correct.
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2065.772,2067.487,And that's what the arbitrator rejected.
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2067.487,2068.638,That's correct.
1987.86-651,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2068.638,2081.047,Would the arbitrator automatically sustain a dismissal for violation of a plant rule even if he had considered and credited all your evidence?
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2081.047,2083.567,"He wouldn't automatically sustain one, no."
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2083.567,2085.3,He normally--
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2085.3,2098.243,"I think he would, but in this case, again, we are dealing in an industry that, in Louisiana, has the highest workman's compensation rating in terms of premium cost in the whole state."
1987.86-651,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2236.531,2258.397,--Would you say that a contract violated public policy and was unenforceable to that extent if it failed to provide for the dismissal of an employee who had marijuana on the premises in any industry?
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2258.397,2266.134,"I don't think that you can say that an employer's failure to adopt a rule is a violation of public policy, no."
1987.86-651,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2266.134,2270.537,"Well, then why is it a violation of public policy here, not to have such a rule, which is all the arbitrator said."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2275.941,2282.845,"In fact, the contract did such have a rule, but an employer can fire an employee for drug usage without having a specific rule in question."
1987.86-651,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2296.439,2308.127,"--Are you saying any factually finding that is erroneous, relating to marijuana use, by an arbitrator, is contrary to public policy?"
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2308.127,2309.179,"No, I'm not saying--"
1987.86-651,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2309.179,2313.614,I am trying to get the nub of what it is in this thing that is contrary to public policy.
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2313.614,2320.054,"--In this case, it was clear the individual was in possession of drugs on company premises."
1987.86-651,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2330.076,2333.778,"All right, but the arbitrator obviously didn't agree."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2345.42,2359.512,"Well, it's just that the clear evidence of drug usage by this individual in a safety problem industry, and his reinstatement, is against the public policy is what we believe--"
1987.86-651,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2359.512,2368.285,I suppose what you are saying is what really violated public policy was ordering him back on the job?
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2368.285,2368.918,--Absolutely.
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2368.918,2376.141,It's like his ordering a drug addict back on the job.
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2376.141,2376.491,Exactly right.
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2382.045,2393.083,And you say that the Court of Appeals was justified in relying on the evidence of marijuana in the back seat of his car to conclude that he was a drug user who should not be ordered back on the job.
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2393.083,2393.566,--Absolutely.
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2393.566,2401.672,"That just means that the Court of Appeals disagrees with the arbitrator as a fact finder, on the facts."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2401.672,2405.458,It means they disagreed with his remedy deriving from the facts that he found.
1987.86-651,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2405.458,2417.116,"Another way, what you are saying is, if the arbitrator said it for any other thing, it would have been all right, but if it's drugs, it's bad."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2417.116,2420.42,If... I have not thought about it much outside the drug concept.
1987.86-651,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2420.42,2426.574,"For example, if he had been charged with murder... for another employee it was wrong."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2427.757,2428.94,I'm not saying that.
1987.86-651,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2435.762,2441.083,Who is going to set up which crimes are against public policy or not?
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2441.083,2443.916,"I think the courts are going to have to do that, which is why we are here."
1987.86-651,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2443.916,2444.885,I take it you want us to do that?
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2444.885,2445.551,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2445.551,2447.57,"Mr. Gear, I want to be sure."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2457.193,2458.609,There was enough marijuana.
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2460.911,2462.58,"Well, the record doesn't tell us that."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2462.58,2463.363,"--I know, but the--"
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2463.363,2467.449,What the Court of Appeals said... now you want us to go beyond what the Court of Appeals found.
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2472.685,2476.32,--With marijuana residue and certainly marijuana residue can be smoked.
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2479.256,2481.308,"We don't know how much, and it could have been just a trace, couldn't it?"
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2481.308,2483.093,"--It was not just a trace, I assure you."
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2483.093,2488.98,"Well, the record that comes to us, it could have been just a trace, and is that enough for your position?"
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2493.516,2496.984,"Particularly with the background of the drug problems at this plant, I--"
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2496.984,2497.586,Well--
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2497.586,2508.978,"--The Fifth Circuit commented that de minimus is sufficient to violate the rule against possession of marijuana, particularly in a state where you have criminal laws prohibiting the possession of marijuana."
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2510.91,2531.224,"--I understand that, but it would be true that even if he went to trial, found guilty, and served his sentence and all, the public policy rule for which you contend is, that if in a dangerous industry... and I agree with you it's a dangerous industry... an employee's car is found to have contained a residue of marijuana, he must be fired."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2531.224,2532.474,I would agree with that.
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2532.474,2533.676,As a matter of public policy.
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2533.676,2535.545,I would agree with that... on the plant premises.
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2535.545,2542.449,"And even if the contract provided, we will not fire people unless we find more than six ounces of marijuana."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2553.339,2554.589,"If the contract said that, I would have difficulty--"
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2554.589,2556.208,Why?
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2559.66,2569.366,"--I understand what you are saying, but the public policy is, regardless of the small residue in his car that was found, he is probably going to do it again."
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2569.366,2570.816,Probably going to do what again?
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2570.816,2573.718,Probably going to be using marijuana on the job again.
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2574.336,2576.603,Is there any finding he ever did use marijuana on the job?
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2576.603,2577.038,--No.
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2577.038,2580.574,How can you say probably be doing it again if you don't have the first violation?
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2580.574,2586.728,"But that's obviously the basis of the policy against drug use in the workplace, the probability of continued usage."
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2593.781,2595.166,"There is not testimony he used it once, is there?"
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2595.166,2599.368,There is testimony that he was found with two and a half ounces at his home.
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2599.368,2602.237,But is there testimony that he ever used it?
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2602.237,2602.853,No.
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2602.853,2611.259,Did the Court of Appeals overturn this because they concluded that he was a drug user?
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2611.259,2613.211,I would suspect so.
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2613.211,2614.445,"Well, you suspect it."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2615.247,2630.673,They concluded that the possession of this small amount in violation of the company's rules in a safety intense industry was sufficient basis to set it aside using the public policy exception of W. R. Grace.
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2630.673,2639.362,Do you think that their finding to that effect is open here under the questions that were presented by the Petitioner?
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2643.614,2647.099,"Well, if the Petitioner didn't address it and put it before the Court, I don't think it's open."
1987.86-651,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2660.74,2663.542,Was public policy argued to the arbitrator?
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2663.542,2665.394,I argued it in my brief that--
1987.86-651,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2665.394,2667.012,To the arbitrator?
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2667.012,2667.546,--Yes.
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2672.749,2678.903,What if they found a case of beer in the back seat and a drunk passenger in the front seat?
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2682.021,2691.877,"In that industry, the safety industry, the rule against possession prohibited also the possession of whisky or alcoholic beverages on the premises, and that would have been sufficient."
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2691.877,2695.246,It would have been a mandatory discharge if he had beer in the car?
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2695.246,2695.879,Yes.
1987.86-651,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2695.879,2699.831,Including near beer?
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2699.831,2701.783,I'm not sure about near beer.
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2800.029,2801.579,"Mr. Gear, let me ask you one other question."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2806.816,2807.966,--There is a positive law--
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2807.966,2813.087,"So if you can prove drug use in the workplace, you have proved a violation not only of public policy but positive law."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2813.087,2816.456,--Louisiana statutes prohibit the possession of marijuana.
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2819.943,2824.728,So a fortiori if you've got it in possession when you're working one of these slitting machines.
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2824.728,2825.93,Then you've violated a positive law.
1987.86-651,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2825.93,2836.703,"But there's nothing... the arbitrator doesn't offend that sort of law, because if the guy is going to use marijuana, he offends it as much as if he has been fired as if he is still working."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2856.116,2857.449,"Of course not, but--"
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2857.449,2860.318,"And you don't put the employer in jail, you put him in jail."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2860.318,2870.543,"--That's correct, but we're not going to find a law in this country, to my knowledge, that says the possession of marijuana shall bar one from employment."
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2870.543,2885.385,"But ordering the employer to reinstate him, arguably... if you order an employer to put back to work, in an industry like this, a drug user, aren't you violating a federal statute about a safe workplace?"
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2885.385,2888.254,You are violating the Occupational Safety and Health Act--
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2888.254,2888.754,Exactly.
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2888.754,2889.954,--the employer's duty to--
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2889.954,2894.158,"That's the employer doing that, so you are ordering the employer to do something to public policy."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2894.158,2904.264,"--You are ordering the employer to violate the federal obligation to provide a safe workplace, and a Louisiana statute also exists imposing a duty to provide a safe workplace on the employer."
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2907.966,2910.084,"But the question is, is that what this order was?"
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2910.084,2911.953,Sir?
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2911.953,2915.905,"Is that what this order was, though, to put back to work a drug user?"
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2915.905,2933.116,"It was to put back to work an individual that was found in the back seat of a car where an amount of marijuana smoke existed, that had marijuana found on the premises of the employer's plant in violation of the company's rule, and I think it would put back to work a drug possessor or probably drug user."
1987.86-651,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2940.02,2945.941,What's really contrary to public policy here is to refuse to be persuaded by that degree of evidence that this fellow was a drug user.
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2945.941,2948.209,For the arbitrator to refuse to be persuaded?
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2953.197,2962.635,"But the Court of Appeals obviously, you say, concluded that he was a drug user, and that's why they said it was contrary to public policy."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2962.635,2964.837,They concluded that he was a drug possessor.
1987.86-651,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2966.504,2985.668,"Supposing it were a liquor... supposing the evidence shows someone saw ""x"" drinking liquor in a car, and there was liquor spilled in the back seat, and ""y"" had been sitting in the car, but there is no who actually saw ""y"" drinking liquor."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2991.655,2999.659,"No, I don't think so, but there are cases that hold, in the area particularly, that constructive possession can be based upon similar facts to that."
1987.86-651,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2999.659,3012.418,"It's a bit of a jump first from use, then to possession, then to constructive possession."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,3014.001,3018.489,I don't think so.
1987.86-651,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3032.03,3041.504,"Well, it is one thing to uphold a conviction based upon a conclusion to that effect by the finder of fact, but it is another thing to say the finder of fact must draw that inference."
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,3041.504,3043.504,I would agree.
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3058.664,3065.286,"And the Court of Appeals said that, based on that evidence, the remedy was inappropriate--"
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,3065.286,3065.803,That's correct.
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3065.803,3074.226,--because it was contrary to public policy to order back to work anybody whose car contains traces of marijuana.
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,3074.226,3075.276,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3198.373,3201.242,"Mr. Gear, isn't there another protection that is available?"
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,3209.228,3223.036,"They can bargain for a provision, or they can just implement work rules if they have the authority under the contract to do so, that says that the discharge of an individual for possession of marijuana is a dischargeable--"
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3223.036,3234.009,The arbitrator could have interpreted the word cause in this case as including finding marijuana in somebody's car on the premises.
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,3234.009,3236.961,"--Well, he could have, but he didn't accept that evidence."
1987.86-651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3236.961,3240.013,But he could have without any rule or anything else.
1987.86-651,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,3240.013,3257.042,"He had the view that the employer has to know exactly every piece of evidence in support of the discharge at the moment of the discharge, and would not receive the corroborating evidence which we found just a week before the arbitration hearing by going through the police records that this fellow had in fact some marijuana in his car."
