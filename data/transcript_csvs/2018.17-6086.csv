2018.17-6086,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,15.72,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-6086, Gundy versus the United States. Ms. Baumgartel."
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,15.72,36.84,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: SORNA's delegation provision grants unguided power to the nation's top prosecutor to expand the scope of criminal laws and to impose burdensome, sometimes lifetime registration requirements on hundreds of thousands of individuals."
2018.17-6086,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,71.48,81.36,"Well, the government says that they do have a standard and it's the -- apply the prohibition or the requirements in the law to the maximum extent feasible."
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,81.36,87.92,"Your Honor, that language does not appear anywhere in the statutory text, nor can it be derived from the sources that the government cites."
2018.17-6086,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,87.92,105.68,"What about the list that's contained in, what is it, 20901, the -- the list of past offenders? On your view, none of those people would be required to register?"
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,105.68,121.76,"That's not correct. So one important thing about this case is that every -- every state had an existing sex offender registration system prior to SORNA's enactment, and those registration systems would remain in effect regardless of whether SORNA existed or not."
2018.17-6086,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,143.84,154.6,"But they would be -- they would not come under the federal registration system, which was the purpose of SORNA to create."
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,163.12,171.68,"Well, as -- as this Court held in Reynolds, the Congress left it to the Attorney General to determine whether SORNA would apply retroactively at all."
2018.17-6086,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,225.0,238.68,"Well, suppose the -- the statute said that the Attorney General shall have the authority to determine the application of this subchapter to pre-enactment offenders as public safety and fairness requires."
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,243.32,251.44,"Yes, Your Honor. Given the subject matter of this delegation, Congress needs to provide more guidance than something along the lines of ""in the public interest."" And --"
2018.17-6086,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,251.44,274.64,"What about the most famous regulation, that I think people in this room would imagine, Rule 10b-5? I mean, Rule 10b-5 is promulgated under a statute that says the SEC can forbid the use of any manipulative device -- that's like the sex offender part -- in contravention of such rules as are appropriate in the public interest."
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,274.64,276.68,So there are -- there are a few distinctions.
2018.17-6086,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,296.04,303.4,Is it only the Attorney General who falls within the rule that -- falls within your argument?
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,303.4,305.92,That's something that exacerbates this delegation.
2018.17-6086,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,305.92,312.08,"No, but -- but I'm -- look, the SEC has a rule such as we know, 10b-5, the word is the public interest."
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,335.84,337.92,"Your Honor, it's not an especially harsh rule."
2018.17-6086,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,339.48,340.84,Your especially strict rule.
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,340.84,345.6,-- some more specific congressional guidance when this power is delegated.
2018.17-6086,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,346.44,358.28,"Sorry, you're answering Justice Breyer yes, that all 300,000 of those -- whatever the number is, of those delegations are wrong?"
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,358.28,360.32,"No, that's absolutely not our position."
2018.17-6086,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,360.32,368.84,So what distinguishes those -- that delegation or those delegations from the example that Justice Alito gave you?
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,368.84,378.88,"So, in each of the prior delegations that this Court has upheld, there has actually been some standard in the delegation provision, even if it was what the Court might consider to be a broad standard."
2018.17-6086,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,378.88,380.44,But there are standards here.
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,418.2,425.52,But none of those very detailed provisions of SORNA that Congress set forth apply to pre-Act offenders.
2018.17-6086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,432.36,457.96,"Well, that gets back to the question that the Chief Justice started with, because it seems that there is some language in the statute that supports the government's reading, that this is a statute that basically says register all pre-Act offenders as far as possible, with some understanding that there are feasibility considerations that may make immediate registration of everybody impossible."
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,511.76,514.36,So there -- there are a few problems with reading it that way.
2018.17-6086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,526.4,529.52,From the legislative act itself meaning only from the delegation provision?
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,529.52,531.76,From -- so from the legislative act.
2018.17-6086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,532.36,533.84,"Well, this is the legislative act."
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,535.84,536.44,That's right.
2018.17-6086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,550.4,564.44,"Well, but when we are thinking about non-delegation, it's essentially a statutory interpretation question, which it seems should be governed by the same rules of statutory interpretation that we use elsewhere. And we never look only to one provision."
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,586.08,599.64,"So, Your Honor, I -- I agree 100 percent with you that this could be a statutory interpretation issue, but we would prevail under that. The problem with the government's statutory interpretation argument is that the delegation provision here is not ambiguous."
2018.17-6086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,620.52,662.2,"He -- he was dissenting, but nine Justices in Reynolds all had the same view of this statute, which is that this statute demanded comprehensiveness in the registration of pre-Act sex offenders. In other words, both in the majority and in the dissent, this was the one point in common, that they said this statute was designed for something and this statute did something, that it insisted that ""sex offender"" should be read broadly to include any individual who was convicted of a sex offense and that all those people should be registered, you know, with some feasibility recognition."
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,662.2,672.28,"So I'd like to address both comprehensiveness and the definition of ""sex offender"" while also noting that, of course, if Congress had actually wanted that construction, it would have been very easy for it to simply say that."
2018.17-6086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,672.52,674.16,"Well, but nine of us said it."
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,674.16,674.56,The preamble --
2018.17-6086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,674.56,677.16,"Were we all wrong, every single one of us?"
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,677.16,694.48,"Your Honor, I -- I don't believe that's what Reynolds says, but just with respect, because comprehensive is coming up so many times, the preamble states that it is a comprehensive national registration system. In the same way that the National Gallery is a comprehensive art museum, that doesn't mean that it has every painting that has ever been made."
2018.17-6086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,749.68,751.12,I guess I have --
2018.17-6086,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,751.12,751.4,I guess --
2018.17-6086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,751.4,752.88,-- two quick -- I'm sorry.
2018.17-6086,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,752.88,763.68,"Well, I guess where I get stuck on -- on the preamble argument is that normally we -- we, when we're doing statutory interpretation, prefer the more specific statutory provision over the more general."
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,779.4,780.52,Yes.
2018.17-6086,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,780.52,803.92,How do people even know who is going to be included in this class until they hear from the Attorney General? And I -- I'm having trouble thinking of another delegation in which this Court has ever allowed the chief prosecutor of the United States to write the criminal law for those he's going to prosecute. We say that vague criminal laws must be stricken.
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,811.92,813.52,Yes.
2018.17-6086,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,813.52,818.24,"That's your argument stated very, very concisely."
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,818.24,820.88,I'll cede my time. (Laughter.)
2018.17-6086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,820.88,824.84,"Well, then I'll take back my time. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-6086,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,824.84,835.12,"Well, suppose what this was -- what was at stake here was civil liability rather than -- suppose what was at stake here was civil liability rather than criminal liability."
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,836.6,839.68,That would -- that would certainly be a much closer case.
2018.17-6086,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,878.92,897.36,"So if you compare what we have before us with the statute that says -- gives or authorizes the Attorney General to devise a rule to protect public safety, feasibility, and consideration of individual rights, that's the difference between a improper delegation and a proper delegation?"
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,897.36,899.32,Perhaps.
2018.17-6086,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,899.88,901.96,In the civil context. Let's start there.
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,901.96,904.44,"Certainly, the Congressional guidance is the difference."
2018.17-6086,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,926.08,942.0,"Do you think the Attorney General could, in that retroactivity, have a different set of offenders than the text of FORNA -- SORNA itself, have different requirements for where and when the registration is to occur?"
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,942.0,943.4,Yes.
2018.17-6086,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,976.44,989.6,What -- what if the Act said that it applies to pre-Act offenders and there was a provision saying the Attorney General may waive the requirements of this Act when he determines that it's not feasible to apply them?
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,989.6,989.96,Yeah --
2018.17-6086,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,989.96,997.72,"And the Attorney General says, you know, I don't think it's feasible to apply this to pre-Act offenders, so I waive the Act with respect to pre-Act offenders."
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,999.24,1017.92,"So if -- if the Act said this -- Congress determines that this should apply to pre-Act offenders and then gave the Attorney General a limited power to grant exemptions, something which is basically the opposite of what this as written does, that would likely be constitutional, particularly if the -- if Congress provided some guidance around where --"
2018.17-6086,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1017.92,1026.76,Even though the consequences are the same -- the consequences are the same with respect to whether or -- who's making the decision about whether the criminal laws should apply to whom?
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,1026.76,1029.04,"Respectfully, the -- the consequences are not the same."
2018.17-6086,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1040.88,1041.84,"Well, let's say it isn't."
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,1049.48,1085.4,"Even -- even if, that would still be much closer to being constitutional because Congress has made the initial decision and has afforded the Attorney General a power that is something more akin to traditional prosecutorial discretion. It's not the same, but this was the point that Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Ginsburg, made in dissent in Reynolds, which is that that is much -- that seems closer to being constitutional because the power that the Attorney General has is closer to a traditional clemency or prosecutorial discretion power. In this case, however, the -- the statute is truly worded in the opposite fashion."
2018.17-6086,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1094.28,1107.08,Don't we routinely read into statute limitations in order to save its constitutionality?
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,1107.08,1107.88,Yes.
2018.17-6086,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1107.88,1109.64,We do do that routinely.
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,1127.36,1130.36,So there are three reasons.
2018.17-6086,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1178.48,1181.0,Can we go back to -- mention your third.
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,1213.88,1221.44,The intelligible principle cannot be the Court's speculation about what Congress thinks the Attorney General might do.
2018.17-6086,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1221.44,1224.44,But we're speculating from the Act itself.
2018.17-6086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1224.44,1226.92,It's not speculating. It's interpreting.
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,1243.84,1259.88,"No, I don't agree. And so if the -- my friend uses different formulations of their interpretation. Sometimes it's to the maximum extent feasible. Sometimes it's to the extent feasible. Sometimes it's to the extent practicable. And I would argue that there is -- there are differences there."
2018.17-6086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1259.88,1274.6,"Let's -- let's call it, which is, I think, consistent with what Reynolds said, to the maximum extent feasible. In other words, what the Act is telling the AG is go register pre-Act offenders, except if you find it unfeasible."
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,1274.6,1278.48,"I -- again, that's -- that's nowhere in the statute, and --"
2018.17-6086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1278.48,1280.16,"Yeah, I -- I understand that you think that."
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,1286.96,1312.0,"That likely would be constitutional if you could read into the statute a command to the Attorney General to register pre-Act offenders to the maximum extent feasible, although, you know, as Justice Rehnquist articulated in Industrial Union, the benzene case, there is still a question about what feasibility means. And in this context particularly, because these are not -- this is not a technical scientific area."
2018.17-6086,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1329.04,1358.16,"Are we supposed to do that -- are we supposed to, in your opinion, start distinguishing among the 300,000 and say, well, you have a weak standard if all that's at interest is the cost of pollution or something, but you have to have a strong standard where, in fact, it's what you said, liberty and so on, and a medium standard perhaps for the SEC? I don't -- I don't know what we do about the SEC. And there are 300,000, approximately. Maybe there are only 200,000."
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,1362.84,1364.4,"Yes, and the -- the Court in American --"
2018.17-6086,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1364.4,1366.24,"Yes, all right, 300,000."
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,1366.24,1368.88,"I should -- Your Honor, I should -- I'm not conceding the 300,000."
2018.17-6086,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1368.88,1370.96,"No, I wouldn't either. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,1370.96,1378.88,"But this is -- this is what the Court said in American Trucking v. Whitman, that the amount of guidance required depends on the scope of the delegated power."
2018.17-6086,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1378.88,1379.2,Okay.
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,1393.44,1396.28,"Your Honor, the question is not a matter of tough versus --"
2018.17-6086,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1396.28,1407.56,"No, you see what I mean, categories where Congress can delegate with an SEC-type standard or the standard here in categories where Congress has to be more specific."
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,1407.56,1407.92,The --
2018.17-6086,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1407.92,1411.28,What -- what in your opinion are the right categories?
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,1411.28,1417.24,The -- so the factors about SORNA that are critical include the fact that it contemplates criminal sanctions.
2018.17-6086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1426.2,1470.68,"But are -- isn't that all over the place we have confronted delegation challenges to civil regulations whose violation will result in criminal sanctions? So, I mean, there are numerous of those cases, but I'll just give you three: Kollock is like that, Grimaud is like that, Avent is like that. So these are all places where the delegation is to a civil regulation, as it is here, but if you violate that regulation that some secretary or attorney general or whatever has written, you're going to face criminal sanctions. So what's the difference between this case and all those other cases where we said that's -- you know, that's -- criminal sanctions is not what matters?"
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,1470.68,1475.72,"Well, Kollock is the perfect example because this is very different than oleomargarine label."
2018.17-6086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1477.6,1490.12,"You know, you can say that, and it's easy to make fun of oleomargarine labels, but the person who violated that provision was going to go to prison in the same way that the person who violates this provision is going to go to prison."
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,1490.12,1491.44,"It's not making fun, Your Honor."
2018.17-6086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1506.56,1523.96,"The point I was making is that all of these are civil regulations. The delegation is to say you write the -- we're going to give you some degree of discretion to write the civil regulation, understanding that if somebody violates that, that person is going to jail."
2018.17-6086,0,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,1523.96,1542.76,"Your Honor, may I answer your question and then reserve the remainder of my time? Just the -- the question is always the nature and significance of the delegated power, and it -- it is perfectly fine for Congress to permit agencies to fill in the details or otherwise implement statutes, but not to make these sorts of fundamental policy choices. Thank you."
2018.17-6086,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1542.76,1546.84,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wall."
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1546.84,1558.64,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I wanted to start this morning where Justices Ginsburg and Kagan did, with the text of the Act, because I do think it is best interpreted in the way that we have said."
2018.17-6086,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1627.56,1630.52,"Well, let's take one of the items you just mentioned, comprehensive."
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1645.72,1646.0,Oh --
2018.17-6086,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1646.0,1646.76,It's comprehensive.
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1651.04,1658.8,"Oh, it -- it's certainly true that Congress made certain legislative judgments about what sex offenses would qualify, how long people would have to register for."
2018.17-6086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1684.24,1684.8,"But, Mr. Wall --"
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1684.8,1685.04,-- to get them in.
2018.17-6086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1686.32,1689.16,-- you didn't -- the government didn't make that argument in Reynolds.
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1742.96,1749.36,"Well, the Attorney General has never changed his or her mind with respect to the registration duty for individuals, but -- but to go squarely to the question --"
2018.17-6086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1749.36,1750.68,There have been changes in --
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1750.68,1754.16,Only with respect to the state's obligations to go out and find offenders --
2018.17-6086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1754.16,1754.68,All right.
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1754.68,1758.88,-- not with the individual duty on offenders to come forward and present themselves and register.
2018.17-6086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1758.88,1763.24,"Attorney General Holder changed the guidance provided by -- by the prior Attorney General, correct?"
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1763.24,1766.68,He narrowed the states' obligations to give the states a little more breathing room.
2018.17-6086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1801.0,1801.32,Mr. Wall --
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1801.32,1803.84,-- everybody was working off of that page in Reynolds.
2018.17-6086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1803.84,1808.96,-- your -- your brief in Reynolds is very important to me.
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1828.6,1833.2,"Oh, that's -- to be clear, Justice Sotomayor, that's exactly the same position I'm taking here today."
2018.17-6086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1834.24,1836.56,"No, you're adding in a caveat."
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1842.48,1842.56,No.
2018.17-6086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1858.52,1859.4,Now you're reading to get them in.
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1860.08,1860.32,Well --
2018.17-6086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1860.32,1866.32,I understand Justice Gorsuch's point that you said he could turn it on and off as he decided.
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1866.32,1866.64,Yes.
2018.17-6086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1908.56,1908.88,What do you say --
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1908.88,1909.96,And all it said to the Attorney --
2018.17-6086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1909.96,1930.72,"-- about the ACLU's argument on that score that, under your view, that Congress could have simply enacted a statute with respect to post-enactment offenders that mirrored the language of (d) and said, well, it's up to the Attorney General to come up with a comprehensive and feasible registration regime in the public interest? You'd be here defending that, wouldn't you?"
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1930.72,1933.6,"Justice Gorsuch, it would be a much broader delegation."
2018.17-6086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1938.76,1942.4,Why? What's the difference? A half a million people are affected by this delegation.
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1942.4,1964.04,"Yes, if Congress found there are real practical problems with applying it even going forward, here is our general policy to the Attorney General, I don't know that it would be importantly different from saying to the Attorney General in Touby which drugs will be controlled substances under the Act, or -- or in Union Bridge, which obstruct -- which bridges will we think obstruct the rivers, or in Grimaud, who will be allowed to graze on federal land?"
2018.17-6086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1964.04,1973.68,"Could you answer my question? Would you be here defending a statute that mimicked (d) with respect to post-enactment offenders, and in -- in -- in which case why does Congress bother to legislate SORNA at all?"
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1973.68,1981.2,"It's very difficult to know in that situation, Justice Gorsuch, what the equivalent practical problems would be for why Congress didn't apply it."
2018.17-6086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1981.2,1982.4,So you might defend that statute too?
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1982.4,1984.68,"No, I -- I -- I -- what I'm saying is I -- I don't know."
2018.17-6086,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2004.08,2015.24,"Mr. Wall, can you tell me how -- how this retroactivity works? So let's take somebody who was convicted of a sex offense 30 years ago."
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2028.92,2037.48,"So he's -- he's only required to register if he's a Tier III offender, so if he's got a really grave sex offense like Petitioner --"
2018.17-6086,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2037.48,2041.04,"Yes, but let's say he is such an offender, but it was 30 years ago."
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2041.04,2042.28,Yes.
2018.17-6086,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2055.24,2075.84,"So he's a -- he has to know what the Attorney General's regulation is? There's no notice given to these people. They can be charged with -- with failure to register, even though nobody -- no one ever gave them notice that they had to register?"
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2075.84,2079.28,I suppose you could try to bring an as-applied due process challenge.
2018.17-6086,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2120.4,2144.52,"Do you think that if there were a new attorney general who came in and said, you know, I think that this registration stuff has just gone overboard, and I'm going to start making some exceptions with respect to pre-Act offenders, because I think it's just unfair to penalize them for the rest of their lives, could the attorney general do that?"
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2144.52,2159.12,"No, we don't think the attorney general could make judgments on the basis, other than feasibility, and disagree with Congress's policy judgments. And if the Court had any doubt about that, it should construe the statute more narrowly, in the way I think is the most reasonable interpretation, so as to avoid the constitutional problem."
2018.17-6086,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2159.12,2168.52,"And when you say the Attorney General could -- tell me what you think the Attorney General cannot do, given the language of this statute and given the language of Reynolds."
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2168.52,2183.72,"So I don't think the Attorney General could say: Look, I know Congress set up three tiers with registration links of 15, 25 years, and life, but I'm going to require you to register, but only for a few years. It's perfectly feasible."
2018.17-6086,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2190.68,2191.24,Is -- is --
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2191.24,2193.28,I don't think the Attorney General could do that.
2018.17-6086,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2193.28,2205.08,I'm -- I'm trying to think of -- I think Ms. Baumgartel was trying to make a point that in my mind is something like this: That the executive branch has many different functions.
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2271.56,2282.92,"So I do think that plays itself out in certain rules, like not deferring to the executive in the interpretation of criminal statutes, but the Court's considered that argument twice in the non-delegation context and rejected it both times."
2018.17-6086,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2282.92,2283.52,What -- which --
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2283.52,2285.4,"In Touby, they made exactly the same argument."
2018.17-6086,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2329.52,2331.04,"That -- those are the standards, quite right."
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2331.04,2332.0,-- fixed the punishment --
2018.17-6086,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2332.0,2332.96,But suppose you put --
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2332.96,2334.68,-- and given the executive the authority.
2018.17-6086,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2334.68,2336.76,"No, I -- I see where you're going there."
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2362.04,2391.8,"Justice Breyer, I just think the non-delegation context is a very odd one in which to try to cache that out, as opposed to -- to vagueness or -- or due process, because it's asking whether Congress has made the basic policy judgments that can inform the executive's exercise of power. And, boy, if -- if the executive can define the availability of the death penalty in Loving and Mistretta, here, it seems well withinside that to say, look, this is a civil requirement; yes, there are criminal penalties that could potentially attach."
2018.17-6086,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2406.72,2445.16,"Well, this is -- this is different in the sense that the Attorney General is deciding what law applies, not whether a particular act or a particular exercise in commercial activity is covered by an Act that certainly applies in a general sense. I mean, it's not this -- in those instances, even in -- in -- in Touby, it's -- it's exercising fairly refined authority with respect to what activity is covered. Here, it's just saying are you going to be -- it's not just covered by a law; does the law even apply to you?"
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2445.16,2445.28,Well --
2018.17-6086,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2445.28,2449.36,And it seems to me that those -- that -- that's a substantive difference.
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2449.36,2451.76,"I don't -- I don't know, Mr. Chief Justice."
2018.17-6086,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2472.96,2475.28,"Well, but it's -- the bridges, yes."
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2492.28,2504.2,"I -- I understand if SORNA didn't have the kind of guidance that it had here, if it hadn't defined the criminal offense, if it hadn't fixed the punishment, if it hadn't set a reticulated scheme on the civil side."
2018.17-6086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2583.24,2587.44,"Well, Mr. Wall, I -- I want to develop a little bit what Justice Breyer was after."
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2628.8,2633.68,"Justice Gorsuch, I -- I -- I don't think the Court needs to cross that bridge here."
2018.17-6086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2633.68,2636.6,I understand that. I'm asking you to answer that question.
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2636.6,2638.68,I -- and I want to -- I want to try to.
2018.17-6086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2675.92,2676.04,No.
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2679.28,2684.84,"I think, as -- as long as it's done the things it did here, it's created the crime, it's defined the elements --"
2018.17-6086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2684.84,2685.16,Those would be okay?
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2685.16,2694.76,"-- it's fixed the penalty. And then, on the civil side, it has said, and you provided some standard like that in the statute, the Court's cases indicate that's enough."
2018.17-6086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2709.32,2709.96,Is it a right --
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2709.96,2718.96,"Reading the statute, Congress made a lot of those judgments for itself and left to the Attorney General a much narrower practical problem."
2018.17-6086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2718.96,2772.32,"There's a lot of discussion in our case law about the propriety of the Court reading into statute words, and I think a fundamental issue that Justice Gorsuch has been aiming at is, especially in criminal law, is it just to delegate to the Attorney General a fundamental decision about who gets covered or doesn't get covered by a statute? That seems like -- it seems like at the core of what a law is, if someone does X act, you're covered or you're not. And if Congress had said that, we probably wouldn't have found a retroactivity problem."
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2790.56,2792.56,"So two separate points, Justice Sotomayor."
2018.17-6086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2792.56,2794.6,Or who might be a criminal because of their acts?
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2794.6,2807.0,"Two separate points. First, if Congress had given the same authority to the Attorney General and not otherwise expressed any intention with respect to how that authority would be exercised, I'll grant that would be --"
2018.17-6086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2807.0,2811.24,There's no plain words that add maximum feasibility --
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2811.24,2811.52,So --
2018.17-6086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2811.52,2812.52,-- in this statute.
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2816.56,2818.48,"I am, Justice Sotomayor. And that's my second point."
2018.17-6086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2866.8,2867.48,If you take out --
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2867.48,2869.92,-- and it was just a practical problem of how to accomplish that.
2018.17-6086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2869.92,2880.68,"-- if you take out legislative history and you take out policy statements, because there are some of my colleagues who don't rely on either of those two things, what's left?"
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2880.68,2905.0,"I would say the findings in 20901, the statement of express statutory purpose, which this Court has relied on in cases like NBC and New York Central for a comprehensive national system, the inclusive definition of ""sex offender,"" the broad registration requirement in 2913(a), and then the text and title of 913(d), which say that this grant of authority was about addressing the inability to comply."
2018.17-6086,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2948.12,2956.24,"The part that's still gnawing at me, I mean, your basic argument is there is a standard here, that's the end of the case."
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3025.08,3025.6,Right.
2018.17-6086,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3025.6,3030.48,Does that matter? Should it matter? Should we suggest in the opinion that it might matter?
2018.17-6086,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3030.48,3043.96,"So, to the extent it matters, here's what I think you could say in the opinion. If the executive official, the Attorney General, were defining the elements of the offense or defining the criminal punishment, that would raise the Touby question."
2018.17-6086,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3185.32,3190.56,"Thank you, Mr. Wall. Ms. Baumgartel, you have four minutes remaining."
2018.17-6086,2,63032,sarah_baumgartel,,3190.56,3255.68,"Thank you. Just to pick up where my friend left off, I want to emphasize that prior to SORNA's enactment, every single state had an existing sex offender registry and those will continue to exist and to require the registration of offenders, regardless of what happens with Individuals like Petitioner were required to register under existing state law, and they will still be required to register. This was a law whose retroactive application was opposed by the states, which is part of the reason why only 18 states have implemented it. States spoke out against the retroactive application of the law before the Attorney General made his determination. And so states themselves, who are the experts in this area having run registration systems for years, don't want this Act to be fully retroactive. My friend emphasized that this delegation was all about practicality, but the reality is, is that the Attorney General's promulgated rule does not account for practicality in any way, which is further evidence for this Court that to the extent feasible was not the standard of this delegation. That is not the standard that exists in the text."
2018.17-6086,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3325.48,3326.76,"Thank you, counsel."
