2006.06-427,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.056,"We'll hear argument first today in 06-427, Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association versus Brentwood Academy."
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,11.964,15.399,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-427,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,81.652,84.26,"May I ask you a preliminary question, Ms. Mahoney?"
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,136.6,151.406,"Your Honor, actually the record indicates that it would be permissible to give the information about the date for the spring practice to the students who had signed an enrollment contract."
2006.06-427,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,222.113,225.516,"So in speech terms, there were alternative means to get the message out."
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,225.516,226.359,Absolutely.
2006.06-427,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,247.506,254.272,"I think the briefs are... I think it's fair to characterize the Respondent's brief this way, or fair to concentrate on Pickering."
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,273.184,281.4,"--Your Honor, I think Pickering is really an example of an unconstitutional conditions analysis just in the employment context."
2006.06-427,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,308.186,320.883,"In Umbehr we said, the Court said, that in the independent contractor cases the interests of either party, the government or the contractor, are not quite so intense as they are with a public employee."
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,325.32,337.955,"Well, and in fact this Court said in Umbehr that, even though the interests were what different, the standards that had been applied in Connick and Pickering could easily accommodate the circumstances of dealing with--"
2006.06-427,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,337.955,343.11,"Well, I suppose we could construct a hypothetical where we could say there's a very strong interest in the contractor."
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,346.421,371.316,"--But I think that the key from all the cases, whether we look at Cornelius, which involves your access to the charitable campaign, or if we look at or if we look at Lusk and American Library, which involved access to funding, or Grove, access to funding, that the strain across these cases is that you're really looking at is the restriction germane."
2006.06-427,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,372.395,383.248,"What about if, what if the association had a rule that members, school officials, shall not criticize the decisions of the association?"
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,383.248,385.03,--I think then it would be--
2006.06-427,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,385.03,385.717,It's germane.
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,394.556,401.727,"--I think that would probably be viewed as speech of public concern, and at that point under Connick balancing you'd have--"
2006.06-427,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,401.727,404.551,There's no more public concern about when spring practice is.
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,414.347,425.452,"--Your Honor, in Connick this Court said that in assessing whether something is a issue of public concern you look at not just the topic, but also the way in which that topic is discussed."
2006.06-427,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,448.786,451.47,What about criticizing officials?
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,451.47,453.189,"--On the field, Your Honor?"
2006.06-427,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,466.717,476.82,"No, I mean three days later, you know, the school... the coach writes an editorial saying there were lousy calls in the game last week."
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,476.82,482.646,"I think that would probably be treated as speech of public concern, which would then give rise to Connick balancing."
2006.06-427,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,482.646,484.178,And how would you balance it?
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,484.178,488.722,"What Connick says is you look at how core is the speech, what's it about?"
2006.06-427,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,488.722,490.129,And how would you commence?
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,490.129,502.0,"Probably find that that not be a reasonable restriction, that it's probably not germane to the important educational goals of the association."
2006.06-427,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,517.601,522.222,"Ms. Mahoney, on that point, can I just take you back to square one for a second?"
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,587.165,601.176,"First, I think that this letter, which was not sent to Brentwood's own eighth grade middle school students, probably could have been, because under the rule those students were not enrolled at another school."
2006.06-427,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,614.215,615.264,"Okay, so they had signed up to go to Brentwood."
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,617.015,620.279,"--Your Honor, the contracts weren't binding."
2006.06-427,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,665.026,673.585,"So it boils down to saying that when they've signed the enrollment contract that's not the end of the, in effect, the issue."
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,673.585,674.038,--No.
2006.06-427,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,674.038,680.955,And there is a sensible practical way in which recruiting goes on even among those who have signed up.
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,681.657,683.518,"It certainly could, and so there's an interest in stopping that."
2006.06-427,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,704.868,709.181,And what is the interest behind the anti-recruiting rule?
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,709.181,710.382,"Several, Your Honor."
2006.06-427,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,730.28,737.136,They could have determined that it's particularly harmful to the public schools who don't have the option of recruiting while the private schools do?
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,737.136,747.993,"--Well, Your Honor, in 1997 there were five violations, five penalties for violations of the recruiting rule, and four of them were against public schools, one against a private school."
2006.06-427,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,755.238,761.784,Could the association bar Brentwood from contacting public school students altogether?
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,761.784,764.514,About anything?
2006.06-427,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,765.934,766.714,About enrollment.
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,766.714,775.445,"--I think, Your Honor, that it would be hard to say that that is germane, and it would also put a very large burden on speech if they imposed a flat contact."
2006.06-427,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,777.71,791.078,"Well, like if Brentwood, let's assume... I think it's true... is rather well-known in the State, and if they send you a solicitation form to enroll, everybody knows they've got a great athletic program, so we say you can't solicit any high school students."
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,791.078,793.859,--I think that they haven't done it.
2006.06-427,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,829.749,834.734,"I haven't kept track of your time, but if we're going to rule for you we have to reach the due process problem."
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,842.824,865.235,"Your Honor, if I could just... one thing I do want to make clear about the voluntariness of the choice and then I'll turn to due process, is that, as we set out in our brief, one of the things that Brentwood and some of its amici have tried to say is that there simply is no ability to play scholastic sports in Tennessee if you're not a member of this association."
2006.06-427,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,889.415,893.584,"But then that's part of the trophy, whatever it is when you win at the end of the year."
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,893.584,894.302,"That's right, Your Honor."
2006.06-427,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,903.941,904.69,Is there any other?
2006.06-427,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,904.69,906.016,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-427,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,979.404,980.593,"Thank you, Ms. Mahoney."
2006.06-427,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,990.261,996.024,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1267.943,1271.566,"May I ask this, what is your response to the, one of your earlier questions."
2006.06-427,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1285.229,1291.075,"I think that would be close to the line, Justice Stevens."
2006.06-427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1298.617,1301.913,But isn't the coach recruiting just a subcategory of a broader--
2006.06-427,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1301.913,1303.024,--No.
2006.06-427,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1322.169,1324.732,I'm sorry; you think it might be a reasonable or unreasonable?
2006.06-427,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1324.732,1328.994,"--It might be... well, I think it's close enough to the line that it could go either way."
2006.06-427,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1328.994,1338.302,It's a close call whether a school can send a brochure to 8th graders that is not limited to athletics telling them about their school?
2006.06-427,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1338.302,1346.035,"Well, the... in that situation, I think... I think it probably would be unreasonable, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.06-427,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1374.368,1387.83,"What if the mailing was limited to people who had signed contracts with... students, not just football players but everyone who else had signed enrollment contracts with the school?"
2006.06-427,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1396.295,1397.059,--I think--
2006.06-427,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1397.059,1401.185,Or would it be unreasonable for the TSSAA to prohibit that?
2006.06-427,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1401.185,1404.169,--I think that would be much more problematic.
2006.06-427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1443.308,1444.902,--I'm not asking you about the school for the rule.
2006.06-427,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1448.338,1448.869,--Right.
2006.06-427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1455.709,1460.131,You do agree at some point the First Amendment would prohibit some kind of rule.
2006.06-427,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1460.131,1460.521,--Of course.
2006.06-427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1475.156,1483.714,"Is that permissible, in weighing the... both sides of the equation to consider the advantages... I mean the justifications for the speech?"
2006.06-427,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1483.714,1486.619,--Sure.
2006.06-427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1501.442,1510.033,--justification for the rule in this case and the justification for the rule that would prohibit the general solicitation I described.
2006.06-427,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1510.033,1511.453,--I'm sorry?
2006.06-427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1511.453,1517.217,"Is it the same justification, but the justification is a little stronger in one hypo than the other?"
2006.06-427,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1517.217,1517.685,Right.
2006.06-427,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1532.303,1546.314,"It seems to me that, turning to the state action for a moment, one of the justifications for finding state action that is there is no other real choice, that they have, other than to... if they want to play athletics in Tennessee other than to join this association."
2006.06-427,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1557.198,1559.932,"Well, no, I don't think so, Justice Kennedy."
2006.06-427,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1592.465,1603.509,"But that's somewhat inconsistent with one of the most forceful arguments for finding state action to begin it, i.e., that you have to join the school if you really want to compete with most of the schools."
2006.06-427,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1604.71,1608.601,"Well, I think... I'm not sure that's true, Justice Kennedy."
2006.06-427,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1624.187,1625.252,"Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb."
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1626.812,1643.557,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-427,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1688.942,1690.833,Did it serve the suspension or has that been stayed?
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1694.971,1695.72,Yes.
2006.06-427,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1695.72,1696.831,Did it... did that take effect?
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1696.831,1698.453,The first year it did take effect--
2006.06-427,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1698.453,1699.077,One year--
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1699.077,1701.264,"--And the second year did not take effect, Justice Kennedy."
2006.06-427,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1701.264,1704.123,And the fine has not been paid.
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1705.62,1706.108,Not yet.
2006.06-427,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1715.665,1719.507,"Mr. Blumstein, there's one feature of this that I find puzzling."
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1765.832,1773.592,"Justice Ginsburg, let me say that there's a finding, a stipulation that the school thought it was abiding by the rule."
2006.06-427,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1777.719,1796.663,"But isn't part of what you agree to is a organization that has a certain governance structure, the people in the organization decide, and then make public to all the members of the association what the rules are and how they're going to be interpreted?"
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1796.663,1808.657,"Well, Your Honor, let me first address, in... in the appendix to our brief is a two page... a two-sentence letter from Joe Marley to Brentwood Academy."
2006.06-427,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1867.259,1882.861,"Mr. Blumstein, am I not correct for purposes of our decision, if you're claiming constitutional protection, you're claiming that you'd be constitutionally protected even if you knew in advance that this particular communication would violate the rule and even if you did it deliberately?"
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1885.111,1889.72,"Well, our... Your Honor, the significance of the voluntariness--"
2006.06-427,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1889.72,1890.671,Is it or is it not?
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1890.671,1891.486,--Yes.
2006.06-427,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1891.486,1892.875,It is.
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1893.483,1892.875,Yes.
2006.06-427,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1894.06,1901.715,"So that what really, you're... it is sort of a side issue as to whether they really had adequate notice and so forth, insofar as we're talking about the First Amendment?"
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1901.715,1904.195,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-427,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1922.955,1934.498,"What if the state set up two athletic leagues and one had an anti-recruiting rule and the other didn't, and they were equally strong, and you chose to join the one that had the anti-recruiting league."
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1938.199,1939.244,And both are governmental?
2006.06-427,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1940.963,1942.024,"Yes, both are governmental."
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1942.024,1967.313,"Well, I think if a private party subjects itself voluntary, voluntarily to a regulatory program run by the government or which is attributable to the government, then under cases like Ibanez, which we emphasize in our brief, that there is an obligation on the part of the government to apply the rules fairly, unless there is a waiver of some kind, the waiver standard is the one that makes a difference."
2006.06-427,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1983.477,1987.677,"But your claim here is not that they didn't apply the rules fairly, your claim is--"
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,1989.598,1993.408,Unconstitutionally.
2006.06-427,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1993.408,1994.645,That's right.
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2002.779,2004.998,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2006.06-427,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2006.344,2007.623,I just wanted to be clear on that.
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2007.623,2009.233,But I think perhaps--
2006.06-427,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2009.233,2020.463,"And even if was purely voluntary and even if you had two choices but you chose the... you chose to join the association with the anti-recruiting rule, there would be a First Amendment problem?"
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2020.463,2021.321,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-427,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2040.437,2056.136,"So what if you decided to offer bonuses to 8th graders, a thousand dollars... and of course that's, I assume that's against the rules in Tennessee... would you have... would that be covered by your First Amendment right?"
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2056.136,2057.103,"No, Your Honor."
2006.06-427,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2057.103,2057.743,Why not?
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2057.743,2059.213,"That would be conduct, Your Honor."
2006.06-427,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2064.505,2067.409,But that's not the line that we draw elsewhere in the First Amendment.
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2067.409,2079.704,"--Between money as an inducing, an inducement, we would view an inducement or an incentive as conduct, as opposed to speech, communication."
2006.06-427,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2151.284,2152.781,"Mr. Blumstein, you're making that distinction."
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2175.961,2177.524,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.06-427,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2177.524,2178.257,That would be okay.
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2178.257,2179.022,That's correct.
2006.06-427,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2197.201,2210.416,"It's a little odd, isn't it, that they could do... they could take the stronger measure but not the lesser measure of saying it's available but we don't want you to broadcast it?"
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2210.416,2221.051,"--Well, under the First Amendment, it is a core principle that speech about lawful or permitted conduct cannot be punished just because of the speech."
2006.06-427,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2232.608,2234.655,But not beneficial to the system.
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2279.199,2280.42,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2006.06-427,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2280.42,2283.466,"They don't have to consider the matter, do they?"
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2286.543,2298.678,"--I believe that under the Lorillard case and under this Court's decision in the Fox case, that there is an obligation to engage in what is called the careful calculation of cause and benefits."
2006.06-427,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2298.678,2299.287,Certainly.
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2320.371,2332.647,"Well, Your Honor, there was in the Lorillard case, the tobacco regulation case, the Court was specifically critical that the attorney general of Massachusetts did not consider the cost of speech, particularly with respect to--"
2006.06-427,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2332.647,2337.193,"Well, I mean, you may criticize them when they get it... when it comes out wrong."
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2354.296,2361.666,"--But Justice Scalia, in your opinion in the Fox case, one of the safeguards that was articulated for speech protection was the need to have a procedural safeguard."
2006.06-427,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2379.472,2388.031,That's where you had an approval system where one party would be approved and another one wouldn't.
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2399.666,2413.818,"--Well, in addition, there is an obligation under this Court's decision in the Thompson case for the government to consider non-speech alternatives, where to restrict... and to achieve its objectives by not regulating speech at all."
2006.06-427,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2414.754,2421.017,"Mr. Blumstein, it seems to me that Ms. Mahoney addressed that in response to a question from me."
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2456.393,2468.42,"--Well, the district court found that the constitutional balance tipped at that point because the evidence suggested that while that does happen, it's not a normal occurrence, fewer than 5 percent of cases."
2006.06-427,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2468.42,2476.76,"Well, how many cases have there got to be before you would recognize the sufficiency of the asserted state interest?"
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2476.76,2488.116,"Well, I think that once a family has... and the evidence in this case established that all these families had made their educational choice."
2006.06-427,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2488.116,2489.551,"Well, we know that."
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2502.641,2509.435,"Well, in this case, the association allows the underlying practice itself."
2006.06-427,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2514.122,2521.039,"So that if the kid comes and says, look, I'm going to Brentwood next fall and I'd like to tag along to a spring practice, they say okay."
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2553.308,2557.883,"--But there's the whole cited Question 3, Justice Souter."
2006.06-427,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2557.883,2559.227,"Yeah, but would you answer my question?"
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2561.679,2596.791,"Well, I think, again, as long as the association permits this activity and says there is a risk of recruiting at that activity if the students are not firmly committed, irrevocably committed to a place, and that they allow that conduct, then to allow the... to bar the... the school from talking about or at least mentioning the... the activity as an opportunity, then at that point the association if it wants to protect its interests must act to prohibit the conduct, not the speech."
2006.06-427,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2596.791,2597.227,Okay.
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2613.925,2619.436,"Well, because... Ms. Mahoney cited an example that does not require initiated school contact."
2006.06-427,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2627.215,2628.732,That's not what we've got before us.
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2628.732,2629.465,"--Yes, we do."
2006.06-427,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2637.774,2638.195,Okay.
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2640.161,2642.63,"Yes, but not necessarily initiated by the coach."
2006.06-427,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2650.249,2650.721,Okay.
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2664.9,2665.839,Yes.
2006.06-427,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2665.839,2685.127,"And I am saying that if the rule generally... maybe quite imprecisely... but if it generally distinguishes between that kind of proselytizing by a coach, and on the other hand contact that a kid initiates in the first place, isn't that roughly a fair line?"
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2685.127,2701.122,"Well, I don't think so, Justice Souter, because once the association determines that this activity is legitimate, and authorizes this with respect to the feeder pattern, so that all public schools can be--"
2006.06-427,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2701.122,2703.653,The activity being tagging along to spring practice?
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2703.653,2705.011,--Participating in spring practice.
2006.06-427,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2722.238,2730.563,"But the answer to that is, they're not trying to prevent people, at least under this rule, they're not trying to prevent 8th grade kids from going to spring practice."
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2738.604,2746.556,"Well, the proselytization here was found to be a harmless letter sent just informing the kids that they had an opportunity."
2006.06-427,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2754.272,2757.018,It was a letter from coach.
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2773.403,2778.278,"--But the letter, Justice Scalia, went to all students, not just the athletes."
2006.06-427,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2804.58,2807.313,"Is it fair to say ""your coach""?"
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2812.043,2816.513,"--Well, these were incoming students, Justice Ginsburg, and--"
2006.06-427,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2816.513,2818.791,"And did it say, by the way, everybody got this letter?"
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2826.102,2847.826,"--Again we think if the practice itself was problematic, was educationally unsound, if there was a risk of any of the interests that were involved, then the association could and did prohibit participation in that activity."
2006.06-427,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2847.826,2859.337,"--Weren't all these things that are being discussed before the factfinder, or was there some ex parte contact later which was the only evidence for what we're talking about now?"
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2862.508,2883.842,"The information that was before the factfinder had to do with, on the due process point, had to do with a person who was not related to the school but who had been, it turns out falsely, accused of offering inducements to students to attend the school."
2006.06-427,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2883.842,2889.792,"But I mean, all of these matters were discussed and there was an opportunity to reply to all of these matters that we've just been talking about, correct?"
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2889.792,2892.276,Yes.
2006.06-427,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2905.632,2911.739,It doesn't seem to me like there's a strong case for a flawed hearing for a due process violation.
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,2911.739,2937.429,"The problem was that the district court made two findings in this regard that were very important: That the association misled the school as to what issues were still open and available; and that ultimately a matter involving this Bart King was discussed at the closed after-hearing session, executive session, and the school had been told that the Bart King allegations were no longer on the table."
2006.06-427,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3004.633,3006.118,What was the evidence?
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3006.118,3009.257,I'm sorry?
2006.06-427,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3009.257,3010.303,What was the evidence?
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3010.303,3014.241,We don't know what the evidence was.
2006.06-427,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3014.241,3016.628,"I mean, at this late date, you've had trials."
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3023.675,3026.736,"Well, the evidence suggested that--"
2006.06-427,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3026.736,3033.981,"Did you ever ask the people who were at the meeting, what was the evidence you considered that we haven't had a chance to see?"
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3033.981,3035.482,--And--
2006.06-427,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3035.482,3036.512,Did you or not?
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3036.512,3037.167,--Yes.
2006.06-427,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3037.167,3039.012,"And then, and what did they say?"
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3039.012,3044.119,The evidence was the notes that was presented were the notes taken by the investigators.
2006.06-427,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3044.119,3044.556,All right.
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3049.801,3052.192,"We hadn't seen, we hadn't seen them before the hearing."
2006.06-427,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3052.192,3056.598,What was in there that you had not seen before in the notes?
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3056.598,3065.876,"Well, again I think that what was... what was available to the association was... excuse me--"
2006.06-427,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3065.876,3078.729,I'm asking you: What was in the notes that were presented to the decisionmaker that you had not previously seen and therefore had no opportunity to rebut?
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3086.726,3089.833,"--Well, we did not know that those issues were even on the table."
2006.06-427,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3099.22,3108.984,"What did it say in the notes that you, a factual matter or some other, that you did not have a chance to reply to specifically?"
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3108.984,3113.574,"--Well, we learned that the investigators had not spoken to Mr. King."
2006.06-427,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3113.574,3128.395,"What you learned was the investigators had not spoken to Mr. King, and you previously did not know that, and if you had known that you would have said to the decisionmaker: The investigators did not speak to Mr. King."
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3131.737,3149.153,"What we would have been in a position to say, Your Honor, was that we want to understand what your perception, your, the investigators' perception, is of what Bart King's relationship to Brentwood Academy is and how... and what he is alleged to have done."
2006.06-427,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3158.087,3165.101,"And the other side says, Mr. Bart King was part of the school and had something to do with this?"
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3165.101,3165.897,No--
2006.06-427,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3165.897,3166.458,Is that right.
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3166.458,3167.867,--I don't believe that they've taken that--
2006.06-427,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3167.867,3170.175,"Well then, I don't understand what the relevance of this is."
2006.06-427,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3170.175,3177.408,"I thought your claim was that you had a witness available to testify, but you didn't put him on because you didn't think they were going into this issue."
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3178.048,3180.329,--This was Mr. King himself was availability.
2006.06-427,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3184.358,3194.715,But I don't understand what Mr. King has to do with this if the other side is not claiming that Mr. King is part of your operation.
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3194.715,3206.054,"--But the association, the association association witnesses testified at trial, Justice Breyer, that in fact they... that they considered the King allegations."
2006.06-427,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3209.13,3210.176,Who considered it?
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3210.176,3212.535,"That the board of control, the TSSAA board."
2006.06-427,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3212.535,3218.08,"Did you ask the people on the board of control, what role did Mr. King play in your decision?"
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3218.08,3225.888,"And the answer that was given at trial, and the trial judge found this, was that he played a role, not in the liable but in the penalty."
2006.06-427,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3225.888,3236.962,"So that they might have reduced it ed it from $3,000 to less had they not been under the mistaken impression that Mr. King had something to do with you when he did it."
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3236.962,3241.899,"And specifically to mention the terms, the length of the probation, is what they said, the probation."
2006.06-427,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3241.899,3244.741,"And the probation was... and the probation, which was for four years?"
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3244.741,3245.365,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-427,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3245.365,3246.473,And have you served the four years.
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3246.473,3251.581,"Well, I believe one year has been served at this point."
2006.06-427,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3251.581,3253.437,So there is three more years?
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3271.761,3283.334,"The concern was that the association had told us, and the district court found this, that the King allegations were not on the table."
2006.06-427,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3283.334,3286.895,I thought it was a different claim.
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3294.109,3295.096,Yes.
2006.06-427,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3295.096,3300.34,And that I would think was not a violation of the Constitution since it happens every day of the week in administrative agencies.
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3309.025,3328.268,"No, but that we... that the disclosure of evidence as a basis of decision and an opportunity to respond to that evidence in a disciplinary hearing this Court has held as recently as the Hamdi case and certainly in Laudermill that that is an important procedural protection of due process, and that's what we're seeking in this case as well, Your--"
2006.06-427,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3328.658,3330.378,Thank you.
2006.06-427,2,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3330.378,3342.015,"Again, we think that the First Amendment framework that exists for regulatory cases fits this case well."
2006.06-427,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3443.581,3445.317,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.06-427,3,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3448.155,3450.499,Thank you.
2006.06-427,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3494.918,3497.605,I thought it had some State claims as pendant claims.
2006.06-427,3,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3497.605,3510.665,"The only State claim they had as a pendant claim was arbitrary action under State law, and the district court dismissed that because it found that the questions were sufficiently novel that he didn't feel that he should entertain jurisdiction over it."
2006.06-427,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3611.294,3621.477,Was there anything at the trial that came out that the investigator when they were in the private session said a fact about Bart King of supreme importance that they didn't know about?
2006.06-427,3,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3621.477,3622.542,"--Absolutely not, Your Honor."
2006.06-427,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3625.353,3628.695,"Well, didn't one of the decisionmakers testify that they relied on this--"
2006.06-427,3,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3628.695,3631.897,"Your Honor, most of them actually testified that they did not."
2006.06-427,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3631.897,3632.692,"--No, but one did."
2006.06-427,3,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3632.692,3634.708,There was one who had testified--
2006.06-427,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3634.708,3638.019,And did not the district court find that his testimony was credible?
2006.06-427,3,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3638.019,3659.649,"--He did, Your Honor, and... but even if that's true, even if the board did rely on evidence about Bart King in deciding what penalty ought to be, how much probation, whatever, that still does not establish that there was a due process violation because they had notice that the Bart King issues could be considered at this trial."
2006.06-427,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3686.685,3687.605,"Thank you, counsel."
