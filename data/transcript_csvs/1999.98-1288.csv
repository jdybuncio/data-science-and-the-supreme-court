1999.98-1288,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.94,"We'll hear argument next in Number 98-1288, The Village of Willowbrook v. Grace Olech."
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,66.668,70.012,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1288,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,92.303,97.96,"Mr. DeAno, let me ask you a question or two about this so-called class of one."
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,104.025,107.991,I think the facts of the complaint could give rise to a class of five.
1999.98-1288,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,118.309,130.281,"Yes, well, it wasn't in fact a class of one, and when has this Court ever said that the Equal Protection Clause only addresses classes as opposed to individuals?"
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,131.479,135.854,"The case that we cite...  no, not directly, this Court has not said that."
1999.98-1288,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,135.854,136.514,And why should we?
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,145.43,158.821,"The citizen is protected if that class is drawn for a constitutionally impermissible reason, and we submit that vindictiveness is not a constitutionally impermissible reason, and really what it's looking into is the distinction between..."
1999.98-1288,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,158.821,162.332,I don't even understand the vindictiveness point.
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,195.214,201.613,"We submit that if there is an equal protection claim, it is not under this Esmail-type theory, and then..."
1999.98-1288,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,201.613,203.925,But isn't there a claim?
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,211.561,218.991,"If the reason that they sought the additional 50 feet in your example was constitutionally impermissible, to punish..."
1999.98-1288,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,218.991,221.592,It doesn't matter what the reason was.
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,226.605,242.397,"Well, I would look at this Court's case of Snowden v. Hughes, where the Court said that simply differential treatment, even if it violates State law, and in this case village policy, it is not a violation of the Equal Protection Clause unless it is done for a constitutionally impermissible reason."
1999.98-1288,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,243.14,264.195,"Mr. DeAno, supposing that in this case they asked 50 feet of Mrs. Olech's property and asked only 10 feet from people whose property was indistinguishable from Mrs. Olech, do you say that that would not be any sort of an equal protection claim?"
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,264.195,266.757,"If it was done for an impermissible, constitutionally impermissible..."
1999.98-1288,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,266.757,267.167,When is it...
1999.98-1288,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,267.167,267.539,Well...
1999.98-1288,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,267.539,269.025,you keep referring to impermissible.
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,278.851,285.0,"Justice Scalia, I would point to the Snowden case where the Court said, simply differential treatment is not a violation of..."
1999.98-1288,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,285.0,288.306,"Well, of course not, if there's a rational basis for the difference."
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,288.306,288.882,And...
1999.98-1288,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,288.882,292.802,It becomes constitutionally impermissible when there is no rational basis.
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,292.802,294.91,"And that's what we're arguing in this case, that..."
1999.98-1288,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,294.91,296.229,"Oh, it's a perfectly rational basis."
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,299.08,299.906,Well...
1999.98-1288,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,302.302,304.736,"It's perfectly rational, you see."
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,304.736,319.885,"Well, if the rational basis is to serve a legitimate government objective, for example, in this instance to upgrade and improve an existing road, then we submit that the question should be, if it's an equal protection claim it should fall under traditional equal protection analysis, with the..."
1999.98-1288,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,319.885,336.026,"Mr. DeAno, one problem I have with that answer is, how do we get even to know what the purpose of the government was when this case is tossed out on a 12(b)(6) motion and all we're supposed to look at is the face of the complaint, and the complaint doesn't say anything about, they wanted to widen the road."
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,336.026,347.832,"Well, I think as the district court found, the complaint alleges that the reason that the village sought the additional, and I think it's in this case 18 feet, was so that it could improve and dedicate this road."
1999.98-1288,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,347.832,349.857,Did the...  the complaint said that?
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,349.857,362.321,"The complaint alleged that the reason they sought the additional space was so that they could, I believe, pave and complete the road with sidewalks and public utilities, and that's what the district court found to be a legitimate purpose."
1999.98-1288,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,365.46,367.522,We don't have the...  do we have the complaint?
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,367.522,368.061,Yes.
1999.98-1288,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,380.2,388.745,And where is the part where the plaintiff sets out that the State's...  that the village's reason...
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,388.745,411.157,"At page 9 of the Joint Appendix, and it's allegation number 25, where it's alleged that they sought the property so that they could dedicate the public roadway and construct pavement, public utilities..."
1999.98-1288,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,411.157,411.779,"Yes, thank you."
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,411.779,411.945,Okay.
1999.98-1288,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,436.177,454.464,"But you would agree, then, that there may be a claim stated by an individual who is not otherwise a member of a class if the individual states that the differential treatment is not rationally related to any legitimate governmental purpose."
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,455.951,457.066,Yes.
1999.98-1288,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,471.843,487.697,"Well, supposing...  again, let's have the 50-foot and 10-foot examples, that from Mrs. Olech they want 50 feet, from people identically situated they want 10 feet, and it simply is a result of a goof in the City Clerk's office."
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,499.214,500.04,I believe so.
1999.98-1288,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,509.867,518.799,There is certainly an intentional difference in treatment.
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,526.046,534.674,"Intent versus motive, if the intent is to take 50 feet, then certainly they treated her differently than others..."
1999.98-1288,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,534.674,534.941,Right.
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,534.941,536.615,when they took less than 50 feet from them.
1999.98-1288,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,536.615,537.12,Right.
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,537.12,537.729,However...
1999.98-1288,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,537.729,539.065,"That's not enough, according to you?"
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,539.065,551.863,"Well, that may state a traditional equal protection claim, but then the question for the Court would be, is there a rational basis for this, and we submit that this complaint alleges a rational basis for why they asked for an additional 18 feet in this case."
1999.98-1288,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,551.863,558.012,"No, but you say it alleges a rational basis because establishing roads is a governmental objective."
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,558.922,561.356,Establishing roads and also for the purpose...
1999.98-1288,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,561.356,564.328,"Well, what about the rational basis for the differential treatment?"
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,564.328,569.491,The differential treatment is the beginning of the analysis.
1999.98-1288,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,574.238,593.678,"In other words, your theory is that the government can treat people in any otherwise unjustifiably differential way so long as in isolation it has a legitimate objective for treating each individual in the way the individual is treated?"
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,624.226,625.423,That...
1999.98-1288,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,625.423,626.538,Is that your argument?
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,626.538,627.009,No.
1999.98-1288,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,638.592,638.964,Okay.
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,642.967,644.62,Yes.
1999.98-1288,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,644.62,645.114,Okay.
1999.98-1288,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,645.114,651.801,"Why isn't the complaint alleging...  it may not be right, but it alleges a difference."
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,666.912,668.853,The complaint alleges those facts.
1999.98-1288,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,668.853,669.024,All right.
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,675.506,685.742,"Under the Esmail theory, where is...  where the Court says to look at motive before you look at anything else, that's what we're saying, that that may be a traditional equal protection claim."
1999.98-1288,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,685.742,687.578,"You may be right or wrong about that, I don't know."
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,699.655,700.193,Well...
1999.98-1288,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,700.193,704.28,So now should we get into this much more difficult question about motive and so forth?
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,704.28,714.022,"Not whether simply one person can ever state an equal protection claim, but whether that one person can state that they were singled out because of the government's motive, vindictiveness."
1999.98-1288,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,714.022,725.335,"Well, suppose that they're singled out because of the government's motive, and it also happens that there's no rational basis, which I take it is what Judge Posner said."
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,739.014,739.74,Well...
1999.98-1288,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,739.74,741.392,"I'll get his exact words, if you want."
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,741.392,744.57,"Well, in answer to that question, I think that..."
1999.98-1288,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,744.57,754.229,"He says, if it refuses to perform this obligation for one of the residents for no reason...  no reason."
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,762.403,771.198,"And under traditional equal protection analysis, the question then would be for the Court to search the record to see if there is any conceivable rational basis."
1999.98-1288,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,771.198,772.062,"Well, here we have the record."
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,775.944,785.332,The...  we submit that the rational basis is that in this instance they had a nondedicated road over which they were now being asked to place a public improvement.
1999.98-1288,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,785.332,788.204,"I suppose if your hatred is not baseless, it's okay."
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,791.01,791.382,No...
1999.98-1288,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,791.615,792.662,would that make it all right?
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,792.662,799.062,"No, it's not that if hatred is baseless, it's if the act, the legitimate...  the goal of the government."
1999.98-1288,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,808.637,819.7,"Why, then, shouldn't you read this complaint to say, they wanted 33 feet to widen the road, but everybody else, they wanted only 15 feet."
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,837.661,865.913,"On that set of facts, if they alleged a traditional equal protection claim, the next question would be, is there a conceivable rational basis for what was done, and that's why we point, and why the district court pointed to paragraph 25, which alleged that although the respondent is saying the reason they did this is because they're retaliating against me, they also supplied an allegation that explained another basis, another reason why the village wanted that 18 feet."
1999.98-1288,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,865.913,875.572,"But wouldn't that reason still be inadequate if everybody else was either not asked for the 33, or paid for the difference?"
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,875.572,881.872,"I don't think so, because the reason...  if nobody else was asked for 33 feet, that would create the classification."
1999.98-1288,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,892.646,903.132,"It has to be a rational basis, not for taking the 33 feet, but a rational basis for treating this person different from other people, right?"
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,903.132,910.069,"I agree with that, and the reason that she was asked for the 33 feet is why she was treated differently."
1999.98-1288,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,910.069,916.302,"But other people, they did not have the need for the 33 feet from other people?"
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,916.302,921.419,"This is a unique situ...  no, because in this situation we had a nondedicated road."
1999.98-1288,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,921.419,928.206,"But we don't know that from the motion to...  from the complaint and the motion to dismiss, do we?"
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,928.206,936.197,"Well, the complaint alleges that it had never been dedicated, and that there had never been any easement granted to any governmental body for the use of any portion of it, so..."
1999.98-1288,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,936.197,945.402,You say all the facts necessary to support your argument that there is a rational basis can be deduced from the complaint?
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,945.402,947.559,"Yes, Your Honor, and that's what the district court found, that..."
1999.98-1288,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,947.559,951.236,I think that's asking rather a lot of a court like this.
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,986.735,987.312,The...
1999.98-1288,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,987.312,995.735,"And it also seems that this was, as has been pointed out, dismissed on the face of the complaint."
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,1015.459,1029.727,"Because the complaint was brought under a theory of the Equal Protection Clause recognizing the Seventh Circuit in the Esmail case, and we submit that Esmail is not a proper...  is not a viable cause of action under the Equal Protection Clause."
1999.98-1288,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1031.13,1046.324,"Well, but if the complaint boils down to, they treated me differently than every other citizen when it comes to hooking up water, that's enough, and it doesn't matter if it's one person or five person...  five people."
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,1054.702,1062.792,"Because the reason that the motion to dismiss was filed was because Esmail is a new theory in the Seventh Circuit, and there had been no other cases interpreting it."
1999.98-1288,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1065.847,1072.163,"But you know, we don't necessarily follow a case from the Seventh Circuit."
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,1080.997,1104.031,"And that's not the theory, though, that the respondent brought this case under, and the petition that we filed asked not only that the Court consider whether a class of one could ever file an equal protection claim, it's whether a class of one who is alleging that the class was created by vindictiveness, because vindictiveness has not been a constitutionally protected interest."
1999.98-1288,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1104.031,1117.2,"But if one doesn't need to find vindictiveness in order to say that a complaint like the States have claimed for relief under the Equal Protection Clause, it seems to me we wouldn't get into the Esmail question at all."
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,1117.2,1130.781,"That's correct, but then if it was under traditional equal protection analysis we believe that the district court took the right approach and looked for a rational basis for what the government did, and that's why the case was dismissed in the district court."
1999.98-1288,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1130.781,1140.235,Have we ever said...  has this Court ever said that in the abstract there's some free-floating duty for the government always to act rationally?
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,1141.555,1141.927,No.
1999.98-1288,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1141.927,1149.607,So the duty to act rationally applies only when the government's actions affect a certain person?
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,1149.607,1157.902,"When the government takes a position that differentiates, creates a class, then I think the question is whether...  what is that class?"
1999.98-1288,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1176.894,1185.726,Do you think your argument is consistent either with the...  Justice Stone's opinion in Snowden or with Learned Hand's opinion in Burt?
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,1185.726,1214.167,"I think it's inconsistent with Learned Hand's position in Burt, but I think it's consistent with the Snowden decision in that in Snowden you had a single individual who claimed that he had been denied the right to be placed on the ballot in Illinois, and that he had qualified for that, and that the canvassing board maliciously, willfully, and arbitrarily refused him that right, and the Court said that despite those allegations you have not alleged intentional or purposeful discrimination, and it went on to say..."
1999.98-1288,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1214.167,1218.792,But that seems to me to suggest that the missing allegation was precisely the allegation you've got here.

1999.98-1288,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1220.733,1221.309,Yes.
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,1221.309,1230.241,"Well, we cite, then, U.S. v. O'Brien and Arlington Heights and Washington v. Davis for the position that the motivation, which vindictiveness..."
1999.98-1288,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1230.241,1235.881,"I understand that, but it seems to me if one confined himself to Snowden and Burt, you would lose."
1999.98-1288,0,30007,james_l_deano,,1241.25,1252.767,"Snowden I think it's how you interpret intentional and purposeful discrimination, and if you read intentional and purposeful discrimination broadly in that it's enough to say..."
1999.98-1288,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1252.767,1260.485,"If you read Snowden the way Learned Hand read it, then you lose, and he's usually a pretty good judge, we say."
1999.98-1288,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1568.092,1573.665,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1288,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1606.896,1618.126,"What if they had a class of litigants against the city, and they had a rule that anybody who sues the city, will get disparate treatment, 33 feet instead of 15 feet, and that's their policy."
1999.98-1288,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1621.757,1623.16,"Justice Stevens, it would."
1999.98-1288,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1626.754,1627.784,Why isn't that this case?
1999.98-1288,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1627.784,1632.631,"Well, it is this case, and that's one of the reasons that we told...  suggested to the Court..."
1999.98-1288,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1632.631,1632.781,Oh.
1999.98-1288,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1633.153,1654.951,"that we suggested to the Court that it not examine the class-of-one issue, because the class-of-one issue really arises when there is no suspect classification and no fundamental right involved, but this happens to implicate the fundamental right to file a lawsuit, which this Court has recognized as being protected by the First Amendment as a component of the right to petition for a redress of grievances."
1999.98-1288,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1656.52,1659.613,Mr. DeAno said that's not the theory of the plaintiff's complaint.
1999.98-1288,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1664.526,1675.877,"They actually did, in their factual allegations, allege that the basis for the retaliation was the filing of the lawsuit, and that is in Joint Appendix 10, allegation number 27."
1999.98-1288,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1675.877,1690.699,"Well, what if you decide that you're going to treat this person differently because they've filed a lawsuit against the village, but it turns out there's a perfectly rational basis for treating them differently?"
1999.98-1288,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1690.699,1725.129,"Mr. Chief Justice, in that case, when you have a First Amendment right at issue, the sequence of events is dictated by this Court's decision in Doyle, which says that the plaintiff has the burden to show that a motivating factor in the decision was the exercise of First Amendment rights and at that point, if the plaintiff establishes that initial burden, then the burden shifts to the defendant to show that the same decision would have been reached even the...  even in the absence of the consideration of the protected activity."
1999.98-1288,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1747.17,1778.256,"So under the Doyle approach, my hypothetical, would a court say, yes, this is a prima facie denial of equal protection because of 50 feet versus 10 feet, and the respondent has come up with a perfectly good explanation of why, but we also find that the motive for doing it was not the rational basis, that they simply wanted to get this person because they filed a lawsuit, and kind of dug up the rational basis later."
1999.98-1288,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1781.804,1808.099,"This Court recently issued a per curiam decision this term, and I believe it's called Le Sage, in which the government took the action on the base of race and...  in part, and the government was able to show to the satisfaction of the Court that the same thing would have occurred even absent the consideration of race, and in that event there is at least no award for past conduct."
1999.98-1288,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1808.721,1814.293,But you have to get beyond the dismissal of the complaint to reach that.
1999.98-1288,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1814.293,1815.78,That's correct.
1999.98-1288,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1815.78,1819.495,Le Sage was hardly a dismissal of the complaint situation.
1999.98-1288,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1819.495,1819.832,That's correct.
1999.98-1288,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1838.136,1847.036,Should we begin our opinion in this case by saying there is no constitutional right for similarly situated persons to be treated equally under the law?
1999.98-1288,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1849.06,1865.861,"There is a constitutional right for people who are being treated equally...  who are similarly situated, in fact, to be treated equally, but how the Court approaches that question depends on whether there's a suspect classification or a fundamental right involved."
1999.98-1288,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1878.865,1887.492,"Is that necessary to reduce the number of suits filed in Federal court, to reduce the intervention of courts in routine governmental actions?"
1999.98-1288,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1887.492,1888.607,That is the...
1999.98-1288,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1888.607,1893.232,Are we compromising the basic principle by saying that?
1999.98-1288,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1893.232,1909.002,"No, because I think the basic principle that the Court has established is...  under rational basis review is a baseline of protection, but only against those classifications, or those different...  intentional differences in treatment that lack any conceivable rational basis..."
1999.98-1288,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1909.002,1909.373,"Well, why..."
1999.98-1288,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1909.373,1918.374,"If you're a county council and the board of commissioners said, we're going to bury this application because we just don't like this guy, you tell them that that is constitutionally permissible?"
1999.98-1288,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1918.374,1919.61,I do not.
1999.98-1288,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1926.835,1927.783,And that you would propose to conceive one.
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,2175.674,2188.306,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1288,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2292.293,2305.129,"Well, but the discussion of question 1 may involve some...  you know, rather than a purely hypothetical discussion might involve discussion of question 2."
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,2310.619,2313.136,I don't know that they can be totally separated.
1999.98-1288,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2372.102,2386.453,"But as to question 1, it talks about a class of one, and the complaint itself reveals that they're a class of five, at least, so wouldn't it be a totally hypothetical advisory opinion to answer question 1 in the context of a case that doesn't raise it?"
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,2386.453,2410.685,"Well, I don't think it would be an advisory opinion necessarily, because although there are five people involved, I think the principal the class of one...  the distinction is between a class of one and a vulnerable group."
1999.98-1288,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2420.716,2424.802,"Mr. Wimmer, did you represent Ms. Olech..."
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,2424.802,2425.341,Yes.
1999.98-1288,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2425.341,2426.66,at all times below?
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,2426.66,2426.949,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-1288,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2426.949,2427.942,And you drafted the complaint?
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,2427.942,2428.397,I did.
1999.98-1288,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2428.397,2444.576,"Then why didn't you include the theory that Mr. Deano suggested may have been okay, that is, it was retaliation for exercise of their First Amendment right to sue the village?"
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,2444.576,2490.644,"Well, Your Honor, I did state in paragraph 27, and this is on page 10 of the appendix, that the defendants treated plaintiff Grace Olech and Thaddeus Olech, Howard Brinkman, and Rodney C. Zimmer and Phyllis S. Zimmer differently from other property owners in the Village of Willowbrook by demanding the 33-foot easements and the 66-foot dedicated street as a condition of the extension of the water main because of the ill will generated by the State court lawsuit, and in an attempt to control storm water drainage in the vicinity to the detriment of plaintiff Grace Olech and Thaddeus Olech and other plaintiffs in the State court lawsuit by the use of ditches and swales along Tennessee Avenue."
1999.98-1288,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2518.015,2552.317,"What if we had a somewhat different situation here, where we're not talking about the demand for easement dedication, but whether the village is going to contract with a particular person, or take bids from various persons to do the paving in this area, and the village says, well, one person we're not going to contract with is X, because X has a reputation for suing everybody, for just being a very litigious person constantly taking advantage of his right to petition."
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,2558.594,2566.357,"Well, if the lawsuit that was brought was meritorious, I think it would be."
1999.98-1288,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2597.126,2609.841,So you say that the First Amendment does protect someone who the county or the village simply doesn't want to deal with because they have a propensity to litigate at the drop of a hat.
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,2612.07,2625.279,"Well, I think if...  it would come down to what the propensity to litigate in cases that are not valid, that would probably be a proper consideration for the village to take into account."
1999.98-1288,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2631.778,2634.074,What was your theory?
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,2661.816,2664.046,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1999.98-1288,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2743.923,2788.588,"Well now, if a complaint were to allege that the city took some...  singled out the plaintiff for some negative action solely because the city didn't like the person for some reason, the mayor hated her, and it turns out, though, that there is a perfectly rational basis that the Court can think of for the mayor's action, is there a lawsuit just because the mayor, in his heart of hearts, hated the plaintiff and wanted that outcome, even though we can derive a perfectly rational basis?"
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,2788.588,2803.821,"Probably not, Judge, although this Court did say in the City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center that some objectives, such as a bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group, are not legitimate State interests."
1999.98-1288,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2831.973,2853.4,"I think you know what's bothering us, that if we accept your theory, then in those thousands, tens of thousands of zoning decisions where local personalities are involved and difficult discretionary judgments are made, it's going to always be followed by a lawsuit of ill will."
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,2862.892,2879.033,"Your Honor, I think there's sufficient protection from municipalities or government in the fact that the plaintiff has to show that there was no rational basis, no conceivable rational basis related to legitimate government interests for the conduct."
1999.98-1288,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2894.804,2895.669,They don't have to say that.
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,2900.31,2900.581,That's correct.
1999.98-1288,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2900.581,2904.091,So in this respect you're in agreement with the government's theory of the case?
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,2904.091,2918.497,I agree that a rational basis related to a legitimate government interest for the disparate treatment would indicate that there was no equal protection violation.
1999.98-1288,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2918.497,2919.611,A conceivable basis.
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,2919.611,2923.698,"Based on the facts that are before the Court, yes."
1999.98-1288,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2962.419,2966.506,Do we have a class of one?
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,2968.985,2973.482,"That the Equal Protection Clause...  oh, do we have a class of one in this case?"
1999.98-1288,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2985.87,2994.165,"This objection that a class of five is not a class of one, was this made at the petition stage in the opposition to certiorari?"
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,2994.165,2995.53,I don't believe so.
1999.98-1288,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3006.963,3011.671,May I ask you just a variation...
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,3011.671,3012.414,Yes.
1999.98-1288,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3012.414,3013.157,of Justice Scalia's question?
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,3019.473,3019.844,No.
1999.98-1288,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3035.614,3037.389,Because that was a law of the Seventh Circuit?
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,3037.389,3037.677,Right.
1999.98-1288,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3145.025,3165.663,"And what is your answer, Mr. Wimmer, to the argument that you have pled yourself out of court by making your statement of the class of one or five but then including in the complaint a rational basis for seeking more land, that is, they wanted to make the street?"
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,3165.663,3177.346,"Well, I don't think I did include in my complaint a rational basis for the Village of Willowbrook to treat Mrs. Olech differently from other property owners."
1999.98-1288,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3228.616,3233.984,May I ask you a hypothetical about a concession you made earlier?
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,3252.227,3259.907,"Well, I think..."
1999.98-1288,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3259.907,3263.722,Is there a stupidity clause in the Constitution...
1999.98-1288,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3263.722,3264.365,[Laughter]
1999.98-1288,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3264.365,3265.563,"somewhere we could get them on, or something?"
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,3265.563,3282.077,"Well, I think one could argue convincingly in light of Your Honor's language in the Cleburne case that if the city admitted that they were doing it to punish a person, a politically unpopular person or group, that the plaintiff would prevail."
1999.98-1288,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3285.132,3299.167,"And it's not a totally hypothetical question, either, to respond to my good colleague, because sometimes you take depositions before the answer is filed, and the depositions make it perfectly clear that was the real purpose, but then they conceive of a legitimate purpose later."
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,3299.167,3319.867,"Well, I think, as I say, that a convincing argument can be made under Cleburne that if they made that concession, that it was not...  it was what this Court has said to be not a legitimate government interest that motivated them to take that action, that there would be an equal protection..."
1999.98-1288,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3319.867,3321.253,"Why, if they only make the concession?"
1999.98-1288,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3321.253,3321.541,Maybe there's a presumption...
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,3333.801,3336.939,"Well, that's a good question, although in this case..."
1999.98-1288,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3336.939,3337.766,It's a very good question.
1999.98-1288,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3338.138,3338.714,[Laughter]
1999.98-1288,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3338.714,3341.975,You want to throw us right back into the pool that we thought we had jumped out of.
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,3341.975,3361.377,"Well, in this case, where the complaint does not show a rational basis related to a legitimate government interest for the disparate treatment, I think it is proper to inquire into the motive, however, Judge...  or, I'm sorry, Your Honor...  because I have to show that there was a denial of equal protection."
1999.98-1288,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3381.728,3397.953,"I suppose the way Judge Posner's view could be explained is that there is a presumption that the government acted for a reasonable purpose, and if there's specific evidence to the contrary, then the case can proceed and it just becomes a pleading case."
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,3397.953,3399.272,"Well, yes."
1999.98-1288,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3402.783,3404.556,I thought you had both.
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,3404.556,3404.862,And...
1999.98-1288,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3404.862,3409.775,"No conceivable rational purpose, and animus."
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,3409.775,3411.056,"I believe I do, Your Honor."
1999.98-1288,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3411.799,3429.382,"And if you get rid of the former, I guess we have a Federal lawsuit even if the land was set aside as coastal land, you know, a wonderful reason, has the most beautiful view in the State, but it turns out, it's alleged, that the real reason he did it is, he didn't like the landowner."
1999.98-1288,2,33509,john_r_wimmer,,3440.899,3452.666,"That's right, although I think in this case that's not what we have, since I've alleged both, and the allegations of the complaint have to be accepted as true at this point."
1999.98-1288,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3593.266,3594.958,"Thank you, Mr. Wimmer."
