1979.78-599,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,49.263,"We will hear oral argument next in 78-599, Secretary of the Navy v. Huff."
1979.78-599,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,53.142,56.447,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,358.063,359.426,"Mr. Jones, just one question."
1979.78-599,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,367.247,368.45,"I am sorry, I didn't understand."
1979.78-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,369.871,373.043,You are saying the statute does not protect the communications?
1979.78-599,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,373.043,373.468,That's right.
1979.78-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,374.676,378.625,"Then we must decide, if you are right, whether or not the Constitution, independently of the statute?"
1979.78-599,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,378.625,381.411,You must decide it in the Glines case.
1979.78-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,381.411,382.748,"Or the Huff case, this case?"
1979.78-599,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,382.748,388.682,"Well, in the Huff case, you could decide it if it wasn't decided below."
1979.78-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,388.682,391.47,If we construe the statute the way you construe it --
1979.78-599,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,391.47,392.008,Yes.
1979.78-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,392.008,395.351,-- then are we not necessarily confronted with the constitutional question?
1979.78-599,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,397.338,404.595,"Well, all I'm saying is that our petition in the Huff case only brought up the statutory issue because that's all the Court of Appeals decided."
1979.78-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,404.595,404.951,"I know, but --"
1979.78-599,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,404.951,411.032,There was no cross petition. Certainly it's within the Court's discretion to reach the constitutional issue.
1979.78-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,419.946,423.177,"But if you went on the statute, the case can't be finally decided until --"
1979.78-599,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,423.177,425.755,"That's right, final judgment couldn't be rendered."
1979.78-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,425.755,430.462,And is it your suggestion that we then remand to the -- what do we do with the constitutional issue?
1979.78-599,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,430.462,437.264,"Well, I think that regulations should be upheld under the statute and under the Constitution."
1979.78-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,446.231,453.299,"Then if the statute doesn't apply and if the regulation is attacked as unconstitutional, which I understand it is, then don't we have to decide it?"
1979.78-599,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,455.762,465.193,"You don't have to decide it at this time in the sense that it wasn't raised in our petition, it wasn't raised in a cross petition, it hasn't been aired below."
1979.78-599,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,465.193,471.898,"So it should be decided by the lower court, is what you're saying, in the first instance?"
1979.78-599,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,471.898,474.54,I think that it perhaps should be.
1979.78-599,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,474.54,480.859,"Respondents do have a right to support the judgment below on an alternate ground, it was argued --"
1979.78-599,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,480.859,487.707,"Yes, they have that right, and I don't think they raised that claim, though, in their brief."
1979.78-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,487.707,496.52,In what respect is the constitutional issue different in this case from the preceding case?
1979.78-599,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,497.507,501.702,"Well, I don't think that the eventual constitutional issue is different at all."
1979.78-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,503.798,508.399,"So if that were decided in your favor, we certainly wouldn't have to address it here again?"
1979.78-599,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,508.399,513.191,"If it were decided in Glines in our favor, it wouldn't have to be addressed here as well."
1979.78-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,513.191,514.448,And vice versa?
1979.78-599,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,514.448,515.32,And vice versa.
1979.78-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,515.32,525.696,"Is there this difference In the other case, as I understand it, you contend the communication was improper, but here wasn't there a request for command approval which was denied?"
1979.78-599,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,525.696,531.716,"Well, all of the underlying facts in the case are not relevant to the judgment."
1979.78-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,540.748,541.288,"Well, but they are --"
1979.78-599,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,541.288,546.566,"The regulations were held to be facially invalid, that is to say no application can be given to them at all."
1979.78-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,546.566,553.652,"And with respect to the actual litigation, they got the relief they wanted here, and you don't challenge that?"
1979.78-599,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,553.652,554.592,They have obtained --
1979.78-599,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,554.592,568.575,"Apart from the declaratory judgment holding it -- but I mean in terms of, I am trying to remember the facts here You conceded here that either under the regulation or under the Constitution, I can't remember which, the military could not prevent the communication?"
1979.78-599,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,568.575,570.822,"Well, the record is mixed on that."
1979.78-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,601.365,607.182,What was it that the man -- I am trying to remember the facts of this case -- what was it that he distributed here?
1979.78-599,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,607.182,609.718,"Well, there were several distributions."
1979.78-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,636.923,640.207,Yes.
1979.78-599,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,640.207,643.251,And so that individual aspect of the case is definitely out.
1979.78-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,658.06,661.129,But he has standing because it might be applied to him sometime in the future?
1979.78-599,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,661.129,662.813,"Well, it's a class action."
1979.78-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,662.813,664.995,I see.
1979.78-599,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,669.772,671.633,Mr. Dranitzke.
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,671.633,675.037,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,760.333,762.974,In a foreign country?
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,762.974,774.265,"Your Honor, the facts of this case and the regulations in this case make it such that everything we're talking about is in a foreign country."
1979.78-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,788.663,800.908,"No, I just meant that, when you were just summarizing now as to the prohibition, one qualification to the prohibition is that it applies only in a foreign country."
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,800.908,804.269,The pertinent part applies in a foreign country.
1979.78-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,814.562,818.763,But that isn't involved here?
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,818.763,820.741,It is --
1979.78-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,820.741,827.538,"Did the lower court pass on that and did you challenge that, the part you just read?"
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,827.538,835.129,It was unnecessary because the prior approval requests were made on a foreign base.
1979.78-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,835.129,839.098,"So that really is what's before us, is something in a foreign country?"
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,839.098,840.399,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,840.399,846.562,Were you paraphrasing the 5370.3 with your summary?
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,846.562,861.675,"I was reading directly from the Fleet Marine Force Specific Order, which was the order picked out of the four orders by the Court of Appeals below, and is reprinted both in the government's brief and our brief yes, sir."
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,886.199,891.545,"Well, now, what you're saying is, Congress meant to include in 1034 petitions?"
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,891.545,893.128,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,894.035,902.547,Most members of Congress are familiar with the constitutional reference to the right to petition Congress.
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,908.456,920.153,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think communications is a broader term than petition, and Congress did not want to eliminate somebody who thought they were not writing a petition, and simply a letter, from writing to Congress."
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,920.153,936.785,"The legislative history suggests that both Chairman Vinson and Congressman Byrnes spoke in terms of a man sitting down with a pencil and writing a letter to his congressman, which is clearly an exercise of the right to petition Congress, is it not?"
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,936.785,953.4,"Yes, it is, Your Honor, and I think that admittedly the legislative history here deals with the individual sailor who was trying to write to his Congressman and the Navy was saying no, you have to send it to the Secretary first."
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1041.396,1044.238,You are speaking now of 3(b)?
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1044.238,1046.172,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1046.172,1059.984,"And you say the prohibition against pro-magazines, handbills, flyers, means you can't write an individual letter?"
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1059.984,1061.783,"Yes, I think that's the clear meaning."
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1070.26,1078.686,"Do we ordinarily think of a letter from a single individual to another individual as a petition, except in the very generic sense?"
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1078.686,1081.346,"I think that when you're writing to Congress it's certainly a petition, and I think --"
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1081.346,1091.244,"Well, you are exercising your right of petition, perhaps, but if you write your congressman, do you regard that as a petition?"
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1093.735,1098.437,I think I regard it as both.
1979.78-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1281.456,1307.082,"What if we were to conclude that the commanding officer on a base in a foreign country is constitutionally permitted to prohibit or require advance submission, and like this requiring blanket advance submission?"
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1320.284,1349.895,"Well, Your Honor, I think what is important about the facts here is that we have a series of requests, a series of denials, a total misuse of the regulations, concession by the government that all of these were improper, every last one of them, and it shows that in fact, if these regulations or similar type regulations are going to be in existence, that the right to petition is not a right that is going to exist within the military."
1979.78-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1349.895,1353.63,In foreign countries?
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1353.63,1362.84,"To the extent that the same requirement is obtained on a state-side base, I think the answer is still the same."
1979.78-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1362.84,1366.51,But all your case involves is foreign countries?
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1366.51,1372.244,That is correct.
1979.78-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1475.487,1490.315,"You don't complain about the refusal in the first case, you simply claim about the -- your claim is based on the disparate treatment between Huff and the first commanding officer?"
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1490.315,1502.91,"No, we complained about all the denials in the case and, in fact, the court granted declaratory judgment that these denials were unconstitutional and illegal under the statute."
1979.78-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1502.91,1528.034,"Well, do you think the Constitution permits leafletting a base by a member of the military to the effect that the commanding officer of this base is lazy, corrupt, and engaged in treasonable conduct, even if those statements might be proven true?"
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1528.034,1552.157,"I think that as long as that activity takes place in a way that does not disrupt the order of the base and the discipline of the base, that can be taken care of through the criminal processes under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, that yes, an enlisted person would have such a right."
1979.78-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1552.157,1559.293,But the reaction of people to leaflets like that is going to be disruptive to order on the base.
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1559.293,1565.333,"I think that that would, unfortunately in the situation, have to be a command decision."
1979.78-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1573.871,1577.333,But if the commander says it would?
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1577.333,1581.802,Then the commander would be free to bring criminal prosecution --
1979.78-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1581.802,1586.441,But he can't prevent in advance its circulation?
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1586.441,1601.94,"Well, I think that the assumption of the question in a lot of the government's argument is that the minute something starts, the whole structure of discipline and morale fall, and I think that is a false assumption."
1979.78-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1621.349,1628.108,"Well, I'm not a psychologist I have no reason to think you're a psychologist."
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1637.353,1655.568,"I think that if the First Amendment is to have any meaning in the military, then it cannot be a decision solely that the command can see everything ahead of time and pass on it, and engage in prior restraint."
1979.78-599,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1693.158,1698.711,"Wall, that's what Spock decided, according to the dissenting opinion, isn't it?"
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1698.711,1701.096,I understand that that is what the dissenting opinion says.
1979.78-599,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1701.096,1702.885,"And if it did, well then, you lose."
1979.78-599,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1702.885,1709.081,Dissenting opinions usually say things like that.
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1709.081,1711.934,"I think that no, not necessarily we lose."
1979.78-599,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1713.619,1715.499,"And I don't mean erroneously, either."
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1715.499,1716.439,No.
1979.78-599,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1716.439,1719.136,"And if it's not erroneous, it seems to me you do lose."
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1719.136,1724.778,I think that that is a constitutional decision and we have a statutory question before us.
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1733.781,1738.243,"I do not read the government's briefs the way you do, Counsel."
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1776.846,1778.979,"And that's our point, Your Honor."
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1780.1,1788.861,Don't you think they can make regulations prohibiting conduct which reasonably has a tendency to produce that result?
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1788.861,1789.002,No.
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1790.8,1792.033,Let me see if I understand you.
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1798.735,1804.203,"Mr. Chief Justice, with regard to the petition issue before the Court, the answer is no."
1979.78-599,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1806.187,1807.236,Because of the statute?
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1807.236,1810.166,Yes.
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1843.413,1850.636,"When you refer to the statute in response to that last question, what statute particularly and what language in that statute are you relying on?"
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1850.636,1852.227,I am relying on 1034.
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1852.227,1853.257,What language?
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1853.257,1857.373,The language says no person may restrict --
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1857.373,1858.167,What else?
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1858.167,1860.396,Any member --
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1860.396,1867.781,"Now, does any member mean anything other than any member?"
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1867.781,1868.642,"I think, Mr. Chief Justice --"
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1868.642,1875.799,"Communicating with a member of Congress, aren't they talking about a one-on-one communication there?"
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1875.799,1886.133,"I think that first they are not necessarily talking about a one-on-one contact, that as the court below found, that is not the outer limit of the language."
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1913.205,1916.35,I understand that last -- if you will tell me again.
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1916.35,1932.061,"It is our contention furthermore that the regulations here and the statute don't mesh the way they do in Glines, that an individual writing his Congressman in this case would require command approval before he signs that letter."
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1932.061,1935.369,"That would be directly contrary to the statute, if you read it that way."
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1935.369,1937.651,"Mr. Chief Justice, that is exactly our position."
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1937.651,1951.134,Don't you read regulations which are promulgated pursuant to a statute in a way that is consistent with the statute if it is possible to do so?
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,1953.104,1956.635,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, it is."
1979.78-599,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2035.325,2052.154,I take it your position would also foreclose any regulation that said that anyone who wants to send a petition to his Congressman must first show it to the commanding officer?
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,2054.464,2056.942,"Yes, Mr. Justice White, that is correct."
1979.78-599,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2056.942,2059.083,Just so you would know what is going on.
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,2059.083,2060.139,That's correct.
1979.78-599,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2066.882,2093.19,"And you would also I suppose say that if the commanding officer Just happened to find out about the petition and thought that the petition was not protected by the statute, that he nevertheless couldn't take the petition out of circulation pending disciplinary proceedings?"
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,2093.19,2095.068,"No, I think --"
1979.78-599,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2095.068,2096.123,Why not?
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,2108.595,2113.093,I think that our position is the government is not helpless in this situation.
1979.78-599,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2114.92,2124.653,"You mean the commanding officer, instead of being able to disapprove it, can just bring disciplinary proceedings and stop it?"
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,2124.653,2132.156,If it is of a nature that would violate one of the code sections of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
1979.78-599,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2136.531,2140.466,You mean if in the commander's opinion it does?
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,2140.466,2147.832,"That is certainly the basis on which the commander brings criminal proceedings, yes, Mr. Justice White."
1979.78-599,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2154.323,2172.996,Did the government or anybody else ever claim in this case that a petition such as involved in this case really didn't restrict communications with a Congressman until and unless permission is refused?
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,2181.521,2193.714,"It is certainly our position, that to require submission, whether approval or showing, is a restriction and that was the whole basis of the statute being passed."
1979.78-599,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2212.53,2220.012,"Well, it is a pretty prior restraint to take the petition out of circulation pending military discipline."
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,2220.012,2221.874,I think that a commander --
1979.78-599,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2221.874,2229.587,"There hasn't been any adjudication or anything, you just take it out of circulation."
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,2229.587,2262.283,The military court martial process permits such response and I think that helps prove the correctness of the Court of Appeals opinion below and that is that the military criminal process in fact is quite powerful and can certainly deal with the issues that the government thinks are necessary here for purposes of national security.
1979.78-599,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2307.642,2311.772,"So what if we disagree with you on the statute, is the case over?"
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,2311.772,2320.733,"No, I believe that this Court is then faced with the constitutional question."
1979.78-599,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2320.733,2325.013,And what then do you say about Greer?
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,2325.013,2331.042,Then I think that Greer presents greater problems.
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2351.43,2370.533,"As between a civilian, a Dr. Spock circulating some material on a base and a major or a captain, which would the military be entitled to think would be more disruptive of military discipline and morale?"
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,2370.533,2374.757,"I have no idea, Mr. Chief Justice, what the military would think about --"
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2374.757,2376.012,"Now, come, come, come."
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,2376.012,2378.728,-- which would be more disruptive.
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2378.728,2380.643,You don't have any idea which?
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,2380.643,2382.706,No.
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2382.706,2395.611,"Let's say you were a private first class, which would you be more impressed by, Dr. Spock or the major's view or, as someone suggested in the other case, the master sergeant?"
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,2395.611,2399.728,I don't know as a private what I would think with regard to those distributions.
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2400.982,2405.426,What do you think the military is entitled to think?
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,2405.426,2408.274,"I don't know what the military is entitled to think, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2424.761,2429.516,"But without prior approval is all we are talking about here, aren't we?"
1979.78-599,1,15832,alan_dranitzke,,2441.569,2442.894,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.78-599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2460.411,2463.803,Mr. Jones.
1979.78-599,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2463.803,2468.235,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-599,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2518.291,2521.37,"you talk about the regulation, you are talking about the --"
1979.78-599,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2521.37,2523.766,The one in the --
1979.78-599,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2523.766,2532.629,"-- the one in the directive, 1325.6, that is set out on pages 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of your brief?"
1979.78-599,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2532.629,2533.357,"No, I'm not."
1979.78-599,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2542.123,2544.244,"Pages 4, 5, and 6 of your brief."
1979.78-599,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2544.244,2548.022,Right.
1979.78-599,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2612.151,2623.043,"Well, it would certainly apply to a letter signed jointly by a sailor and everybody in his division, wouldn't it?"
1979.78-599,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2623.043,2626.284,"Well, it is our position that it wasn't intended to."
1979.78-599,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2626.284,2629.582,Or by two ensigns who room together on a ship?
1979.78-599,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2629.582,2633.517,I think that the regulation wouldn't apply to them.
1979.78-599,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2634.349,2639.597,But the statute would.
1979.78-599,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2639.597,2648.338,I think the question of whether the statute would be applicable there is a question that we haven't addressed and I am not sure what the answer would be.
1979.78-599,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2707.963,2708.662,"Thank you, gentlemen."
