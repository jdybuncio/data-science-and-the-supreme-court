2012.12-167,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.904,"We will hear argument next in Case 12-167, United States v. Davila."
2012.12-167,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,8.856,9.872,"Yes, Your Honor, thank you."
2012.12-167,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,9.872,10.389,Thank you.
2012.12-167,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,10.389,13.391,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-167,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,46.095,48.481,May -- may I ask you a question about that?
2012.12-167,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,94.628,110.221,"--Well, first of all, Your Honor, I'd respectfully disagree with the notion that just because Respondent's counsel was advising him to plead guilty, that Respondent's counsel had so advocated -- so abdicated his representation that he couldn't be expected to object to an error that the judge made."
2012.12-167,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,139.074,145.227,"Well, suppose you just stick with Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, or perhaps not even a hypothetical, what happened in this case."
2012.12-167,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,165.391,172.712,"Well, Your Honor, if Respondent wants to make an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on collateral review, he can make that."
2012.12-167,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,191.958,193.291,It doesn't really matter--
2012.12-167,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,193.291,196.243,But this is a lawyer that had filed an Anders brief.
2012.12-167,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,220.693,223.895,"Well, Your Honor, let me just say one other word about that."
2012.12-167,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,253.347,253.949,--Excuse me.
2012.12-167,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,265.305,266.606,"--That's exactly right, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.12-167,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,278.881,297.209,One of the most powerful arguments of your adversary is that in the most common of situations -- and it's how I read the advisory notes -- it's going to be awfully difficult to say that a judge's intervention hasn't influenced a defendant.
2012.12-167,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,328.764,330.064,--Well--
2012.12-167,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,330.064,336.318,"It has to be an awfully high presumption, otherwise, you make mockery of the rule, in my mind."
2012.12-167,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,336.318,341.472,"--Well, first of all, Your Honor, I want to take issue with the notion that all Rule 11(c)(1) errors are alike."
2012.12-167,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,386.084,395.724,"Well, I don't disagree that one doesn't' have to use the word “ rebuttable presumption ”, but there has to be a strong prejudice factor--"
2012.12-167,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,395.724,396.874,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2012.12-167,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,396.874,400.01,"--whether rebuttable or not, assumed in a judge's intervention."
2012.12-167,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,400.01,403.628,--I think that's already built into Rule 52 in a couple of different ways.
2012.12-167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,437.551,438.151,But that's the problem.
2012.12-167,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,500.709,512.516,"I have thought about that a little bit, Your Honor, and I'd say that trying to break Rule 11(c)(1) into different pieces and adopt different rules based on different kinds of error would be inappropriate, for three main reasons."
2012.12-167,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,608.18,625.373,"Mr. Feigin, is there any situation in which a -- a judge participating in a plea bargaining, any situation that would be prejudicial, that you recognize would be prejudicial, and if there is can you describe what that would be?"
2012.12-167,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,625.373,626.975,"Certainly, Your Honor."
2012.12-167,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,652.709,655.226,What -- what makes it prejudicial and this not?
2012.12-167,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,655.226,658.78,"--Well, let me take -- let me take a different example."
2012.12-167,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,726.757,740.315,"On that point, do we know -- do we know if the district judge who did preside at the plea hearing knew about the episode with the magistrate 3 months earlier?"
2012.12-167,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,740.315,744.136,I don't -- I'm not aware of anything in the record that reflects whether he did or did not.
2012.12-167,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,749.354,750.956,The same for the prosecutor?
2012.12-167,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,750.956,758.443,"--Your Honor, my understanding is the government was not aware of this because it occurred in an ex parte hearing in which the government wasn't in attendance."
2012.12-167,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,764.447,781.909,Suppose there's a case where the -- the defendant would not have pled guilty without the court saying something inappropriate about it's a case where the defendant would be crazy to go to trial because the trial would lead to a much more severe sentence.
2012.12-167,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,782.927,783.677,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-167,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,793.45,805.524,That's -- what happens under -- under the rule if the magistrate asked that the defendant be excused -- I don't know quite how you do that; the defendant has to be present.
2012.12-167,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,819.634,822.219,"Well, Your Honor, I think that's--"
2012.12-167,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,822.219,824.521,It's awfully hard to have a hypothetical where you exclude the defendant.
2012.12-167,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,824.521,844.667,"--Well, Your Honor, this actually happened in a non-hypothetical fashion in a case we cite in our reply brief, called In re United States, in which the judge was apparently unhappy with the Government's conduct in that case and had the prosecutor and defense counsel in chambers, or at least in court, without the defendant's presence, and was urging the parties to reach a plea agreement."
2012.12-167,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,857.559,866.931,What -- what if the judge sees what the judge thinks is ineffective assistance of counsel under our decision in Lafler taking place?
2012.12-167,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,868.45,899.486,"--So -- Your Honor, I think one of our main concerns in bringing this case before the Court is the interaction of this Court's decisions in Lafler and Frye with Rule 11(c)(1), and Frye suggests that one way a judge can try to guard against a later claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is to conduct a colloquy with the defendant -- not a colloquy, but a discussion with the defendant -- during the initial proceedings to try to establish that he understands the consequences of his plea and that he's receiving effective assistance of counsel."
2012.12-167,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1007.523,1008.407,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,1014.927,1018.045,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-167,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1031.703,1038.274,I -- I don't want to interrupt your opening because I think -- I just didn't hear your first -- “ by foregoing ”?
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,1038.274,1038.876,By foregoing--
2012.12-167,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1038.876,1039.493,By foregoing.
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,1039.493,1040.643,--his trial rights.
2012.12-167,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1053.552,1059.289,You're creating a sui generis structural error analysis.
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,1081.302,1083.321,"--That's -- that's not correct, Your Honor."
2012.12-167,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1092.76,1093.643,Assume I accept that argument.
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,1093.643,1095.045,So this Court has--
2012.12-167,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1095.045,1097.379,You're -- you're saying this is a structural error always.
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,1097.379,1120.261,"--And this Court has, at the very least, strongly suggested that substantial rights when you're dealing with a structural error are affected, per se, where they've left the door open to some additional analysis is the fourth prong of the plain error standard where the Court is called upon to consider whether the error affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings."
2012.12-167,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1215.139,1220.36,What -- what if you have the situation where the judge is conveying purely factual information?
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,1248.027,1254.949,"--That's right, Your Honor, and this raises a question about what the scope of the participation prohibition actually is."
2012.12-167,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1290.572,1300.312,"Well, we do need to have a good sense of how far your -- your per se structural argument is going to reach before we decide -- in deciding whether it's appropriate or not."
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,1300.312,1303.097,"--That's right, Your Honor, and there are -- there are two ways to break it down."
2012.12-167,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1319.476,1326.296,"Well, on that, what's the most minor thing that the government could do that would still count as a Rule 11(c)(1) violation?"
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,1326.296,1329.414,--The most minor thing that the government could do or a judge could do?
2012.12-167,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1329.414,1329.947,That the judge could do.
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,1330.481,1335.818,"Well, the most minor -- we think that Rule 11 is concerned with judicial pressure to plead guilty."
2012.12-167,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1352.447,1355.582,What -- what about the hypothetical that I posed?
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,1355.582,1367.956,"--So that hypothetical, if -- if we were talking about a purely informational statement like that, then, actually, we don't think that that is likely to be a violation of Rule 11(c)(1)."
2012.12-167,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1403.546,1412.168,"So if he -- if it's my example and he says, this is what I've done the past ten times, so you ought to think long and hard about whether a bargain for one year is a good deal."
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,1412.168,1417.805,So -- and -- and this is getting -- and then the judge may well be crossing the line.
2012.12-167,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1418.672,1421.591,"It's kind of a fine line to -- to draw, isn't it?"
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,1421.591,1424.226,--There's no question that there will be close cases.
2012.12-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1446.825,1468.172,"Mr. Yablon, the -- the case that you're presenting would be quite strong if the same judge -- if the magistrate judge also presided at the plea hearing, but here we have two factors that are special in this case."
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,1512.701,1531.68,"And at no point during the plea colloquy hearing is the district judge in any way acknowledging or disavowing the magistrate judge's comments, which, we submit, there is at least a very strong probability that those comments affected the defendant's thinking and the reason that the defendant is at the Rule 11 hearing in the first place."
2012.12-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1531.68,1540.62,"But -- but the -- but the judge did ask, do you recognize that your -- your conduct satisfied the elements of the conspiracy?"
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,1553.861,1561.7,"And, of course, in that situation, the defendant is likely not thinking about pressure that may come from the judiciary itself."
2012.12-167,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1574.974,1578.126,"Mr. Yablon, I agree with you totally."
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,1625.04,1629.928,--That statement reveals just how little confidence we actually should have in the plea decision that he made.
2012.12-167,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1671.088,1682.896,"But that is the whole point, which is this may be IAC, but I don't know how -- how you prove that what the magistrate judge said to him led to his decision."
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,1682.896,1684.146,--And we don't need to prove that.
2012.12-167,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1684.146,1690.65,That's only if we don't accept that prejudice is a consideration here.
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,1690.65,1703.041,"Either way, if you were looking at whether this conduct should be viewed as inherently prejudicial the reason that you might do that is because you might think that at least in all of these cases there might at least be a reasonable probability that it would affect where the defendant is."
2012.12-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1734.327,1747.737,"You want us to basically not apply the 11(h), the harmless error business, and you basically want to prevent bizarre results by making a tough definition of the word “ participate ”."
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,1770.352,1775.404,"Let me address that in two ways, because we have two separate arguments and I want to try to keep them distinct."
2012.12-167,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1868.016,1874.835,"Well, Mr. Yablon, have we ever said that about the violation of a rule of criminal procedure, that it's structural error no matter what the circumstances?"
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,1874.835,1879.906,"First, Justice Sotomayor, this Court has said that rules of criminal -- I'm so, sorry--"
2012.12-167,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1879.906,1885.125,That's not the first time that has happened.
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,1885.125,1886.727,--And I should be--
2012.12-167,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1886.727,1887.86,"You worked for her, too, I think."
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,1887.86,1890.445,--That makes it that much more embarrassing.
2012.12-167,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1956.721,1964.227,"I would think, Mr. Yablon, that one of the effects of what you are asking us to do is that the rule would just get narrower and narrower."
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,1988.943,1994.163,So we think that our approach is consistent with how the rule is in fact meant to be interpreted.
2012.12-167,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2017.445,2025.051,"But you are arguing for a narrower interpretation of Rule 11(c)(1) than a number of courts of appeals have adopted, isn't that correct?"
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,2025.051,2032.288,--I believe there are some decisions out that have adopted probably a broader construction than we think is necessary and appropriate.
2012.12-167,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2085.339,2100.782,Could you say something about Mr. Feigin's comments regarding what a judge can and cannot do if the judge thinks that he or she sees a violation of Lafler and Frye taking place?
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,2100.782,2106.686,So there ought to be things that a judge is able to do in that situation.
2012.12-167,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2156.517,2163.772,"What if the judge knows as a result of pretrial motions that the evidence in the case is very, very strong."
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,2198.529,2210.336,"Well, the judge's role in that situation is -- is not to step in as defense counsel or, in effect, as second prosecutor."
2012.12-167,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2233.4,2235.969,It just puts -- puts the judge in a very difficult position.
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,2260.952,2270.975,"--And if this is happening in the context of active discussions of whether the defendant should or should not take a plea, then that -- that may well cross the line."
2012.12-167,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2270.975,2277.981,"I don't know when it can happen, because there's no colloquy when there's a guilty plea."
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,2280.214,2284.301,"I think -- isn't it the opposite, Justice Kennedy?"
2012.12-167,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2286.217,2287.586,"No, no -- you're correct."
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,2288.619,2303.346,"--So -- so taking -- so in that instance, again, you have a situation that may not be different from situations that arise in completely different contexts, where the attorney is doing something that's ineffective, for example, and the judge just doesn't know about it."
2012.12-167,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2314.237,2320.725,"Now -- well, but you've answered a lot of these questions by saying, you know, it's hard to draw the line and, you know, maybe in that case, maybe in this case."
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,2354.129,2356.831,That's actually not accurate.
2012.12-167,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2383.648,2394.539,"I would say in both of those examples, the line -- the gray area, if you were, is really quite narrow than here, where almost every time you've been asked a question about a difficult hypothetical, you say, well, maybe, maybe not."
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,2406.246,2410.198,"--And, of course, I'm being asked all of the difficult hypotheticals."
2012.12-167,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2412.15,2420.773,"Yes, but if you were -- if you were arguing whether or not it's -- it's categorical error when the magistrate conducts voir dire, it'd be pretty hard for somebody to come up with a tough hypothetical."
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,2420.773,2423.142,"--In that instance, yes."
2012.12-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2430.679,2439.985,"--Mr. Yablon, one problem with calling this structural error is that it's not so clear that this is a -- a bad thing."
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,2481.747,2487.133,"--Your Honor, no jurisdiction endorses judicial exhortations to plead guilty."
2012.12-167,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2599.206,2601.674,"But that seems a bit odd, don't you think, Mr. Yablon?"
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,2610.696,2619.052,"It would factor into the prejudice analysis that the Court undertakes, but it also is a reason just to -- to draw the line."

2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,2685.447,2701.689,"The answer is no, and that would be -- and we would urge the Court that if it does not accept our primary submission, that it make clear that judicial exhortations like this are highly unlikely to be harmless."
2012.12-167,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2760.062,2773.987,"How do we -- if we're giving this guidance, what do we say about the fact that he had a different judge subsequent to this, that he filed a speedy trial motion after this coercion, to suggest that he wasn't coerced all that much."
2012.12-167,1,40841,robert_m_yablon,,2776.404,2783.343,"--You should say that those inferences are not adequate to overcome the inference that you draw from this type of participation, particularly here."

2012.12-167,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2857.558,2871.401,"Mr. Feigin, can I ask you the same question that I asked Mr. Yablon: Do you know of any cases where in these -- where there are really core violations, where a judge exhorts the defendant to plea it -- does the Court ever find that non-prejudicial?"
2012.12-167,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2871.401,2880.257,--I am aware of one or two State cases in which the court has looked at the passage of time as a reason why that kind of error wouldn't have been prejudicial.

2012.12-167,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2905.939,2912.293,"--Well, Your Honor, there -- my -- I'm not going to go so far as to endorse the results they've reached in every single case--"

2012.12-167,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2912.812,2928.155,"--but I think insofar as they approach the matter that -- you know, if there's a fairly serious error and the defendant pleads guilty right after that, that that's very likely absence of extenuating circumstances to be prejudicial; we don't have a problem with that."
2012.12-167,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2930.44,2932.14,"Thank you, counsel."
