2005.04-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,3.459,We'll hear argument first in Will v. Hallock.
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,5.826,11.854,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,46.117,53.159,"And in enacting section 1291, Congress specified that only final decisions would be appealable."
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,53.159,60.522,"That's right, Your Honor, and this Court has adopted a practical rather than technical construction of that statute."
2005.04-1332,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,94.394,100.05,"Well, you can... you can say the same thing of... of res judicata, that there is a complete bar."
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,112.777,125.374,"--Well, Your Honor, the... the Court recognized in the Digital Equipment case that even a claim of res judicata could correctly be characterized as a right to be free from suit, but it said that that wasn't enough."
2005.04-1332,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,130.036,130.651,Digital I remember.
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,130.651,132.095,--And... and the Court--
2005.04-1332,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,132.095,132.526,So do I.
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,133.057,134.372,--I'm sure you do.
2005.04-1332,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,152.325,170.148,"But in Digital Equipment, I think that we said that the collateral order doctrine is narrow, it should stay that way, and that we should give it... we should be very reluctant to expand the practical construction of section 1291."
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,173.539,187.18,"Well, I don't think so, Your Honor, because this is like the other claims of immunity that the Court has recognized warrant collateral appeal in Mitchell v. Forsyth or Nixon v. Fitzgerald."
2005.04-1332,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,188.173,190.98,"It's certainly broader... it's certainly broader than res judicata anyway, isn't it?"
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,205.252,205.886,"--That's right, Your Honor."
2005.04-1332,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,248.382,258.293,"Well, I'm... I'm assuming that it's not res judicata in... in the narrow sense of the doctrine, but it's... it's still a bar that depends upon a... a prior judgment."
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,280.52,291.162,"Well, certainly there is no categorical rule that claims in the nature of claim preclusion are not eligible for immediate appeal under collateral order."
2005.04-1332,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,303.078,318.935,"But a double jeopardy claim is... is a claim in which there is an... a... an immunity textually conferred by the... the Constitution, or at least, we... we have thought it... the guarantee does not make an awful lot of practical sense, unless you read it that way."
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,322.314,329.114,"Well, the Constitution does not use the word immunity, nor does the Westfall Act use the word immunity."
2005.04-1332,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,329.114,330.619,"And there is... in fact, there's no immunity."
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,353.981,355.043,That's right.
2005.04-1332,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,372.255,381.855,"Well, I... I take it Justice Ginsburg's point... and it's my concern as well... is that if the Bivens action is brought first, there's no protection of the Government against multiple actions."
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,387.089,388.393,"Well, I'm not sure that--"
2005.04-1332,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,388.393,393.982,And that's not... that's not a very strong policy interest to vindicate by expanding the collateral order doctrine.
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,393.982,399.679,"--Well, it... it's... it's not entirely clear that the United States would be subject to a second suit."
2005.04-1332,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,404.754,408.013,"Well, it depends on... it depends on... on how the case was resolved."
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,408.013,408.795,--That's... that's right.
2005.04-1332,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,422.116,432.256,"It's hard to accept that argument given that if the lawyer had sued in the reverse order, there would be the same morale."
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,462.457,475.085,"Well, Your Honor, the... the statute protects against the... the cost of repetitive litigation, the harassment of the employee of multiple suits."
2005.04-1332,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,478.947,487.541,What was the harassment that this employee experienced in the... in the FTCA claim that was dismissed?
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,487.541,492.927,"--It... well, in this particular FTCA claim, there... there was no discovery."
2005.04-1332,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,530.03,538.015,Did that... did that involve the employee or it was just legal argument involving lawyers representing the United States?
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,538.015,539.609,--It would certainly involve the employee.
2005.04-1332,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,575.358,580.923,"Counsel, can I ask you sort of a basic question that I don't really think is adequately addressed in the briefs?"
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,587.363,587.924,Yes.
2005.04-1332,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,587.924,597.693,And 2680... the introductory language of 2680 is the provisions of this chapter shall not apply to such cases.
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,608.195,618.494,2676 makes the... the scope of its application turn on whether there has been a judgment and an action under section 1346(b).
2005.04-1332,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,618.494,626.811,But my first question is how does 2676 apply if it's in the chapter that 2680 says shall not apply to... to things in the exception?
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,626.811,638.605,"Well, Your Honor, the... that view of the language, shall not apply, would be inconsistent with this Court's decisions both in United States v. Smith and in FDIC v. Meyer."
2005.04-1332,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,663.831,667.333,But they held that the... the action simply didn't apply in... in that case.
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,679.71,681.093,"Well, what they--"
2005.04-1332,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,681.093,682.147,--which is what also happens here.
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,682.147,688.224,"--Well, take another example why... why you couldn't read the... the shall not apply language in that way."
2005.04-1332,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,730.162,731.827,"Go... go through that again, would you?"
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,731.827,747.381,The... the... 2679(a) says that the authority of an agency to sue and be sued in its own name shall not extend to claims cognizable under section 1346(b).
2005.04-1332,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,785.066,785.338,No.
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,787.052,793.772,And... and a... a claim with respect to the miscarriage of mail is one that comes within the exception.
2005.04-1332,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,810.912,847.544,"I guess it's true, is it... I'm testing my own understanding of this... that if, in fact, shall not apply meant anything in that chapter, if you had a State and that State gave a State law remedy for, say, detaining property or for loss of mail or something, then that State law remedy would continue in existence because the thing in the law that sets aside that State court remedy is a different part of the same chapter--"
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,847.544,848.005,That's right.
2005.04-1332,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,848.005,849.299,--namely 2679(b)?
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,849.299,850.052,Right.
2005.04-1332,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,850.793,855.789,But the whole point of the Westfall Act is to get rid of those State causes of action.
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,855.789,864.164,"--Exactly, and in that sense, that reading of shall not apply is simply inconsistent with the Court's holding in United States v. Smith."
2005.04-1332,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,864.164,868.015,But the language does seem to say it.
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,868.015,877.374,"Well, I think what it... what it means is that... what it... what it has been understood to mean is that the United States' waiver of sovereign immunity."
2005.04-1332,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,962.158,893.362,All right.
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,964.506,965.569,"--Well, there--"
2005.04-1332,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,965.569,966.831,A lot of things.
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,966.831,968.578,--there are any number of things wrong in our view.
2005.04-1332,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1004.024,1005.771,Could the two claims have been brought together?
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1038.739,1044.376,"--Well, Your Honor, obviously that... that issue is not presented here because here we have two separate litigation--"
2005.04-1332,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1044.376,1045.269,I'm... I'm asking--
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1045.269,1045.699,--But--
2005.04-1332,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1045.699,1057.095,"--does the Government have a position on that, whether you can combine a suit against the United States under the Tort Claims Act with a suit against the individual officers under Bivens."
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1057.095,1070.265,"--Well, the... the consistent view of the courts of appeals and district courts over 50 years has been that the judgment bar does have some application even when the claims are litigated simultaneously."
2005.04-1332,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1083.022,1083.976,But I want you to go back before we get to a judgment.
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1086.321,1086.853,--Can it be brought?
2005.04-1332,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1087.574,1095.539,Could this lawyer have brought the FTCA act complaint and pled in the alternative the Bivens claim?
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1095.539,1101.115,It... it can certainly be brought because the judgment bar only comes into effect when there's been a judgment.
2005.04-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1125.76,1134.155,"Counsel, what if the first case against the Government were dismissed because of a finding that the employee was acting beyond the scope of his authority?"
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1141.519,1144.758,"--Well, in... in a footnote--"
2005.04-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1144.758,1145.018,I read your--
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1145.018,1146.713,--in our brief we suggest it might not--
2005.04-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1146.713,1147.384,--I read footnote 5.
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1153.181,1167.876,"--And... and in fact, in... in re reading FDIC v. Meyer in preparation for oral argument, footnote 7 of that decision suggests that that would be a judgment in an action under 1346(b)."
2005.04-1332,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1213.693,1228.307,Your theory would cover the case where the FTCA claim drops out because the employee didn't file the administrative claim within the... what is it?
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1228.757,1239.129,"It... Your Honor, it would not, I think, cover a claim that... where the dismissal was curable, where the person could go and exhaust their claim."
2005.04-1332,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1241.517,1244.165,But don't they have a short span where they have to bring that administrative claim?
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1244.165,1246.472,--They have... they have 2 years to bring the administrative claim.
2005.04-1332,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1256.621,1259.762,And the suit is tossed out because one of those deadlines was met.
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1267.164,1268.769,--That's right.
2005.04-1332,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1309.342,1314.375,I'd like to pursue the question I asked you earlier because I really didn't fully understand your answer.
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1334.376,1340.595,--I... I think I'm going to borrow Justice Breyer's response because it's... it's a little clearer than the... than the point I was trying to make.
2005.04-1332,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1350.064,1350.624,That's correct.
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1350.624,1357.074,"--precisely the question that was addressed in... in United States v. Smith, and the Court said that... that it did apply."
2005.04-1332,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1357.074,1371.256,"It follows that 2679(b) does not apply, but you're just have... working on a blank slate with no provision of the Federal Tort Claims Act affecting a waiver of sovereign immunity or imposing any kind of judgment bar."
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1371.256,1377.175,"But if 2679(b) did not apply, there would be no basis for substituting the United States and having the claim dismissed."
2005.04-1332,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1398.72,1399.021,Correct.
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1399.021,1415.862,"But in FDIC v. Meyer, the Court was very clear that the FTCA is the kind of case which defines jurisdiction by the scope of the waiver of immunity and to... the claims to which the United States has rendered itself liable."
2005.04-1332,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1425.551,1428.029,But you left out one word that I think is important there.
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1438.218,1440.044,--It is true that--
2005.04-1332,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1440.044,1442.562,They wanted to get rid of the State tort suits--
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1442.562,1443.483,--The... the--
2005.04-1332,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1443.483,1443.984,--in part.
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1445.271,1451.027,--2679(b) applies only to... to State law causes of action.
2005.04-1332,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1451.027,1451.097,All right.
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1474.084,1474.687,That's right.
2005.04-1332,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1474.687,1475.75,That's right?
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1475.75,1476.351,I--
2005.04-1332,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1476.351,1477.035,Okay.
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1479.29,1480.044,"--Well, certainly--"
2005.04-1332,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1480.044,1480.394,--Okay.
2005.04-1332,0,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1480.394,1488.848,"--we... we believe that United States v. Smith was right, and that shall not apply cannot have the meaning that Justice Stevens was trying to attribute to it for that reason."
2005.04-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1494.204,1494.777,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,1498.339,1506.994,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1546.292,1554.618,"But what... what significance do you give to the word to complete, as to whether it's a complete bar?"
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,1564.927,1571.859,--I don't think complete bar means anything more than bar.
2005.04-1332,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1582.941,1586.895,"Well, not... there... there are exceptions to the statute of limitations."
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,1600.916,1608.94,"--That's right, but when... when the bar applies, it's... it's an absolute bar."
2005.04-1332,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1676.323,1683.746,"Yes, but that... that... see, that's what's... I'm not at all certain about this, whether they have an appeal, whether they don't have an appeal."
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,1768.179,1768.78,Well--
2005.04-1332,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1768.78,1769.704,So put in--
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,1769.704,1771.199,--I don't--
2005.04-1332,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1771.199,1772.192,--put in the whole bag.
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,1785.41,1786.694,"--Well, a couple things."
2005.04-1332,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1957.697,1959.404,Your rule would be this.
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,1984.068,1985.431,That's--
2005.04-1332,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1985.431,1994.488,"But if under the Westfall Act you could sue him, depending on the order, he doesn't get an appeal."
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,1994.488,1998.87,--That's right because defense is based on the order of suits.
2005.04-1332,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2023.404,2033.555,What... what's wrong with the Government's distinction of Digital that here you have a policy embodied in a statute as opposed to a private settlement agreement?
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2033.555,2051.498,"The... Digital explains that if you have a right not to stand trial that is set forth in a statute or constitutional provision, that the court isn't going to second guess the importance of that right."
2005.04-1332,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2105.19,2113.576,"Well, I suppose if there was no appellate court jurisdiction, we're not going to resolve the merits of that question."
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2113.576,2116.394,That's right.
2005.04-1332,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2123.696,2125.651,"Well, you would at the end of the road."
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2143.785,2152.913,"--That's right, Justice Ginsburg, and that's exactly why this defense is effectively reviewable after final judgment as opposed to now."
2005.04-1332,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2152.913,2158.318,There's no question that it would be... it doesn't die if you don't have an interlocutory review.
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2163.822,2174.463,"That's true to this... just as is true with defenses based on statute of limitations or res judicata or, you know, a whole host of defenses--"
2005.04-1332,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2174.463,2177.053,Could the district court have certified the question?
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2177.053,2180.011,--The district court could have certified it and... and--
2005.04-1332,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2180.011,2182.276,And was there a request made to do that or--
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2182.276,2182.517,--Yes.
2005.04-1332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2184.071,2185.114,"Yes, but the petitioners requested it."
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2187.712,2191.414,I don't know.
2005.04-1332,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2193.119,2201.716,"The district judge said I'm not going to give you 1292(b) certification, but... but there's Cohen against Beneficial out there."
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2207.162,2219.819,"Well, actually the petitioners filed a notice of appeal before the 1292(b) motion had been decided and then sought a 1292(b) certification."
2005.04-1332,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2223.41,2228.807,"But I think the district... the district judge was aware of Cohen against Beneficial, and I think referred to it."
2005.04-1332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2231.305,2233.26,Yes.
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2242.027,2247.753,"--Well, I don't think he expressed any view about whether the case satisfied the Cohen doctrine."
2005.04-1332,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2247.753,2252.026,"No, but he mentioned that there was... he mentioned Cohen."
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2252.026,2258.416,"Yes, but he... he didn't think the issue warranted an immediate appeal."
2005.04-1332,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2284.353,2294.372,"Is it... is it... maybe this is an incorrect way to look at it, but there is a relationship between the merits and the interlocutory review decision."
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2322.539,2354.746,"The Court's cases allowing and disallowing collateral order appeals don't turn on the... the litigation efficiencies that will be obtained if the court goes forward, but rather on whether the issue or the defense that... that the petitioner is seeking to appeal actually fits the stringent requirements of the Cohen doctrine."
2005.04-1332,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2394.405,2401.615,"Perhaps you should go on now to the question, assuming that it is immediately appealable."
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2401.615,2416.411,"If the Court reaches the second question, the res judicata foundation of the bar shows as well why the Second Circuit's decision on the substantive question should be affirmed."
2005.04-1332,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2527.242,2539.119,Did you... did you make the argument or the point that Justice Stevens articulated earlier about the... the provisions of this chapter not applying and that including 2676?
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2539.119,2544.525,"--No, we didn't make it, and--"
2005.04-1332,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2544.525,2546.883,Does it sound good or bad to you now?
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2547.093,2574.938,"--We did make a similar argument that 2680 states that 1346(b) shall not apply and because the judgment bar only applies to actions under 1346(b), it's something of a contradiction to say that an action that... to which 1346(b) shall not apply at the same time an action under 1346(b)."
2005.04-1332,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2683.111,2684.195,I don't... I don't understand.
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2777.687,2785.742,"Well, like application of the judgment bar, one distinction would be that it turns on the order in which things occur, and in--"
2005.04-1332,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2785.742,2788.78,"I mean, that... that would be to overturn the reasoning of Smith."
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2789.341,2789.761,--But the reasoning--
2005.04-1332,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2789.761,2790.004,--Yes.
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2790.004,2797.837,"--Well, the reasoning of Smith is not based on the language of 2680."
2005.04-1332,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2819.652,2822.431,"So, in effect, they didn't... the Court didn't consider this argument in Smith."
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2822.431,2824.676,--Right.
2005.04-1332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2832.964,2835.802,The main holding in Smith was that the foreign country exception applied.
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2837.949,2839.904,--Right.
2005.04-1332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2846.504,2851.017,And the... and the plaintiff couldn't... I don't see how that is at all inconsistent with what I'm suggesting here.
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2852.03,2853.935,"Well, I don't think it's inconsistent."
2005.04-1332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2879.231,2895.529,"Well, looking at it very broadly, it doesn't seem to me that if the United States did not waive sovereign immunity for a particular category of tort case, that a dismissal of such a tort case should bar an... an action by an individual against an individual defendant, just looking at it in... in a global sense."
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2902.513,2903.887,I agree entirely.
2005.04-1332,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2912.131,2917.658,"But we... this case is about the interpretation of 2676, as we took it."
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,2945.812,2950.859,"--No, the statute doesn't say what it means by judgment."
2005.04-1332,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3069.114,3081.261,"What is the... as a practical matter, though, what is the great burden on the plaintiffs in requiring them to sue the individual defendants first if they're concerned about the judgment bar?"
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3081.261,3092.513,"In... in many cases, if not most cases, an... a plaintiff won't have both remedies available."
2005.04-1332,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3164.599,3167.259,"Well, you don't... you don't have to bring them simultaneously."
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3171.862,3174.991,Bring the individual... bring suit... the Bivens suit first?
2005.04-1332,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3182.654,3187.167,"A Bivens suit is pretty hard to prove, a lot harder than proving a case of negligence."
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3187.167,3189.015,--Yes.
2005.04-1332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3208.481,3213.847,"And plaintiffs, generally, like to sue... sue solvent defendants too I think."
2005.04-1332,1,17307,allison_m_zieve,,3214.57,3215.862,Yes.
2005.04-1332,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3307.119,3307.68,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.04-1332,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3312.415,3314.069,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2005.04-1332,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3372.915,3393.349,"The thing you haven't answered that I think is troubling everybody is why is... why is that... I mean, if you could come up with some explanation of why that concern for morale only arises after there has been a... a judgment in the suit against the Government."
2005.04-1332,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3406.869,3410.468,"--Well, Your Honor, I... I admit that Congress--"
2005.04-1332,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3410.468,3411.622,Give me a good reason for that.
2005.04-1332,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3411.622,3415.905,--Congress addressed the... only part of... of the problem.
2005.04-1332,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3537.101,3546.559,What about 2679(b)(2) of the Westfall Act which says the Government doesn't get substituted for the employee in a Bivens claim?
2005.04-1332,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3557.412,3571.893,"With respect to section 2676, Bivens claims today, after the enactment of the Westfall Act, stand in the same footing as common law claims stood prior to the enactment of the Westfall Act."
2005.04-1332,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3611.985,3621.835,"And if... if they decided to pursue a Bivens claims... a Bivens claim, doesn't the... the Government often undertake the representation of the Government employees in those cases?"
2005.04-1332,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3621.835,3622.316,That's right.
2005.04-1332,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3632.425,3636.425,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
