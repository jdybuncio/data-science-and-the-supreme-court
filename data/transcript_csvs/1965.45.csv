1965.45,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,308.246,310.895,Was there an organizing campaign?
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,310.895,318.937,It was said in the Circuit Court's opinion that there was an organizational campaign.
1965.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,318.937,320.32,What does the record show?
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,320.32,321.774,The record does not show.
1965.45,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,344.398,346.72,Was there any evidence on this campaign?
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,346.72,347.196,"No, sir."
1965.45,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,434.127,439.69,The charge was based entirely and exclusively on this --
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,439.69,445.341,Based exclusively on the leaflet containing the defamatory material -- yes sir.
1965.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,445.341,451.561,As I understand you to say that Mr. Linn was specifically mentioned in this --
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,451.561,452.324,Yes sir.
1965.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,454.36,454.529,Where does --
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,454.529,454.94,Pardon.
1965.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,454.94,456.986,Where does his name appear?
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,456.986,461.983,The leaflet had about 14 or 15 pages and in one place --
1965.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,461.983,464.112,Well I'm reading -- I'm reading with complaint.
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,464.112,470.016,It is not -- we don't describe the particular place in the complaint.
1965.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,509.704,510.863,Where do we find that?
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,510.863,513.105,"I don't see that it was printed in the record, sir."
1965.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,513.105,525.676,But how can we act on it if it isn't in the record that you -- and that do put in your complaint here what the dodger said?
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,525.676,543.884,"What -- well, I don't think really, the question of whether or not Mr. Linn was otherwise named has ever been raised either in the Court of Appeals, certainly not in the District Court, not in the Court of Appeals, and it has never been an issue as to whether or not, Linn was in fact named in the complaint."
1965.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,544.523,549.471,Well you just told -- you just said he was -- he was named in it and I identified it in your complaint.
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,549.471,551.177,"No, it is --"
1965.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,551.177,552.286,It is not in the record.
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,552.286,553.271,It is not in this record.
1965.45,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,553.821,566.044,"I've noticed on page five of the record, paragraph six that the complaint alleges that plaintiff is and was one of the managers referred to."
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,566.044,567.722,Yes sir.
1965.45,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,567.722,576.809,"Now those managers are the ones described in paragraph five, is that right?"
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,576.809,581.822,"Now, you're speaking about paragraph five of the complaint on page four of the record, sir."
1965.45,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,581.822,582.746,Yes.
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,582.746,585.903,Yes.
1965.45,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,585.903,599.28,Is that -- is the circular that is quoted in paragraph five of the complaint in the record?
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,599.28,600.843,The entire circular?
1965.45,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,600.843,605.6,Well you quote they are now that we find out Pinkerton had a large volume of work and so on.
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,605.6,606.045,"Yes, sir."
1965.45,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,606.045,609.661,Is that quoted -- is that in the record the whole circular?
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,609.661,614.661,The whole circular was submitted as an exhibit to the complaint in the District Court.
1965.45,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,621.125,622.544,But it's in the District Court records.
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,622.544,624.867,It is in the District Court record.
1965.45,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,624.867,626.264,Is that record here?
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,626.264,626.698,Pardon.
1965.45,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,626.698,629.045,Is that record here?
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,629.045,631.399,I don't' know sir.
1965.45,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,631.399,633.279,Could you see that it gets here?
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,633.279,642.009,"I can certainly furnish a copy of the entire record or of the circular which ever, Your Honor, would desire."
1965.45,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,642.009,644.688,Oh we would only go on what -- what was before the District Court.
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,644.688,654.738,"I appreciate that, sir, and I'll see to it that that if that complaint or -- excuse me, if that circular is made available."
1965.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,810.098,814.509,"That was before the Board, the complaint for the Board."
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,814.509,816.635,"No, this is the complaint before the District Court."
1965.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,816.635,817.48,For the District Court.
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,817.48,819.14,This is the lawsuit.
1965.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,819.14,822.397,How did it initiate before the Board.
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,822.397,825.948,The Pinkerton people filed a complaint before the Board.
1965.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,829.428,831.291,At the point of the manager as you say?
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,831.291,835.798,"He was the acting or the -- yes, the acting District manager in Detroit."
1965.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,861.646,863.774,Was he in any way before the Board?
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,863.774,865.917,"No, sir, not at all."
1965.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,865.917,875.355,Did the Pinkerton people offer any evidence to the effect that the Union was involved in it?
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,875.355,890.494,"Yes, requests were made by the local National Labor Relations Board of a written statement of the respective positions of the Pinkerton people who had filed the charge and the Union as a respondent to it."
1965.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,901.264,904.703,Yes.
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,904.703,914.059,"Doyle, who was the last named defendant in the original lawsuit, was not dismissed from the case."
1965.45,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1015.434,1016.784,The --
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,1016.784,1017.125,Yes sir.
1965.45,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1017.125,1020.11,"Did the Board -- that wasn't the Board finding, was it?"
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,1021.354,1024.034,"It was an -- yes sir, it was an administrative finding."
1965.45,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1029.329,1032.798,But had decided at the administrative level by the regional --
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,1032.798,1034.131,"Yes sir, by the regional director."
1965.45,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1034.131,1035.672,And then approved by the general counsel.
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,1035.672,1037.73,And confirmed by the general counsel.
1965.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1037.73,1041.036,"Why is Doyle, a Pinkerton employee?"
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,1041.036,1043.125,He was a Pinkerton guard.
1965.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1043.125,1048.026,"And he is the defendant, same Doyle, referred earlier."
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,1048.026,1048.922,Yes.
1965.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1048.922,1067.384,"And as I read this, perhaps I'm wrong and I hope you correct it, so the District Court dismissed the action as to everybody except Doyle, the Pinkerton employee, Doyle did not move, did not join in the motion to dismiss --"
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,1067.384,1067.746,"That's correct, sir."
1965.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1067.746,1068.668,-- is that right?
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,1078.599,1079.188,Yes sir.
1965.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1079.794,1107.136,"Now as I read your complaint, you did not allege that the defendants were responsible for preparing the material and you alleged -- in paragraph five as they conspired to mail and circulate and publish by mailing and circulating, is that right?"
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,1117.929,1119.293,May understand --
1965.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1119.293,1124.058,It's paragraph five on page four of the record.
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,1124.058,1135.458,"That during the times aforesaid, the defendants which would be the -- all of the respondents here and Doyle did conspire to maliciously publish of unconcerning plaintiff by mailing and circulating."
1965.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1135.458,1137.297,By mailing and circulating.
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,1137.297,1137.798,Yes sir.
1965.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1137.798,1144.312,And then you say they compared.
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,1145.028,1147.544,"That's yes -- yes, you're right."
1965.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1148.262,1170.983,"As I read this sir, I get the impression of both the Board and the Court, you're saying that Doyle referred to be an employee may or may not have been the man that prepared and circulated this publication."
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,1180.85,1191.981,"I don't think they came to the first question but the second proposition which we put, I think is what the regional director did -- conclusion."
1965.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1200.178,1215.794,Is there anything in these papers before this Court to indicate whether Doyle was “also a union member or an official of the union”?
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,1215.794,1222.717,"Nothing before this Court, no sir."
1965.45,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1277.085,1286.251,"I suppose, under Michigan Law and that's what governs here is that the action (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,1286.251,1287.354,-- law which --
1965.45,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1287.354,1300.009,"Substantive law of Michigan I suppose that circulation of a an amatory statement, nearly libel just as much as you've written -- or not, I don't know."
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,1300.009,1301.142,Under the --
1965.45,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1301.142,1305.173,Publishing one and circulating one is generally --
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,1305.173,1318.465,"Well, yes as a -- certainly as an aider and abettor than a conspirator in the perpetration of what is in effect crime in the State of Michigan, not in effect with this -- by statute, a crime in the State of Michigan."
1965.45,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1927.385,1939.728,All we know so far is that the labor board at the administrative by all how that he wasn't part and parcel of the Union that he wasn't the member that he had and he wasn't their agent.
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,1939.728,1940.509,That's correct and you --
1965.45,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1940.509,1942.753,And you had alleged that he is.
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,1942.753,1944.973,No but we alleged that they acted in concert.
1965.45,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1945.175,1947.135,But you don't allege that he's part and parcel of the Union.
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,1950.368,1960.672,"Well I appreciate that, sir, but would it not also create the same kind of a defense that the Garmon rule has created so far."
1965.45,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1986.023,1988.567,How can we and I'm asking this for information.
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,2005.326,2010.13,"I think, we can let the Court hear that question in the first instance."
1965.45,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2014.729,2018.452,This question -- the question isn't before us.
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,2040.525,2042.746,"No, I'm afraid I can't agree with you."
1965.45,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2042.746,2046.336,Now it says this is just John Smith who libeled your client.
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,2054.629,2058.114,"Well, but the question before the Court here is not whether John Smith did it."
1965.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2129.368,2130.759,Suppose -- excuse me.
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,2130.759,2131.622,Yes sir.
1965.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2131.622,2155.02,"Suppose that Mr. Doyle were a Pinkerton agent and Mr. Linn is a Pinkerton agent too, would that make any difference with respect to the jurisdictional issues here?"
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,2187.859,2188.173,Yes.
1965.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2204.915,2222.65,"What you're urging upon us the proposition that Mr. Linn being, let us say a stranger to the company, has no remedy at the NLRB and according to this decision, no remedy in it, is that right?"
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,2222.65,2223.799,Yes sir.
1965.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2228.689,2230.496,Managerial staff of the --
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,2230.496,2231.665,Of the employer.
1965.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2231.665,2232.589,Of the employer.
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,2232.589,2237.019,"Yes sir, in a supervisory capacity."
1965.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2254.63,2267.18,But you're saying that you cannot accredit to Mr. Linn the disabilities if any of the employer's legal position.
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,2267.18,2274.484,Not under this peculiar circumstances where it is alleged that he is maliciously and deliberately libeled.
1965.45,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2300.847,2314.188,"Do you contend or don't you that even under Garmon, this libel is not arguably either protected or prohibited by the Act?"
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,2314.188,2325.323,We have in our brief said that the libel is not protected by Section 7 nor is it prohibited under Section 8.
1965.45,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2325.323,2329.014,"The Garmon (Inaudible) as you and I both know it that whether or not, it's arguably so."
1965.45,1,21705,donald_f_welday,,2329.014,2339.253,"This is correct but Garmon also says may fairly be asserted is words in place of arguably, may it fairly be asserted."
1965.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2372.834,2397.15,"We""ll recess now."

1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2753.788,2758.663,"No sir, they are defamatory in the general sense of the word."
1965.45,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2758.663,2761.984,Let me take the scale.
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2761.984,2769.854,"They would be in the general -- Harper and James or any of the books, they say yes."
1965.45,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2781.214,2786.23,"Well, if I understand you'd say that the -- if this is not serious --"
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2786.23,2786.529,Then --

1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2788.737,2788.963,Then this --
1965.45,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2788.963,2791.187,To say that the State could not provide --
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2791.187,2791.533,Yes.
1965.45,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2791.533,2792.953,-- the remedy you like.
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2792.953,2808.143,That the State could not apply its libel law to that situation just like this Court says that the State statute on restrain of trade is alright but they can't use it in a labor dispute.
1965.45,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2817.788,2818.13,Suppose --
1965.45,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2818.13,2824.047,But then I gather you say the words what the -- characterizes serious then.
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2824.047,2824.363,Malicious --
1965.45,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2824.363,2830.987,By default could be applied only to the extent of allowing the Republic for knowing the reckless --
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2830.987,2832.338,"Right, yes sir."
1965.45,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2835.138,2836.574,Not punitive damage --
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2836.574,2838.593,In those situations.

1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2846.473,2850.15,And it seriously injures the party involved.
1965.45,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2853.371,2854.535,(Inaudible)

1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2903.283,2906.732,It would be that -- it would depend on the State's situation.
1965.45,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2921.066,2921.633,No matter what --
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2921.633,2922.89,--and the type of relief.
1965.45,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2922.89,2924.363,No matter what section we're going to apply.
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2924.363,2925.922,"Yes, yes, sir."
1965.45,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2950.262,2954.64,"If you get one dictionary then, who's going to draw that dictionary words?"

1965.45,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2961.355,2962.396,Who would decide?
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2962.396,2963.683,The courts.
1965.45,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2963.683,2966.997,The courts would decide whether there was serious that have to come under the Act?
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2966.997,2968.093,Yes sir.
1965.45,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2971.305,2974.389,Serious enough the Court would decide --
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2974.389,2976.043,With the -- well it would be tried --
1965.45,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2976.043,2977.047,State court?
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2977.047,2987.454,"If it was in a state court, I would assume that the state court would have to decide originally, yes sir."
1965.45,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2987.454,2995.017,"Then that would define the labor board of any chance in the outset to preserve the jurisdiction over that, wouldn't they?"
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2995.017,2998.428,I think the labor board could intervene as amicus.
1965.45,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2998.428,2999.472,In the state court?
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2999.472,3003.794,"Yes sir, I don't know whether this has ever been done or not."
1965.45,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3003.794,3006.151,"That would be a pretty bad mix, wouldn't it?"
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3006.151,3009.906,That would be really confusing to me.

1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3025.638,3027.878,"Yes sir, we argue that in our brief."
1965.45,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3068.354,3071.046,Of course that's the whole philosophy of New York Times case.
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3071.046,3102.009,"Yes sir, I said the philosophy, yes, that's what I meant on it, that the -- I would hate to see a labor official trying to convince people and win his point and be afraid of what possibility there would be for liable action against him, and a few of them could really do it -- that's the real danger we see in it."
1965.45,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3116.131,3118.947,Well violence isn't free the speech.
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3118.947,3127.772,"Well, (Inaudible) case had said that it can in very well involve violence down the line."
1965.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3170.397,3171.414,General --
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3171.414,3171.568,Yes sir.
1965.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3171.568,3206.36,"If you start from the point of view of the NLRB jurisdiction, perhaps it would seem that the more extreme the language, the more malicious, the more outrageous the language is, the more the interest the NLRB might have in it in the sense that it might – that's a sort of case, might more readily rule to be an unfair labor practice than a more general and polite terms of abuse."
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3206.36,3222.289,"Well, the cases as I read them with the NLRB decision, that usually comes up when the union member uses some very good language and he subsequently discharged."
1965.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3227.052,3230.184,"Yes, but take the present case."
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3277.187,3281.632,Well I would think definitely that they would have a greater interest in it and I think that the --
1965.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3281.632,3292.006,So that isn't -- it doesn't that solve the paradox in here in the formula that the department has proposed.
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3292.006,3306.824,"Well, the real trouble is that if the NLRB finds that this Union is given to -- you have an unfair labor practice in what they call management, there's nothing they can do."
1965.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3313.614,3318.278,And as if the problem I was trying to get some more light on your answer.
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3318.278,3335.469,"Well, I mean, I started off with saying, this is a real difficult one and I wish we could draw most specific lines that would make a better presentation but we run into that real difficulty."
1965.45,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3460.314,3462.034,May I ask in connection that --
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3462.034,3462.685,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1965.45,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3462.685,3488.392,"-- replacement about the New York Times but we said in Thornhill, I thought of Thornhill which had never been impaired in this date and I repeat that a number of other cases that in a circumstances or valid times the discretion of matters in connection to the labor dispute to be considered the same as all other questions affecting public affairs."
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3504.737,3506.027,They're very -- they're very close.
1965.45,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3521.304,3532.955,"But of course I think as you rather graphically stated at the beginning, we have to realize that these labor disputes general rules of the like conversation are thrown away --"
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3532.955,3534.19,Absolutely.

1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3560.096,3574.772,"I think labor unions in some areas could be completely destroyed and I go even further that many unions, the threat would do just as much harm as the judgment."
1965.45,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3574.772,3598.793,(Inaudible)
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3598.793,3599.925,It is a usual procedure.

1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3614.856,3618.373,"Yes sir, they're several on their way up here."
1965.45,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3645.664,3647.362,I mean is that right to prove a judgment?
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3647.362,3650.541,This one is being held pending the outcome of this case.

1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3652.616,3656.321,Well these are all pending.
1965.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3665.984,3667.08,Mr. Solicitor General --
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3667.08,3668.457,Yes sir.
1965.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3668.457,3682.609,"Is there anything in the law, which you could tell us about that would preclude an action by the company."
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3739.99,3745.277,I am afraid we don't know.
1965.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3745.277,3760.074,But if the answer to that is that the action against the individual propriety and individual concern against the individual concern leaving out the company and the union.
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3771.114,3787.918,"Well, there are, as I understand under the Act, if there is a ranking file worker who has a grievance against a supervisor and employee, he can't bring -- he can bring certain types of actions."
1965.45,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3798.047,3804.466,"Of course, if you're right on the philosophy of the New York Times case you're not bothered with this question of preemption."
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3804.466,3805.493,Oh no sir.
1965.45,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3826.518,3828.771,It wasn't one of the cases.
1965.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3828.771,3832.656,I think so.
1965.45,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3851.221,3852.467,Mr. Livingston.
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,3852.467,3858.693,"Mr. Chief Justice, Associate members of the Court."

1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,4314.453,4317.084,"No sir, I did not."
1965.45,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4318.401,4319.114,Why not?
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,4319.114,4322.759,Because it gets into the area of the physical touching violence.
1965.45,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4322.759,4327.685,"No violence, I say by hypothesis, no violence, I mean, no intentional violence at all, just a negligence."
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,4327.685,4333.055,Well it would be a touching tort as distinguished from this case a non-touching.
1965.45,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4333.055,4334.864,Garmon.
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,4337.17,4338.771,"No, sir, it does not."
1965.45,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4339.349,4346.441,"Because what you've told is what you -- part of your version of what this Court decided, there wouldn't be no right of action for that kind of a negligent tort."
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,4346.441,4360.684,"Well, I think the important thing too in that situation would be the accidental kicking of another in the chin would have no relevance or relationship to Labor Relations policy and --"
1965.45,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4360.684,4366.092,"We can by my -- I'm inventing this case and maybe it will never happen but by hypothesis, it does."
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,4378.884,4392.209,That is correct but I would not -- I would not say that such would be preempted by Garmon because of the distinctions which I have just stated.
1965.45,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4558.281,4560.137,"Excuse me, this is your point here."
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,4565.38,4589.155,"No sir but I do suggest that as another part of the argument that in many instances, the institution of a libel suit such as this suit may violate the Act because it may have a coercive effect upon a union's organizational right or during the course of the labor dispute."
1965.45,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5098.505,5099.504,Would that be maintained?

1965.45,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5228.183,5231.083,"But the Board, they -- results of the investigation."
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5231.083,5241.38,"Right, I thought that I had preface my remarks with the statement that it should not -- it does not have the status of a Board determination."
1965.45,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5257.565,5279.555,"Counsel, a few moments ago if you forgive me for going back to it, you made a point of the fact that the libel and the allegedly libel has some material contained no statement which was outside of or irrelevant to the employment relationship."
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5279.555,5281.21,"That is correct, sir."
1965.45,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5281.21,5284.918,What significance do you attach to that?
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5284.918,5297.979,We believe that if there are statements made during an organizing drive which are irrelevant to the dispute then libel actions could be maintained.

1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5430.192,5432.819,"Well I don't go on the basis of seriousness, sir."
1965.45,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5438.275,5439.375,"Well, I thought you'd --"
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5439.375,5439.97,Regardless --
1965.45,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5439.97,5442.422,Use word gross.
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5442.422,5442.68,Well --
1965.45,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5442.68,5452.617,"You used the word that kind of a gross charge, most might have heard in those kind of thing as I had -- you could either excuse for them for -- it sounded pretty gross to me charges --"
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5452.617,5470.605,"I would -- I misused and I beg your pardon that the term gross, I was referring to some irrelevant type of accusation made during an organizing campaign."
1965.45,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5481.488,5485.196,Suppose the charge made that you will not have anything to do with it.
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5495.843,5508.624,Well I would say that in that case that there would be -- that it would be relevant to the right of the Union and the obligation of the Union and the ability of the Union to represent the employees.
1965.45,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5508.624,5512.789,Oh did he said about the employer?
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5512.789,5522.559,"In that case, I don't think there would be -- there would be the relevance because the employer is not charged with a trust or a responsibility to represent employees."
1965.45,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5528.329,5530.219,As to the relevance of the same statement.
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5530.219,5531.925,"Yes, sir."
1965.45,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5531.925,5538.414,"Or as I said, you can't believe this man, his employer, his superintendent but you can't believe him."
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5563.314,5568.791,Well that is -- that is very true and I think is the --
1965.45,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5568.791,5597.917,"And I think Garmon laws that if the thing is arguably but the Board and it seemed to me like that the very argument you're making which you seem to break as far as the government's argument that if it's not serious, if you get – somebody get to decide whether it's serious or not, it seems to me like that very argument, both of your points rather than the effect that Garmon should apply because it would be arguably for the Board to determine."
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5597.917,5601.364,"Well, I beg to disagree."
1965.45,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5624.025,5630.425,"Well that's going to be determining line, who should determine that line the state of the labor board?"
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5630.425,5630.776,The National Labor --
1965.45,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5630.776,5634.31,I mean with the Labor Board and we're to adopt the rule like that.
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5644.471,5659.629,"I think this Court has made it very clear that in these cases, it is arguably or the arguably determination must be made by the National Labor Relations Board initially and should be made initially."
1965.45,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5661.709,5675.568,"Well, any charges that they can make for the reference of defamation and suppose its language that the Labor Board shouldn't pass on it before submitted to a court in a jury in the state court to determine whether it falls on that line."
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5675.568,5684.338,I believe there would be some instances in which -- in which a resort could be -- head directly to the Court.
1965.45,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5684.338,5685.7,Wanting of it.
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5685.7,5693.178,I think the very clear instance would be a charge of sexual misconduct.
1965.45,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5693.178,5697.073,That's some conduct of question a lot of people consider worst than that.
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5697.073,5718.679,Well I realized that but I -- but I don't see that it would have any relevance to the labor dispute except of course it could in an area where you have -- you're organizing a group of office employees and there is a charge of misconduct between certain people and an employer.
1965.45,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5726.328,5731.487,Nobody said anything about what's going to happen with the reference to the suit.
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5747.903,5767.215,"If I had my way, I would require that in all preemption cases, the initial, the party should first be required to go to the National Labor Relations Board in order to see or to obtain some sort of the determination as to whether they are going to act in the area."
1965.45,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5767.553,5768.902,But we have to said that --
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5768.902,5769.237,No sir.
1965.45,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5769.237,5776.471,(Inaudible)
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5776.471,5796.172,"That is correct, -- but respect to Garmon in subsequent cases, this Court has clearly state that the initial determination as to whether an activity is arguably subject to Section 7 or 8 is to be made by the National Labor Relations Board."
1965.45,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5796.172,5808.817,"If it's arguably decided on jurisdiction, that means exclusively that more jurisdiction, the state can't move anywhere in regard, (Inaudible)"
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5808.817,5815.996,"That is correct, but somewhere along the line an initial determination must be made and --"
1965.45,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5815.996,5834.209,"(Inaudible) It isn't it not a matter of initial determination, it's a matter of -- the State has now -- and jurisdiction and whether anything that happens to the Board, nothing or whatever may happen and if it's arguably within the Board, (Inaudible)"
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5834.209,5834.879,That is correct.
1965.45,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5835.434,5845.454,But I don't see any -- I don't see places that directly give initial (Inaudible)
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5845.454,5861.288,"Well, if anyone thinks that the activity is not subject to the National Labor Relations Board, they should be required to first go there and obtain some sort of a determination prior to resort to Court."
1965.45,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5866.834,5872.912,To Justice Brennan's question pointed out the reason I was asking you what that was.
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5910.085,5910.32,I think --
1965.45,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5910.32,5911.799,"Well, I thought they decided."
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5911.799,5913.029,Yes.
1965.45,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5931.88,5936.892,"Counsel, I wonder where all that leaves you on the facts of this case."
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5949.484,5950.486,"That is correct, sir."
1965.45,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5950.486,5953.695,Now let me ask you first.
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,5971.131,5972.006,"Yes, sir."
1965.45,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5973.648,5976.511,Now my second question is this.
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,6020.531,6039.43,"I think quite the contrary the Board asserted jurisdiction by making an investigation and as a result of the investigation, the record will show, they check the membership cards of the local, took the investigative machinery and reached a conclusion, there wasn't any evidence against the Union."
1965.45,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6040.5,6047.379,No but they held that –- they found as I read it that the Union was not involved in the libel.
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,6047.379,6048.212,"That is correct, sir."
1965.45,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6048.212,6060.245,"Now if the Union wasn't involved in the libel, is the amount still under the NLRB and let me put in as precisely as I can."
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,6085.895,6086.447,Yes.
1965.45,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6086.447,6093.18,"Let us say an investigation doesn't settle the matter, does it, after the investigation."
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,6115.192,6124.967,My position is that this was an effective type of determination (Voice Overlap)
1965.45,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6124.967,6128.673,I'm sorry to take your time but let me ask you this specifically.
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,6136.054,6137.936,"About a year, yes sir."
1965.45,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6137.936,6150.134,"Now I suppose that after Mr. Doyle resigned from the Union, he had prepared and circulated this libelous material."
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,6209.402,6211.442,Yes sir.
1965.45,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6268.208,6285.829,"I suppose your suggestion is that that would be outrageous but I don't think -- I don't see why -- what if Mr. Doyle negligently ran over the employer and that cut both his legs off, he'd be subject to pay for the heavy damages."
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,6293.849,6294.029,My point is --
1965.45,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6294.029,6296.459,There were two differences that had standard.
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,6296.459,6299.281,"My point is this, Mr. Justice."
1965.45,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6441.136,6443.359,(Inaudible)
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,6443.359,6444.51,"I do not know, sir."
1965.45,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6444.51,6446.935,(Inaudible)
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,6446.935,6456.967,"Yes sir, there are -- there are two or three listed in the appendix to the Solicitor General that have gone -- that have gone to judgment."
1965.45,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6456.967,6461.269,(Inaudible)
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,6461.269,6464.714,"As I recall, they were quite out of proportion and –-"
1965.45,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6464.714,6468.241,"You had any experience with him before this case, you personally?"
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,6468.241,6468.788,Me personally?
1965.45,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6468.788,6471.071,Yes.
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,6471.071,6473.407,Not that I can recall right off hand.
1965.45,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6478.798,6481.809,Well I'm just wondering how wrong I am.
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,6491.703,6493.984,But it's like any other -- that's right.
1965.45,3,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,6533.624,6536.017,"Michigan is the truth, the defense."
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,6536.017,6536.856,Yes sir.
1965.45,3,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,6536.856,6543.275,"So just to stop all people from lying, telling defamatory lies."
1965.45,3,45316,winston_l_livingston,,6543.275,6559.128,"Yes, Michigan also requires that you publish or require the alleged defamer to publish a retraction before you may bring the suit but it also allows punitive damages."
1965.45,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6564.65,6566.385,Mr. Welday.
1965.45,4,21705,donald_f_welday,,6566.385,6567.946,May it please the Court.
1965.45,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6624.93,6634.638,Well now the Solicitor General referred us to that statement in an affidavit that this was in the context of an organizational campaign.
1965.45,4,21705,donald_f_welday,,6642.877,6650.721,"A semantic problem which I have, there was nothing insofar as either this petitioner was concerned nor his employer."
1965.45,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6654.645,6659.83,Well I know but it's one of the facts this whole case has been tried in an affidavit.
1965.45,4,21705,donald_f_welday,,6659.83,6661.323,"What trial it has been, yes."
1965.45,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6661.534,6665.725,Well but there hasn't -- the whole -- I don't mean tried.
1965.45,4,21705,donald_f_welday,,6671.25,6671.985,Yes sir.
1965.45,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6671.985,6674.372,Alright.
1965.45,4,21705,donald_f_welday,,6674.372,6676.714,I didn't mean to suggest that there wasn't.
1965.45,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6771.326,6774.959,Well how far are you on the Solicitor General part?
1965.45,4,21705,donald_f_welday,,6774.959,6777.021,Well the Solicitor General adds to it.
1965.45,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6795.631,6809.356,How about the suggestion Solicitor General made that within an elimination of punitive damages.
1965.45,4,21705,donald_f_welday,,6809.356,6819.84,"I, personally would have no objection because and particularly in the context of this case where some form to provide the truth is what the petitioner seeks here."
1965.45,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6916.649,6944.674,"Counsel, is it your position by taking the allegedly libelous material set forth in the record before us, pages four and six, I think it is, that a -- this complaint would be the Solicitor General's proposed test?"
1965.45,4,21705,donald_f_welday,,6944.674,6945.696,I think it would.
1965.45,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6949.914,6957.719,Where is that?
1965.45,4,21705,donald_f_welday,,6957.719,6960.453,The men were robbed for pay increases.
1965.45,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6960.453,6969.068,"Well in the context -- alright, what about that -- you said the thief and robbery and I supposed that will support of it."
1965.45,4,21705,donald_f_welday,,6969.068,6972.117,"Call it whether what you will, he's a thief or a robber."
1965.45,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6972.117,6975.383,So you think this would make the Solicitor General's test.
1965.45,4,21705,donald_f_welday,,6975.383,6984.812,I think it would.
