1975.74-1137,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.911,"We will hear arguments first this morning in 74-1137, Lavine against Milne."
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,18.494,21.392,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,203.831,206.277,"Only the validity of the presumptions, right?"
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,206.277,207.364,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,207.364,220.109,Not of the substantive law that this allows Home Relief for somebody who has quit his job for the purpose of going on Home Relief?
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,220.109,220.649,That is correct.
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,220.649,224.851,"-- before 75 days, not the substantive law, that is not an issue here, is it?"
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,224.851,236.843,"Well, that is the precise form of the order, is to declare the presumption invalid, but as a practical matter it precludes this very sensitively drafted statute from having a practical fit."
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,236.843,244.418,"Well, is it not the -- I maybe a little obtuse, but as you go on in the argument, maybe you can clarify it for me."
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,257.88,277.819,"Yes, Your Honor, one of the things that we find amazing about this case is that the Court below found this presumption to violate the plaintiff class' constitutional rights because if one reads the statute which clearly says that he has the burden of coming forward and proving each element of eligibility --"
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,277.819,277.885,Right.
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,277.885,287.363,"-- in any event, the presumption merely clarifies and makes explicit his duty to do so and promotes uniformity of application throughout the state."
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,295.005,303.261,"That is what I gathered from reading the briefs and if that is so, then the invalidation of the presumption does not hurt the state’s position very much, does it?"
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,303.261,303.556,"Yes, it does."
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,303.556,304.236,With law?
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,304.236,304.891,"Yes, it does Your Honor."
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,304.891,305.632,Why?
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,305.632,309.092,The major reason that it does is that it is an injunction.
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,324.181,349.658,"Well, if the substantive law remains wholly valid that a person is not eligible for Home Relief, if for the first 75 days after the termination of his employment, if he has terminated his employment for the purpose of going on Home Relief, he has to prove his eligibility, he has the burden of proof?"
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,349.658,350.905,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,350.905,358.856,That remains true under this Court's decision whether or not it is going through the motions of invalidating this statutory presumption?
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,358.856,358.931,Except --
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,358.931,362.242,And if that is true what difference does it make?
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,362.242,366.069,The difference that it makes is as follows.
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,433.228,437.61,"But an applicant for Home Relief still has the burden of proving his eligibility, does he not?"
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,437.61,440.027,I believe that that will be up to this Court and it is --
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,440.027,443.447,Is it not that correct as matter of New York law?
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,443.447,447.206,"Yes, except the injunction in this case raises very considerable doubt."
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,447.206,449.024,"Alright, it is a matter general law --"
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,449.024,449.08,Yes.
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,449.08,452.528,-- an applicant for anything has to prove his eligibility for what he wants?
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,452.528,454.918,"Yes, Your Honor that is correct."
1975.74-1137,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,454.918,462.968,I take it what you are saying to us now that this injunction does in fact impinge upon the substantive law?
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,462.968,468.014,Yes I think it makes it effective because of the nature of this very sensitive statute.
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,520.433,524.2,Let me -- just one more try one more time and then just I will to try stop bothering you --
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,524.2,525.591,Right.
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,525.591,528.194,-- and then in the course of your argument maybe you can explain it.
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,532.668,533.06,Yes.
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,533.06,538.468,-- it would not have -- the applicant would have still had the burden of proving his eligibility?
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,538.468,538.863,Yes.
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,538.863,547.064,"And in fact, the law generally would have been as though this presumption were written into the law?"
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,547.064,548.94,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,552.642,553.074,Right.
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,554.943,555.258,The only --
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,555.258,557.521,And therefore never been this lawsuit?
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,557.521,559.257,"Yes, that is --"
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,559.257,562.069,The applicant still has to prove his eligibility?
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,562.069,565.212,That is our position that he still could be required to.
1975.74-1137,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,595.043,608.395,Is there any reason why New York could not have provided that no person should be eligible for Home Aid until 75 days after he voluntarily quit his job?
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,608.395,610.889,"There certainly is no reason, Your Honor."
1975.74-1137,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,653.64,661.422,So that New York scheme is actually more liberal in that regard than say New Jersey that you correctly described New Jersey?
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,661.422,670.067,"That is correct and indeed, I think that anyone looking at this statutory schemes sees the very narrow road that our legislature travels."
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,763.567,769.108,"In this particular case, the plaintiffs do not seem to have to quit their jobs, they seem to have been fired?"
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,769.108,773.03,"Yes Your Honor, that is correct."
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,825.04,826.184,Did not know?
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,826.184,829.068,Because the presumption was not applied to them.
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,831.274,835.215,"Well, they were victims of maladministration by the state and they probably not (Voice Overlap)"
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,835.215,836.653,Yes and we point --
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,836.653,838.213,Under the statute?
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,838.213,840.417,"Well, we do not even concede that it is under the statute."
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,842.266,843.742,They were victims of unfair administration of the law?
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,843.742,849.016,Administration of the law without a question and we are not here defending that maladministration.
1975.74-1137,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,849.016,849.679,Right.
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,849.679,852.213,We have separated ourselves from it since the very beginning.
1975.74-1137,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,884.069,902.002,"If Mr. Justice Stewart is correct that it would not make any difference whether the presumption is in or out of the case then there is hardly any case of controversy about that statute and the District Court should never adjudicated it and much of that, you would vacate and dismiss the case?"
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,902.002,902.532,"No, Your Honor."
1975.74-1137,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,902.532,905.401,"And you would not really care about that, would you?"
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,905.401,908.087,You mean about this presumption particularly?
1975.74-1137,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,908.087,911.899,"Well, I mean the judgment of unconstitutionality would be vacated?"
1975.74-1137,0,16311,amy_juviler,,911.899,918.676,"If we talk about the second face, yes that is true, except for the fact that it is not the presumption."
1975.74-1137,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1349.104,1352.637,Very well.
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1355.319,1358.455,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1137,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1389.35,1403.624,"In your view Mr. Norlander, the legislature of the state to constitutionally provide no one would be eligible for any benefits of any kind for 75 days?"
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1403.624,1408.386,"That question, Your Honor, I believe would raise a serious problem under the Equal Protection Clause."
1975.74-1137,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1411.966,1415.65,Why would it raise any problem at all on the Equal Protection Clause?
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1415.65,1426.013,"Well, Your Honor, we are dealing here with the benefit that has impact of being -- it is the last resort for a person who is destitute."
1975.74-1137,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1447.111,1454.683,What did you say about a state's action in providing for no Welfare or whatever?
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1454.683,1455.116,"Well, as--"
1975.74-1137,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1455.116,1464.431,"No Welfare program and rejecting all matching funds of the Federal Government and saying in this state, we are not going to have any program."
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1464.431,1477.092,"This Court has never held that Welfare is a constitutionally required benefit, but on the other hand, the Court has never held at one state offers a benefit, it may have arbitrarily withdraw or deny that benefit."
1975.74-1137,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1477.092,1490.959,"Well, supposing taking the Chief Justice's question, it is not any withdrawing, if it is simply saying 70 per 75 days after you voluntarily quit your work, you are not eligible for work, for Welfare."
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1495.097,1499.535,"Well, I do not see what rational purpose of that would advance."
1975.74-1137,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1543.995,1546.762,"Well, but does the constitution prevent that result?"
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1546.762,1554.956,"Well, what I am saying is that a class of persons would be informed as a result of the operation on that statute and it is rather hypothetical at this point."
1975.74-1137,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1571.427,1578.557,"Well, but it is up to the New York Legislature to decide what would advance and what will not advance the purposes of the statute, is it not?"
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1578.557,1593.314,"Well, I would say that in operation, the question would probably boil down to a question as to whether such as classification as applied, would violate the Equal Protection Clause."
1975.74-1137,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1632.419,1639.096,"Well, it is supposed to be eligible for Home Relief and it not is not a matter of the sanction?"
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1639.096,1650.108,"I think the record is quiet clear in this respect, Mr. Justice Stewart that at a very practical level, we are not dealing with the label of the sanction, but we are dealing with --"
1975.74-1137,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1650.108,1650.927,Eligibility?
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1650.927,1651.208,No.
1975.74-1137,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1685.806,1693.326,"As I understand your sisters on the other side, they conceive the maladministration of this Law?"
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1693.326,1695.083,"Well, I would point out to the Court --"
1975.74-1137,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1695.083,1697.135,It is like the 20 out of the 21 plaintiffs?
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1697.135,1703.875,"Well, we do not concede that and in fact they have taken a reversal possession in their papers before the Court on that question."
1975.74-1137,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1731.369,1738.828,Temporary would be maladministration to this case (Inaudible).
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1738.828,1744.129,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I believe that the maladministration of the --"
1975.74-1137,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1744.129,1749.621,As I was saying before was the knocking down of the statutory being unconstitutional?
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1749.621,1756.401,"Well, one of the questions presented by my adversary in jurisdictional statement is whether plaintiffs had a share opportunity to rebut it."
1975.74-1137,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1776.675,1794.842,"As the people you represent, they quit their job or either one of them for this is why I see the difference and you do not expect and a lot of that people come to him and says, here is the money, they have to go and ask for it, do they not?"
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1794.842,1795.913,That is right!
1975.74-1137,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1795.913,1799.648,And do not they have to “qualify?”
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1799.648,1801.721,Oh! Yes.
1975.74-1137,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1801.721,1814.322,"And if in administering the qualifications standards the officer does wrong, is that ground for knocking out the statute, yes or no?"
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1814.322,1814.438,Mr. --
1975.74-1137,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1814.438,1816.547,"The answers no, is not it?"
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1816.547,1821.937,"The answer is sometimes yes, if the statute as applied is applied in unconstitutional or arbitrary manner --"
1975.74-1137,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1821.937,1824.241,"(Inaudible)_ that out as applied, was it?"
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1824.241,1829.819,"The District Court judgment that held at the statute was unconstitutional on its face, although, at --"
1975.74-1137,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1829.819,1831.475,(Inaudible) before us?
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1831.475,1833.894,"Well, the question of the --"
1975.74-1137,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1833.894,1838.096,"The validity, the facial validity of the statute is what is before us?"
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1838.096,1839.584,"That is before the Court, Your Honor."
1975.74-1137,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1839.584,1840.835,And what else?
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1840.835,1844.498,And plaintiffs have urged all along through this case.
1975.74-1137,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1883.089,1897.965,"In your second point, the absence of a fair opportunity to rebut the presumption based on the facts of this case or is it a challenge to the procedure prescribed by regulations?"
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1909.291,1918.893,"Well, the facts and the records illustrate the problem, but, our contention is that the applicable regulations and laws are not really in dispute."
1975.74-1137,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1942.98,1951.299,How does the burden to establish eligibility differ from the burden to rebut the presumption?
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1951.299,1956.333,I think the record is quite clear in the Beverly case.
1975.74-1137,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1967.858,1974.295,And it is one of the things he must show that he did not voluntarily leave his job?
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,1974.295,1976.867,"Well obviously, he will be asked why he left his employment."
1975.74-1137,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2049.841,2056.0,Was that issued pursuant to the mandate or order of the court in this case?
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,2056.0,2056.851,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-1137,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2091.984,2098.399,"So this is the Court saying the constitution requires it, rather than the choice of the Department of Social Service?"
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,2098.399,2102.54,"No, the letter was drafted by the Department of Social Services."
1975.74-1137,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2111.144,2120.361,"But, the court has no business telling the Department of Social Services anything, other than it be mandated by the constitution?"
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,2120.361,2125.445,The judgment below merely says that the presumption may not be enforced.
1975.74-1137,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2125.445,2145.517,"I take it under New York law if there is a hearing at sometime, maybe 90 days, maybe whatever it is, if the applicant win, I take it he does to get the back pay, so to speak, back to the time when he should have --"
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,2145.517,2146.312,That is quite right.
1975.74-1137,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2146.312,2147.344,Under the state law.
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,2147.344,2147.777,That is right.
1975.74-1137,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2175.86,2176.618,I understand.
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,2179.593,2179.922,Yes.
1975.74-1137,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2179.922,2180.659,And they do?
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,2180.659,2187.975,"Yes, yes."
1975.74-1137,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2300.797,2314.97,"(Inaudible) the man applied for Home Relief and the worker says did she quits her job within the last 75 days, and he said yes, he says why?"
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,2316.766,2318.068,"Yes, he is."
1975.74-1137,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2318.068,2320.865,"Is he not obliged to give in great detail, why?"
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,2320.865,2322.782,Certainly.
1975.74-1137,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2322.782,2325.97,And the difference with that presumption is what?
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,2325.97,2336.457,The presumption allows the worker to really cease the inquiry at the time when it is found that a person recently terminated employment.
1975.74-1137,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2391.67,2421.067,"If an applicant were asked whether he quit work to receive relief and the applicant answered no, that is all he was doing, and he did not offer any other reason, and there was no other inquiry would the presumption serve to reject his claim?"
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,2421.067,2426.925,I do not know that the presumption would be needed to be able to reject that claim.
1975.74-1137,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2427.842,2434.229,"Well, he just says, he says no, I did not quit at work to get a relief."
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,2434.229,2469.828,"My adversary did say in oral argument below that presumption is necessary because we do not have to take a person's say so and I suppose that the presumption operates to provide, the given presumed fact merely upon the fact that the person voluntary terminated and the case worker is free to totally disregard the denial under the presumption."
1975.74-1137,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2504.127,2514.505,Do any of these facts that you have been talking about have anything to do with the declaration that statute is unconstitutional on it is face?
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,2514.505,2521.636,"The facts merely illustrate I think, Your Honor, with respect to the facial issue, they merely illustrate the irrationally of presumption."
1975.74-1137,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2855.82,2856.668,How do does help you --
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,2856.668,2857.519,-- and the likes.
1975.74-1137,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2857.519,2862.205,When the term used by that commission is “most?”
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,2868.908,2876.855,"Well, that -- my adversary contends that there is no evidence available with respect to that group and so the --"
1975.74-1137,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2876.855,2878.63,Accepting this as a evidence --
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,2878.63,2878.926,Well --
1975.74-1137,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2878.926,2888.296,"-- which is not necessarily the case, accepting it as what someone thought about it, it does not support your position even as you read it to us?"
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,2888.296,2910.379,"Well, the position of the President's Commission has been tested by a massive study in New Jersey in which the United States Office of the Economic Opportunity spent $8 million over a three-year period to test the precise question whether people would quit their jobs in order to qualify for welfare benefits."
1975.74-1137,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3135.474,3145.616,Under the fairest and the most valid law regulation in the world you can have the maladministration by ignorant or abusive --
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,3145.616,3146.028,Well.
1975.74-1137,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3146.028,3147.455,"Administrator, do you not?"
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,3147.455,3149.526,I would not agree.
1975.74-1137,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3151.895,3152.823,Let me ask you.
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,3153.61,3172.621,"Your Honor, I do believe that the fundamental concept of the rebutted -- of the rational connection test is that it prevents sweeping in of a broad class of persons and subjecting them to the liability imposed by the first -- by the substantive rule and I think record demonstrates that."
1975.74-1137,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3173.028,3176.433,"Mr. Gerald A. Norlander, let me ask you one more question."
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,3192.178,3193.817,"Correct, Your Honor, and --"
1975.74-1137,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3193.817,3226.215,"Now if that is true and if we except the Wigmore Theory that an irrebuttable presumption is not a presumption at all, but merely a substantive rule of law, then are we not faced with my brother Rehnquist's question of earlier in this argument with i.e. the substantive validity of a law that says that anybody who voluntarily terminates his employment shall be ineligible for Home Relief for 75 days, cannot rewrite up against that, if this is an rebuttable presumption?"
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,3226.215,3233.387,"I think not, Your Honor because if we have a situation quite unlike that in the case of Weinberger against Salfi decided in last term."
1975.74-1137,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3246.872,3250.14,But you tell us in fact it is tantamount to any rebuttable --
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,3250.14,3252.097,We say it has that the same rice.
1975.74-1137,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3257.641,3259.848,You want to have it both ways?
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,3259.848,3260.551,Yes.
1975.74-1137,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3260.551,3261.732,Okay.
1975.74-1137,1,25846,gerald_a_norlander,,3261.732,3263.482,Thank you.
1975.74-1137,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3263.482,3265.019,Do you have anything further?
1975.74-1137,2,16311,amy_juviler,,3265.019,3268.59,"Yes, I just have two things Mr. Chief Justice."
1975.74-1137,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3439.055,3440.236,My I ask you a question?
1975.74-1137,2,16311,amy_juviler,,3440.236,3442.093,Sure.
1975.74-1137,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3442.093,3454.0,"Procedure of due process, appellee's brief makes some broad categorical statements, I will read one to you, plaintiffs were not afforded a hearing of any kind at the local agency."
1975.74-1137,2,16311,amy_juviler,,3470.74,3472.527,At the time -- from initial application?
1975.74-1137,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3472.527,3481.37,"Yes, take an applicant who appears for the time, describe the procedure, what opportunity does he have?"
1975.74-1137,2,16311,amy_juviler,,3481.37,3488.187,The applicant is interviewed and it is interview which is the primary and original source of information.
1975.74-1137,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3613.371,3619.34,Do any regulations prescribe the procedure at this hearing?
1975.74-1137,2,16311,amy_juviler,,3619.34,3621.706,"Yes, there are two regulations assuming --"
1975.74-1137,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3621.706,3623.171,"If you just tell me, what they are --"
1975.74-1137,2,16311,amy_juviler,,3623.171,3623.587,Right.
1975.74-1137,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3623.587,3624.856,-- I can check them out?
1975.74-1137,2,16311,amy_juviler,,3624.856,3627.706,The regulations appear as an appendix to our main brief.
1975.74-1137,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3642.806,3645.537,The regulation commence at 1(a) of --
1975.74-1137,2,16311,amy_juviler,,3645.537,3652.812,"At 1(a), and let me particularly draw your attention to page 5(a)."
1975.74-1137,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3754.215,3758.634,I have (Inaudible) any pamphlets or written information --
1975.74-1137,2,16311,amy_juviler,,3758.634,3758.852,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-1137,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3758.852,3760.667,-- describing the procedure to them?
1975.74-1137,2,16311,amy_juviler,,3760.667,3761.819,They do have.
1975.74-1137,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3764.167,3774.386,"Under statute -- one other question the three-judge court did not reach the procedure of due process issue, it is addressed by the both of you on the briefs --"
1975.74-1137,2,16311,amy_juviler,,3774.386,3777.66,"Yes, there --"
1975.74-1137,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3777.66,3786.692,If we should reach that point that we just thought that we should remanded the three-judge court or try decide it on this record?
1975.74-1137,2,16311,amy_juviler,,3786.692,3799.901,"I believe that the Court can decide the question of the validity of the opportunity to rebut on the face of the statute, not only 130-10811, but face of the regulations and the statue in effect."
1975.74-1137,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3853.941,3855.953,It has nothing to do with this case.
1975.74-1137,2,16311,amy_juviler,,3860.227,3873.681,"He was making 2.25 an hour, I think 40 hours a week, he was guaranteed 40 hour a week and he was making 2.25, not much."
1975.74-1137,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3874.257,3877.179,The case is submitted.
