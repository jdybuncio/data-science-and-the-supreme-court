2013.12-1184,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.123,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12-1184, Octane Fitness versus ICON Health and Fitness, Incorporated."
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,9.715,13.137,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,114.847,116.611,You talking about economic coercion.
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,123.531,126.873,The analysis would be primarily the same.
2013.12-1184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,145.459,149.379,"I've been listening to your adjectives -- this is a search for adjectives, in part."
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,158.438,161.155,I don't know that the case law is perfectly clear.
2013.12-1184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,169.121,176.588,"Because if we remand to the District Court, the District Court's already said it's not objectively baseless; it's not brought in bad faith."
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,183.194,184.443,Well--
2013.12-1184,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,184.443,193.111,You -- you had just said that we should return it to the District Court with orders to require fee shifting.
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,210.729,216.055,--We understand the tension between the discretionary standard and asking for a remand with a finding.
2013.12-1184,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,227.363,237.999,"And you think this Court is the proper court to look at the record and make that determination that the District Court got it wrong and the District Court didn't think this was an ""exceptional case""."
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,237.999,240.295,"On this record, yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,254.352,256.742,"Well, what do you -- what do you want to add to meritless?"
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,266.628,268.222,"It is not, Your Honor."
2013.12-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,268.222,269.596,Doesn't meritless just mean without merit?
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,269.596,275.405,"No, it -- for example, in most patent cases, there is the Markman phase."
2013.12-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,291.706,292.039,Okay.
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,297.919,300.375,In our strong view--
2013.12-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,300.375,305.205,That no -- no reasonable judge could have found it to be with merit?
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,305.205,314.702,"--If someone brings a claim construction position that's unreasonably weak, in our view that qualifies under Section 285 and is consistent with the words that other cases have used."
2013.12-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,314.702,325.682,"That -- that's not a standard I would -- I would want to, you know -- you realize how -- how differently various District Courts would operate if -- if you just say -- what was your phrase?"
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,326.868,329.023,"And yet, that's the--"
2013.12-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,329.023,330.57,You've got to give me something tighter than that.
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,330.57,334.194,"--That is the standard, however, that this Court used in Martin and in Pierce."
2013.12-1184,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,387.891,393.795,We're dealing with a term that could be read in many different ways: exceptional.
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,421.174,431.421,"Well, I think we need to look at the basis of the judgment, which is grounded in the fact that they've -- they've found constitutionally that the -- the PRE standard was required."
2013.12-1184,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,452.13,464.626,What is the difference between the Federal Circuit's use of objective reasonable -- objectively meritless and your standard?
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,464.626,466.406,To my way--
2013.12-1184,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,466.406,472.435,"I know that you've been arguing that they shouldn't be using subjective intent, so I'm putting that aside."
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,480.29,486.023,"--To my way of thinking, when you say meritless or baseless, it means there's absolutely no foundation of zero merit."
2013.12-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,502.657,505.171,I don't understand your answer to the question.
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,515.449,525.46,"We understand the first part of the Federal Circuit's test to require zero merit or frivolousness, which is what the district court -- she used interchangeably ""objectively baseless"" and ""frivolousness""."
2013.12-1184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,530.254,534.159,So would you say without substantial merit?
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,536.611,540.844,"Without substantial merit, unreasonably weak, or low likelihood of success."
2013.12-1184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,548.342,551.826,"You have several objections, I take it, to what the Federal Circuit has said."
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,556.604,557.198,Yes.
2013.12-1184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,557.198,559.931,You also don't think bad faith is necessary?
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,559.931,560.649,Agreed.
2013.12-1184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,560.649,579.438,"And do you also believe that litigation misconduct taken in conjunction with a case that is, let's say, of little merit, but perhaps not as low as the standard that you have, that you're suggesting, would justify an award of fees?"
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,579.438,580.641,Yes.
2013.12-1184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,586.873,590.497,Let's say that I'm a district judge someplace and I rarely get a patent case.
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,615.61,618.844,"So, I do not think it's a numerical comparison."
2013.12-1184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,650.397,650.627,Compared to what?
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,656.859,658.921,District courts handle--
2013.12-1184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,658.921,659.796,Or patent cases?
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,659.796,660.867,--I think all cases.
2013.12-1184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,667.208,671.848,"See, this is what I find somewhat troubling about your ""take everything into account"" standard."
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,721.128,729.219,"--Well, first of all, Congress -- Congress has spoken and said that in exceptional cases the district court should do this."
2013.12-1184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,752.772,754.083,Is that really true?
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,768.718,770.748,"--I don't know what that number is, Your Honor."
2013.12-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,780.807,793.569,"Mr. Telscher, it occurs to me that you really cannot answer the question of what adjectives should be attached to ""meritless""."
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,832.381,833.865,"That's absolutely correct, Your Honor."
2013.12-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,833.865,837.772,"So then how can we possibly define ""meritless""?"
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,845.859,850.623,It's the degree of the unreasonable nature of the case as one factor.
2013.12-1184,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,850.623,859.714,"Do you agree with the Solicitor General's test that fees are authorized when they are -- I'm quoting -- ""necessary to prevent gross injustice""?"
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,859.714,861.009,"Yes, we do, Your Honor."
2013.12-1184,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,861.009,865.712,"Well now, I was surprised at that because I would have thought your friend on the other side would say that."
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,883.704,887.39,"Well, it's certainly what Congress said in the legislative history and what was adopted by the courts."
2013.12-1184,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,887.39,898.558,"Well, but you've been up here for several minutes and you haven't even used those particular -- that adjective, which is your test."
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,898.558,903.649,"Section 285 is remedial, so certainly in order to remedy something there must be some level of injustice."
2013.12-1184,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,930.013,935.652,"Mr. Telscher, could I just ask very quickly the factors that you would think a Court should consider."
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,945.757,947.193,"No, there's more."
2013.12-1184,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,996.502,1006.435,"I think you did say if it's an exceptional case the district court must award fees, but the statute says may."
2013.12-1184,0,62294,rudolph_telscher,,1018.196,1023.647,Certainly there has been the issue of whether this determination is a one or two-step finding.
2013.12-1184,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1047.262,1048.059,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-1184,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1057.477,1060.054,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1154.5,1156.904,Now matter What other factors exist?
2013.12-1184,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1179.615,1180.693,"--It is an important point, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1180.693,1188.644,All of those things cannot justify shifting the award unless it is objectively unreasonable.
2013.12-1184,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1188.644,1189.783,"No, Justice Scalia, that's not our position."
2013.12-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1189.783,1190.314,"Oh, okay."
2013.12-1184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1204.058,1204.886,I see that.
2013.12-1184,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1230.704,1234.078,I think our view is that those are the kinds of circumstances--
2013.12-1184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1234.078,1234.514,All right.
2013.12-1184,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1236.233,1240.512,--I think as long as the Court makes clear that that is an illustrative list that I think captures the kind of bad faith--
2013.12-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1240.512,1241.824,"You want to add ""et cetera"", right?"
2013.12-1184,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1241.824,1256.413,"--And add ""or similar"", ""similar equitable"", ""similar and inequitable conduct"", which is what the Ninth Circuit said in the Park-in-Theaters case, which I think all the parties agree fairly captures what Congress intended to incorporate from the cases decided in the late Forties."
2013.12-1184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1256.413,1258.746,So where does gross injustice come from?
2013.12-1184,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1269.172,1283.431,"Well, I think the long laundry list reflects the kinds of circumstances in which courts operating between 1946 and 1952 interpreting the prior statute, those are the circumstances in which those courts had concluded that there was a gross injustice."
2013.12-1184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1286.805,1287.837,You don't think it.
2013.12-1184,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1300.348,1316.058,"--We are comfortable saying that and we do say that and we think it's especially salient and worth relying on here, not just because it's the legislative history, but also because that same legislative history and that same gross injustice language was repeatedly cited and talked about in the 1946 to '52 cases."
2013.12-1184,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1316.058,1324.289,"But I think, Mr. Martinez, what the Chief Justice is driving at is there's a bit of a disconnect between your list of factors and those two words."
2013.12-1184,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1350.953,1352.264,Let me -- let me explain by stepping back.
2013.12-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1352.264,1353.796,"But it's in the Senate report, so--"
2013.12-1184,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1355.638,1363.755,"Justice Kagan, we think that the way to look at the statute is to try to figure out what Congress understood the statute to mean in 1952."
2013.12-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1410.191,1415.563,"So if that's what you mean, why don't you say ""exceptional injustice"" instead of ""gross injustice""?"
2013.12-1184,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1415.563,1418.565,We're trying to tie the interpretation of the statute to the language--
2013.12-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1418.565,1419.875,To the Senate report.
2013.12-1184,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1419.875,1423.637,"--Not just to the Senate report, Justice Scalia, but to the judicial decisions."
2013.12-1184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1431.072,1432.619,It's a different statute.
2013.12-1184,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1436.82,1439.244,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1439.584,1441.569,It's a different statute.
2013.12-1184,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1443.687,1453.297,"--We think that when the situation involves, say, just an objectively unreasonable argument, we think that essentially the same test would apply from the EJA context."
2013.12-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1453.297,1464.856,So is there anything other than the objectively baseless and bad faith of the Brooks Furniture test that you would change?
2013.12-1184,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1473.743,1482.427,"I think it does, but I think it's very important if the Court were to go in that direction as long as it elaborates a couple of the additional points that I mentioned earlier."
2013.12-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1482.427,1486.425,"That it has to be a combination, a combination of factors, and--"
2013.12-1184,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1486.425,1496.124,"Yes, right, that both are not required, that it can be a combination of factors, that when the Brooks Furniture test says unjustified, that embraces the concept of objective unreasonable--"
2013.12-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1496.124,1502.372,"--By the way, I thought -- I thought the Federal Circuit said that you only use the objective unreasonable if there isn't one of the other things."
2013.12-1184,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1505.465,1525.987,"--I think they do, but I think that catch-all category in which they apply the two-pronged Brooks Furniture test covers potentially a very wide array of cases, because it covers any case in which perhaps there's bad faith conduct in bringing the litigation and also it covers the range of circumstances in which frivolous or unreasonable arguments are made."
2013.12-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1525.987,1536.608,"--Could you spend a moment on clear and convincing, because there's not a whole lot in your briefs on that part of it, although you do mention it in passing."
2013.12-1184,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1536.608,1537.201,Right.
2013.12-1184,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1576.482,1582.87,"What is the difference between -- you say the correct phrase is ""objectively unreasonable""?"
2013.12-1184,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1582.87,1588.321,"When we're dealing with just that, a case that raises a weak legal argument."
2013.12-1184,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1588.321,1590.009,That's different from objectively baseless.
2013.12-1184,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1591.461,1596.226,"It's not clear, Justice Alito, how the Federal Circuit conceives of it."
2013.12-1184,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1623.01,1625.104,And that's higher than the Rule 11 standard?
2013.12-1184,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1625.104,1628.399,"The Rule 11 standard, when it comes to unreasonable arguments, is frivolous."
2013.12-1184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1672.88,1674.177,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1678.307,1680.566,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2013.12-1184,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1729.641,1734.67,"Well, in PRE, of course, we were concerned about infringing on First Amendment rights and that's not the case here."
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1734.67,1741.637,"Well, I think you could argue that there is at least a First Amendment concern that's in here; but in any event, what it seems to me--"
2013.12-1184,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1741.637,1743.884,"First Amendment concern, what, to bring a patent case?"
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1743.884,1745.695,"--Well, access to the courts, access to the courts."
2013.12-1184,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1753.896,1758.598,Do you think Congress could not require the loser to pay in all cases?
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1758.598,1761.096,"Well, I have no doubt that Congress could -- well, I'm not sure about in all cases."
2013.12-1184,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1761.096,1764.235,"I mean, if it can do that, there's certainly no First Amendment problem."
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1764.235,1766.142,"Well, I'm not sure I concede that in all cases."
2013.12-1184,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1776.013,1776.528,That's an English rule.
2013.12-1184,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1781.713,1783.476,This is not your best argument.
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1783.484,1785.773,"--It is not my best argument, I appreciate that."
2013.12-1184,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1809.436,1812.435,How different is this from sanctionable misconduct?
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1825.242,1853.513,"--Well, because the provision was enacted in 1952, Justice Sotomayor, or long before this kind of litigation, these kind of rules that would have rendered the litigation sanctionable existed, and so as a consequence of that -- and I think it's important to put it into context because, you know, when Congress did this initially in 1946, to be sure, it's the Senate report that talks about gross injustice, but it is the decisions of the courts that adopted that approach of gross injustice."
2013.12-1184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1866.037,1868.693,Why does it always have to be objectively based?
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1938.384,1938.946,Yes.
2013.12-1184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1938.946,1945.507,And so I do not see why you couldn't have an exceptional case where attorneys' fees should be shifted.
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1959.314,1966.904,"I think the problem with the approach you propose there, Justice Breyer, is you're trying to deal with a very small slice of the problem of litigation."
2013.12-1184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1968.56,1975.103,"I know, but I -- of course it may be a small slice of litigation, but it is a slice that costs a lot of people a lot of money--"
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1975.103,1975.743,--But the problem--
2013.12-1184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1975.743,1991.05,"--and so I would like to know if I do run across that small slice why cannot I, the district judge, say, I've see all these things, taken together they spell serious injustice, and therefore, I'm shifting the fees."
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2003.53,2016.836,"--Because when Congress enacted the statute, adopted the exceptional-case standard, it meant essentially to require that the litigation be unjustified and vexatious."
2013.12-1184,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2029.237,2040.796,"Well, baseless is at the end of the day -- I mean, you have a case that involves a straight stroke rail that at one ends going in a elliptical arc, and the district judge had to figure this out with all the experts."
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2057.101,2064.161,"Well, if at the end of the day there's nothing there, then I think it is objectively baseless, even though they've gone through the litigation."
2013.12-1184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2065.098,2066.114,Not nothing there.
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2101.021,2102.48,"--It usually comes through in the opinions, actually."
2013.12-1184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2102.48,2103.927,Yes.
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2106.332,2111.736,"But, Justice Breyer, you know, the case you have in front of you, though, is not a case like that."
2013.12-1184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2111.736,2129.169,"--Well, let's send it back and tell them that they were imposing a standard that was too narrow, that didn't take count of all the circumstances where something could be unusually unjust, and then let them, no clear and convincing, but it's up to you, district judge."
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2131.806,2133.209,Can I say two things about that?
2013.12-1184,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2140.709,2148.582,"If the Court is dealing with the Federal Circuit's test and it's got these two things, baseless and--"
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2148.582,2151.065,--Subjective--
2013.12-1184,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2151.065,2167.619,"--and clear and convincing evidence, I think to leave out that piece of it when it all comes out of that one paragraph in the Brooks Furniture case, so I think once the case is before us, if we leave out that one piece--"
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2167.619,2182.677,"--I don't -- well, Justice Ginsburg, I do not believe that the clear and convincing evidence standard is fairly subsumed within the question of whether or not the objective baselessness standard ought to be applied, any more than the second case you're going to hear today is subsumed by these case."
2013.12-1184,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2192.174,2207.495,"--Why don't we just take -- there's another statute, as you know, that has identical wording, the Lanham Act, and that says exceptional means not run of the mine, uncommon."
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2212.852,2213.758,I read that opinion.
2013.12-1184,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2213.758,2220.193,"Why don't we say, well, we have it there in the Lanham Act, the same words."
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2220.193,2221.051,Right.
2013.12-1184,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2267.674,2269.876,We look to the text and the text is identical in both.
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2287.525,2289.602,"Well, I -- I -- two answers to that."
2013.12-1184,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2319.215,2320.153,Mr. Phillips--
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2320.153,2321.168,Justice Breyer--
2013.12-1184,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2321.168,2321.48,--please--
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2321.48,2330.992,"--The one thing I do want to say, Justice Breyer, in -- in response to -- to your argument about why don't you leave it for the district court in that -- in that circumstance."
2013.12-1184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2371.288,2372.866,"That's true, but you could then appeal."
2013.12-1184,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2397.012,2407.804,"Mr. Phillips, their lawyers might well given them different advice if they didn't know that Hey, nothing to lose, given the test that the Federal Circuit has, you know."
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2407.804,2410.022,"Well, I mean, the idea that there's nothing to lose--"
2013.12-1184,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2410.022,2412.319,"Hey, I would give -- I would give the same advice."
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2413.052,2414.255,--Justice Scalia--
2013.12-1184,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2414.255,2416.613,"This guy is a possible competitor, sue him."
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2418.504,2419.58,--But there is something to lose.
2013.12-1184,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2445.804,2447.399,"If it goes to litigation, yes."
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2462.985,2467.202,"Well, I mean, I don't know whether that's an easy call for the defendant."
2013.12-1184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2493.098,2495.815,"Yeah, but the -- the difficulty here, I not -- see it from my point of view for a second."
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2503.813,2504.64,Of course.
2013.12-1184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2504.64,2505.218,All right.
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2565.538,2566.022,Right.
2013.12-1184,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2594.979,2603.116,"Mr. Phillips, I realize that you have this argument that this statute was before Rule 11, so the -- the super fluidity argument doesn't work."
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2616.423,2622.701,--Are -- are you -- are you asking me that just about the baseless litigation or all of 285?
2013.12-1184,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2659.078,2660.125,Let me make sure I understand you.
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2670.37,2678.913,"Again, I mean, the -- the clear one -- again, if you're only talking about the baselessness component, I don't know that there is one like that."
2013.12-1184,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2696.859,2701.92,"Inequitable conduct to the trademark office, but not with respect to the suit itself?"
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2701.92,2702.809,Right.
2013.12-1184,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2704.465,2704.821,So there's nothing--
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2704.821,2705.214,There is--
2013.12-1184,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2705.214,2709.918,"--There's nothing with respect to the suit itself, then Rule 11 and inherent authority wouldn't get you anyway?"
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2709.918,2717.025,"--Well, litigation misconduct is something that may or may not go against the party, depending on which rule it is and how it plays out."
2013.12-1184,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2759.055,2772.082,"What about the inherent authority -- Justice Kagan brought this up -- not just Rule 11, but inherent authority when the court finds that the litigation is baseless and brought in bad faith?"
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2782.326,2784.919,"Well, today -- today that's -- I think that may be true."
2013.12-1184,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2824.388,2825.263,--So where does the bad faith come in?
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2825.263,2825.777,I'm sorry?
2013.12-1184,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2825.777,2827.418,Where does the bad faith come in?
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2831.4,2837.929,"I mean, we -- we obviously have, because it's in the Federal Circuit's standard, we -- we embrace it."
2013.12-1184,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2868.573,2870.26,--Would you address the clear and convincing?
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2870.26,2871.666,"Yeah, I -- well."
2013.12-1184,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2871.666,2873.587,I know your argument it's not.
2013.12-1184,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2873.587,2875.461,That it's not in the -- that it's not before us.
