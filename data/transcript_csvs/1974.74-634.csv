1974.74-634,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,65.018,"We'll hear arguments next in 74-634, United States against Nobles."
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,69.848,73.121,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1974.74-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,111.174,115.545,Why do you refer to it as ordering a defendant to do it Mr. Freidman?
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,119.14,122.801,"Well, it really is directed to the witness because at his report."
1974.74-634,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,143.198,145.508,Is this the Southern District of California --
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,145.508,147.622,This is the Central District of California --
1974.74-634,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,147.622,148.209,You must --
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,148.209,152.468,"The Central District of California, the trial was in Los Angeles."
1974.74-634,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,152.468,158.993,"One that they is trying to -- they give that stuff ahead of time, it could file at McCray's office."
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,158.993,163.424,"Apparently, that does not occur in the Central District of California as a matter of practice."
1974.74-634,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,163.424,165.35,At least in this particular court.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,165.35,165.757,That's correct.
1974.74-634,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,165.757,166.745,That's --
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,166.745,169.729,"He never looks in the clerk's office, maybe it's there all the time."
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,169.729,187.13,"Judging from the transcript in this case, I sincerely doubt that. Our position basically is that cases like Jencks, and Gordon, and Goldman of this Court really support the view that a trial judge has that kind of a discretion."
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,192.457,194.902,Is this sort of a reverse Jencks case?
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,194.902,197.592,"It is sort of a reverse Jencks case, yes."
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,327.805,328.494,I misses that.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,333.203,346.269,"The Court made the ruling prior to the defense investigator being called to the stand and he said that, he would require production of relevant portions after the direct testimony of the investigator."
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,347.794,351.495,-- anybody but he know that time that the investigator was going to testify?
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,351.495,354.707,The defense had called them to the stand.
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,371.506,372.911,Is on cross-examination.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,372.911,373.188,Cross-examination --
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,373.188,374.526,Of that prosecution witness --
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,374.526,375.512,By a defense counsel.
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,375.512,375.712,Right.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,375.712,376.548,That's right.
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,384.305,385.373,All right.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,385.373,388.395,And in fact he did not see only the back of the man.
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,447.741,453.851,"Before that conferral was other defense colleagues is the defense counsel had agreed to this, hadn't he?"
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,453.851,458.322,"He had, (voice overlap)he updated some mild protest but he had aptly asked yes."
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,465.805,467.722,"Now, this is now the defense putting on its case."
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,467.722,468.87,The defense putting on its case.
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,526.622,527.57,With the investigator --
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,527.57,527.95,To the investigator --
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,527.95,528.856,-- to get the investigator's report.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,528.856,529.455,That's right.
1974.74-634,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,529.455,534.832,"But well that seems, if we can go limited to the direct testimony whether it was to be in the investigator."
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,534.832,542.873,Limited to the direct testimony of the investigator as it relate it to his interviews with those witnesses and that if --
1974.74-634,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,542.873,545.945,That's the same in Jencks Act limitation.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,545.945,549.765,"I think it's the same exact Jencks limitation, yes."
1974.74-634,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,549.765,553.94,Was he about to use those reports?
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,553.94,555.874,"Was -- I'm sorry, was who about to use the reports?"
1974.74-634,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,555.874,560.365,The defense investigator who was going to impeach the Government witnesses.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,560.365,571.722,It is not clear from the record whether he was going to use the reports to refresh his recollection while on the stand and it was never developed because this subject matter was not going into.
1974.74-634,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,571.722,580.664,"Won't -- if it weren't shown under the new rules of evidence when they go into affect, if that weren't shown, you wouldn't get these?"
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,580.664,584.267,"Well, I'm not sure that that's entirely true and I think that's it."
1974.74-634,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,584.267,587.521,"I'll put it this way, there's a problem -- then you'd have a problem on the rules would you."
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,587.521,589.725,"I think we have a bigger problem in this case, yes."
1974.74-634,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,589.725,593.466,-- and whether you can solve or not is another matter.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,593.466,595.091,I'll attempt to solve it.
1974.74-634,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,595.091,596.396,"Well, one of these days, you'll have to."
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,596.396,600.276,"But, I think that the rules are obviously were not in affect."
1974.74-634,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,600.276,603.689,Were not affect till July?
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,603.689,606.758,And are not in affect until July 1st of this year.
1974.74-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,606.758,618.095,Did the District Court's restriction on Bond's testimony permit him to testify as to the lighting in the bank without showing the report?
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,618.095,620.748,"Yes, and he did so testify."
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,620.748,624.359,"Well, we're getting a little ahead of the story."
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,624.359,631.004,"Alright, at the bench, they were discussing the matter the judge reiterated his ruling, made clear that it was limited to only the relevant portions."
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,646.078,647.433,Then or ever.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,649.24,649.957,"Yes, he would not turn --"
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,649.957,652.36,He is then or after the investigator.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,652.36,664.178,"That's correct and the Court -- at some point, there were some discussion about why I let them testify and then striking the Courts and well, I think we can rule on this before the witness and I want to know your intentions, you're an officer of the Court."
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,696.054,700.503,"The trial -- in the Trial Court, this material was turned over --"
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,700.503,705.572,"To the Trial Court, the material in the defense investigator's report --"
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,705.572,707.029,Right.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,707.029,712.648,"Was -- what was turned over to the Trial Court, I believe, under seal so I've never seen it."
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,712.648,712.995,Right.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,712.995,717.177,Is a proffer as to what Bond would testify to.
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,747.072,752.529,He most as I read the story a little bit after the investigator did testified at any?
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,752.529,755.082,The investigator testified as to other matters.
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,755.082,756.519,But not as to these two witnesses.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,756.519,757.897,But not as to these two witnesses.
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,757.897,759.063,And why not?
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,759.063,770.461,Because the Court ruled that if he or counsel refused to comply with the order to turnover the report that he would be precluded --
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,770.461,770.978,From testifying --
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,770.978,772.723,-- in testifying in the subject matter.
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,772.723,773.479,On that subject.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,773.479,774.006,And so --
1974.74-634,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,774.006,775.97,More than Jencks.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,775.97,777.876,"No, I think that under Jencks --"
1974.74-634,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,777.876,780.824,"He didn't get -- under Jencks, you don't get it until a fellow has testified."
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,780.824,781.531,Yes.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,781.531,809.511,"Well, the Court's or the Court ruled prior to his taking the stand but he made clear that his order would only apply after the direct testimony said, “After the direct testimony, you must turnover these portions of the report but tell me now whether you're going to comply with that order and if you're not going to comply rather than what I'm testifying then striking I will do the functional equivalent which is to prevent him from going in to the subject matter at all.”"
1974.74-634,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,817.533,820.854,"If it's just anticipating the problem, wasn't he?"
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,820.854,821.264,Exactly.
1974.74-634,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,828.228,833.416,But the other way that matters in having to testify in order to turn it over.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,833.416,834.212,"That's right, but the --"
1974.74-634,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,834.212,835.749,Is that the ordinary Jencks procedure?
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,835.749,836.588,Yes.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,836.588,839.031,That's the ordinary Jencks procedure.
1974.74-634,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,839.031,844.914,I know that and I gather practices growing upturning over so according to Jencks statements --
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,844.914,845.254,Well in advance.
1974.74-634,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,845.254,847.048,-- to defense counsel before the trial begins.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,847.048,848.166,"Well, other than that?"
1974.74-634,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,848.166,852.797,"But under the statute itself, there not obligation to turn anything or run in the part of the government."
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,852.797,853.324,That's right.
1974.74-634,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,853.324,856.176,"Until the witnesses completed his direct testimony, is that right?"
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,856.176,861.594,"And by the trial judges order, there was no obligation to turn it over until after he completed his direct testimony."
1974.74-634,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,861.594,865.514,"Well, what I'm wondering is if you had a Jencks Act situation."
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,871.042,885.375,"I'm not sure if that's true Mr. Justice Brennan because it seems to me that if a prosecutor were to make that kind of a statement in advance, all the witness being called it all for whatever reason, it just doesn't happen that much."
1974.74-634,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,886.072,891.08,"I know it doesn't happen, I'm just wondering whether the judge would have that authority."
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,892.944,898.114,I don't think he would be required to let him testify and then strike it.
1974.74-634,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,899.11,902.942,"Certainly, out of the Jencks opinion what would have happened as you'd have to dismiss indictment?"
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,902.942,903.342,That's right.
1974.74-634,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,913.234,920.621,"At some point, would you tell me why we should decide this case when 613 (a) is going to become effective on July 1?"
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,920.621,925.242,"Well, other than the fact that 613 (a) didn't govern but it may govern on a retrial."
1974.74-634,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,933.362,935.568,"But this will survive 613 (a), will it?"
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,935.568,938.36,I think it will survive 613 (a) because if you look at the history --
1974.74-634,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,938.36,944.822,Because otherwise I don't see that this just be a decision from this case we wouldn't be settling in a major question of law.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,944.822,953.372,"Well, I don't think that refreshing recollection has to be a precondition to the trial judge exercising his discretion in this kind of a circumstance."
1974.74-634,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,953.482,955.259,"Well, that will be an issue under 613 (a) does it?"
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,955.259,968.633,"Yes, it will be because 613 as it was originally came from the Court required did not provide judges' discretion but said whether refreshing was done while testifying or prior testifying would be turned over."
1974.74-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,979.121,992.327,"Well, do you see the scope of the trial judges order here requiring a turnover as being necessarily tantamount to allowing the prosecution to offer this in our inhabit admitted in evidence?"
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,992.327,994.66,"Well, I don't think so."
1974.74-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1030.058,1039.316,"But I would think it is not precisely the same for the Trial Court to say, “you must make available to the prosecutor this document.”"
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1044.114,1054.22,"The two questions are clearly distinguished but I think Jencks said, that I think Claremore said, I think Campbell said it, that production for the purposes of cross-examination."
1974.74-634,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1112.978,1119.406,This is the statement allegedly made to an investigator suppose Mr. Allis himself been his own investigator.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1119.406,1120.971,Mr. Nobles the defendant?
1974.74-634,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1120.971,1121.438,The attorney.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1121.438,1123.025,Or the attorney.
1974.74-634,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1123.292,1126.583,And he made a note which are case be any different.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1126.583,1130.166,I don't think so.
1974.74-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1170.976,1176.034,"-- protect it from discovery in the civil action by Hickman against Taylor, wasn't it?"
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1176.034,1183.667,The statements would be protected pretrial from discover in a civil action.
1974.74-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1214.358,1224.3,But I mean by Justice Blackmun's hypothesis that where the lawyer himself id the interview and then it's clearly protected from pretrial case.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1224.3,1226.077,"From pretrial discovery, yes under Hickman --"
1974.74-634,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1226.077,1238.677,"And how about in this verdict case if a man walks in off the street and tells a lawyer that I heard so on and so say this not took some notes on it, and he calls him as a witness, same rule?"
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1238.677,1242.867,If the witness himself took the notes of what the other person had said.
1974.74-634,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1242.867,1246.787,And it comes in that the lawyer didn't know a thing about it.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1246.787,1249.749,But the lawyer chooses to call him as a witness.
1974.74-634,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1249.749,1251.196,That's right.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1251.196,1251.933,Well --
1974.74-634,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1251.933,1254.636,Use your phrase seeking the truth.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1254.636,1257.279,"Well, isn't that what the criminal trial is all about."
1974.74-634,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1257.279,1259.053,"I say, assuming that."
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1259.053,1259.283,And --
1974.74-634,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1259.283,1262.571,"Well, with the rule applied, it is the man to walk in out of the street?"
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1262.571,1273.499,"I think if they had taken written notes and testified about the content of those notes, substance of those notes that the prosecutor had to be able to see them for purposes of cross-examination."
1974.74-634,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1273.499,1277.758,And now the lawyer will walk into the courtroom and volunteered himself as a witness.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1277.758,1279.076,And the defense attorney?
1974.74-634,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1279.076,1281.679,"No, and the judge called him as a witness."
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1281.679,1288.903,"If he's the court's witness, then perhaps both counsel entitled to see the notes."
1974.74-634,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1288.903,1296.815,What's you're doing if you try to get this case reverse so you can put the new rule on and then never to do --
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1296.815,1303.09,"No, I mean the purpose whether the new rule applies or not."
1974.74-634,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1335.707,1336.713,Alright.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1352.152,1355.447,That's right.
1974.74-634,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1355.447,1366.713,Did you object to defense cross-examination of the defense witnesses at that time about their prior statements without the defense giving you a copy of any notes they made of their statement?
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1366.713,1369.096,You mean of a defense cross-examination of the Government.
1974.74-634,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1369.096,1370.294,Yes.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1370.294,1376.839,There was a request by the prosecutor at that time for the notes.
1974.74-634,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1376.839,1389.341,Wasn't there a rule -- a common rule of evidence that if you're going to cross-examine a witness about a prior statement of his especially took were written that you're supposed to show it to him?
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1389.341,1392.513,We thank him and we make this argument in our brief too.
1974.74-634,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1404.523,1410.535,"Well, when the Government witnesses were being cross-examined, did you ask for them now?"
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1410.535,1417.012,"In the case of Van Gamoran, the prosecutor made the request that the witness will be showing the statement and that he too the prosecutor be showing it."
1974.74-634,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1417.012,1417.302,Well --
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1417.302,1418.428,That was done.
1974.74-634,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1418.428,1428.439,"If there are retrial and the rules were in a effect and they apply, let's assume they apply, you would demand these statements I've taken under 613 at the time of the cross-examination."
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1428.439,1433.038,"I would think so, yes."
1974.74-634,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1433.038,1442.267,"But if you're concentrating -- if you were just concentrating on getting the documents because the defense investigator is go on the stand, then you'd face with Rule 612."
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1442.267,1451.454,"That's right, which creates more problems I agree and does Rule 613."
1974.74-634,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1461.552,1463.309,"Well, I know what you'd just said Mr. Freidman."
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1468.117,1483.364,"Well, for one thing, the respondent makes a whole slew of constitutional arguments that would stand in the way of the common law, Jencks case type doctrine that we're talking about if he's right."
1974.74-634,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1486.266,1488.701,The Jencks case was not a constitutional decision.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1488.701,1499.794,That's right and my point is that we -- our position is that the same principles of Jencks apply unless there's some constitutional privilege that stands in the way because the government is different from --
1974.74-634,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1499.794,1500.83,-- distinguishing the Government.
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1500.83,1501.666,Right.
1974.74-634,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1540.51,1545.718,"So far as the Court of Appeals judgment went there, there will be a retrial."
1974.74-634,0,37900,paul_l_freidman,,1545.718,1547.135,That's right.
1974.74-634,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1568.316,1579.367,Mr. Allis.
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,1627.094,1630.615,"Yes, Your Honor, I'd like to if I may --"
1974.74-634,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1630.615,1633.976,And then you can deal with that anytime you wanted in the order of your argument.
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,1637.18,1640.312,"Well, I appreciate that if I could reserve it for a little bit later."
1974.74-634,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1640.312,1640.53,Fine.
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,1640.53,1657.74,I would like to say it this time though Your Honor that the statement of Van Gamoran of the statement of Hoffman which was the written report of the investigator were place under seal for the Court of Appeals.
1974.74-634,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1673.165,1678.267,Do we know that any of the judges did if they were under seal from the District Court?
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,1678.267,1679.235,I do not know sir.
1974.74-634,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1692.223,1697.051,"The statements you mean the investigator, reports are all oral statements to him?"
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,1697.051,1697.59,That's correct.
1974.74-634,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1697.59,1699.127,Is that what in fact it is?
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,1699.127,1699.826,Yes.
1974.74-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1699.826,1704.285,Did this panel set in that the panel I'm sure it's set in San Francisco or Los Angeles.
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,1704.285,1707.449,Los Angeles.
1974.74-634,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1782.945,1789.428,"-- the facts -- are both of those versions we're suggested through cross-examination of course, aren't they?"
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,1789.428,1789.638,"Yes, sir."
1974.74-634,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1789.638,1794.267,"-- of the two prosecution witnesses in the form of, didn't you tell investigator that?"
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,1794.267,1797.778,"Yes, they were Mr. Justice Stewart."
1974.74-634,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1883.649,1900.217,"May I ask this question I'm sure I don't understand the postural case but if the statements in the possession of your witness corroborated his testimony, why did you object to that being presented to the jury?"
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,1900.217,1915.495,"Your Honor, I objected to it being presented to the jury because in my belief at that time, it undercut two of the most fundamental interest in favor of the defendant in our criminal justice system."
1974.74-634,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1920.922,1924.797,"Well, were you representing the defendants generally or representing this defendant?"
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,1924.797,1925.074,I --
1974.74-634,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1925.074,1926.951,Where was your primary obligation?
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,1926.951,1933.606,"It was with this defendant Your Honor and this case presents the exact problem, it seems to me --"
1974.74-634,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1933.606,1949.546,"Well, if that suggested by my earlier question and now by Justice Powell's question, if the representation is made by inference or contained them and report, why wouldn't that help your client?"
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,1949.546,1961.291,The exact words would've helped the client because the exact words were in the reports as those reports in the safe now show.
1974.74-634,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2031.719,2038.833,Did the judge think he would exercise all the matter that was not relevant to the precise issue?
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2038.833,2039.861,He did sir.
1974.74-634,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2040.049,2046.754,Could intact to the subject of excising and not open new to this problem?
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2046.754,2047.57,"Yes, sir."
1974.74-634,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2053.13,2060.572,How could you decide that your hypothetical -- how could he decide other than then it was relevant?
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2060.572,2078.827,"Sir, I think it's at least arguable and I'd certainly believe that a judge could decide if you suggest that it is relevant and that it should be turned over and that would violate the underlying principle of our system of justice in the accusatory system whereby the Government must bare the entire burden."
1974.74-634,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2103.619,2109.871,Even when the defense opens up the subject on cross-examination?
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2109.871,2120.131,"Well sir, Mr. Justice Powell, we were willing to have Bond cross-examined."
1974.74-634,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2146.216,2152.791,Was this report in Bond's handwriting or had it been typed by his typewriter?
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2152.791,2157.619,It had been type by a secretary later at subsequent to the interview.
1974.74-634,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2173.742,2186.272,Would your position here today be different if you would had in your possession statements signed by the prosecution witnesses that had been referred to in cross-examination?
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2186.272,2188.607,If -- yes -- if the statements --
1974.74-634,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2188.607,2189.575,It would be different?
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2189.575,2190.823,"Yes, it would because --"
1974.74-634,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2190.823,2196.29,You would agree that those statements could be demanded by the Trial Court?
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2196.29,2197.587,"Yes, sir."
1974.74-634,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2198.496,2211.422,And tell me again why draw to this -- the distinction between our statements signed by a witness and the recordation of the witness statement by your investigator.
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2211.422,2215.564,"Your Honor, it's based on the common law rules of evidence."
1974.74-634,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2245.837,2248.342,This is what product?
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2250.069,2250.676,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.74-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2301.306,2306.434,"The rule of the Queens case is a rule governing cross-examination, isn't it?"
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2306.434,2308.628,"Yes, yes, it is Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1974.74-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2308.628,2313.027,And it's followed some places and not others?
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2313.027,2316.05,That's correct.
1974.74-634,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2316.05,2325.787,You are talking about witnesses in terms of the two prosecution witnesses focusing upon Bond as a witness.
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2336.381,2336.938,That's right.
1974.74-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2342.515,2348.491,But you weren't required to produce that until the prosecution was going to examine it.
1974.74-634,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2348.491,2349.21,Right.
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2349.21,2350.116,That's right.
1974.74-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2350.116,2353.988,And the Court -- there it's a clear case of the Queens case rule.
1974.74-634,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2353.988,2356.753,I think of the Bond now is the witness.
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2356.753,2357.15,"No, sir."
1974.74-634,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2370.019,2371.185,Well what about --
1974.74-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2371.185,2373.099,You're confused in terms.
1974.74-634,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2378.279,2379.175,There is no such thing.
1974.74-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2379.175,2382.767,There's direct examination and there's a --
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2382.767,2384.272,I beg your pardon.
1974.74-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2395.892,2397.207,When you're going to cross-examine --
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2397.207,2420.16,"-- when I'm cross-examining them but it would not apply to make me turnover to the Government statements in my position when my own witness has completed his testimony, the rule on the Queens case would apply to Bond insofar as any statements of Bond in the possession of the Government would have to be turned over to me during their cross-examination to him --"
1974.74-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2420.16,2422.503,"Well, to him rather than you?"
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2422.503,2423.701,"To him, yes."
1974.74-634,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2423.701,2424.857,"Mr. Allis, so when --"
1974.74-634,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2424.857,2425.324,That's right.
1974.74-634,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2425.324,2432.24,When the Government undertook it had Mr. Bond testified and the Government would then be entitled cross-examine and you'll agree.
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2432.24,2433.176,"Yes, sir."
1974.74-634,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2433.176,2441.72,Could the Government ask him whether he had refreshed his recollection about the interview by reference to his notes that were made?
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2441.72,2443.115,Certainly.
1974.74-634,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2443.115,2451.996,"Well, isn't there quite an old established rule that notes used to refresh recollection of witness maybe examined by the opposing counsel?"
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2451.996,2453.212,"Yes, it is Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.74-634,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2453.212,2455.316,"Then, what's the problem here?"
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2455.316,2465.962,There was no evidence in the record in the Court of Appeals specifically found this to support any contention that his recollection was refreshed.
1974.74-634,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2465.962,2469.356,"No, but you can't know that."
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2472.598,2473.574,That's correct.
1974.74-634,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2473.574,2481.492,"He's inquiring and interviewing dozens of people in many, many cases I would assume, is that not so?"
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2481.492,2482.179,That's true.
1974.74-634,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2483.684,2489.121,Just might the counter part of the investigator for the law enforcement agency.
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2502.269,2525.261,"Perhaps Your Honor, I don't think its necessarily true in all cases and if that if where you have the case of a very important trial and the witness is just been interviewed and because of some items and other parts of the report not relevant or not specifically connected with the statements he would testify to if the defense counsel didn't."
1974.74-634,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2544.836,2547.778,He wouldn't ask on cross-examination whether he had it?
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2547.778,2552.616,"No, he was not Your Honor."
1974.74-634,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2553.864,2555.1,-- at all?
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2555.1,2571.973,"-- is that the rules of disclosure of documents that are in effect at the time of trial are compose of the common law rules of evidence, Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and the Jencks Act."
1974.74-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2649.21,2660.262,"What if on cross-examination, you would ask the Government's witness whether they were aware of a bloody shirt that had been found in connection with this thing and their answer was “no”."
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2692.656,2697.11,"If the shirt were thrown on the table Your Honor, it would in effect be produce at the trial."
1974.74-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2704.856,2708.058,"Yes, you certainly are."
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2720.444,2750.951,"Your Honor in my cross-examination, I had the report or a copy of that part that I wanted to question the witness about so that I could make sure I was restating the exact words which she told John Bond but it never been referred too at all and it had never had been brought out before the jury that there was a report written, never shown to the jury, never introduced an evidence."
1974.74-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2783.713,2790.487,"Of course, Judge Pratt's order in the Wright case was a good deal broader than the District Court's order here, wasn't it?"
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2790.487,2791.655,"Yes, it was."
1974.74-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2913.986,2925.244,Hickman wouldn't protect the statement made to an investigating agent would it as oppose to the statement made to a lawyer and Mr. Justice Blackmun's hypothetical?
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2925.244,2932.108,This is the petitioner's viewpoint and it's true that Hickman did deal with the statement made to the attorney as oppose to an investigator.
1974.74-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2932.108,2941.969,There's a lot of District Court law that says that statements for investigators are not protected under Hickman.
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2941.969,2955.732,"Your Honor, we've cited down in our brief a number of cases which say that Hickman does apply so I think that although there are some would say it doesn't apply, there are that many that would say it does apply."
1974.74-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2955.732,2959.582,"I think you're right on your Rule 16 argument, it's irrelevant."
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,2959.582,2966.846,"That's correct, that is absolutely correct Your Honor, I'm just moving now into our three privilege arguments."
1974.74-634,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3034.855,3043.354,"Mr. Allis, what would you do if the witness had the notes in his own pocket while he's up to testify?"
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,3045.696,3060.366,It would be if he had refresh his recollection with the notes and conceivably it would be different if he in some way indicated although I would argue or not to the jury by waiving the report and somehow relying on the fact that he --
1974.74-634,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3060.366,3066.052,"-- you get your confidentiality award, he has in his pocket."
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,3066.052,3075.257,The confidentiality Your Honors protects all internal documents of the defense made by the defense team.
1974.74-634,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3082.554,3082.953,No.
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,3082.953,3084.169,-- from one --
1974.74-634,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3084.169,3086.389,"In my case, well he got some notes in his pocket."
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,3089.706,3099.161,"Mr. Justice Marshall, you're correct in suggesting that that would be different then in the sense that it certainly not a communication by one member of the defense team."
1974.74-634,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3099.161,3106.735,But it wouldn't be necessarily a working product but it could be made it like you take position if it's in your hands it's obviously a working product.
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,3107.432,3109.985,That's correct Mr. Justice Marshall.
1974.74-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3109.985,3117.418,"What if I'm representing a condemnee, and I employ an appraiser and he makes a report to me as the value of the property."
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,3125.967,3132.522,I think that it certainly would be much more arguable that something like that could be produce for two reasons.
1974.74-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3145.151,3151.289,You can be wrong on Hickman and still prevail because this is a criminal case I did?
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,3151.289,3153.772,"Yes, Your Honor, we'd contend that."
1974.74-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3165.544,3171.222,"Well, don't you think an attorney for a condemnee is a pretty much of close agent too?"
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,3171.222,3173.615,"Yes, sir."
1974.74-634,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3173.615,3184.216,"Mr. Allis, what do you normally do, I'm not talking about you personally but what the defense counsel normally do, when they send an investigator out."
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,3218.301,3231.127,I would certainly prefer that that it's my normal practice to have the investigator get a written statement signed by the witness or approved by him then it's much more effective in examining the witness.
1974.74-634,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3252.996,3254.062,One of these two witnesses?
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,3254.062,3254.649,Hoffman.
1974.74-634,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3254.649,3255.485,Hoffman.
1974.74-634,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3255.485,3264.608,"But in many cases, you have no idea whether the witness is going to be pro-government or pro-defense or just as neutral as he can be?"
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,3264.608,3277.268,"Your Honor, bank teller after a bank robbery in my experience tends to be a prejudice against the defendant assuming that the Government's right in bringing the man in the trial."
1974.74-634,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3277.268,3280.17,Prejudice against the robber but --
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,3280.17,3282.296,"I beg your pardon, prejudice against the robber."
1974.74-634,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3282.296,3286.486,"Whether or not he was --this defendant was one of the robbers, that was the whole issue here?"
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,3286.486,3287.093,That's correct.
1974.74-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3385.66,3396.569,I suppose Bond is down the stand and you were asking the questions that would impeach the government witnesses by saying that they did tell him so and so.
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,3410.702,3419.744,"In my understanding Mr. Justice White, your question as assuming a situation where the report has been shown to the jury although not actually verdict that referred to --"
1974.74-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3419.744,3421.67,"Well, that's referred to the jury at all."
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,3426.67,3427.798,And he's looking at the report?
1974.74-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3427.798,3429.092,He's looking at a piece of paper.
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,3429.092,3433.873,Certainly that report should be turned over to the Government because he's refreshing his recollection with it.
1974.74-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3433.873,3438.921,"Well, what difference does that make in terms of your privileges?"
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,3438.921,3455.646,"The -- my answer to that, Your Honor, is that the refreshing recollection doctrine has traditionally been a matter of common law trial practice and has therefore been an exception to any privilege argument."
1974.74-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3455.646,3455.844,"So, you think --"
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,3455.844,3459.026,I think it's a question of waiver perhaps.
1974.74-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3459.026,3463.006,"At least you think, Rule 16 doesn't forbid that?"
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,3463.006,3465.112,Absolutely not if there's a specific --
1974.74-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3465.112,3474.01,"It's the same piece of paper that you say Rule 16 would protect you from producing it if you weren't looking at it, at the trial."
1974.74-634,1,36988,nicholas_r_allis,,3474.01,3495.371,"Your Honor, our contention is that the common law rules of evidence of which the rule refreshing recollection is one are complimentary to Rule 16 if there's a rule of the common law evidence specifically making an exception to Rule 16 then it should be followed, but here there is no specific rule."
1974.74-634,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3511.661,3513.765,You have anything further Mr. Freidman?
1974.74-634,2,37900,paul_l_freidman,,3513.765,3517.565,Just very briefly.
1974.74-634,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3596.695,3611.478,"The pillars, have you -- you still insisting that it's quite all right to keep the witness off the stand entirely rather than letting him testify and then demanding that you get the statement and having the Court order them to produce it?"
1974.74-634,2,37900,paul_l_freidman,,3611.478,3628.109,"All I'm saying is that in a situation like this with the problem as flagged early enough and it can be discussed and there can be legal argument out, a judge does not have to let the witness testify and then strike the testimony if counsel refuses to turn it over."
1974.74-634,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3647.741,3648.647,Thank you gentlemen.
