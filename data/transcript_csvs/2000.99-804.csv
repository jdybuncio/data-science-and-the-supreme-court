2000.99-804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.142,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-804, Carl W. Cleveland v. The United States."
2000.99-804,0,38136,paul_mogin,,7.968,11.124,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--
2000.99-804,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,49.867,53.127,What would they be punished under?
2000.99-804,0,38136,paul_mogin,,56.471,63.491,"Well in this case, for example, there's a false statement provision in the Louisiana video poker statute."
2000.99-804,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,63.491,67.245,--And that's fairly standard in State licensing schemes?
2000.99-804,0,38136,paul_mogin,,67.245,76.866,"I think it is, that there be a... that false statements are ordinarily punished... punishable by criminal provisions."
2000.99-804,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,109.267,117.612,Is it the case that the same would apply to a Federal agency?
2000.99-804,0,38136,paul_mogin,,122.42,125.104,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2000.99-804,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,138.767,149.131,But in any case it would be... any application for a permit to a Federal authority would be susceptible to the same argument.
2000.99-804,0,38136,paul_mogin,,156.766,179.762,"--Under the Fifth Circuit's analysis I think it would be possible that a Federal license application perhaps could be prosecuted if it met the Fifth Circuit's test, which is somewhat difficult to discern from the opinion, but there's nothing in what the Fifth Circuit says that would confine it to a State application, if that answers your question."
2000.99-804,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,179.762,180.793,Or in the statute.
2000.99-804,0,38136,paul_mogin,,180.793,181.908,Right.
2000.99-804,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,181.908,217.285,"Mr. Mogin, I think it would be helpful if we focused somewhat on the statutory language in this case to figure out what it covers, and we have to read it, I suppose, in light of this Court's decision in McNally, which does appear to suggest that it... the statute covers only the scheme to defraud the victim of money or property, although the statute doesn't say so in so many words."
2000.99-804,0,38136,paul_mogin,,254.165,267.556,"Justice O'Connor, there is no question the State is taking a substantial share of the revenue from video poker operations in Louisiana, but we don't see how that gives rise to any property interest."
2000.99-804,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,278.192,287.685,"Well, taking money from the victim is covered, according to McNally, so is it taking money from the State, in a sense, because of this revenues--"
2000.99-804,0,38136,paul_mogin,,287.685,290.824,"No, Justice O'Connor, we would say it is not."
2000.99-804,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,309.954,343.458,"--Did the State ever argue that it has an interest in assuring the users of these machines that the operators are honest and that by this alleged misstatement the goodwill, the confidence that the State has in its own licenses is somehow diminished, and that that's a taking of property, and of course you might say this is intangible property, but did they ever make that sort of argument?"
2000.99-804,0,38136,paul_mogin,,343.458,354.808,"--No, I don't believe that that argument has been made by the Government and, of course, there's no question that the regulatory scheme is designed to ensure the honesty and suitability of licensees."
2000.99-804,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,371.405,374.044,Are the licenses limited in number?
2000.99-804,0,38136,paul_mogin,,374.044,375.796,"--No, they're not, Justice Kennedy."
2000.99-804,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,375.796,377.532,Would that have made a difference?
2000.99-804,0,38136,paul_mogin,,380.604,409.399,"Well, it's our position that even if there were a limitation to some large number of licenses, that the same analysis would apply, but certainly that would be a factor to consider, and when you get to a very limited number of licenses, you may have a different analysis, because then there's... people are actually competing with each other for a license, and something important is being given away by the State."
2000.99-804,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,409.399,447.255,"Well, but even in that case, how would it affect any property interest of the State, unless you could show that the person who got the license somehow intended to exercise the rights under it, less than some other holder might have done, and thereby produce less revenue from the State, which is at least on the face of it counterintuitive, because the State and the licensee has the same interest in maximizing the amount of gambling that goes on, but save in that odd situation, how would a limited number of licenses affect your property analysis?"
2000.99-804,0,38136,paul_mogin,,447.255,456.832,"Well, I think that you're right, the mere fact that there's a limitation on the number would not, in our view, give rise to a property deprivation."
2000.99-804,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,458.977,467.067,"Would it be a basis for saying that there is a property interest at all, where there is not, as you argue, under these circumstances?"
2000.99-804,0,38136,paul_mogin,,467.067,475.241,"--Well, we think the term license is used in many different contexts, radio licenses, whatnot."
2000.99-804,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,500.587,507.934,"That would be true if there were just one license being given away, if there were only one gambling casino allowed in the whole State."
2000.99-804,0,38136,paul_mogin,,526.638,529.898,"--That is our position, Justice Scalia."
2000.99-804,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,545.791,546.495,"Well, I don't--"
2000.99-804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,546.495,552.522,"--How does the State lose something giving away one license, but not lose something giving away a number of licenses?"
2000.99-804,0,38136,paul_mogin,,552.522,571.181,"Well, if... Mr. Chief Justice, if there were only one license available, and if it were understood that once given it couldn't be taken back, then perhaps it could be said that the State was losing something because by giving the license it lost the ability to give it to anyone else."
2000.99-804,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,571.181,575.473,"But that's true if it gives away 10 licenses or 100 licenses, doesn't it?"
2000.99-804,0,38136,paul_mogin,,575.473,580.319,"Well, in this scheme, if 10 licenses are given out for video poker--"
2000.99-804,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,580.319,580.402,"Oh, I see."
2000.99-804,0,38136,paul_mogin,,590.35,592.829,--And we don't disagree.
2000.99-804,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,678.566,684.594,"Mr. Mogin, what do you do with the Government's argument that under the second clause of the statute you don't need a victim?"
2000.99-804,0,38136,paul_mogin,,688.697,693.427,"Justice Stevens, we have a number of responses to that."
2000.99-804,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,701.229,703.292,An alternative basis to affirm.
2000.99-804,0,38136,paul_mogin,,703.292,703.747,Right.
2000.99-804,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,781.849,785.192,How many years since McNally?
2000.99-804,0,38136,paul_mogin,,785.192,787.71,13 years.
2000.99-804,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,790.228,798.651,So we can assume that someone in Congress knew of this Court's interpretation and could have done something about it if it disagreed.
2000.99-804,0,38136,paul_mogin,,798.651,818.136,"That's right, Justice Ginsburg, and in fact in 1988 the statute was amended to deal with honest services cases, which had been thought to be the most important application of intangible rights doctrine, and those were brought under the statute if there was a deprivation of honest services."
2000.99-804,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,833.824,841.626,Would you give me an example... maybe the most obvious example you can think of... of the deprivation of honest services?
2000.99-804,0,38136,paul_mogin,,844.142,853.43,"Justice Souter, that refers to the principle that an employer has a right to expect that an employee will provide honest services, and so--"
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1144.33,1151.35,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.99-804,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1198.905,1235.685,"How has that property interest been infringed in any way, because there's no claim, as I understand it, and I don't know whether your argument suggests that there was any intent here to deprive the State of its licensing fees, and no intent here to deprive the State of its percentage, and no intent here, in effect, to conduct less gambling than would otherwise be possible in order to minimize revenue, so even if we accept your theory that there are property interests that the State can claim, how have any of them been infringed on the allegations of this complaint?"
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1235.685,1248.483,"--Justice Souter, I would agree that if there were a direct fraud at money or property of the State in a tangible form or in a financial form, that would be an easier case than this one."
2000.99-804,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1297.729,1300.041,But I don't see where the fraud comes into it.
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1343.692,1346.171,"Well, it's not a metaphysical property right."
2000.99-804,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1372.549,1382.496,"Okay, but as I understand it, then, the... what I was sort of disparaging as the metaphysical right is basically the State's regulatory interest."
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1399.214,1403.673,It is both a regulatory and a proprietary interest.
2000.99-804,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1403.673,1414.53,"But if we were to say, we're going to distinguish for purposes of this statute between the State's regulatory interest and the State's property interest, then you'd have to lose, wouldn't you?"
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1414.53,1422.415,"No, because I would define the State's property interest more broadly than simply the actual currency that is received under the license."
2000.99-804,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1422.415,1426.707,Did the State lose any revenue here because of the fraud?
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1426.707,1427.04,No.
2000.99-804,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1442.311,1451.022,"Well then, why isn't Justice Souter's question correct, that you're not talking about any orthodox property interest here that was lost to the State."
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1454.45,1461.341,"No, I think we are talking about a property interest that in the private sector would clearly be recognized as such."
2000.99-804,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1479.463,1482.907,But in a private action you have to show money damages.
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1482.907,1485.657,"That is true, but under the mail fraud statute we do not."
2000.99-804,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1485.657,1486.045,"Well, I know."
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1489.267,1502.846,"I think that the analogy is an analogy which attempts to compare the State to a private party, and the difference is that the State can always be said in some sense to be acting as a regulator."
2000.99-804,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1502.846,1506.562,Were there money damages in Carpenter to the Wall Street Journal?
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1506.562,1507.305,No.
2000.99-804,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1545.488,1555.314,"Well, does, under Louisiana law, under the statutes of Louisiana, can the State of Louisiana give itself a license and go into the video poker business?"
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1555.314,1557.627,"--Under the Louisiana law, the answer is no."
2000.99-804,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1557.627,1557.71,Okay.
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1568.939,1570.88,Under Louisiana law--
2000.99-804,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1570.88,1571.456,Yes.
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1571.456,1573.602,--I don't believe that the State has that authority.
2000.99-804,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1573.602,1573.868,"No, I don't think so, either."
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1576.081,1577.9,"Well, it would be--"
2000.99-804,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1577.9,1580.927,"I mean, McDonald's can give the right to sell to others."
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1586.278,1586.938,--The State--
2000.99-804,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1586.938,1587.598,"--I mean, that's your analogy."
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1587.598,1591.025,The State could choose to operate in precisely that manner.
2000.99-804,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1591.935,1600.73,"Oh, of course, under the Constitution it could, of the United States, but the question is, what is the scheme that Louisiana has set up under positive law."
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1600.73,1601.473,--But I think--
2000.99-804,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1601.473,1607.25,"And under positive law, I'm just saying in the two respects I mentioned it does not sound like McDonald's."
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1607.25,1614.764,"--Justice Breyer, I agree with you that the State has not assigned to itself the right to sell video poker licenses."
2000.99-804,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1614.764,1615.219,Could not.
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1616.045,1617.448,"No, I don't see any reason--"
2000.99-804,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1617.448,1619.184,"No, it could under the Constitution."
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1621.042,1640.937,"--Under its own statute, but if you're looking at the legal rights that it has invested in itself, it is as if Louisiana has made the State the exclusive holder and determiner of who may participate in the video poker industry with a substantial revenue share being assigned back to the State."
2000.99-804,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1675.384,1682.714,"Mr. Dreeben, how does that differ from giving out liquor licenses, or giving out taxi medallions?"
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1690.638,1706.779,"Justice Ginsburg, it spreads only to those licenses and those State activities that are generically speaking more in a proprietary mold than in a regulatory mold, and there is a classification question that arises."
2000.99-804,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1719.345,1721.352,"Well, tell me, what is the Government's position?"
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1729.154,1758.837,"Our position is that a purely regulatory license, such as a license to practice medicine, or a driver's license, is not encompassed within this theory of property, but a license, or a regulatory proprietary scheme such as a franchise scheme, or a license that is very closely linked in the revenue stream that goes back to the State and in the regulatory component is."
2000.99-804,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1758.837,1775.101,"Well, suppose there is, like with the example of the hotel and the occupancy tax that Mr. Mogin raised, or people who run liquor establishments get a much higher tax than people who are in other businesses."
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1778.361,1793.1,"I think that they do under a strict analytical approach, but I also think that there is a component to the analysis that is narrower than assuming that all such licenses fall within the scope of the mail fraud statute, and--"
2000.99-804,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1793.1,1812.791,"Mr. Dreeben... if you answered the question... it seems to me that you really... the property right that I would think of in terms of normal usage would be the right to exclude as one of the bundle of rights, but you don't claim the right to exclude is sufficient, because you would not include the bar, the control of the membership in the bar, is that right?"
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1812.791,1813.655,--That's correct.
2000.99-804,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1813.655,1815.763,You are not claiming... every right to exclude is not a--
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1815.763,1816.506,That's correct.
2000.99-804,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1816.506,1821.829,--But then I don't... I really don't understand why it makes any difference that the State shares in the revenues.
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1831.117,1843.256,"Well, I think if there was no linkage between the taxation and the licensing scheme, then it's harder to say that the State is acting in a proprietary than in a regulatory--"
2000.99-804,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1843.256,1846.721,"But even if it's acting in a proprietary way, it's not deprived of any revenue."
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1851.179,1879.786,"--It's not itself sufficient, but in combination with a scheme such as this, that creates in the State the power to participate in a particular industry, and to select, in effect, the participants in the industry, the agents who will carry out the work, the State has acted in a way that far more closely resembles a franchise business than it does a pure, sovereign regulator, and that is the question that has to be asked under the mail fraud statute."
2000.99-804,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1879.786,1880.069,I don't--
2000.99-804,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1880.069,1886.013,"--Mr. Dreeben, you seem to be... the Government's position seems to be somewhat of a shifting target."
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1920.936,1921.474,"No, Justice--"
2000.99-804,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1921.474,1922.134,It was new.
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1923.87,1924.446,--Correct.
2000.99-804,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1924.446,1928.011,But do you still adhere to that as well?
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1928.011,1928.838,"Yes, I do."
2000.99-804,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1931.893,1937.416,"Is there any reason why we should address it, since it came so late in the day?"
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1937.416,1939.612,"--Well, the Court has discretion to address it."
2000.99-804,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1959.097,1967.476,"Well, by implication McNally seemed to assume that it was... the statute covers only money or property obtained from the victim."
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1972.184,2001.739,"--Well, there is language in McNally, without doubt, that reads that way, but that language could not have announced a holding in McNally, because the actual holding of McNally was, in addition to the well known part of McNally that an intangible right to good government is not a property right, the Court also held that there was no deception of the State and there were no false statements made to any third party, so there was no factual predicate in McNally itself for deciding whether the second clause applies."
2000.99-804,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2001.739,2020.193,"I suppose one argument in favor of exercising our discretion here is that we took the case to construe the meaning of a statute, there's a conflict in the circuits, and to say, you know, we're construing it this way but there's another argument that we might accede to in some other case wouldn't be the best use of our resources."
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2020.193,2022.089,"I agree, Mr. Chief Justice, particularly--"
2000.99-804,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2022.089,2024.334,But you say that's what we did in McNally.
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2032.575,2033.235,"--Well, there is--"
2000.99-804,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2033.235,2034.228,"I mean, I was here in McNally."
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2035.442,2049.643,"--Well, there is actually no discussion in the opinion itself of the theory that the Government raised that the false statements alone, when the defendant obtains property, are sufficient."
2000.99-804,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2049.643,2054.927,"Oh, you're saying we did in McNally what you are now arguing it would be irresponsible for us to do now."
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2060.804,2075.732,"Well, as I said, Justice Scalia, there... the square holdings of McNally did not require the Court to come to a definitive answer to it, and if you read the McNally opinion, which is fairly brief, it doesn't identify and reject in terms this theory."
2000.99-804,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2089.395,2089.684,If--
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2089.684,2092.534,--false promises come within the mail fraud statute.
2000.99-804,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2092.534,2095.34,--That's contrary to your interpretation of what the amendment did.
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2095.34,2097.197,"No, it's not contrary to it."
2000.99-804,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2109.54,2113.422,"But if it did more than that, we should have said that in McNally."
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2124.318,2132.946,"It would not have produced a different result in McNally, Justice Scalia, because the Court made quite clear in footnote 9 of its opinion that there was no deception of the State at all."
2000.99-804,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2155.98,2163.782,You also would never reach the principal holding of McNally if you're going to put all of the weight on that footnote.
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2163.782,2170.758,"The Court could have decided the case based on that analysis, but it decided it on a broader analysis, which is--"
2000.99-804,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2170.758,2171.129,Right.
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2173.98,2174.201,--Footnote 9.
2000.99-804,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2174.201,2188.673,"--9, I don't think footnote 9 was meant to preclude the question that's before us here, any more than it was meant to preclude the question of whether intangible services can qualify under the statute."
2000.99-804,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2192.306,2200.851,What I think is evident from McNally is that the Court at various points in the opinion wrote broadly about the mail fraud statute.
2000.99-804,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2223.021,2228.222,"If we did have that, if that theory's in front of us, it seemed a little broad."
2000.99-804,2,38136,paul_mogin,,2932.475,2936.849,"Mr. Chief Justice, we will waive rebuttal unless there are questions."
2000.99-804,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2936.849,2952.165,"How do you distinguish the Carpenter case, because the Carpenter case held that the confidential information of the Wall Street Journal was traditionally protected as property because it would be subject to protection in equity, et cetera."
2000.99-804,2,38136,paul_mogin,,2952.165,2962.112,The key distinction is that there this Court was able to find prior law that recognized confidential business information as property.
2000.99-804,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2989.81,2991.629,"May I ask this, Mr. Mogin."
2000.99-804,2,38136,paul_mogin,,3016.931,3023.513,"Well, this Court has pointed out that there's no precise or universal definition of property."
2000.99-804,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3026.552,3033.649,"But isn't it true that the right to exclude is referred to in many, many property cases as a strand of property right?"
2000.99-804,2,38136,paul_mogin,,3033.649,3051.732,"--Yes, but I don't think that from that one could conclude that every right to exclude is a property right, because here you have the breadth of it, that the licensing and approvals and permits and certifications and registrations that the Government issues is truly extraordinary."
2000.99-804,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3075.138,3103.995,"Well, because in this case or in any regulatory case, as distinct from the case of private ownership or private property, there are two capacities, I suppose, on the part of the supposed property owner, and one is a regulatory capacity and one is arguably a proprietary one, and I suppose... I mean, wouldn't it be your argument that the right to exclude would have to be classified on the regulatory side rather than the property side?"
2000.99-804,2,38136,paul_mogin,,3116.46,3124.14,"I think that's exactly right, and that's why the Government prohibits all types of things, excludes people from all types of activities."
2000.99-804,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3146.348,3148.122,"Thank you, Mr. Mogin."
