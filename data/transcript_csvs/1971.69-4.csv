1971.69-4,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,25.064,We will hear arguments first today in number 69-4 was Zicarelli against the New Jersey State Commission of Investigation.
1971.69-4,0,36507,michael_a_querques,,27.414,30.39,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,1342.715,1346.307,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may I please the Court."
1971.69-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.837,1627.592,Tell me why does not New Jersey grand absolute immunity?
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,1634.037,1635.032,The use plus proof --
1971.69-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1635.032,1650.104,Do you say it is an extravagant -- on the one hand that it is an extravagant application of the Fifth Amendment that on the other hand you seem to say that use immunity is even more extravagant?
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,1650.104,1661.613,I believe Mr. Justice White that use immunity alone which would allow the Government or the people thereafter to go out and secure evidence based upon the testimony compelled must be unconstitutional.
1971.69-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1662.511,1661.613,I agree.
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,1662.596,1676.399,"I further argue that a transactional or an absolute immunity is too broad, is that it gives to greater gratuity to the individual who seeks to utilize that privilege and then forces the people to secure the absolute --"
1971.69-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1676.399,1695.337,"You are suggesting that New Jersey limits its statute to use immunity because it could conceive of situations where it would like to be able to prosecute, the gentlemen may have had before the Grand Jury for the very crime that which he is testified."
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,1695.337,1697.638,I do not suggest here that they would like to prosecute.
1971.69-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1698.183,1700.93,Or isn't that the only thing you are protecting.
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,1713.402,1719.255,"In the first instance, I would say that you were seeking to protect the individual in his constitutional rights."
1971.69-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1730.503,1748.619,"With a absolute immunity statute, you can get your evidence of the crimes that you want to prosecute for, but you want to retain the right to prosecute this man for the very crime about which you would ask him questions?"
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,1748.619,1755.336,If such evidence of an independent nature should be developed either in a different jurisdiction or at a later date.
1971.69-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1755.336,1763.243,You think that that possibility is significant enough to warrant to come and clear to this Court arguing for its retention?
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,1763.243,1764.633,Absolutely Sir.
1971.69-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1764.633,1768.775,"So, it is a real possibility that he maybe prosecuted --"
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,1768.775,1769.903,I would have to say --
1971.69-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1769.903,1773.199,For the very crime about what he has been interrogated.
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,1773.199,1776.91,I would have to say that there is certainly is a real possibility of that occurrence.
1971.69-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1776.91,1783.052,It is substantial enough anyway for New Jersey to have made this choice and the Defendant in this Court.
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,1783.052,1790.779,"Well, if I may could just draw this distinction Justice White, hours of the State Commission of Investigation, we are purely an investigative body."
1971.69-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1809.534,1822.035,"Well, in some situations -- if I understand you correctly, New Jersey would be better off with an absolute immunity statute than with the use immunity statute."
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,1837.507,1861.802,"I suggested that perhaps the individual might be in a better position because with the use plus proofs, the burden of establishing, the relationship would be on the Government and on the people that return the indictment whereas now it is my understanding of the law that with the transactional grant of immunity should he later be indicted that he must prove that as an affirmative defense in the defense of this case."
1971.69-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1870.416,1889.696,"Well, I am just glad -- the real purpose of my question is really to inquire about what New Jersey's estimate is that the actual importance of this issue in terms of -- how often will it come up."
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,1899.064,1901.912,I think it makes a very substantial difference Your Honor.
1971.69-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1901.912,1916.564,"So, so, you are saying that there is substantial enough chance to what it prosecutes say --Mr. Zicarelli for the questions, for the crime about which you have been asking him questions?"
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,1916.564,1919.149,"No, I am not suggesting that at all Sir."
1971.69-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1935.156,1939.942,"Well, I know that you could have done that with the transactional immunity?"
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,1939.942,1944.134,"But at the same time, we would then have been granting a collective immunity to Mr. Zicarelli."
1971.69-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1944.134,1950.873,"Right, so again I say you want to retain the possibility of being able to prosecute Mr. Zicarelli on independent evidence?"
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,1950.873,1951.485,Correct Sir.
1971.69-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1951.485,1952.342,Okay.
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,1952.342,1958.196,With the burden of proof being placed upon the Government should any indictment ever be forth coming.
1971.69-4,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1958.595,1967.477,How much weight do you put on this extraordinary situation in 1968 just to find the statute?
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,1967.477,1969.944,"The extraordinary situation, well."
1971.69-4,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1969.944,1970.603,"Well, let me ask--"
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,1970.603,1970.937,Yes.
1971.69-4,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1970.937,1973.57,"Is still in effect, the statute?"
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,1973.57,1975.997,The statute is still in effect that—
1971.69-4,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1975.997,1976.552,I kind of got there.
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,1980.399,1991.055,"In the Spring of 1968, there was convened in New Jersey, a special legislative committee which found that at time a serious organized crime problem did exist within the State."
1971.69-4,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1991.055,1993.772,"Well, do you still have the Commission?"
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,1993.772,1995.26,The Commission is still in effect.
1971.69-4,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1995.26,1997.018,And the statute is being in effect?
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,1997.018,1998.604,"Yes Sir, it is."
1971.69-4,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1998.604,2003.16,"Well, my whole point is what is the great value of what happened in '68?"
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,2007.148,2011.981,"Well, we hope that to some extent the problem has diminished."
1971.69-4,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2013.313,2021.061,"When the problem disappeared, would the statute be repealed?"
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,2021.061,2026.252,"I would frankly hope not, because if the use plus proof immunity statute --"
1971.69-4,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2026.252,2031.583,"You are not right when you say it is a good statute, now it is good as long as you care to use."
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,2031.583,2033.061,That is my position Sir.
1971.69-4,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2033.061,2034.036,"Okay, well then."
1971.69-4,1,16757,andrew_f_phelan,,2034.036,2035.81,Yes Sir.
1971.69-4,2,25578,george_f_kugler_jr,,2321.951,2325.636,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1971.69-4,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2904.054,2907.397,Thank you Mr. Kugler.
1971.69-4,3,36507,michael_a_querques,,2909.476,2915.916,"Chief Justice, I would like to respond just for a few moment as if I have not left to of what you think that Mr. Phelan said."
1971.69-4,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2993.497,3008.054,"If that came to pass Mr. Querques, the prosecution whether Federal or State making use of it would have burden of proving an independent source, is that correct?"
1971.69-4,3,36507,michael_a_querques,,3008.054,3011.334,"That would be correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1971.69-4,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3011.334,3025.702,"If they had an independent source that was prior to the inquiry, under which testimony was compelled, why should they not be able to use the testimony for that independent source?"
1971.69-4,3,36507,michael_a_querques,,3025.702,3028.881,"That is a very rare situation, and I would think --"
1971.69-4,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3028.881,3030.366,Let us assume on.
1971.69-4,3,36507,michael_a_querques,,3030.366,3040.307,"I would think that they would be full hardened, indeed assuming that they had an independent case, then to call to in the witness whom they want to prosecute."
1971.69-4,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3040.307,3042.817,I am speaking of another jurisdiction.
1971.69-4,3,36507,michael_a_querques,,3089.095,3090.245,He should be permitted to use it.
1971.69-4,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3109.362,3117.457,"But, we are not -- this Court is in a position to make a choice between two different kinds of immunity."
1971.69-4,3,36507,michael_a_querques,,3128.939,3147.371,"Yes, I quite understand that and for the reason that indicated that I think, with respect to the questioning jurisdiction, the constitutional standard is only met when the questioning jurisdiction gives prosecutional immunity or absolute --"
1971.69-4,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3147.371,3159.371,(Inaudible) differently say than a prosecutor in some other county of New Jersey?
1971.69-4,3,36507,michael_a_querques,,3159.371,3161.19,"Mr. Justice White, I --"
1971.69-4,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3161.19,3164.472,"Just because it happens to be part of the same phase, is that it?"
1971.69-4,3,36507,michael_a_querques,,3164.472,3170.281,"Well, because Mr. Hogan is not bringing in that witness."
1971.69-4,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3171.611,3175.349,Only there is a Prosecutor in the other county?
1971.69-4,3,36507,michael_a_querques,,3175.349,3181.193,"If I understood your question, it assume that—for example, a New Jersey Prosecutor would bring in a witness, and question—"
1971.69-4,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3181.193,3202.136,"What you are saying -- you are saying that if the District Attorney in San Francisco, all of the witness before a Grand Jury, and that answers the question, that if he gives him immunity, that immunity must be absolute --"
1971.69-4,3,36507,michael_a_querques,,3202.136,3202.393,Yes.
1971.69-4,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3202.393,3211.134,"Transactional immunity, and that a Prosecutor in Los Angeles is in great secrecy, also developing a case."
1971.69-4,3,36507,michael_a_querques,,3232.28,3234.542,"Yes, because he is not from the questioning jurisdiction."
1971.69-4,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3234.542,3235.876,"Well, so your answer is yes --"
1971.69-4,3,36507,michael_a_querques,,3235.876,3238.358,He has an upset -- upset the balance.
1971.69-4,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3238.358,3242.785,You wish a treat the Prosecutor in Los Angeles differently than the Prosecutor in Washington?
1971.69-4,3,36507,michael_a_querques,,3242.785,3248.182,"No, I do not think -- excuse me Sir, I do not you are treating them differently."
1971.69-4,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3290.951,3299.674,"Neither did the Prosecutor in Los Angeles calling in, unlike him?"
1971.69-4,3,36507,michael_a_querques,,3299.674,3302.346,I make it just as clear as I can.
1971.69-4,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3313.817,3314.258,Well then—
1971.69-4,3,36507,michael_a_querques,,3314.258,3315.832,"And, call then the individual."
1971.69-4,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3315.832,3320.9,"Alright, let us say the Prosecutor in San Francisco would be bounded, what about the Prosecutor in Los Angeles?"
1971.69-4,3,36507,michael_a_querques,,3320.9,3323.614,Not bound.
1971.69-4,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3327.683,3331.176,"Both are in the same State, he was bound --"
1971.69-4,3,36507,michael_a_querques,,3331.176,3334.157,"Yes, I would say he is bound, because they are working under one sovereign."
1971.69-4,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3334.157,3336.419,"So, the different prosecution?"
1971.69-4,3,36507,michael_a_querques,,3336.419,3340.939,"But, he is working in the State that he is working within the same framework."
1971.69-4,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3340.939,3348.912,"But within State where a District Attorney was elected in each District, the sovereign of that District Attorney is not the State."
1971.69-4,3,36507,michael_a_querques,,3356.418,3357.405,Well.
1971.69-4,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3357.405,3359.672,In that District --
1971.69-4,3,36507,michael_a_querques,,3359.672,3360.69,That is one way to look at it.
1971.69-4,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3363.71,3383.979,"You were emphasizing earlier Mr. Querques that something you called a Trilemma, you seem to suggest that the law has some kind of duty to spare a man from the temptation or as you put it the pressure to commit perjury in order to save himself?"
1971.69-4,3,36507,michael_a_querques,,3383.979,3389.167,"I do not it should spare him, I say it should not induce him to do it."
1971.69-4,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3389.167,3396.043,"Now, what about the man who takes the stand in a criminal case in his own defense to testify?"
1971.69-4,3,36507,michael_a_querques,,3402.699,3404.347,"Yes, your honor."
1971.69-4,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3404.347,3417.957,"Does not the broad power of cross examination, put that witness to defendant under a great temptation or pressure, do you want to use that term?"
1971.69-4,3,36507,michael_a_querques,,3422.066,3427.012,"I would say yes, it does to you but, it does it in a different framework."
1971.69-4,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3452.301,3454.606,I am just focusing just on the pressure here.
1971.69-4,3,36507,michael_a_querques,,3472.672,3481.494,"I would conceive to you that once the Defendant in a trial elects to take the stand, he yes, is under pressure."
1971.69-4,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3514.943,3518.149,"Very well, Mr. Querques, thank you and thank you gentlemen."
