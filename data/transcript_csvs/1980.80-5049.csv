1980.80-5049,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.762,We'll hear arguments first this morning in Clayton v. International Union and the consolidated case.
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,13.745,15.854,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-5049,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,288.401,292.18,"Well, has the Court really held that these are 301 actions?"
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,309.08,329.681,"But Vaca v. Sipes, Mr. Justice Stewart, went far beyond the Steele and Humphrey v. Moore, and held that where that breach exists, that is the condition precedent to the employee's right of action under 301 in the court for breach of the collective agreement."
1980.80-5049,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,329.681,346.691,"Well, first of all, he has to show and prove that he was not properly represented through whatever the grievance and arbitration procedure may have been by his representative, the union organization."
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,346.691,347.051,Right.
1980.80-5049,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,347.051,351.644,"And only then, after he's proved that, may he sue the employer."
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,352.191,352.472,Right.
1980.80-5049,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,353.236,358.11,And any suit against the employer would be a plain vanilla 301 action.
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,358.11,373.65,"--Well, but the language in Vaca v. Sipes... there are two sections, and one I recall precisely is that the Court said in that opinion that the claim of the breach of the duty of fair representation is part and parcel of the Section 301 action."
1980.80-5049,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,393.815,401.733,"Well, except that the Tunstall and Steele cases were decided in the total absence of anything like 301."
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,401.733,402.811,--Quite so; quite so.
1980.80-5049,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,402.811,406.076,"And they were actions only against the union, were they not?"
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,406.076,407.559,That's right.
1980.80-5049,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,408.746,410.98,I don't think you're right there.
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,430.456,436.374,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I am unable to recall whether the employers were involved in those actions or not."
1980.80-5049,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,518.748,534.476,"Well, do you concede, Mr. McTernan, that the liability of the employer under an action such as this is necessarily conditioned on the liability of the union also?"
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,534.476,554.046,"Well, it's conditioned upon proof that the Union breached its duties, and this Court has held that the employees may sue the employer alone and prove in that action the union's breach of duty, and therefore establish his right to go ahead on the merits of his breach of the collective agreement claim."
1980.80-5049,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,592.282,607.524,"Part of that, I suppose, is that if he sues the employer alone and that case went to judgment, the judgment against the employer should not include any damages that were caused by the union."
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,607.524,608.602,"I would think so, yes."
1980.80-5049,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,619.535,627.205,"Well, not if the union was responsible for the discharge."
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,627.205,630.781,"Oh, well, now, you've raised a different point."
1980.80-5049,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,630.781,641.824,It's not a different point if the union had maliciously caused the discharge.
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,649.054,664.892,"Mr. Justice White, this Court has been very careful to distinguish those cases in which the conduct of the employer and the conduct of the union were independent and discrete, and where each would be then liable for his proportionate share of the damage caused."
1980.80-5049,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,677.293,684.822,And what if the union tells a lie to the employer about an employee and the employer discharges him?
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,684.822,695.707,"This Court has affirmed in a number of cases NLRB orders where it is quite clear that the employer acted under pressure from the union, but yet the employer is responsible for its conduct."
1980.80-5049,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,702.971,707.875,"Well, in those cases the employer knows that it's acting under pressure from the union."
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,713.092,719.12,"--Then I think the apportionment rule would apply, but I don't think the employer would be relieved if his duty to reinstate the man."
1980.80-5049,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,719.12,722.056,"No, no, but the he certainly wouldn't be paying back pay."
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,722.056,727.179,"I think that if all of the back pay losses stemmed from the union's conduct, then I would say--"
1980.80-5049,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,727.179,728.929,"All right, all right."
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,728.929,729.163,--Yes?
1980.80-5049,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,729.163,732.74,"Mr. McTernan, may I ask you a kind of a preliminary question?"
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,748.404,761.322,"Well, sir, I don't think that it's consistent with Lincoln Mills for the judiciary to delegate to union tribunals the interpretation and application of federal law under Section 301; number one."
1980.80-5049,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,783.173,794.043,"Well, supposing the collective bargaining agreement has a provision in it that if that review board found there was inadequate representation there's a duty to reopen the arbitration proceeding, and so on."
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,810.615,818.206,I think that there is no unqualified duty to exhaust.
1980.80-5049,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,894.612,904.858,"But you do concede, do you not, under this agreement that the employee couldn't go indirectly into court?"
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,911.948,913.665,I don't concede that in this case.
1980.80-5049,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,913.665,917.649,"Oh, yes; we're talking about the grievance procedure."
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,917.649,922.068,The collective bargaining agreements procedure?
1980.80-5049,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,923.443,926.02,Yes; the first stage.
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,926.02,935.533,"Well, the grievance procedure under the collective bargaining contract provides for a three-step--"
1980.80-5049,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,935.533,938.907,But did the employee ask the union to take it to arbitration?
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,938.907,943.922,"--Oh, yes, and as a matter of fact arbitration was requested and then withdrawn by the union."
1980.80-5049,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,943.922,945.873,"Yes, but he had to do that, didn't he?"
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,945.873,947.591,"Oh, no question about that."
1980.80-5049,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,949.935,950.543,Right.
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,950.543,953.09,"That's very clear in all of the cases, yes."
1980.80-5049,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,963.506,1005.677,"Well, Mr. McTernan, in prior cases, I recall, when it was suggested that if the union breached its duty, and therefore the employee shouldn't be bound by defective grievance and arbitration procedures, I recall the arguments on behalf of the employee were that he shouldn't be sent back to arbitration either, because he would be there being represented, or at least accompanied by, or at least with a party in the picture that had shown it incapable of representing him."
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,1005.677,1012.097,"--Yes, there is that problem, and that problem exists, it seems to me, in any reactivation case."
1980.80-5049,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1018.265,1018.687,No.
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,1018.687,1042.489,"But let me say that in your opinion in Vaca v. Sipes, you considered the question of whether the Court should decide the collective bargaining contract issue or whether it should be remanded for arbitration, and the Court held there, in your language, that this was a remedy for the trial court to consider in light of the circumstances of the particular case."
1980.80-5049,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1054.126,1055.016,Very well.
1980.80-5049,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1055.016,1065.543,"Mr. McTernan, before you sit down, there's been called to my attention a recent 2nd Circuit case decided about two weeks ago, Johnson v. General Motors."
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,1067.777,1068.901,"No, I'm not, Your Honor, I'm sorry."
1980.80-5049,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1069.651,1073.681,It might be worth looking into.
1980.80-5049,0,31669,john_t_mcternan,,1078.679,1079.491,--Thank you.
1980.80-5049,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1079.491,1085.786,Mr. Meiners.
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1085.786,1090.767,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.80-5049,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1161.944,1166.239,"I might have missed it, but the Union didn't give any reason for withdrawing, it just withdrew; isn't that right?"
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1166.239,1181.857,"Well, Your Honor, they did, the union steward did write a letter to the National Labor Relations Board advising them that they had investigated the case."
1980.80-5049,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1202.631,1225.45,"Mr. Meiners, as I've tried to think through this argument that the employer is in an impossible position because he doesn't know the facts, but isn't it correct that the employee has the burden, rather severe burden, of showing arbitrary conduct by the union and what it really amounts to is, you have two defenses?"
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1238.648,1242.615,"Well, having there withdrawn the request for arbitration, that's correct."
1980.80-5049,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1273.914,1275.352,"Yes, but it's still a tough prima facie case."
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1275.352,1276.274,"--Yes, I certainly admit that."
1980.80-5049,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1276.727,1279.147,It's the same legal standard as if the union was a party.
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1279.147,1279.882,--That's correct.
1980.80-5049,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1297.578,1308.059,"The argument is made in one of the amicus briefs, I don't remember which, that suppose you have a situation in which for some reason the employee elects just to sue the union and doesn't sue the employer."
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1316.68,1319.788,I'm not sure that the underlying contract issue should be reached in that lawsuit where--
1980.80-5049,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1319.788,1322.678,"--Well, as a matter of proving no damages it's certainly relevant."
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1322.678,1332.188,"--Well, it's certainly relevant to the issue of proving no damages, but if the employee only proves that there's been a breach of the duty of fair representation, certainly under Vaca there would be this allocation problem."
1980.80-5049,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1347.838,1348.697,"Well, they don't have to."
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1351.587,1352.961,That's correct.
1980.80-5049,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1428.978,1444.237,"Is the employer put in this position you describe every time the union declines to support the employee's claim, or even assuming for perfectly valid reasons, as you do here?"
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1444.237,1447.142,"I am sorry, I don't understand, I don't follow the full question."
1980.80-5049,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1447.142,1455.903,Does this problem for the employer arise every time a union declines to carry the ball for the employee?
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1455.903,1463.979,"Well, it arises only when there is a claim by the employee that there has been a breach of the duty of fair representation."
1980.80-5049,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1463.979,1465.259,"Well, I'm assuming that."
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1465.259,1484.799,"And in that situation if the union wants to support... the union usually would take a position, in our view, fairly... if the union is acting fairly and honestly, they would take a position that they're trying to defend and show why the action that they took was taken in good faith."
1980.80-5049,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1495.685,1501.979,"Except, Mr. Meiners, the real reason, as I understand the briefs, is the reason they abandoned the claim was they thought there was no merit in it."
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1501.979,1502.713,That's correct.
1980.80-5049,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1502.713,1507.57,"And you're able to prove that, if the facts are as they're described in some of the briefs, it's a fairly simple case."
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1507.57,1509.257,"Well, that may be true, yes."
1980.80-5049,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1565.438,1570.28,"You don't really have an exposure for back pay during the period that you could rely on the arbitration award, do you?"
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1576.121,1577.136,--That's correct.
1980.80-5049,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1582.961,1591.006,"It would seem to me, just again thinking out loud, that most of the time, I would assume, when the union abandons a claim, it's probably because it doesn't think it has any merit."
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1606.702,1621.056,"If you look at the practical viewpoint of presenting the defense to the breach of the duty, I think that's the... we're skipping over the defense which has to be presented or should be presented."
1980.80-5049,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1638.315,1651.168,"Well, I thought that the employee has got the burden of proving a breach of duty, and you don't prove a breach of duty just by saying that the union failed to take it to arbitration."
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1651.168,1651.731,That's correct.
1980.80-5049,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1651.731,1661.165,"So, it's a rather... if reasonable men could have differed about the validity of the claim, the union is going to win."
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1670.364,1687.919,"Well, I think that for a lot of the reasons that we have indicated that this presents... puts the union and the company in a very difficult position to attempt to present a case on behalf of a party which it had no knowledge of."
1980.80-5049,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1712.66,1720.25,"But here in the discovery, presumably, is you take a deposition of the steward and he says, I investigated the claim and I thought the company was right; that's why I abandoned it."
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1720.25,1729.856,"Except, the union may well not be in a position that they feel that it is either politically or appropriate for them to take an active role in this."
1980.80-5049,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1736.806,1751.987,"The real issue in these breach of duty cases, as I understand it, at least in an awful lot of them, is whether or not there was real substance in the claim that the employer breached the contract."
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1751.987,1754.392,"Well, but then, in our view--"
1980.80-5049,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1754.392,1756.298,Your employer is the one that knows that.
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1770.651,1771.761,--No.
1980.80-5049,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1776.4,1789.301,"But there's also... if one were to adopt the principle that the employee can go directly into court, you're going to inevitably be involved in a lot of line-drawing problems."
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1802.779,1803.81,"--Yes, there could."
1980.80-5049,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1857.117,1871.439,How can you get the employer back to the arbitration table when the contract time has... when all he promised to do he's done?
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1871.439,1873.547,--Has expired during the process of?
1980.80-5049,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.547,1874.938,How can you get him back?
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1874.938,1911.892,"Because I believe that the Nolde Brothers decision raises a substantial question as to whether or not because of the national labor policy that is deemed to be incorporated in the collective bargaining agreement when it is written, that... and in that case the decision indicated that unless the agreement expressly or directly negated the possibility of the grievance in that instance... of course the contract had expired... I think that the same situation can be said to apply here."
1980.80-5049,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1943.926,1948.488,Would you say the same thing in a joint board situation where there was no arbitrator?
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1948.488,1952.283,--Would I say the same thing in a joint board situation?
1980.80-5049,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1961.763,1965.135,"They're in rather widespread use though, aren't they?"
1980.80-5049,1,22811,everett_f_meiners,,1965.135,1966.635,--In some areas.
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2362.913,2367.085,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-5049,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2456.142,2459.297,"How could you do that in this case, in the light of this letter?"
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2462.827,2469.183,"--Mr. Justice Marshall, the answer is that that letter was written by an international representative--"
1980.80-5049,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2469.183,2471.136,On behalf of you.
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2471.136,2477.57,--who is one of our line troops and is subject as the agent of a corporation is subject to the board of directors.
1980.80-5049,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2484.036,2486.785,But that's not what this said.
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2488.472,2489.409,That's right.
1980.80-5049,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2489.409,2490.644,That's what he says.
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2496.25,2498.515,"That takes us to the third set of cases, Your Honor."
1980.80-5049,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2571.298,2576.187,"Mr. Whitman, will you help me out on one rather simple point, I guess?"
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2579.795,2587.385,"The source of the duty, Your Honor, is the discretion of the federal judiciary in Article III."
1980.80-5049,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2628.291,2649.313,"Well, is the conclusion that the federal judge should reach... now, it's a kind of the federal judge is both the lawmaker and the decider under your view... that if there's no attempt whatsoever to get the union to review the decision, that ipso facto establishes an inability to prove a breach of the duty of fair representation."
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2658.622,2670.508,"I would agree that if the man is told to go file his appeal and he does, and it comes to an end, then he ought to be able to resume his litigation."
1980.80-5049,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2670.508,2673.304,"No, but suppose he won't do it?"
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2673.304,2676.115,"Well, then, that's a strike on him."
1980.80-5049,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2676.115,2678.926,And then what happens as to the suit against the employer?
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2681.723,2687.408,"Well, what happens to the suit against the employer?"
1980.80-5049,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2695.373,2697.202,How?
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2704.246,2715.679,"No, the question is whether he is not able to prevail against the union because he didn't attempt the internal procedures and didn't give that opportunity to the union."
1980.80-5049,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2715.679,2725.704,"You think this holding, this exhaustion, just protects the union, and that he could still be free to prove your breach of duty in his suit against the employer?"
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2725.704,2728.61,"I don't see any logical impediment to that possibility, Your Honor."
1980.80-5049,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2728.61,2732.015,How about the Steelworkers' trilogy?
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2738.668,2754.07,The better result would be for the trial bench not to rush into putting the employer in the sort of dilemma of nonfinality which was presented in the Hines v. Anchor Motor Freight.
1980.80-5049,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2781.339,2789.571,Does the employee have the same choice as the employer to choose litigation over arbitration?
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2789.571,2802.908,"Your Honor, all that's required to decide this case is to decide that federal district courts have the discretion as a routine matter to require the attempt."
1980.80-5049,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2809.874,2812.358,"Well, what would an attempt have involved, Mr. Whitman, in this case?"
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2812.358,2815.121,--A letter to Douglas/Fraser.
1980.80-5049,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2815.121,2815.95,That's all?
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2815.95,2816.511,That's all.
1980.80-5049,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2816.511,2817.949,The President of the UAW?
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2817.949,2818.824,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-5049,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2818.824,2821.839,"And does he then act on it, or is there some--"
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2821.839,2833.552,"He processes it... well, it is typically presented to the International Executive Board which sits in panels of three, and they go out to, the location and they have a hearing and they make the report--"
1980.80-5049,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2833.552,2837.239,"--Nothing of this nature goes to the general convention, annual convention, or anything?"
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2837.239,2846.593,"--The step above that, by analogy to the appeal to the stockholders in a corporate case, is to one of two places, at the option of the appellant."
1980.80-5049,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2873.146,2877.285,"What I'm trying to get at, initially, the first step would have to be a letter to Mr. Fraser?"
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2877.285,2877.8,Yes.
1980.80-5049,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2877.8,2883.562,"And then some proceeding occurs, and his claim is rejected at that level?"
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2883.562,2884.483,Yes.
1980.80-5049,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2884.483,2890.56,"Then he has to go to one or the other of two other levels, does he, or whatever it may be?"
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2890.56,2890.904,"No, it's the final level."
1980.80-5049,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2891.45,2900.353,"But the second one is what, about six months or more, you suggested, to get to the appeals... convention?"
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2900.353,2902.103,It depends on the case.
1980.80-5049,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2943.149,2946.288,Does the union permit counsel in this sort of thing?
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2946.288,2947.21,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-5049,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2970.325,2980.134,"Well, I gather you do suggest that the employee says, no, I don't want to take that year and a half to do all this, I want to go ahead with my lawsuit."
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2993.926,2995.816,"--An employer could be... yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-5049,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2995.816,3005.547,"No, I say, you do suggest that the employee who refuses to go through that recourse in part nevertheless may still prove, in the suit against the employer--"
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3005.547,3005.969,Yes.
1980.80-5049,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3005.969,3007.281,--The breach of the duty of representation?
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3007.281,3008.139,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-5049,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3010.747,3016.558,"So, to that extent, failure to exhaust does not deny him a right to go ahead with his lawsuit, at least against the employer?"
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3016.558,3017.588,"That's right, Your Honor."
1980.80-5049,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3017.588,3021.76,Then he doesn't have to name the union as a party?
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3021.76,3026.553,"This Court held in Vaca, as I read it, that he doesn't."
1980.80-5049,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3042.83,3059.778,"Dr. Whitman, then, these upper levels of the union appellate process, if I may call it that, that you've described, is the employee very often successful after defeats in the lower levels?"
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3059.778,3065.478,"Well, Your Honor, yes, he often is."
1980.80-5049,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3119.58,3123.579,But there are thousands of grievances.
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3123.579,3127.609,"Your Honor, there are very many thousands of grievances."
1980.80-5049,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3134.512,3143.291,"In this particular company, it shows on this one, doesn't it, that there are 4,000 already... what is it?"
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3156.909,3159.237,"I don't know, but it's conceivable, Your Honor."
1980.80-5049,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3159.237,3160.158,It is?
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3160.158,3170.263,"There is a lot of controversy, and there are a lot of meritorious and, I must say, frivolous grievances in the industrial system."
1980.80-5049,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3244.764,3250.184,"Mr. Whitman, to the extent that's a valid argument, and it's quite persuasive, it should be available to the employer as well."
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3250.184,3273.676,"--Yes, and for that reason, I think, in the appropriate case the district court would be well advised to say to the employer, wouldn't it be nice if at least on an ad hoc basis you are willing to accept this back into the grievance and arbitration case, should the union reverse itself, or hold its hand to see what happens."
1980.80-5049,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3303.242,3317.55,"It also goes back behind the J. I. Case case, in effect, doesn't it, where the Court said that under collective bargaining you can't have an individual employee contracting separately with the company?"
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3317.55,3318.298,--True.
1980.80-5049,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3390.567,3406.856,"Doesn't it pervade all of the labor law of the last 40 years, more or less, that there should be exhaustion of all these intermediate efforts before getting into the judicial process?"
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3408.841,3413.401,"Yes, Your Honor, and it's the concept for very practical reasons."
1980.80-5049,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3453.869,3465.692,"Well, Mr. Whitman, I don't understand your suggestion in that if the employee refuses to exhaust, that means he can't proceed against the union, but nevertheless he may proceed against the employer."
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3467.083,3468.192,--If he refuses to--
1980.80-5049,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3468.192,3473.783,"If he... well, I gather your position is if the... he made no attempt, is what you said."
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3473.783,3474.455,"--That's right, Your Honor."
1980.80-5049,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3474.455,3479.14,"And having made no attempt, he has no further course of action against the unions."
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3507.004,3508.566,And the problem may go away.
1980.80-5049,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3508.566,3512.907,"Well, it won't go away if you say that he can proceed against the employer, meanwhile."
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3534.368,3544.068,"The prudent course would be to hold the procedures against the employer and in that effort to see what happened, because it's really premature--"
1980.80-5049,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3544.068,3552.752,"All right, let's assume you do, and the union turns him down, and decides that we didn't breach a duty at all and we're not going to go back to arbitration."
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3553.424,3557.124,--Then both the union and the employer will proceed with the suit.
1980.80-5049,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3557.124,3559.499,--I beg your pardon?
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3559.499,3566.325,"If the man goes to the union and the union says, you're wrong, and you won't believe you're wrong--"
1980.80-5049,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3566.325,3568.575,Then the suit goes forward against both?
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3568.575,3576.822,"--As I say, I can't warranty against frivolous litigation or litigation where the union isn't willing to cure a fault in--"
1980.80-5049,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3576.822,3587.738,"Then, I really don't understand, Mr. Whitman, why you can take the position, if he refuses to proceed to exhaust, that lets the union off but not also the employer?"
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3587.738,3608.667,"--Well, Your Honor, I suppose the answer is that it will depend on the factual setting and the employer's attitude and what the union will and won't do, and that is best left to the trial bench in their discretion, because situations vary."
1980.80-5049,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3608.667,3613.963,"Of course, here, the trial judge thought they should both do likewise, is the way it looks."
1980.80-5049,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3613.963,3615.025,"Yes, Your Honor, they did."
1980.80-5049,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3617.149,3620.429,Mr. McTernan.
1980.80-5049,3,31669,john_t_mcternan,,3620.429,3622.414,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.80-5049,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3723.06,3731.322,"Mr. McTernan, suppose we agree with you about exhaustion, is one of your questions here also that the union should not have been dismissed from the suit?"
1980.80-5049,3,31669,john_t_mcternan,,3731.322,3733.914,"Yes, sir, that's our point; that is our position."
1980.80-5049,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3733.914,3735.164,And why is that?
1980.80-5049,3,31669,john_t_mcternan,,3735.164,3740.662,Our position is that the union procedures were inadequate as a matter of law--
1980.80-5049,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3740.662,3742.193,"And so you're just entitled to sue them, that's all."
1980.80-5049,3,31669,john_t_mcternan,,3742.193,3743.099,--Correct.
1980.80-5049,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3751.97,3766.12,"And if you're going to have to prove a breach of representation, you want the union there as a party so you have the advantages of working against the defendant, all the remedies against the defendant?"
1980.80-5049,3,31669,john_t_mcternan,,3766.12,3766.745,Exactly.
1980.80-5049,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3766.745,3768.244,Discovery and other things?
1980.80-5049,3,31669,john_t_mcternan,,3768.244,3768.791,Exactly.
1980.80-5049,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3778.6,3784.488,But I suppose there is some great advantage to having them as an opponent in the lawsuit rather than as a third-party witness?
1980.80-5049,3,31669,john_t_mcternan,,3784.488,3788.846,"Indeed it is, because then we have the right to discovery under the civil rules."
1980.80-5049,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3806.588,3808.556,"How much time does all this take, Mr. McTernan?"
1980.80-5049,3,31669,john_t_mcternan,,3808.556,3812.929,"Well, 45 days... the local union must decide in 45 days."
1980.80-5049,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3853.273,3856.006,"This case has been over four years, hasn't it?"
1980.80-5049,3,31669,john_t_mcternan,,3856.006,3857.286,"This case has been over five years, sir."
1980.80-5049,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3887.868,3892.1,"Had he gone back for arbitration, how do we know but it might have been settled a long time ago?"
1980.80-5049,3,31669,john_t_mcternan,,3892.1,3895.864,"Well, he had hoped, sir... sir, he had no way of going back to arbitration."
1980.80-5049,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3899.801,3906.891,"It was conceded, unless you disagree with it... that makes it quite different... that he could get outside counsel and go to arbitration."
1980.80-5049,3,31669,john_t_mcternan,,3906.891,3913.904,"--Oh, I think what that was addressed to was this, if there were arbitration after this litigation, he might be able to get--"
1980.80-5049,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3913.904,3914.592,Not after?
1980.80-5049,3,31669,john_t_mcternan,,3922.151,3928.382,"--Mr. Chief Justice, at that point he could have had no arbitration either with the union representing him or with private counsel representing him."
1980.80-5049,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3933.053,3937.254,Because of the provisions of the collective bargaining contract.
1980.80-5049,3,31669,john_t_mcternan,,3937.254,3937.707,Exactly.
1980.80-5049,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3937.707,3939.299,The procedure was exhausted.
1980.80-5049,3,31669,john_t_mcternan,,3939.299,3939.674,Exactly.
1980.80-5049,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3942.189,3942.58,Very well.
