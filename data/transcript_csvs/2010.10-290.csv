2010.10-290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,0.0,10.189,"We'll hear argument now in Case No. 10-290, Microsoft Corporation v. i4i Limited Partnership."
2010.10-290,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,12.891,16.526,"Thank you, Justice Scalia, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-290,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,60.086,64.621,"It would be hard to argue, Mr. Hungar, that it makes no sense, but it made sense to Cardozo and Judge Rich."
2010.10-290,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,64.621,73.493,"Your Honor, Justice Cardozo was not addressing a case in which the evidence at issue had not been considered by the Patent Office."
2010.10-290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,75.095,77.495,"Well, you can't keep shifting horses, now."
2010.10-290,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,96.259,103.329,"--Your Honor, our position and our view of the correct interpretation of the statute is that Grogan and Huddleston approach."
2010.10-290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,122.742,124.576,"So, you're contradicting Cardozo?"
2010.10-290,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,124.576,137.002,"To the extent that -- that Justice Cardozo was discussing a heightened standard in the limited context of priority inventions, we think that that's not consistent with section 282, which, of course, came later."
2010.10-290,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,169.973,173.842,But Justice Cardozo certainly didn't limit his holding in the way you suggest.
2010.10-290,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,183.865,191.553,"Actually, Your Honor, I agree that there is some grand language used in dictum in that case."
2010.10-290,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,237.515,268.184,"But just taking RCA itself, Cardozo said through all the verbal variances there runs this common core of thought and truth, that one otherwise an infringer who assails the validity of a patent bears -- upon its face, bears a heavy burden of persuasion and fails unless his evidence has more than a dubious preponderance."
2010.10-290,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,268.184,268.736,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-290,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,298.988,305.642,Then you -- then you have to be saying that Judge Rich got it wrong because he does deal with the--
2010.10-290,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,305.642,316.914,"Well, certainly -- yes, Your Honor, certainly we think American Hoist is wrong, although I would note that Judge Rich, in his American Hoist decision, says that the cases prior to 1952 were all over the map."
2010.10-290,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,362.745,382.975,"Well, Mr. Hungar, it seems to me that RCA would matter, even under your view of the world, because if you think that Congress did not codify the existing state of the law as to the standard of proof and you think that Congress -- that -- that section 282 was essentially silent as to the standard of proof, then the question is, what do we do?"
2010.10-290,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,387.927,407.905,"--Well, first of all, again, because RCA in context was a case where there was a priority of invention dispute that had been adjudicated in the Patent Office on the same evidence previously resolved by the Court, a priority of invention dispute, where the heightened standard cases had some application, it clearly wouldn't affect the standards in this case."
2010.10-290,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,460.171,480.251,"--It's -- it -- it is true that the Federal Circuit has been consistent now since almost the beginning, since that court came on the scene, and it does have a monopoly on appeal in patent cases since 1984."
2010.10-290,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,495.961,498.713,"No, Your Honor, not that I'm aware of."
2010.10-290,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,535.838,550.263,"Counsel, I -- I -- having read some of those cases that you've cited that you claim weakened or eliminated the burden of proof standard, most of them didn't quite eliminate it."
2010.10-290,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,588.723,617.373,"Your Honor, if I understand the -- the question correctly, first of all, I would disagree with the characterization of the cases, but with respect to the preservation issue, we objected to the clear and convincing evidence instruction, and we also said that if -- if any instruction on the heightened standard is going to be given, it needs to reflect that -- the fact that, at least with respect to prior art combinations that were not considered by the Patent Office, the standard should be a preponderance."
2010.10-290,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,622.194,624.062,But other judges give a slightly different standard.
2010.10-290,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,638.155,640.355,We didn't ask--
2010.10-290,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,640.355,642.523,You just asked for the preponderance of the evidence charge?
2010.10-290,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,642.523,653.295,"--But, Your Honor, we did object to the clear and convincing evidence instruction, and so if -- we don't think that's the right answer, the more easily satisfied instruction, if that's what Your Honor is referring to."
2010.10-290,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,667.239,667.855,Why?
2010.10-290,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,667.855,669.674,--Because that in effect--
2010.10-290,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,669.674,675.16,"I mean, you said to the judge below: All you have to charge is preponderance of the evidence."
2010.10-290,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,681.981,696.039,"--Your Honor, that construction would not solve the fundamental problem, which is that when the Patent Office didn't even consider the evidence, it makes absolutely no sense, as the KRSR court indicated, to have this heightened deference."
2010.10-290,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,722.439,725.891,I have one question here I would like to get your view on.
2010.10-290,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,843.385,844.018,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-290,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,946.967,951.654,I'm getting that out of the American Intellectual Property Law Association.
2010.10-290,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,976.852,995.48,"--Your Honor, I don't think it addresses the problem because the fundamental problem is imposing this heightened standard on the jury that has no moorings in the statute and no moorings in common sense, particularly in a case like this one where the relevant evidence was not only not considered by the Patent Office but withheld from the Patent Office."
2010.10-290,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,996.997,999.099,It might not in your situation.
2010.10-290,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1035.974,1041.259,"--But, Your Honor, if that were -- the judge can't give an instruction like that."
2010.10-290,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1041.259,1042.045,"No, no."
2010.10-290,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1051.667,1062.172,"Your Honor, I think in many of these cases it would be extremely difficult or impossible for judge to fashion at that level of specificity the factual issues to be considered by the jury."
2010.10-290,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1099.881,1106.201,"Mr. Hungar, could we go back to the statute that was enacted in 1952."
2010.10-290,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1150.897,1151.582,"No, Your Honor."
2010.10-290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1169.511,1173.596,Burden of going forward or burden of persuasion?
2010.10-290,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1173.596,1178.333,"--I believe -- you know, the cases aren't crystal-clear on that."
2010.10-290,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1210.305,1221.076,"If the challenger has the burden of persuasion, wouldn't it almost go without saying that the challenger would also have the burden of production on the issue of invalidity?"
2010.10-290,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1228.016,1229.732,"--I think that's unclear, Your Honor."
2010.10-290,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1345.407,1357.449,"Justice Scalia, and may it please the Court."
2010.10-290,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1357.449,1359.317,Mr. Waxman.
2010.10-290,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1359.317,1378.73,"The long-settled, clear and convincing evidence standard is correct, one, as a matter of statutory interpretation, two, as a matter of stare decisis in a field in which stability is particularly important, and, three, as a matter of first principles."
2010.10-290,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1416.94,1418.422,How actively do we acquiesce?
2010.10-290,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1418.422,1421.657,"Yes, I would like that notion of active acquiescence."
2010.10-290,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1421.657,1423.426,I thought that might get a rise out of you.
2010.10-290,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1429.747,1431.699,"It's like passive activity, right?"
2010.10-290,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1431.699,1437.167,--I may want to submit a supplemental brief on that point.
2010.10-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1501.36,1502.295,Mr. Waxman--
2010.10-290,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1502.295,1517.221,"If I could take you back to first principles, which is where you started, I have three problems in seeing your interpretation in the language of section 282."
2010.10-290,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1574.142,1581.729,"Well, as to presumptions generally, I found particularly persuasive your opinion for the Third Circuit in GI Holding."
2010.10-290,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1582.247,1584.013,I've gotten a lot smarter since then.
2010.10-290,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1585.865,1604.994,"--More directly to the point, and with all due deference to the sensibilities of the presiding Justice for this argument, when Congress enacted section 282 in 1952, the revisers note the House Committee report, the Senate committee report said that they were, quote,"
2010.10-290,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1786.346,1818.402,"Would you agree, looking to Judge Rich's opinions, that it would have been in order for the judge to instruct, if the judge had been asked to do so, that the evidence would carry more weight if it hadn't been presented, defendant's evidence would carry more weight if it hadn't been presented to the Patent Office?"
2010.10-290,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1818.402,1823.02,"Yes, and the Federal Circuit has said that over and over and over again."
2010.10-290,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1915.648,1918.683,"Well, there are case -- there are cases in which the presumption disappears?"
2010.10-290,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1918.683,1924.587,"--Well, there -- are you referring to cases of this Court?"
2010.10-290,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1924.587,1924.987,Yes.
2010.10-290,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1934.943,1935.593,"Well, okay."
2010.10-290,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2043.58,2055.971,"Isn't there a lower court that has ruled that that standard, in the manner that you've articulated, could confuse a jury as to what clear and convincing evidence means?"
2010.10-290,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2055.971,2056.571,--The--
2010.10-290,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2056.571,2061.875,"In fact, it's not clear and convincing evidence if you phrase it that way, that it's something less than that."
2010.10-290,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2061.875,2063.158,"--Well, I mean, a lot--"
2010.10-290,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2063.158,2068.779,"And so, the amici here have suggested alternatives to that language that you're endorsing--"
2010.10-290,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2068.779,2074.016,--There -- there are -- there are any number of formulations that trial courts have given.
2010.10-290,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2131.269,2147.647,"Of course the instruction that you've proposed to the jury, like your adversary's proposition, would require determining what it was that the Patent Office considered."
2010.10-290,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2157.837,2158.437,Well--
2010.10-290,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2158.437,2162.038,You have to do it for your instruction just as -- as he will have to do it for his.
2010.10-290,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2162.038,2187.939,"--There is a -- there is a great difference, Justice Scalia, between telling individual jurors what amount of weight they may or may not give to certain evidence in creating a dual standard of proof which would, for reasons that -- that Microsoft's own amici point out, requires -- would require the jury first to determine whether this evidence was or wasn't considered and was or wasn't more pertinent--"
2010.10-290,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2187.939,2190.308,"Yes, but your -- but your instruction requires that, too."
2010.10-290,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2198.08,2214.506,"--Justice Scalia, as -- as I think all the parties agree, and we reflect the -- we reflect the -- the research, I believe, on footnote 12 of our brief, the -- this point is argued in many, many, many cases."
2010.10-290,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2271.962,2273.995,"But -- but why -- why -- why not, Mr. Waxman?"
2010.10-290,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2299.362,2312.17,--There -- here are four independent principles that justify the clear and convincing evidence standard across the board regardless of what the jury considered.
2010.10-290,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2392.305,2397.943,"--Isn't there a limited amount of reliance that any patent holder can have, given the re-exam system?"
2010.10-290,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2397.943,2407.5,"Yes, and the fact -- yes, the re-examine system -- I think your point actually, I wish I had thought to make this point myself."
2010.10-290,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2467.789,2475.478,All those first principles are along the lines of how important patents are and what a disaster is it is to the person once they're invalidated.
2010.10-290,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2502.943,2503.309,--Yes.
2010.10-290,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2503.309,2514.084,So I can't work out in my own mind whether in today's world these first principles cut for the patentee or cut for the challenger to the patent.
2010.10-290,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2514.084,2516.119,Those are policy arguments that have--
2010.10-290,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2516.119,2516.786,And the first are not?
2010.10-290,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2516.786,2517.736,--Excuse me?
2010.10-290,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2562.766,2563.899,--Finish your sentence.
2010.10-290,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2563.899,2581.978,"--which I agree with: A, Congress is on the job; and, B, there is -- those policy reasons say nothing about what Congress thought about the Patent Office in 1952 when it applied this Court's unanimous presumption."
2010.10-290,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2582.411,2583.847,"Thank you, Mr. Waxman."
2010.10-290,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2587.715,2595.921,"Justice Scalia, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-290,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2725.853,2732.339,"Counsel, the problem with your argument, assuming its validity, is why do you need the second sentence?"
2010.10-290,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2752.02,2772.833,"--I think there is a belt and suspenders quality to the statute, no matter how you parse it, but I think that Microsoft has essentially the same problem, because they have constructed a theory under which the second sentence does something that the first has not, does not, but they haven't constructed any theory as to why the first sentence is not superfluous."
2010.10-290,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2872.83,2877.317,But that ground doesn't carry very much weight when the matter was never considered by the PTO.
2010.10-290,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2877.317,2894.343,"I think you are correct that if Congress had focused specifically on the category of cases in which the only evidence brought forward to show invalidity had not been considered by the PTO, it might have addressed that separately."
2010.10-290,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3058.768,3074.061,"Why is -- why is re-examination sufficient to answer the concerns that Justice Breyer mentioned, when re-examination can't consider certain issues, and a case such as this doesn't necessarily have to be stayed while re-examination takes place?"
2010.10-290,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3074.061,3079.148,--It's not fully sufficient to resolve all challenges to the -- the validity of an issued patent.
2010.10-290,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3202.243,3204.279,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
2010.10-290,3,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3207.397,3211.635,"Thank you, Justice Scalia."
2010.10-290,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3297.491,3315.452,"What about the rule where -- I'm trying this on, I don't buy it necessarily -- the -- the heightened standard exists where the Patent Office did consider it or could have considered it had the infringer asked for reconsideration?"
2010.10-290,3,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3328.01,3328.743,"Well, first--"
2010.10-290,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3328.743,3332.128,"--And if he doesn't use it, it should get a heightened burden because he should have used it."
2010.10-290,3,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3332.128,3335.966,"--First of all, Your Honor, I don't see that any way you can get that out of the statute."
2010.10-290,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3338.568,3346.821,"The statute itself doesn't -- we're all going on history here, I mean, and history brought up to date with the words of the statute I don't think cover it either way."
2010.10-290,3,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3349.923,3350.375,"--Well, there--"
2010.10-290,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3350.375,3356.612,I wanted your opinion on that as the validity or a useful instruction for juries.
2010.10-290,3,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3356.612,3361.897,"--Well, Congress certainly couldn't have intended that in 1952 because it hadn't yet created re-examination."
2010.10-290,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3361.897,3363.099,I'm not asking that question.
2010.10-290,3,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3380.644,3387.314,"Your Honor, as you know, re-exam is not available for many of the types of invalidity issues that arise."
2010.10-290,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3526.872,3528.991,"Thank you, Mr. Hungar."
