1982.81-2147,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.134,"We will hear arguments next in Arizona against the San Carlos Apache Tribe of Arizona, and Montana against Northern Cheyenne Tribe of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation."
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,49.478,59.772,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, during the floor debate on the McCarren Amendment, Senator McCarren stated to Senator Ernest McFarland,"
1982.81-2147,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,166.306,169.15,Could one seek that in a federal court in Arizona?
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,169.15,173.77,"One could seek that in a federal court in any state, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-2147,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,183.238,186.595,"Well, what would be the basis of federal jurisdiction?"
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,186.595,202.042,"This Court held in the Colorado River case that either under Section 1345 or... well, Section 1345 in that case, that a suit could be filed in the federal court for adjudication of water rights."
1982.81-2147,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,202.042,205.648,For a statewide or streamwide adjudication?
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,205.648,208.071,"For a streamwide adjudication, yes."
1982.81-2147,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,267.732,274.654,Do you suggest... How does that affect which court will decide the cases?
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,274.654,278.495,"Mr. Chief Justice, those are among the factors, the considerations--"
1982.81-2147,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,278.495,279.322,The numbers I am speaking of.
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,281.26,289.414,"--Simply to illustrate, Mr. Chief Justice, the significant progress and involvement in the Arizona state court proceedings."
1982.81-2147,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,734.106,749.412,"Mr. Kyl, I take it that the Ninth Circuit didn't reach this question with respect to Arizona as to whether wise judicial administration would suggest that the federal court go on or abstain, did it?"
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,749.412,751.319,"--That is correct, Mr. Justice White."
1982.81-2147,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,751.319,757.409,"And isn't that... isn't that sort of a... well, isn't that a question of state law?"
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,757.409,759.83,Mr. Justice White--
1982.81-2147,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,759.83,762.923,As to whether it is really comprehensive or whether it isn't?
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,762.923,764.565,"--No, Mr. Justice White."
1982.81-2147,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,766.952,769.529,It does go to interpreting state law.
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,769.529,780.791,"--Yes, it does, but there has been, I believe, in this case no question about the comprehensiveness of the Arizona state proceedings, the ability of those statutes to comprehensively and properly--"
1982.81-2147,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,780.791,787.007,"Well, but suppose we agree with you on the enabling Act and on the Constitution."
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,802.219,806.89,"--Mr. Justice White, the Arizona federal district judge, Judge Cordoga, did precisely that."
1982.81-2147,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,806.89,808.887,"Well, I know, but the Court of Appeals didn't reach it."
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,808.887,820.792,"Well, that's correct, and we would certainly submit that the judge in the very best position to weigh these factors would be the federal district judge who is on the spot, who made the decision."
1982.81-2147,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,820.792,831.645,"Well, I know, but you wouldn't suggest that we would reverse the Court of Appeals necessarily if the Court of Appeals overturned the district judge on what may be very much a question of state law."
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,831.645,834.769,"Well, Mr. Justice White, let me answer that question two ways."
1982.81-2147,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,839.626,840.094,All right.
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,840.094,841.782,--that the state law is deficient in any respect.
1982.81-2147,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,841.782,847.106,I will ask the question of some other source.
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,847.106,849.184,"Secondly, we believe that this case is before the Court."
1982.81-2147,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,912.485,917.889,"In that great deal of progress, how much of that related to the Indians' claims in the state proceeding?"
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,917.889,927.37,"Mr. Justice Stevens, the Indians, or the United States on behalf of the Indians, have repeatedly sought extensions of time for the filing of their claims in these proceedings."
1982.81-2147,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,927.37,928.555,"Well, they want to proceed in the federal court."
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,928.555,929.635,Yes.
1982.81-2147,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,929.635,934.631,But to what extent have their rights so far been adjudicated at all in the state proceedings?
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,934.631,938.257,No Indian rights have been adjudicated in the state court proceedings.
1982.81-2147,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,938.257,943.19,"And they rely on an entirely different legal theory, as I understand it, than the one normally applied in state proceedings."
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,943.19,951.922,"The Indians rely upon the reserved right doctrine, and that doctrine is a doctrine of federal law applicable in the state courts as well as the federal courts."
1982.81-2147,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,951.922,958.355,"So aren't both sets of cases right at the starting point insofar as the Indian cases are concerned, Indian claims are concerned?"
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,958.355,960.355,"Mr. Justice Stevens, we would suggest not."
1982.81-2147,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1027.767,1034.17,"Mr. Kyl, I think you said earlier there had been 100,000 parties to this state proceeding?"
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,1034.17,1034.575,No.
1982.81-2147,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1044.682,1047.509,"Well, I was thinking of the state... of the pending state proceedings?"
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,1047.509,1048.274,"Yes, there are--"
1982.81-2147,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1048.274,1049.257,How many parties are there?
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,1049.257,1054.583,"--There have been over 70,000 defendants personally served."
1982.81-2147,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1054.583,1061.516,"Now, I gather the issues involved in those cases are quite different than in the Indian cases."
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,1061.516,1078.604,"Mr. Justice Brennan, no, there is only one issue in any of these cases, and that is the inter sese determination of rights: Who has how much water right at what point in time, and how does it relate to all of the other holders of water rights?"
1982.81-2147,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1096.612,1100.269,"But it isn't correct, is it, that you don't start from scratch with every new proceeding?"
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,1106.159,1121.838,"--Mr. Justice Stevens, there are some decrees existing in the State of Arizona, but one of the key reasons for the implementation of the Arizona statutory procedure in the 1970's was a recognition of the fact that those decrees were simply insufficient."
1982.81-2147,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1123.979,1126.209,"Maybe they are insufficient, but they are not nullities."
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,1126.209,1129.099,"--No, they are certainly not nullities, but they only went--"
1982.81-2147,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1129.099,1130.413,So you have some background that you are building on.
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,1130.413,1131.786,"--Yes, that is correct."
1982.81-2147,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1138.77,1146.124,"No, but if there had been, say, a federal adjudication, which I understand there hasn't, which determines some bundle of rights, that would be part of the background--"
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,1146.124,1146.467,Yes.
1982.81-2147,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1146.467,1147.75,--that you would work with in your proceeding.
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,1147.75,1148.421,Certainly so.
1982.81-2147,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1148.421,1155.246,"Well, Mr. Kyl, if the Indians prevailed and they were to go into federal court, would they have to duplicate what is going on in the state courts?"
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,1155.246,1156.543,"Absolutely, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1982.81-2147,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1156.543,1157.541,Completely so?
1982.81-2147,0,31336,jon_l_kyl,,1157.541,1161.492,"Yes, almost completely so."
1982.81-2147,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1291.268,1292.188,Very well.
1982.81-2147,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1302.607,1317.976,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I think it would be helpful if I briefly describe the procedural postures of these cases in the State of Montana, first in the federal court and then the state situation."
1982.81-2147,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1409.5,1411.719,"With separate judges in different areas, I take it."
1982.81-2147,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1411.719,1413.533,"--Well, it is considered to be one court."
1982.81-2147,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1414.812,1417.28,"I know, but there are separate judges doing different rivers."
1982.81-2147,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1417.28,1418.388,That is correct.
1982.81-2147,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1456.404,1460.873,Claiming the very... claiming the very water that they are suing for here?
1982.81-2147,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1460.873,1463.338,"--Yes, they duplicate the suits that are involved in this case in the federal courts."
1982.81-2147,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1482.144,1489.187,"General Greely, is Montana drained entirely into the Mississippi by the Missouri River, or does anything go over to the Pacific?"
1982.81-2147,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1489.187,1494.577,"--There's a few... we have the Continental Divide that goes through the state, so some of that is drained into the Columbia River system."
1982.81-2147,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1494.577,1495.669,Goes into Columbia.
1982.81-2147,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1495.669,1512.535,"Unlike Montana, the state adjudication has not been stayed pending this... pending this proceeding, and the Montana water courts of course have relied on the McCarren Amendment and the Colorado River decision to proceed with their adjudication."
1982.81-2147,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1512.535,1517.096,"Was there any effort made, Mr. Attorney General, to have state proceedings stayed?"
1982.81-2147,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1517.096,1524.514,"There was an effort, I believe, on behalf of one of the tribes to stay the proceedings."
1982.81-2147,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1936.208,1941.578,"In the state adjudications, have the tribes appeared independently?"
1982.81-2147,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1941.578,1948.25,"--There have... I think there's one or two tribes, Your Honor, that have filed claims on their own behalf as tribes."
1982.81-2147,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1948.25,1949.186,Are they permitted to file on their own behalf?
1982.81-2147,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1949.186,1950.297,"Yes, they are."
1982.81-2147,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1951.28,1954.341,Whether or not the United States files for them?
1982.81-2147,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1954.341,1955.434,That's correct.
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2290.0,2296.984,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, may I start out by correcting a misstatement of General Greely's?"
1982.81-2147,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2302.263,2303.823,"What do you mean, on their own?"
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2303.823,2306.198,They have not entered an appearance on their own.
1982.81-2147,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2309.632,2315.537,"So that any claims, water claims that have been filed in those proceedings have been filed on their behalf by the United States?"
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2315.537,2316.02,Correct.
1982.81-2147,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2318.27,2322.533,Did anybody ever serve them as adverse parties in the state proceedings?
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2322.533,2323.925,"--No, sir."
1982.81-2147,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2323.925,2326.424,What about the Blackfeet?
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2330.889,2333.28,"Yes, that is my understanding."
1982.81-2147,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2342.916,2344.073,You are not representing the Blackfeet?
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2344.073,2344.963,That's correct.
1982.81-2147,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2344.963,2349.209,"If they are represented today, they are represented by the United States?"
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2349.209,2350.71,That's correct.
1982.81-2147,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2921.509,2922.994,How about the equal footing clause?
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2922.994,2949.905,"--The equal footing doctrine only prohibits the United States from asserting unique conditions on statehood that Congress would not otherwise have authority to impose, and since Congress has plenary and full authority to impose virtually any condition and any exercise, any authority over Indians, the equal footing doctrine is not a concern in this case."
1982.81-2147,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2949.905,2960.776,"Well, in Pollard against Hagen, the objection was not that Congress didn't have authority in the abstract to reserve water out of its own territory that was making a state, but that it hadn't done it with the other states."
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2960.776,2961.681,I'm sorry.
1982.81-2147,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2962.991,2967.351,"In Pollard against Hagen, which I think is the leaving equal footing case."
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2967.351,2994.823,"Well, there is no question, and Arizona against California specifically held that Congress has full authority to reserve water for Indian reservations pre-statehood and post-statehood, and there is a full range of court decisions which hold... Winters against the United States is probably the leading case holding that the equal footing doctrine does not prohibit any federal legislation dealing with Indian affairs or any reservation of rights for Indians."
1982.81-2147,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2994.823,2999.912,"No, but that was not addressed to this kind of a disclaimer."
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2999.912,3031.947,"Well, the disclaimers have been given effect by this Court, the Indian disclaimers have been given effect by this Court time and time again, in Williams against Lee, in Fisher against the District Court, in McClannahan in 1973, and the equal footing doctrine under the cases cited in our brief at Pages 46 to 47 is just not a factor in dealing with Indian affairs, for the reasons that are explained in those cases."
1982.81-2147,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3108.588,3112.807,Are you going to discuss Organized Village of Kake in your oral argument?
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3112.807,3118.195,"--I wasn't planning to, but I'll be glad to."
1982.81-2147,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3305.976,3312.27,"Well, the Attorney General of Montana suggests that the tribes should file their claims in the state proceedings."
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3312.27,3314.551,"--Well, that remains to be seen, but assuming that--"
1982.81-2147,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3314.551,3316.192,"Well, do you assume that they cannot?"
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3316.192,3316.645,--No--
1982.81-2147,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3316.645,3317.534,Do you assert they cannot?
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3317.534,3318.86,--I do not assume they cannot.
1982.81-2147,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3349.865,3354.879,"So far as worrying about collateral attack, doesn't the Heckman case pretty well take care of that?"
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3357.894,3359.891,Not if there is a denial of due process.
1982.81-2147,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3359.891,3363.735,"Well, nothing you have told me so far suggests a denial of due process."
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3363.735,3382.882,"Well, if the government is... if the government's conflict prevents them from adequately representing the Indians' interests, and the Indians have not had a full and fair opportunity to be heard owing to the government's conflict, then that would be a denial of due process that would cloud the resulting judgment."
1982.81-2147,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3385.959,3394.658,"What is the... what is the... Is there a statute giving tribes sovereign immunity, or a case?"
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3394.658,3399.876,"--No, that is an inherent attribute of sovereignty that was reaffirmed in Santa Clara Pueblo against Martinez--"
1982.81-2147,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3399.876,3401.748,So they may not be sued without their consent?
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3401.748,3433.014,"--That's correct, and Congress in 1966, when it enacted 28 USC Section 1362, which my colleagues will be talking more about, specifically recognized the existence of this conflict problem, recognized that there were instances when the Attorney General would not be able to represent the tribes' interest owing to the conflict, and provided a federal forum, consciously did not provide a state forum for tribes to sue under those circumstances and to represent its own interests."
1982.81-2147,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3444.198,3445.119,May I ask you a question about that?
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3450.009,3452.415,"No, I agree with that in principle."
1982.81-2147,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3453.834,3455.959,Then it is not a reason for picking one forum over the other.
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3455.959,3466.577,"--Yes, it is where the tribes have participated and are participating in the federal court, because the problems posed by the conflict do not exist if the tribes are independently represented."
1982.81-2147,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3469.591,3473.904,"Well, some of them elected to proceed to the federal courts represented by the United States, as I remember."
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3473.904,3485.213,"That's correct, and with regard to those cases, the conflict factor would not point either way, but it would be decisive where the tribes are participating in the federal court but are not participating in the state court--"
1982.81-2147,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3485.213,3487.21,"Well, unless they elected to participate in the state court."
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3489.554,3494.163,"--What I am suggesting is that they are immune from suit, and that in these circumstances--"
1982.81-2147,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3494.163,3496.081,"Well, that is a sovereign immunity argument."
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3496.081,3496.694,--Yes.
1982.81-2147,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3496.694,3497.817,I understand that.
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3497.817,3508.392,"Well, and that it would be unfair to put them to the... to force them to compel their immunity by intervening in federal court, particularly when Congress has provided a federal forum for them."
1982.81-2147,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3508.392,3509.92,But that is all true without the conflict of interest.
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3509.92,3511.702,"Yes, but there is a--"
1982.81-2147,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3511.702,3514.404,It just seems to me the conflict of interest doesn't really add much to the argument.
1982.81-2147,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3514.404,3517.903,"--Well, conflict of interest shows the inadequacy of the state court proceeding."
1982.81-2147,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3518.885,3530.865,Mr. Rifkind.
1982.81-2147,3,41970,simon_k_rifkind,,3530.865,3562.12,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, my argument will be addressed to the considerations which necessarily must underlie the argument of this case as I see it, and that is a discussion of the factors addressed to our attention in the Akin case, the case that we have all decided to call Akin, Colorado River against... but I should like to open with this one sentence."
1982.81-2147,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4049.608,4053.715,Would it be related to the quantity of water in the stream?
1982.81-2147,3,41970,simon_k_rifkind,,4053.715,4070.366,"--It would of course be related to the water... quantity of waters in the stream, but in the most generalized sense of that term only, not because some other user is applying it beneficially to his property."
1982.81-2147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4113.081,4119.426,"Well, Mr. Rifkind, the same is true of claims by the United States on its own behalf."
1982.81-2147,3,41970,simon_k_rifkind,,4127.452,4130.107,"--Yes, Your Honor, but the United States--"
1982.81-2147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4130.107,4133.698,And they would be... stand on a completely separate basis--
1982.81-2147,3,41970,simon_k_rifkind,,4133.698,4134.369,--That is correct.
1982.81-2147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4134.369,4135.215,--just like the Indian claim.
1982.81-2147,3,41970,simon_k_rifkind,,4135.215,4142.869,"Yes, Mr. Justice, but the United States, through the Act of its Congress, acquiesced in such an arrangement."
1982.81-2147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4142.869,4143.852,I understand.
1982.81-2147,3,41970,simon_k_rifkind,,4143.852,4145.915,The Indians never acquiesced in such an arrangement.
1982.81-2147,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4151.004,4151.488,"Well, then, I take it... I take it--"
1982.81-2147,3,41970,simon_k_rifkind,,4153.613,4155.083,"Oh, no, Your Honor."
1982.81-2147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4155.083,4162.36,I take it you would say there is no claim involving an Indian water right that would ever be appropriate to be tried in a state court.
1982.81-2147,3,41970,simon_k_rifkind,,4162.36,4166.498,If the state brings a proceeding?
1982.81-2147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4166.498,4171.028,You suggest that the other side says there is never one that would be proper for the federal court.
1982.81-2147,3,41970,simon_k_rifkind,,4171.028,4172.525,I do not say the contrary.
1982.81-2147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4172.525,4174.9,When would an inquiry be proper?
1982.81-2147,3,41970,simon_k_rifkind,,4174.9,4188.037,"If Arizona brings an action for stream adjudication and the Indians don't do anything, and they bring in the Indian claims by serving the United States, then Akin would say that can go on in the state court."
1982.81-2147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4188.802,4189.785,And the Indians can be bound by it?
1982.81-2147,3,41970,simon_k_rifkind,,4189.785,4191.349,"--Oh, I have no doubt of it."
1982.81-2147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4191.349,4199.015,"Even though, even though determining the Indian water right in that proceeding would be a separate matter resting on a separate foundation?"
1982.81-2147,3,41970,simon_k_rifkind,,4199.015,4199.409,Yes.
1982.81-2147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4228.674,4234.345,"Well, what if in Montana the... what if in Montana... the United States has filed some claims on behalf of Indians in the state proceeding."
1982.81-2147,3,41970,simon_k_rifkind,,4234.345,4235.222,"Well, all I--"
1982.81-2147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4235.222,4246.812,"So let us assume that proceeding goes forward, the federal court proceeding goes forward, one court ends up saying, well, the Indian claim is worth so many acre feet of water, and in the other proceeding it says it is a different--"
1982.81-2147,3,41970,simon_k_rifkind,,4246.812,4252.293,"--I apprehended that you might ask me that question, and therefore I found out the answer from among my colleagues."
1982.81-2147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4254.087,4254.836,--Ah ha.
1982.81-2147,3,41970,simon_k_rifkind,,4254.836,4257.32,Nothing has happened beyond the pleading stage.
1982.81-2147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4273.191,4276.986,"Well, you know, then, that something is going to have to be done to avoid a conflict."
1982.81-2147,3,41970,simon_k_rifkind,,4276.986,4279.719,There is no conflict in the system that I have described.
1982.81-2147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4279.719,4289.823,"Well, I know, but something is... unless this Court or somebody does something, those two proceedings are going to go on side by side, and there could easily be a conflict."
1982.81-2147,3,41970,simon_k_rifkind,,4289.823,4313.095,"Justice White, if you say that the Navajo plan, the complaint that I worked out in Navajo, which I did with both my eyes focused on the Akin case, and I made sure that I never trespassed one foot inside that territory, and I did it with eyes open, and I have accomplished it, I believe, and having done that, then the others can accommodate themselves to the same kind of a complaint that will be safe in the federal court."
1982.81-2147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4313.095,4318.968,"If we held to the contrary, the people in the federal courts will just have to accommodate themselves."
1982.81-2147,3,41970,simon_k_rifkind,,4318.968,4321.328,I would be... I am just--
1982.81-2147,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4321.328,4325.496,"You wouldn't mind if Akin were overruled, would you?"
1982.81-2147,3,41970,simon_k_rifkind,,4325.496,4329.466,--I am not here to ask you to revisit Akin.
1982.81-2147,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4336.694,4349.629,Mr. Claiborne.
1982.81-2147,4,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4349.629,4378.708,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the question we have asked ourselves in respect of these cases is whether it is unavoidable to have an all or nothing solution to have water rights adjudication, Indian, non-Indian, federal, all in the state court or all in the federal court, as indeed Akin suggests must be the result."
1982.81-2147,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4456.038,4473.985,"Mr. Claiborne, since in the last analysis it all depends in these dry western states on how much water there is, how do you handle the determination by both the federal court and the state court of different quantities of available water?"
1982.81-2147,4,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4473.985,4483.231,"Justice O'Connor, I don't know whether your question suggests that either decree will adjudicate more water than is available."
1982.81-2147,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4487.556,4491.603,"No, a different determination of how much water is available."
1982.81-2147,4,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4496.645,4518.092,"--Justice O'Connor, all we suggest the task of the federal court will be is simply to determine adversely to all those who want to contest it in the federal court forum the number of acre feet of water to which Indian reservations are entitled and the priority date appropriate."
1982.81-2147,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4518.092,4522.386,But doesn't that depend in part on how much water there is?
1982.81-2147,4,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4522.386,4537.878,"Only to the extent that the number of acre feet which a river bed bore might be greater, computing so many acre feet per acre for each acre than is available."
1982.81-2147,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4622.922,4633.998,Do you think not only the quantification of the reserved right but also its date would be determined in the federal court?
1982.81-2147,4,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4633.998,4636.965,"Yes, the date, Justice White, and of course that may be--"
1982.81-2147,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4636.965,4640.604,But the state law would determine its priority?
1982.81-2147,4,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4640.604,4652.458,"--I take it that in the western states there is no dispute, the trust in right... first in time is first in right, and I don't think this is--"
1982.81-2147,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4652.458,4661.25,"Well, that might be an assumption that isn't universally applicable, but anyway, you would... your answer is yes, I take it."
1982.81-2147,4,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4661.25,4663.033,--I think my answer is yes.
1982.81-2147,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4680.604,4692.678,"Well, do you think at least for the purpose of finally firming up the state... the Indian water right in its priority, somebody is going to have to go and have it included in the state decree?"
1982.81-2147,4,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4692.678,4698.284,--The United States itself will be a party to the state decree.
1982.81-2147,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4698.284,4700.234,"Well, what if the Indians don't want you to be?"

1982.81-2147,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4711.512,4718.792,"For example, Mr. Claiborne, are you going to comment on that motion of the Blackfeet Indian tribe?"
1982.81-2147,4,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4720.165,4726.131,--We have in effect answered the motion in the letter we sent to the--
1982.81-2147,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4726.131,4727.804,Your letter of March 15th?
1982.81-2147,4,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4727.804,4729.505,"--That is so, Mr. Justice--"
1982.81-2147,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4729.505,4730.113,I see.
1982.81-2147,4,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4730.113,4748.217,"--That is to say that in the absence of any intervention by the tribe, it is the power and duty of the United States to represent Indian claims, whether the tribe wishes it or not, and so to that degree we are here."
1982.81-2147,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4982.419,4989.757,"Would you say, Mr. Claiborne, that the claims of the United States in the Montana case were properly referred to the state court, or were there any?"
1982.81-2147,4,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4989.757,4994.258,"--There were claims of the United States, not on behalf of--"
1982.81-2147,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4994.258,4997.101,"No, no, I mean, the United States' own claims."
1982.81-2147,4,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4998.785,4999.959,--We say they were.
1982.81-2147,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4999.959,5002.595,Under... under Colorado River?
1982.81-2147,4,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5002.595,5004.221,Under Colorado River--
1982.81-2147,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5004.221,5015.187,"So those factors in Colorado River would not only authorize but require the reference of the United States claims to the state court, but not the Indian claims?"
1982.81-2147,4,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5015.187,5015.889,--Yes.
1982.81-2147,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5039.676,5049.031,"But it wouldn't... I don't see how you can say that the reference of the United States claims was quite proper under Colorado River, and yet the reference of the Indian claims were not under those same factors."
1982.81-2147,4,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5054.17,5071.132,"--The Akin court was not, at least at the instance of the United States, invited to focus on the special situation under the Acts of Congress for Indian claims, most specifically, Section 1362."
1982.81-2147,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5090.436,5117.83,"I think you really are, then, asking that we really redo Colorado River with respect to Indian claims, that those factors just... however much they might be satisfied with respect to the claims of the United States itself, are nevertheless either not satisfied or there are additional factors that come into being that must be brought to bear on Indian claims."
1982.81-2147,4,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5117.83,5136.918,"I must candidly concede that we are asking the Court to reconsider one aspect of Akin in light of Section 1362, not involved there, and that the experience under Akin has led us to invite the Court to draw a firmer line."
1982.81-2147,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5152.441,5155.705,But you would say what our rule ought to be is a bright line rule.
1982.81-2147,4,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5170.387,5179.868,"--We invite the Court to that result, though we likewise endorse the intermediate position put forward by Judge Rifkind."
1982.81-2147,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5181.275,5184.148,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Kyl?"
1982.81-2147,5,31336,jon_l_kyl,,5184.148,5195.344,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, yes, I do have some remarks."

1982.81-2147,5,31336,jon_l_kyl,,5335.289,5341.583,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I am not aware of what a disclaimer statute would be."
1982.81-2147,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5341.583,5347.019,"No, with a disclaimer... I mean, say the Washington cases, the New Mexico cases, Mescalero, that you are referring to."
1982.81-2147,5,31336,jon_l_kyl,,5356.062,5363.151,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, no, the disclaimers are occasionally mentioned in these cases, but they have never been seen as a bar."
