1977.76-1660,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,59.118,"We will hear arguments next in 76-1660, Hutto against Finney."
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,68.335,72.12,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1660,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,410.347,428.236,"Certainly, some of our cases have gone sufficiently as far as so as say that you look at everything you can in construing the statute, rather than the more traditional role, perhaps a while ago that only where the legislative language is unclear, do you resort to the history."
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,444.339,457.028,"Yes sir, but it is our position that Congress simply misinterpreted the decision of this Court in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer and Congress did not do what they had to do to abrogate the State's immunity."
1977.76-1660,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,466.576,490.018,"Well, is your point that, even if Congress had enacted the language that you find in the committee reports, it would have been insufficient or that the committee reports are not sufficiently weighty so as to affect the language that Congress did choose to enact?"
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,490.018,504.916,"It is our position that the committee reports -- of course the Court can look at them and consider them, but there is really no need to because there is ambiguity on the face of this particular statute."
1977.76-1660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,526.345,531.987,Was that type of bill introduced before?
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,533.353,537.884,"This is pending now Sir, it was introduced on January the 10th this year."
1977.76-1660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,537.884,545.323,"Was it introduced before then, while this legislation was pending?"
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,545.323,547.046,"Sir, I am not certain whether or not the bill --"
1977.76-1660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,547.046,556.996,"Well if it was not, could we assume that Congress assumed that it was covered, otherwise they would have introduced a Bill like that?"
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,556.996,572.062,"Your Honor, I believe a more correct assumption might be that the fact that this bill pending now, indicates that Congress is not certain, that it followed the guidelines set forth by this Court when it --"
1977.76-1660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,572.062,574.146,You mean what citation --?
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,574.146,587.393,"In Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, Your Honor, this Court held that Congress may act, but Congress in that instance acted by explicit statutory language, by explicitly --"
1977.76-1660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,587.393,588.821,(Inaudible).
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,588.821,594.198,"No Sir, I do not think it should because we are talking about a very fundamental concept of --"
1977.76-1660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,594.198,599.693,Then you just ignore what happened in Congress?
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,618.287,629.275,"Your Honor, as a general proposition there -- Court's hold that in statutory construction, it is not necessary to refer to the legislative history unless there is some ambiguity."
1977.76-1660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,629.275,633.399,We do not have to look at the legislative history?
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,633.399,638.428,"No sir, although I suspect that the Court will look at the legislative history in this particular instance."
1977.76-1660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,638.428,646.793,You may suspect that some will [Laughter] that you put your money on that?
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,646.793,663.303,"The legislative history does indicate the intent of Congress to abrogate Your Honor, but it is our position that Congress, even though it may have tried to abrogate the State's Immunity simply botched the job."
1977.76-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,788.061,792.485,General Taylor let me ask one question about the procedure.
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,804.282,810.973,"Your Honor, I do not think so because the Attorney's Fees Awards Act had not been passed at the time this decision was made, the award was made."
1977.76-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,810.973,816.088,"Well, if the Act applies, if the Act applies, your arguments about the State --"
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,816.088,829.47,Our argument will still be that it should not Your Honor because we do not feel like the Act should be applied retroactively because to do that will result in manifesting justice to the parties.
1977.76-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,829.47,834.067,"Your argument strikes me as is, the Department of Correction is not the party to the case, is that right?"
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,834.067,835.192,That is right.
1977.76-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,835.192,844.28,"And so how are your clients hurt by the order for the Department of Correction to pay the fees, the individual litigants here?"
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,851.242,856.652,"To them individually I do not suppose it makes a great deal of difference other than the fact that, well, of course we are talking about--"
1977.76-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,856.652,865.385,"Well, except that you put bail and went back to the trial judge, he may say, well, I think that the individual better pay the fee, is not that a possible consequence?"
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,865.385,867.163,If this is sent back to the trial judge?
1977.76-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,867.163,868.958,Yes.
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,868.958,875.189,"That is a possibility, but not under the Court's determination that we are, we have right now, The court --"
1977.76-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,875.189,886.481,"But if you prevail and it is sent back to the trial judge, so you cannot order to be paid by them and a different order is an entirely possible, he will say well the individual defendants have to pay this fee?"
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,886.481,900.165,"Your Honor, I do not know what the Court would say in that instance because it ordered the fee to be paid out of the Departments of Correction's Funds and in effect made a finding of bad faith on the part of the department of Correction."
1977.76-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,900.165,905.238,Did the Department of Corrections intervene to object to that order?
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,908.54,909.578,No sir.
1977.76-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,909.578,915.696,I am just wondering whether you are really advancing the best interest of your clients in your arguments here.
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,920.409,948.347,"Yes sir I think so because they were sued in their official capacity as well as individually and in their official capacities we have sued the Commissioner of Corrections and the Board of Corrections and the Court's order, order that the fees be paid out of the funds of the Department of Corrections, which they control in their official capacities. So we have to --"
1977.76-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,948.347,956.968,"Well if the statute applies would he have, would the Judge have power to order the fees paid by the individual defendants?"
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,963.096,963.969,Yes sir.
1977.76-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,963.969,967.543,Then could the Judge order the individuals to pay the fees?
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,967.543,993.565,"The judge could order the individuals to pay the fees, if the act applies, if the Court gives retroactive application to the Act, but to do that, would definitely result in a manifesting justices as you have just pointed out, to give retroactive affect to this Act under the holding of this Court in Bradley v. School Board, Bradley v. School Board of the city of Richmond."
1977.76-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,993.565,999.626,"Whether manifest necessity determination I suppose would take into account the finding of bad faith, would it not?"
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,999.626,1003.378,"Yes sir and we can test that finding, bad faith does not just --"
1977.76-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1003.378,1007.93,"(Voice Overlap) that two courts have agreed on that, the District Court and the Court of Appeals?"
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,1007.93,1010.416,The Court of Appeals footnoted it.
1977.76-1660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1062.5,1072.156,And the correctional provisions in Arkansas been under investigation by the Federal Government since around 1960?
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,1072.156,1074.576,"Yes sir, I am not sure exactly what date it started."
1977.76-1660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1078.889,1082.572,Did it go back way before then?
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,1082.572,1084.572,There has been litigation.
1977.76-1660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1085.252,1089.627,So by the investigation by the FBI?
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,1089.627,1098.15,Your Honor to be honest with you I am not familiar with the courses of FBI investigations or whether there have been any in our prison system.
1977.76-1660,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1098.15,1107.272,"You referred, the bad faith conclusions reached by the Court of Appeals and I guess by the District Court?"
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,1107.272,1108.87,Yes sir.
1977.76-1660,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1108.87,1114.636,"You challenge those determinations, I take it?"
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,1114.636,1114.915,Yes sir.
1977.76-1660,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1143.932,1149.866,"Is the Department of Corrections here, is the department of party here?"
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,1149.866,1151.237,"No sir, no sir."
1977.76-1660,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1151.237,1161.102,"Did they try to intervene, the Department of Corrections try to intervene to challenge the Court's jurisdiction to enter a judgment against it, when it was not a party?"
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,1161.102,1169.975,"No sir, but under the decisions of this Court the Attorney General may protect the interest of the State under the Eleventh Amendment Immunity, regardless of whether it is a party."
1977.76-1660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1169.975,1173.049,They did not file something?
1977.76-1660,0,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,1173.049,1180.277,"No sir that is not my understanding of the law under Ford v. Department of Treasury, if I am not mistaken here."
1977.76-1660,1,38069,philip_e_kaplan,,1663.505,1666.552,Mr. Chief justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1660,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1723.725,1728.087,"Well, that makes it a relatively easy case for both of you to focus on it, does not it?"
1977.76-1660,1,38069,philip_e_kaplan,,1728.087,1743.717,That is correct and I think that it is necessary for you to have a picture of what life was like in the punitive segregation section of maximum security in 1975.
1977.76-1660,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1743.717,1748.936,"Well now why, if the issue is as narrow as you just told us it is?"
1977.76-1660,1,38069,philip_e_kaplan,,1748.936,1759.824,So that focus can be directly related to the judge's power to impose that particular equitable remedy. It is not an isolation.
1977.76-1660,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1760.024,1761.6,You just told us it is?
1977.76-1660,1,38069,philip_e_kaplan,,1761.6,1768.652,"No, that here is the order of no more than 30 days is not an isolated remedy."
1977.76-1660,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1777.976,1780.007,But none of which are challenged by your opponent?
1977.76-1660,1,38069,philip_e_kaplan,,1780.007,1783.967,None of which are challenged.
1977.76-1660,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1801.807,1804.345,I thought that has been limited to two as of now?
1977.76-1660,1,38069,philip_e_kaplan,,1804.345,1805.965,It has now been limited to two.
1977.76-1660,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1805.965,1806.916,"Well, that is what we have?"
1977.76-1660,1,38069,philip_e_kaplan,,1806.916,1809.801,But that is what we had when the judge decided it.
1977.76-1660,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1809.801,1811.812,That is what we have right now?
1977.76-1660,1,38069,philip_e_kaplan,,1811.812,1846.076,"Yes, but also the judge was deciding this case in a context of his having written decisions since 1968, before Mr. Holt and I entered this case, limiting overcrowding, prohibiting overcrowding and never once had he found those orders being complied with, never once and in the context of that series of evasions of court orders since 1968, he finally says, no indeterminate sentencing and only two in a cell."
1977.76-1660,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1848.721,1850.152,"That is not true now, is it?"
1977.76-1660,1,38069,philip_e_kaplan,,1850.152,1857.407,"Still true, one steel pallet, still true, one steel pallet with mattresses during the day only."
1977.76-1660,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1869.451,1873.043,"No mattress, no blanket, no nothing?"
1977.76-1660,1,38069,philip_e_kaplan,,1873.043,1874.153,Not during the day time.
1977.76-1660,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1874.153,1875.229,"Well, at night?"
1977.76-1660,1,38069,philip_e_kaplan,,1875.229,1884.244,At night a person is furnished with a mattress and a blanket.
1977.76-1660,2,26198,garner_l_taylor_jr,,3489.367,3520.344,"With regard to the point made concerning our State statute requiring the Attorney General to appear, I would refer the Court to Ford Motor Company v. Department Of Treasury, a similar statute was involved in that particular case, it is in the footnote left of the Court's decision and in that case it was held that there was no waiver by the virtue of the fact that the Attorney General appeared and defended the action."
1977.76-1660,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3578.223,3578.876,Thank you gentlemen.
