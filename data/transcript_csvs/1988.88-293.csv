1988.88-293,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.522,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 88-293, Community for Creative Non-Violence, et al., versus James Earl Reid."
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,21.513,24.298,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,179.332,179.799,Excuse me.
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,193.625,194.225,--We will--
1988.88-293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,194.225,195.827,You just assert you're entitled to it.
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,195.827,196.727,--We will in fact use it--
1988.88-293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,196.727,198.779,So it really isn't the homeless against Mr. Reid.
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,200.445,208.001,"--We will in fact use the revenues that are derived from this, your Honor, to benefit the homeless, to help fund the various programs that--"
1988.88-293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,208.001,210.187,"Well, that's nice, but you don't have to."
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,210.187,211.053,"--That is correct, your Honor."
1988.88-293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,211.053,213.039,And Mr. Reid could come in and say the same thing.
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,215.205,217.591,"Our only purpose, your Honor, is to serve the homeless."
1988.88-293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,222.228,224.846,But that has nothing to do with this case.
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,232.5,233.952,"--That is correct, your Honor."
1988.88-293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,233.952,234.552,Okay.
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,234.552,250.312,The legal issue before the Court is whether during that seven-week period that Mr. Reid worked full-time on the Third World America project he and CCNV had an employment relationship within the meaning of the work-for-hire provisions of the 1976 Copyright Act.
1988.88-293,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,265.572,281.349,"Mr. Garrett, I take it the principle to be established, though, has far-reaching consequences and would affect software programs commissioned by a company or employer."
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,281.349,282.833,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1988.88-293,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,282.833,288.687,And written work and research that's ordered to be produced by someone.
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,288.687,289.372,"Yes, your Honor."
1988.88-293,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,466.986,474.991,"Well, Mr. Garrett, I take it the Register of Copyrights supports your... the Respondent's view here."
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,474.991,477.524,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1988.88-293,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,477.524,488.965,"And presumably there would be some deference owing, perhaps, to the Register's understanding of the copyright law?"
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,488.965,507.963,"Your Honor, as we have pointed out in our brief, for a period of almost ten years following the passage of the 1976 Copyright Act the Copyright Office agreed with our position, that it is a right-to-control standard that determines whether there is an employment relationship under the meaning of not only the 1909 Act but the 1976 Copyright Act."
1988.88-293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,536.046,540.017,"Mr. Garrett, can you tell me your proposed standard."
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,557.043,564.447,"Justice Scalia, our position is the historic test, and the historic test is a right-to-control test."
1988.88-293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,596.499,597.834,May I ask you another question?
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,609.206,613.194,"Yes, your Honor, in the sense that they both turn on concepts of right-to-control."
1988.88-293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,613.194,619.081,"But I... you see, I understand what you mean by right-to-control, the right-to-control the product."
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,675.5,677.067,"Justice Scalia, I believe you are correct."
1988.88-293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,704.634,717.575,"One would think when he uses the word ""employee"" in a statute that it would connote that brand new thing which is nothing like... which is nothing like what it means at common law."
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,717.575,729.8,"The position that we take, your Honor, is that this is not a brand new thing that is being connoted here, that this is a test of employment that had been developed under the 1909 Copyright Act and applied for a number of years by the courts."
1988.88-293,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,752.481,763.206,Do you see the Copyright Office as taking a third approach as between the court of appeals here and the Fifth Circuit on the one hand and then still the courts of appeals that you rely on?
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,763.206,763.823,"Yes, your Honor."
1988.88-293,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,805.466,832.45,"Well, most of the scholarly writers on the subject, as pointed out by the court of appeals' opinion that we're reviewing here, supported the view, and do support the view, that works made for hire within the meaning of the statutory definition are limited to salaried or like employees and do not include independent contractors even if their work is closely supervised or controlled."
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,832.45,841.556,"Well, your Honor, unfortunately the court of appeals does not point out, nor does Mr. Reid or any of his amici, that Professor Nimmer takes a quite different view."
1988.88-293,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,841.556,845.777,"Well, he stands almost alone in the scholarly writing in taking that view."
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,846.577,848.062,"I would respectfully disagree, your Honor."
1988.88-293,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,857.335,862.637,"--Of course, Nimmer is a respected... long-respected voice in the copyright field, isn't he?"
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,862.637,871.677,"He certainly is, your Honor, and this court has on other occasions certainly looked to his treatise to help understand the copyright laws."
1988.88-293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1030.311,1032.446,Why didn't they just say right-to-control?
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,1047.54,1048.023,"Well, I--"
1988.88-293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1048.023,1049.993,They could have said right-to-control... they could have said.
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,1049.993,1052.245,--They could have said formal salaried employee.
1988.88-293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1052.661,1053.028,I agree.
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,1053.028,1053.745,--have said continuous salaried--
1988.88-293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1053.745,1054.345,I agree with you that too.
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,1055.03,1055.513,--But they didn't.
1988.88-293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1066.219,1067.771,That's not what it meant in the law.
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,1072.156,1074.675,"You're correct, as a general matter, your Honor."
1988.88-293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1092.903,1110.197,"Of course, to the extent that one who pays for the work really is concerned about protecting his or her artistic contribution, I suppose that under the statutory scheme that person who hires can simply contract."
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,1122.738,1123.588,You're absolutely correct.
1988.88-293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1123.588,1125.457,And that's a very simple statutory scheme.
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,1125.457,1126.54,"You're absolutely correct, your Honor."
1988.88-293,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1217.68,1228.988,"Are you saying the right-to-control test as traditionally applied in master/servant law, workmen's compensation, that sort of thing, to define a distinction between an employee and an independent contractor?"
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,1228.988,1229.505,"--No, your Honor."
1988.88-293,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1238.344,1244.398,"Well, then you have a very difficult time with the word 1, it seems to me."
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,1244.398,1257.657,"--Well, our position, your Honor, is that the term 1909 Copyright Act to encompass this right-to-control test, a right to artistic control, a right to supervise the manner in which the work is performed."
1988.88-293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1263.061,1273.284,"Mr. Garrett, I do think that... for me, at least... it's important to your case that the word pre-76 old law, as you call it in that sense."
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,1293.747,1294.966,"Yes, sir."
1988.88-293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1294.966,1305.238,"""Underlying this distinction between"", that is, between employer/employee and commissioned products,"
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,1343.097,1349.851,"I think Varmer recognizes that there are situations in which that control is not going to be exercised, and that's why he uses the term ""generally""."
1988.88-293,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1380.555,1391.161,"I think the court of appeals, though, agreed with you that prior to 1976 the right-to-control test had predominated?"
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,1391.161,1392.28,"Yes, your Honor."
1988.88-293,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1395.898,1396.815,By the Act?
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,1396.815,1397.882,By the Act.
1988.88-293,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1414.841,1423.931,"And that standard, under the prior Act, was an interpretation of employee or employer?"
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,1425.716,1429.435,"The only word used in the 1909 Copyright Act was ""employer"", your Honor."
1988.88-293,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1429.435,1430.118,Employer.
1988.88-293,0,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,1430.118,1444.344,"The courts, however, had taught generally in terms of right... in terms of the employment relationship, as Professor Nimmer notes in his 1963-1976 versions of the Treatise on Copyright Law."
1988.88-293,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1530.8,1531.318,"Very well, Mr. Garrett."
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,1553.148,1555.517,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1620.76,1631.434,"Mr. Kaufman, how do you distinguish the test used by the Ninth Circuit in Dumas from that used by the CACC in the opinion we're reviewing?"
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,1631.434,1636.302,--I think that the Dumas test provides a greater degree of predictability.
1988.88-293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1643.158,1648.193,The Ninth Circuit would say unless you're a salaried employee... that's it?
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,1648.193,1652.181,"--It looks at Section 1, an employee within the scope of his or her employment."
1988.88-293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1664.455,1669.726,You think the Ninth Circuit would not look to the old common law of master/servant?
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,1669.726,1670.276,"--No, I do not."
1988.88-293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1679.098,1681.866,And what standard do you suggest is proper?
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,1681.866,1684.568,We believe that the Dumas test is the best standard.
1988.88-293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1686.618,1691.056,So you don't support the standard adopted by the CADC?
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,1691.056,1697.81,We believe they came to the correct conclusion and we think that it is the second-best test.
1988.88-293,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1710.351,1724.193,"Well, can you give an example of a case which would come out differently as between the D.C. and the Ninth Circuits?"
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,1724.193,1733.899,The situation where you would have someone who would be an agent but nut a salaried employee.
1988.88-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1733.899,1735.501,What about a piece worker?
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,1735.501,1764.77,"You would have a... a piece worker... under the agency which we look at respondeat superior perhaps a piece worker where they don't have FICA withholdings and you don't get some of the other benefits... but they are under the control, the ten categories of control that are set out in the restatement, you might have a situation... and probably not regularly but not infrequently... where you would not have some indicia of formal salaried employees, workmen's comp, like I said, withholding, FICA, and some of those others, but would satisfy the various control tests."
1988.88-293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1764.77,1770.591,"Mr. Kaufman, I don't really agree with you that the common meaning of employee is salaried employee."
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,1828.344,1837.366,"Well, I don't think that a formal salaried employee is... the method of payment in the sense of a salary is merely a weekly... it could be based on a long-term job."
1988.88-293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1843.02,1849.507,What about the people that your client hired to help him in... in doing this statue?
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,1871.706,1873.34,"--No, they would not be employees."
1988.88-293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1873.873,1874.575,"Well, that's very strange."
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,1874.575,1878.609,"--Under agency law they probably would, but not under the formal salaried--"
1988.88-293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1878.609,1888.049,"I think even the man in the street would consider them employees, plus the traditional legal connotation of employee."
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,1888.049,1890.584,--We think they would fall outside this definition.
1988.88-293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1890.584,1895.655,But the statute says employee within the scope of his or her employment.
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,1899.273,1899.707,Correct.
1988.88-293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1899.707,1900.89,--for your view.
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,1900.89,1906.963,You have a full-time salaried employee... let's assume they work 9:00 to 5:00 or whatever the hours are.
1988.88-293,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1906.963,1909.713,"Well, I suppose that just includes wages too, doesn't it?"
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,1909.713,1910.331,Pardon me?
1988.88-293,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1910.331,1913.217,"That just includes what would be called wages, I suppose."
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,1913.217,1914.717,"Salary would be wages, yes."
1988.88-293,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1916.235,1916.569,Okay.
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,1916.569,1917.485,They could be commissions.
1988.88-293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1920.168,1920.52,Excuse me.
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,1928.024,1928.724,--No.
1988.88-293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1943.7,1944.802,"Well, you've given me a whole new theory."
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,1953.608,1962.464,"--But if your long-term relationship with your employer is based on a piece salary, on a commissioned salary, you can be on salary and commission both."
1988.88-293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1974.272,1975.338,Including commission?
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,1975.338,1975.738,--Of course.
1988.88-293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1976.388,1977.474,"Oh, boy."
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,1977.474,1983.21,"--a commission as well as a... you know, you get paid ""x"" dollars an hour plus a commission and be a regular salaried employee."
1988.88-293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1983.593,1984.36,I thought they were opposites.
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,1989.281,1993.316,"As long as it maintains a regular type of pattern, it could be a salary."
1988.88-293,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1993.799,1997.118,I don't think you had an opportunity to finish answering justice O'Connor's question.
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,1997.118,1998.053,"That's correct, your Honor."
1988.88-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2183.034,2186.82,"You have a statement in your brief that says,"
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,2191.823,2198.643,And we believe that the Dumas court was correct in looking at it as the salaried employee.
1988.88-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2200.095,2205.149,Is that the... you can't really believe that that's the ordinary meaning of employee.

1988.88-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2209.868,2217.874,"But you're willing to go by that then, to take the ordinary meaning of the word rather than what's revealed in the hearings or something like that?"
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,2217.874,2218.391,--No.

1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,2295.807,2298.843,--If it's for a sufficient amount of time.
1988.88-293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2298.843,2304.163,"Supposing in this case, say, it takes five months to build this work of art."
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,2322.358,2324.393,It depends on the rest of the contract.

1988.88-293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2330.33,2332.082,--and we want you to prepare it the way we designed it.

1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,2418.568,2419.951,Correct.
1988.88-293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2419.951,2421.353,Don't you think the meaning of
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,2443.916,2447.068,"Under the agency law test, scope of employment has meaning."
1988.88-293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2449.103,2450.087,Under the Aldon test.

1988.88-293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2453.241,2454.324,I see.
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,2454.324,2454.674,--supervision.
1988.88-293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2457.709,2458.659,Okay.
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,2459.811,2461.361,Under our test it certainly has a meaning.
1988.88-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2464.862,2469.083,"Well, I take it that... should we be very upset about this case?"

1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,2521.385,2523.368,And so he should have if that was his intent.
1988.88-293,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2534.209,2535.593,--You're talking about Section 2 now?
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,2535.593,2536.495,Yes.
1988.88-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2556.641,2563.312,--suppose an employer and an employee could agree that the copyright would be owned by the employee?
1988.88-293,1,31292,joshua_kaufman,,2563.312,2565.58,--There are provisions for that.
1988.88-293,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2605.539,2606.605,"Thank you, Mr. Kaufman."

1988.88-293,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2769.661,2770.18,"Well, Mr. Robbins--"
1988.88-293,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2777.083,2785.605,"Well, I think, Justice Stevens, that it is... it is theoretically possible to have these categories be overlapping in part."

1988.88-293,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2789.507,2791.509,There is no question that it is linguistically possible.
1988.88-293,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2791.926,2800.115,"And if it's as clear as you say it is, the thing that I'd just like you to talk about for a minute is how is it that the Register of Copyright and Professor Nimmer got it so wrong for so many years?"
1988.88-293,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2800.115,2806.186,"--Well, let me address the subject I can address with more authority--"
1988.88-293,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2806.186,2806.736,All right.
1988.88-293,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2806.736,2809.221,--how it is that the Register of Copyrights got it wrong.
1988.88-293,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2816.441,2817.208,Six years.
1988.88-293,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2817.208,2829.401,--It is true that in response to inquiries from Congress in the mid-80s the Register of Copyrights offered a position quoting from Nimmer that is at odds with his present one.
1988.88-293,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2853.917,2857.718,"Oh, I don't question the authority of the Register to change his or her mind."
1988.88-293,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2868.676,2875.93,"Well, it wouldn't be the first time that words end up having a plain meaning as to which other people disagree."

1988.88-293,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2921.061,2921.511,--No.
1988.88-293,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2921.511,2921.861,No?
1988.88-293,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2921.861,2923.68,"Justice Scalia, I think that's not correct."
1988.88-293,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2978.564,2978.914,Well--
1988.88-293,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2978.914,2980.616,--and goes back no further than that.
1988.88-293,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2980.616,3001.18,"--The... However clear you think a commission is, the claim here in this case, and which the court of appeals certainly ruled on... the claim is that this is a work-for-hire because there was an employment relationship."

1988.88-293,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3015.69,3016.222,I know.
1988.88-293,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3031.382,3031.732,--That's--
1988.88-293,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3031.732,3035.667,We certainly have to dispose of that... rule on that claim.
1988.88-293,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3035.667,3040.471,"--Well, Justice White, we have offered what we think the correct interpretation of Subsection 1 is."

1988.88-293,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3044.792,3046.242,"--Well, we've done our best."
1988.88-293,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3047.744,3048.961,"Well, I guess we have to too."
1988.88-293,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3048.961,3049.561,But... but--
1988.88-293,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3049.561,3051.879,"Well, may I ask on that point."
1988.88-293,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3064.92,3067.805,"--No, I don't think so, Justice O'Connor."
1988.88-293,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3133.497,3149.858,"Well, they could have been so clear if they had said one... a work made for hire is, one, a work other than a special ordered or commissioned work prepared by an employee within the scope of his employment, or, two, a work specially ordered or commissioned for use, blah, blah, blah."
1988.88-293,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3152.977,3161.166,"Justice Scalia, I won't quarrel with the fact that Congress and the draftsmen could have done a better job, and maybe someday they will."
1988.88-293,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3161.166,3163.733,A better job of embodying your views.
1988.88-293,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3163.733,3164.552,I'm sorry?
1988.88-293,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3164.552,3166.652,A better job of embodying your views.
1988.88-293,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3169.17,3173.524,"Well, I think they could have done a better job of embodying their own views."
1988.88-293,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3202.843,3204.21,"Thank you, Mr. Robbins."

1988.88-293,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3253.526,3259.847,That depends on what all those old cases were referring to when they said right-to-control.
1988.88-293,3,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,3265.4,3266.667,"That is correct, your Honor."
1988.88-293,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3267.352,3271.171,You have to assume that they're using right-to-control in the very narrow sense that you're using it.
1988.88-293,3,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,3275.273,3281.51,"--I believe that the courts were using it, your Honor, in the various cases that we cite in our brief in the sense of right-to-control the artistic production of the work."

1988.88-293,3,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,3380.121,3382.59,"But not on the work-for-hire issue, your Honor."
1988.88-293,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3382.59,3383.557,Joint?

1988.88-293,3,39340,robert_alan_garrett,,3386.292,3387.077,--which is entirely different.

1988.88-293,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3409.857,3410.359,Really?
