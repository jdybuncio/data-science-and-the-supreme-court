1995.95-232,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.618,"We'll hear argument next in Number 95-232, Henderson v. United States."
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,15.664,18.896,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, good morning, members of the Court:"
1995.95-232,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,97.539,110.458,"Well, the Rule 4(j) as I read it, Mr. Sheehy, simply says that if a complaint is not... if service is not made on a defendant within 120 days it shall be dismissed."
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,115.131,128.189,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think that the legislative history and the comments made by the advisory committee, et al. indicate that the 120 rules, there is no exception to it, and that in fact the parties have 120 days to serve--"
1995.95-232,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,128.189,132.242,"Well, and to what extent are we... do we defer to legislative history in this area?"
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,132.242,151.544,"--Your Honor, because in 1982 this particular rule was reviewed to great extent by Congress, as the Court is aware, the submission by the Court was not adopted in total by the Congress, and there was a review by the Congress and this very issue was discussed, namely, under what provisions would the 120 days be put into the rule."
1995.95-232,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,151.544,152.986,It was discussed by whom?
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,152.986,160.2,"There is a... Professor Siegel in his analysis of the rules, the advisory committee, and the judicial conference."
1995.95-232,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,195.924,199.567,"Well, how does that bear on how we read a written rule?"
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,199.567,218.961,"--Well, my point exactly is that the rule itself says, and I think the Government has conceded in its brief on page 20 that there's a clear implication that a party has 120 days to serve under Rule 4, that there are no exceptions for it, it's not a guideline, it's not a suggestion, but a party has 120 days, and I think--"
1995.95-232,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,218.961,240.646,"Well, but there certainly is room for another statute, which we have here in the Suits in Admiralty Act, to have a different requirement, and you can read both statutes and give effect to both, that for a suit in admiralty it has to be served forthwith, and if it's not a suit under that act, then you might have a longer time."
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,246.301,248.763,"--With all respect, Your Honor, I disagree."
1995.95-232,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,266.317,268.29,But that's not what 4(j) says.
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,268.29,269.111,--Your Honor--
1995.95-232,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,269.111,276.145,"What it says is that if a service is not made on a defendant within 120 days, it shall be dismissed."
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,279.617,282.74,"--With all respect, Your Honor, I understand the Court's position."
1995.95-232,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,294.867,297.26,"But they just weren't able to put it into words, I gather."
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,297.26,299.684,"Well, Your Honor, with all respect, I think that they did."
1995.95-232,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,311.592,315.926,"If we disagree with you on the reading, then what are you going to argue?"
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,315.926,321.332,"--Well, if you find there is no conflict, then the Rules Enabling Act probably does not apply."
1995.95-232,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,321.829,335.069,"But then that would be a question of first view for us, because the... as I understand it, the district court and the court of appeals threw it out because they said it doesn't matter what Rule 4 means, service must be made forthwith."
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,380.541,381.771,"--Your Honor, I am not aware of any."
1995.95-232,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,446.646,453.591,But I've got a question about your case that perhaps you can explain to me.
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,476.505,481.94,I think the trial counsel probably could have as a technical matter.
1995.95-232,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,494.21,496.521,But you could have in August of '93.
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,496.521,497.793,"--Well, the statute of limitations--"
1995.95-232,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,497.793,498.433,"It hadn't run yet, had it?"
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,498.433,502.787,"--Well, the statute of limitation would have run August 27 of 1993, so therefore, it was--"
1995.95-232,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,502.787,502.997,Right.
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,502.997,503.728,--It was very close.
1995.95-232,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,503.728,504.73,So on August 1 you could have done this.
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,504.73,505.761,Probably so.
1995.95-232,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,554.778,558.36,"Well, it would have been safer if he had."
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,558.36,560.253,Certainly the duplicate effort would have been safer.
1995.95-232,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,561.475,568.631,There was something else about why this was filed in Galveston rather than Houston.
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,569.272,571.905,"Your Honor, I don't think it's in the record, but if I can make a couple of comments."
1995.95-232,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,629.1,636.195,--Are there cases from this Court where we have held that the Federal rules supersede a statute?
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,636.195,637.345,"Yes, Your--"
1995.95-232,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,637.345,639.786,Or is this the first... would this be the first case?
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,639.786,648.991,--This is the first case of which I'm aware that reaches this specific issue about where you have a Federal statute dealing with service and the Rule 4 after the 1982 amendments.
1995.95-232,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,659.299,670.939,"But what about other rules, the Federal rules of Appellate Procedure, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, have any of those been deemed... or the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, because it contains the supersession provision."
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,675.073,690.252,"Well, in the class action case, and it was the American Pipe & Construction v. Utah where the Court was interpreting Rule 23, having to do with class actions, there was a question as to whether the class certification process would toll the statute of limitations of a Federal statute."
1995.95-232,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,748.654,749.786,I'll look again at American Pipe.
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,759.143,763.727,"Well, with all respect, it probably held... did not hold that there was a direct conflict."
1995.95-232,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,763.727,763.977,Yes.
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,763.977,772.144,"The Government... I'm sorry, the American Pipe had argued that, in fact, the statute required one thing, and the rule could not be used to circumvent that."
1995.95-232,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,814.283,817.054,"Counsel, may I go back to the colloquy you were just having?"
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,849.337,850.028,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-232,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,850.028,850.359,If there's a conflict.
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,850.359,855.461,"Yes, and that was going to be my next followup response to Justice Kennedy."
1995.95-232,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,905.066,917.824,"Well, may I ask, if we got that far, and I don't know that we do, section 2072 of the Rules Enabling Act refers to adoption of rules by the Supreme Court."
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,924.118,926.592,"Your Honor, there are two ways we can go at this."
1995.95-232,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,949.655,968.548,"Well, of course, normally we try to give effect to all laws passed by Congress and, as the Solicitor General argues in its brief, it is possible to interpret and apply both the Suits in Admiralty provision and the Rule 4(j) adopted by Congress."
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,968.548,968.818,--And I think--
1995.95-232,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,968.818,973.543,"In theory they can work, both be in effect at the same time."
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,973.543,980.718,--But I think they only can be in theory is if the Court rules out or determines that the 120-day requirement is effectively irrelevant.
1995.95-232,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,996.298,999.911,"Well, that just gets back to the earlier part of your argument--"
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,999.911,1000.132,--Right.
1995.95-232,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1000.132,1004.486,--where we expressed some disagreement with your reading of 4(j).
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,1004.486,1019.726,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct, and... but I think that the... that it is in my view, anyway, in the view of petitioner, it is clear that what was intended in 1982 was to have a bright line test, and there is no exception in Rule 4 for admiralty cases."
1995.95-232,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1026.839,1032.766,"But you know, we use a lot of different principles in trying to reconcile two statutes."
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,1064.941,1080.58,"--Your Honor, especially in the second, in terms of the specific versus general, if a later act covers the subject matter of the earlier act and is intended as a substitute, then that rule does not apply, and our position here--"
1995.95-232,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1080.58,1082.513,"Well, I know, but we're arguing about whether it is intended as a substitute."
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,1082.513,1082.924,--That's right.
1995.95-232,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1082.924,1094.701,"I mean, that's the conclusion that we're driving towards, and one way we reconcile conflicting statutes is to say, well, when there are two, the more specific governs."
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,1104.898,1141.192,"Yes, it does in terms of service, but my problem is, and our position is, is that Congress by... and subsequently by this Court, that by the enactment of Rule 4 and the 120-day service requirement and the specific methods by which service is allowed upon the Government, that there was a clear intent to have a uniform and comprehensive way of serving the Government, and I think that was intended to supersede any prior statutes, and I think we believe that is not only a reasonable but a compelling conclusion in light of the other policies and the other congressional intent that we have."
1995.95-232,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1153.31,1181.91,"We've got a very peculiar situation in a way created by 2072(b), I take it, because if we assume there's a conflict, if this were a rule within the meaning of 2072(b), and it's procedural, then the rule is going to prevail, whereas if it's not a 2072(b) rule, and we're going to treat it as a congressional statute, we'd say that it wouldn't prevail, and that would be very odd to say that if it's a mere rule of this Court it prevails over the statute, but a specific act of Congress wouldn't."
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,1181.91,1185.674,I never would designate rules by this Court as mere rules--
1995.95-232,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1185.674,1186.335,"No, I don't--"
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,1186.335,1186.756,--but I think either way--
1995.95-232,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1186.756,1189.187,--I'll take care of the adjectives.
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,1189.187,1191.818,"--Either way, though, I think the petitioner prevails."
1995.95-232,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1191.818,1205.529,"But it would be very strange if we said that a rule of this Court would prevail over the statute by virtue of 2071(b), but an intentionally enacted rule by Congress, i.e., one having kind of prime statutory force, wouldn't."
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,1209.785,1208.773,"Yes, sir."
1995.95-232,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1229.97,1237.456,"When you're talking about congressional history, would you be very precise about what written documents you're relying on?"
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,1237.456,1238.047,"--Yes, sir."
1995.95-232,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1245.733,1248.745,"Now, where do... how do we deduce that?"
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,1248.745,1250.167,I think that comes from the language of section--
1995.95-232,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1250.167,1250.367,From--
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,1250.367,1252.08,--743 of the statute.
1995.95-232,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1252.08,1253.522,--From the language of the statute itself.
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,1253.522,1274.897,"Yes, sir, the Suits in Admiralty Act, and I think I would also point out that this Court has addressed at length the history of the Suits in Admiralty Act, the Shipping Act back in 1916 in prior court opinions, and so I'm not going to go through those in any great detail, but the Court has discussed all of these histories together, because issues having to do with the Public Vessels Act, et cetera, has arisen before the Court."
1995.95-232,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1305.425,1307.518,But that didn't change the forthwith requirement.
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,1307.518,1308.228,"No, sir, it didn't."
1995.95-232,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1308.889,1314.635,"Are you suggesting that the forthwith requirement, it tends not to have suits decided on the merits?"
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,1314.635,1315.823,"--Yes, sir, I do."
1995.95-232,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1315.823,1329.324,"Well then, why do you rely on something that was enacted in 1960 that conceivably... that, really, demonstrably did not change the forthwith requirement, to say we want suits decided on the merits?"
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,1332.837,1341.683,"No, Your Honor, but I think it is clear... I think that is an intent of Congress that has not changed, and I don't think it's an intent of this Court that has changed."
1995.95-232,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1344.705,1345.266,"Well, what do you think the--"
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,1345.266,1345.496,--rather than technical aspects.
1995.95-232,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1345.496,1348.859,--What was the intent of Congress when it passed the forthwith requirement?
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,1348.859,1350.972,"Your Honor, I think it is very unclear as to what it was."
1995.95-232,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1358.218,1365.754,"Well, you would agree, I take it, that that tends to... in fact, your argument is that that tends to determine that suits won't be decided on their merits."
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,1365.754,1366.185,"--Yes, sir."
1995.95-232,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1366.185,1370.488,So we have one act of Congress that says suits won't be decided on their merits.
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,1370.488,1377.892,I think we have a provision of an act of Congress that was passed in 1920 that does cast doubt on whether cases will be decided on the merits.
1995.95-232,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1401.34,1402.952,It didn't come out of the blue.
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,1427.839,1450.616,"--But I think as a natural result of the forthwith requirement there was a recognition that the forthwith requirement gave rise to situations where the cases were dismissed short of the merits because of an uncertainty as to what forthwith meant, and there is a... the second half of this is, there is a disagreement and a misunderstanding as to the very definition of forthwith."
1995.95-232,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1486.712,1489.825,"Well, that's just saying that it's a bad statute, I mean, I guess, isn't it?"
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,1491.825,1492.836,Because I believe--
1995.95-232,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1492.836,1502.764,"The decision is whether the earlier statute prevails or the later rule, and to say that the earlier statute is a bad statute doesn't affect me as to whether it should prevail."
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,1505.725,1514.444,"--Leaving aside, and agreeing, perhaps, with the implicit understanding that it's a bad statute, that is not our position, that simply because it's bad this Court has the authority or the right to overturn it."
1995.95-232,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1540.46,1547.903,"At what point in time, because the admiralty rules didn't come under the civil rules until relatively recently."
1995.95-232,0,40492,richard_a_sheehy,,1547.903,1565.027,"I think the safest position for petitioner is, it would have been after 1982, because we have not only the 1966 amendments, which unified admiralty and the civil rules, but then in 1982, for the first time we have, in our view, an express time limitation on service of process on the Government, which is 120 days."
1995.95-232,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1568.039,1569.1,"Very well, Mr. Sheehy."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1569.911,1575.204,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-232,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1594.076,1598.601,"Well, now, is service of process a matter of procedure, do you suppose?"
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1598.601,1602.965,In think as a general matter service of process would be more procedural than substantive.
1995.95-232,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1603.486,1619.357,"What about the requirement, for instance, in Suits in Admiralty Act 742, that a copy must be sent by registered mail to the Attorney General as opposed to the Rule 4 provision that it can be by registered or certified mail."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1619.357,1624.322,--We would say that that's a provision as to which we think certified mail would be acceptable in this day and age.
1995.95-232,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1624.812,1633.387,"And you would say that that's a matter of procedure and that the Rule 4 supersedes there, or what?"
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1633.387,1634.358,"--Well, we would say it's a matter of procedure."
1995.95-232,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1634.589,1635.079,How do we get there?
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1635.079,1636.881,--I think the analysis is a little bit more complicated.
1995.95-232,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1643.276,1649.74,"All right, but let's focus for a minute on the registered mail or certified mail, where you can see a conflict."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1649.74,1670.055,"And the next question would be whether the application of the Federal rule to an action against the Government would have the effect of abridging or enlarging substantive rights or expanding or diminishing the jurisdiction of the district court, and we think that in this day and age, certified and registered mail are practical equivalents for the purposes for which this requirement was designed."
1995.95-232,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1675.009,1681.774,"Well, would you look to section 2072 of the Rules Enabling Act to say that the rule prevails?"
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1681.774,1682.555,--I think we would.
1995.95-232,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1683.817,1685.787,Even though it wasn't adopted by the court.
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1685.787,1686.208,--That's correct.
1995.95-232,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1697.387,1703.811,"Well, if that's the case, then how about the time for notifying the United States?"
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1706.664,1719.672,"I think it is procedural, but again, the first question is whether there's a conflict, and in saying that 2072(b) in our view governs the interpretation of these statutes, we want to make clear that we regard this as a concession rather than an affirmative claim."
1995.95-232,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1755.266,1760.812,"Mr. Stewart, let me ask you about the Government's contention that there is no conflict here."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1768.889,1769.28,--That's correct.
1995.95-232,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1769.28,1769.73,Is that correct?
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1783.999,1795.097,"Well, the district courts have local rulemaking authority under 2071... 28 U.S.C. 2071, which says that the district courts may make local rules not inconsistent with the--"
1995.95-232,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1795.097,1795.328,That's right.
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1795.328,1795.838,--the Federal rules.
1995.95-232,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1795.838,1803.375,"And you say that such a rule requiring service to be made within 30 days, for example, instead of 120 is not inconsistent with rule--"
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1803.375,1804.937,"Well, we would say it's not in conflict with."
1995.95-232,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1828.644,1836.449,"--But Mr. Stewart, if we go on that, it seems to me you're just saying Hanna & Plumer is not at all relevant here."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1860.078,1871.677,"--Well, first of all, the Court in Hanna v. Plumer didn't rely on the language which says that laws in conflict with the Federal rules are of no further force and effect and, indeed, it didn't frame the inquiry as whether a rule that--"
1995.95-232,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1871.677,1874.349,"Well, of course it couldn't because it was dealing with a State law, not a Federal law."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1874.349,1875.771,"--That's correct, and I think the inquiry--"
1995.95-232,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1875.771,1886.818,"So the question was, is it a procedural question or a substantive question, and the court's position I thought was, if the rule covers it, it governs procedure in the Federal courts."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1886.818,1903.952,"--Well, I think the question whether a particular State rule should be incorporated into Federal practice is a fundamentally different one from the question of whether a Federal statute passed by Congress specifically intended to regulate the filing... the service of complaints in the Federal courts should be of no further force and effect."
1995.95-232,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1916.48,1916.99,Mr.--
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1939.928,1940.457,No.
1995.95-232,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1940.457,1942.329,So it is one of a kind.
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1942.329,1943.228,That's correct.
1995.95-232,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1943.228,1956.507,"Mr. Stewart, do you know of any cases in the district courts or the courts of appeals in which the 120-day requirement has been read as you have read it, as being merely an outer limit rather than as establishing a right?"
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1956.507,1987.947,"Well, there... I remember reading one district court case in which the plaintiff raised both title VII and State law claims, and the complaint was served within 120 days, but the district court held that it had not been served... the plaintiff had not exercised diligence in filing the suit as promptly as it could have... in serving the complaint as promptly as it could have been filed, and held that the lack of diligence was dispositive as to dismissal of the State law claim but not as to the Federal law claim."
1995.95-232,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1987.947,1995.983,"Leaving a State law claim aside, then, I take it your theory has never recommended itself to any lower court."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1995.983,1999.416,"Well, the lower court simply haven't passed on this question one way or the other."
1995.95-232,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1999.416,2000.465,But why would it be?
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2091.449,2121.149,"Well, it was certainly the case in 1920, and I think it is still to some extent the case, though not as greatly, that admiralty cases are different in the sense that the witnesses are ordinarily likely to be seamen, they may be transient, they may take off at a moment's notice, it's a little bit more difficult to put your case together after the fact, and Congress had that evidence before it in 1920, and the question of whether changes in the modern world have made that notion superfluous is really one for Congress rather than for--"
1995.95-232,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2121.149,2127.412,"Well, is there any indication that their reason for passing this word forthwith was other than what I said?"
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2159.515,2159.775,--Well--
1995.95-232,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2159.775,2161.838,What's your view of it?
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2161.838,2169.664,"--Under the old rules, it did not follow automatically upon service of a libel in personam in admiralty, that the person would be arrested."
1995.95-232,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2220.104,2228.81,I was going to ask you if the Justice Department had ever recommended that Congress put the courts out of their misery by repealing this statute.
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2234.856,2237.229,"Well, I don't know that we've made a recommendation one way or the other."
1995.95-232,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2238.719,2240.431,It is a trap for the attorneys.
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2240.752,2242.675,"--Well, we would disagree with that."
1995.95-232,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2256.385,2268.522,"--Well, Mr. Stewart, would you answer my question, since I think it is relevant to whether it is a trap or not, suppose on August 1st, counsel said, I see I'm running into this technical problem."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2281.294,2282.085,That could have been done.
1995.95-232,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2282.085,2293.593,"So this is... it's not a case about actual notice, because there was timely notice to the Attorney General, right, so it's only the local U.S. Attorney."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2293.593,2294.244,That's correct.
1995.95-232,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2294.244,2297.837,When did the United States have actual notice of this lawsuit?
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2297.837,2305.71,"Well, I suppose you would say that when the Attorney General's Office received the complaint, that the Government as a Government had notice, and that was in May of 1993."
1995.95-232,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2305.71,2321.982,"So we're not talking about actual notice to the U.S. We're talking about something that could have been cured by withdrawing one complaint and filing another, no substantive difference, and yet the United States is insisting that this is somehow under subject matter jurisdiction."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2323.595,2336.852,"Well, again, part of your question, in essence, goes to the wisdom of requiring plaintiffs in suits against the United States to serve both the United States and the Attorney General, and a plausible argument could be made that service on the Attorney General should be good enough."
1995.95-232,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2342.658,2343.429,I wasn't questioning that.
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2369.057,2376.35,"--I mean, that is not the way it's done even under... where Federal Rule 4(j), or now 4(m), is the only requirement."
1995.95-232,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2400.702,2403.454,"Well, what does the Government gain that a private party wouldn't gain?"
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2412.991,2424.398,"--I think in part it's the idea that, because it's the Government, there are an enormous number of potential suits filed against us, and consequently an increased desire for expeditious resolution of each one, but I think--"
1995.95-232,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2424.398,2424.769,"But I mean, why?"
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2432.295,2448.336,"--And I think... I think perhaps the stronger argument for making a different rule for the United States would be that every, potential maritime defendant has this interest to some degree, but as to suits against private parties, it may often be impracticable to locate a defendant immediately."
1995.95-232,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2448.336,2451.619,"Yes, but of course, the United States has the same interest in all the litigation against it."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2454.671,2454.881,I mean--
1995.95-232,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2454.881,2456.944,--Justice O'Connor... may I just get this one out first.
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2470.958,2472.4,--We didn't say it wouldn't conflict.
1995.95-232,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2478.687,2483.419,"But the certified doesn't, either, because that's just a broader permission in the same way that 120 days is."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2483.419,2485.05,"Well, the certified mail I think is a closer question."
1995.95-232,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2485.301,2488.784,I don't see how you can reconcile your inconsistent positions here.
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2488.784,2499.771,"--The provision in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure say... says that the Attorney General shall be served by registered or certified mail, and I think we could plausibly read that as conferring--"
1995.95-232,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2499.771,2502.492,"Well, it also says they shall be served within 120 days."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2503.684,2510.258,"--No, actually the Federal rule... Rule 4(j) doesn't say the complaint shall be served within 120 days."
1995.95-232,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2516.656,2519.878,It certainly requires service within 120 days.
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2519.878,2520.626,--It certainly provi--
1995.95-232,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2520.626,2526.222,"So that if the earlier statute had said, you can serve in 130 days, it clearly would have been in conflict."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2526.222,2537.08,"--That's exactly right, and when petitioner's counsel, Mr. Sheehy, says that Rule 4(j) admits of no exceptions for particular categories of cases, we quite agree."
1995.95-232,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2567.866,2572.57,"I just also want to be clear, is a complaint served within 20 days served forthwith?"
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2572.57,2575.752,I think there is no categorical answer to that question.
1995.95-232,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2576.753,2581.528,"It clearly is under... the plain language, certainly forthwith doesn't mean 20 days, does it?"
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2581.528,2581.678,--I would agree.
1995.95-232,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2581.999,2583.481,It has to be within 48 hours--
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2583.481,2588.286,"--Well, we would say that forthwith means as quickly as practicable, and--"
1995.95-232,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2588.286,2589.835,"--Well, certainly you can always do it the same day."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2589.835,2591.888,--Certainly almost always.
1995.95-232,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2592.499,2595.551,"So those cases that have allowed 30 days, or 40 days, they're all wrong."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2595.551,2597.875,"--Well, we think that they... there are not--"
1995.95-232,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2597.875,2598.922,They were not faithful to the rule.
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2598.922,2599.964,--There are not a lot of cases.
1995.95-232,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2609.384,2615.598,"Not what they should take, what they are required by the plain language of a statute to take... forthwith."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2615.598,2627.526,"--No, I agree that as an initial matter we would say in virtually every case it would be practicable for plaintiff's counsel to serve the complaint in far less than 20 days from the date of filing."
1995.95-232,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2641.233,2644.646,"But once you acknowledge that, why couldn't the climate be, well, we ought to treat all Federal cases the same?"
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2648.382,2655.208,"Well, I think the requirement that the complaint be served forthwith... clearly, Congress was trying to do something in enacting the SAA."
1995.95-232,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2666.277,2668.891,What were those before the Federal rules?
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2668.891,2675.635,--The admiralty rules of 1844 and then of 1920 would have governed the question of service upon the United States Attorney.
1995.95-232,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2680.059,2681.439,"Well, tell me what the period was."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2688.014,2695.961,"--All the admiralty rule said that when the libel is filed with the court, the summons is given to the marshall, and the marshall serves it."
1995.95-232,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2729.579,2738.775,"Mr. Stewart, would you tell me again why it is that it doesn't have to be by registered mail, even though the provision you say governs requires that?"
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2738.775,2764.643,"I think the way we would spin it out, and certainly either link in our chain is not infallible, we would say first the question is, are they in conflict, and we would say, we would interpret the current provision of the Federal rules that permits either registered or certified mail upon the United States Attorney, or upon the Attorney General, to confer an affirmative right to use either method, equivalent to a rule that says plaintiff may serve by either registered or certified mail."
1995.95-232,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2788.251,2790.322,"Well, you could say the same thing about E-mail."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2792.415,2797.518,"Well, if it was done by E-mail it would be in prohibition of the Federal rules as well as--"
1995.95-232,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2797.518,2800.9,"Well, that's only because E-mail didn't exist when the Federal rule was written."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2811.456,2813.549,"--Well, it wouldn't be an interpretation of the statute alone."
1995.95-232,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2838.91,2863.474,"Wouldn't it help you out of this problem you have if you simply thought that later enacted statutes of Congress which specifically say that they're overturning laws to the contrary, or imply it because of the rule, do overturn laws to the contrary, and unless there is some good reason why this earlier law would be thought to survive, it doesn't."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2863.474,2865.547,We have no problem with that formulation.
1995.95-232,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2865.547,2885.6,"All right, and then the only... the reason that you've come up with for thinking that it is meant to survive is because it had to deal in part with the disappearing seamen witnesses, although that wasn't a strong enough reason for the rules makers to deal similarly with private people whom the SAA was designed to treat the Government similarly to."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2885.6,2890.264,"Well, the reason we think it survives is that first, it's in the statute and hasn't been repealed."
1995.95-232,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2890.264,2895.169,"Yes, but it's a later rule that says the later... well, you see the point."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2895.169,2905.126,"I see your point, but in our view the Suits in Admiralty Act requirement simply is not in conflict with the Federal rule, and we have to presume that Congress used that phrase for a reason."
1995.95-232,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2919.158,2922.522,"If they are in conflict, then what's the answer?"
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2922.522,2932.235,"If they are in conflict, then the old statute is superseded except to the extent that application of the Federal rule would expand or diminish the jurisdiction of the district court."
1995.95-232,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2932.235,2937.35,Doesn't the Government have a longer time to answer a complaint than a private litigant?
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2937.35,2937.58,That's correct.
1995.95-232,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2938.962,2939.653,Sixty days instead of 30?
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2939.653,2952.223,"That's correct, and you... the fact... Congress has seen fit to propound a special rule for Government defendants in admiralty cases."
1995.95-232,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2952.654,2968.366,"But Mr. Stewart, that was done before there were Federal rules, and one can understand why there are no other laws in conflict, because when the rulemakers first came up with the Federal rules, the admiralty rules were separate, so the civil rules saw that there was no other way of serving the United States."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3000.86,3001.281,--Well--
1995.95-232,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3001.281,3003.164,We don't employ too many foreign sailors.
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3003.164,3023.068,"--Well, in this case and the case of the Maritime Administration generally, they're cargo ships, and in fact the MarAd's needs as to staffing levels fluctuate greatly depending upon national emergencies or need for transport generally, so it's not the case that people employed by MarAd typically stay employed by MarAd for long periods of time."
1995.95-232,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3053.168,3053.449,"No, but that's not--"
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3058.774,3064.677,"Well, the holding in Hanna v. Plumer was that the State law would be... would not be incorporated into Federal practice, not that it was of--"
1995.95-232,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3064.677,3068.35,It meant that the Massachusetts requirement of in-hand service would not apply.
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3079.148,3093.179,"--Well, I think the crucial difference between them is that the court there was dealing with the question of whether to incorporate a State procedural rule that was intended for... primarily for use in the State courts but might also be applied in Federal courts or in diversity actions."
1995.95-232,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3093.179,3098.404,"Wasn't the consequence that the case would be out of court as untimely, if you had to follow the State procedure--"
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3098.404,3098.714,That's correct.
1995.95-232,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3098.714,3100.667,"--say it was timely, and the same thing here."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3100.667,3119.09,"The same thing is true here, except that here the consequence of petitioner's argument is that a Federal statute passed by Congress specifically to regulate service of process in the Federal courts in this particular class of cases will be held to be impliedly repealed, and we think that the Court has repeatedly cautioned that implied repeals are disfavored."
1995.95-232,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3120.041,3123.755,Repealed it except for the service by registered mail.
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3125.268,3125.949,"--Again, we think--"
1995.95-232,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3125.949,3127.418,--to test that one... yes.
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3127.418,3132.691,"--The point is, we get to that... the Court could disagree with our treatment of certified mail."
1995.95-232,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3134.424,3138.567,It seems to me the Court must disagree with it in order to come out the way you want us to on the other issue.
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3138.567,3138.836,--No.
1995.95-232,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3144.079,3151.694,If we disagree with you on whether there's a conflict we would certainly have to disagree with you on the registered mail point.
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3151.694,3190.162,"--Well, I think even if you disagreed with us as to whether there was a conflict, it would still be plausible to say that the difference between... to permit certified mail in addition to registered mail would not have the effect of enlarging or diminishing the substantive rights of the parties because those two are functional equivalents for present purposes, whereas to permit a suit to go forward when the time limitation that Congress deemed important enough to include in the suits in Admiralty Act to begin with has not been complied with would have the effect of both increasing the jurisdiction of the district courts and enlarging the substantive rights of the--"
1995.95-232,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3190.162,3194.262,But then you're just backing off from your concession that it's procedural.
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3194.262,3195.504,"--No, I don't--"
1995.95-232,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3195.504,3196.294,I thought you conceded that it was.
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3196.294,3199.626,--I don't think we're... we're not backing off from the concession that it's procedural.
1995.95-232,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3212.385,3215.547,I think within the context of the rule that's what procedural means.
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3216.759,3217.67,"--Well, it--"
1995.95-232,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3217.67,3225.224,--and I guess I was just misled by your use earlier in speaking of it as concededly procedural.
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3226.105,3232.72,--I think we would analo... we would say it's procedural in the sense that it deals with the filing of documents rather than the--
1995.95-232,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3232.72,3238.853,"But in terms of what counts for the decision of this case, it's not procedural, it is substantive."
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3238.853,3244.278,"--In terms of what counts for the decision of this case, nonapplication of the forthwith service requirement would have the effect--"
1995.95-232,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3244.278,3244.938,It would.
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3244.938,3249.101,"--of expanding or diminishing substantive rights, and the court has repeatedly stated--"
1995.95-232,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3249.101,3253.235,So on that proposition you disagree totally with Judge Friendly in--
1995.95-232,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3253.235,3259.349,"--We do disagree with Judge Friendly as to that proposition, yes."
