2017.16-476,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.18,15.94,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 16-476, Christie versus NCAA, and the consolidated case, 16-477, the New Jersey Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association versus NCAA. Mr. Olson."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,15.94,50.9,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: One of the most important decisions made at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 was replacing the failed confederacy that governed states with a national government that could regulate individuals but not states. In the words of this Court in the New York case, Congress may regulate interstate commerce directly, but it may not regulate states' regulation of interstate commerce."
2017.16-476,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,50.9,60.365,"Mr. Olson, isn't that what the government does whenever it preempts state laws? It says you can't regulate."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,60.365,79.835,"When -- when the government preempts state laws, the government -- the federal government has initially taken the position or taken an action to regulate interstate commerce in some respect, and when it does that, this Court has repeatedly held, it may preempt contradictory or inconsistent state laws."
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,79.98,81.05,So what do you make of FERC?
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,81.05,81.755,Pardon?
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,81.755,88.01,"What do you make of FERC? FERC, the government gave the state a choice."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,88.01,88.56,Yes.
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,88.56,92.485,Regulate this way or don't regulate at all.
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,92.485,92.98,That's right.
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,93.04,93.94,And we won't either.
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,93.94,100.42,It gave -- it gave the states a choice in conjunction with the regulation of the area that was being --
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,100.42,102.17,"No, there were federal standards."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,102.17,102.275,Yes.
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,102.275,105.3,The states were told: Accept them or don't.
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,105.3,105.67,Yes.
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,105.67,109.555,"But if you don't, you won't regulate, neither will we."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,109.555,110.17,The --
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,110.17,111.555,So --
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,111.555,128.33,"As a matter of fact, what the consequence of that is that the -- the states could regulate according to the standards established by the federal government with respect to the regulation of interstate commerce, and if the states chose not to do that, the field was left to the federal government."
2017.16-476,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,137.61,141.035,"Well, the Airline Deregulation Act is the obvious example."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,141.035,152.38,"Yes, and the Airline Deregulation Act is a very, very good example because in that case, the Congress of the United States took a wide responsibility with respect to airline deregulation."
2017.16-476,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,161.33,162.3,"No, but suppose they hadn't."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,168.01,168.27,"Well, the --"
2017.16-476,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,168.27,174.45,"That's the federal statute, and it says, now, states, you can't regulate them and we don't regulate their prices."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,190.62,191.73,I do see the analogy.
2017.16-476,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,191.73,191.85,Okay.
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,191.99,226.03,"And the Morales case to which you're referring has -- discusses in great detail the federal regulatory scheme, which included, as a portion of the federal regulatory scheme, a preemption of the states from regulating fares, conditions of service, and that sort of thing. But -- but, Justice Breyer, that is an area -- it's a quintessential example of the federal government taking responsibility for how airlines flew in this country and deciding in certain areas, yes, it could be preempted. This statute is completely different."
2017.16-476,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,226.03,237.44,"Well, what does that mean? What would you be looking for, when you say that the federal government took responsibility? I mean, suppose that the federal government had just said we don't want states to regulate."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,249.12,257.28,I believe it is not because that is a situation where the -- where the Congress would be saying we're choosing to regulate states.
2017.16-476,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,276.74,305.35,"I guess what I'm asking, Mr. Olson, is you're suggesting that the federal government, in order to preempt state activity, has to itself enact some kind of comprehensive regulatory scheme; and the question is, you know, how -- what would we be looking for if that -- if that were our test? When do we know that they've enacted a sufficiently comprehensive regulatory scheme in order to allow preemption of state rules?"
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,305.35,327.44,"The only thing that I would say in response as a predicate to answering your question is that when you say ""sufficiently comprehensive,"" to the extent that the state -- the federal government, Congress, has taken responsibility to regulate in that field, once it has done so, it can then preempt, under the Supremacy Clause, inconsistent or contradictory state laws."
2017.16-476,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,342.68,348.36,And -- and it doesn't even have to be inconsistent if the federal government occupies the whole field.
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,348.36,348.87,Yes.
2017.16-476,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,348.87,351.435,In -- like Southern Pacific versus Arizona --
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,351.435,352.23,That --
2017.16-476,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,352.23,358.9,-- a state cannot regulate the length of a -- of a freight train simply because this is reserved for the Congress.
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,375.445,422.52,"Well, first -- no, not -- I think, if I understand your question correctly, Justice Kennedy, is if Congress had taken responsibility to decide to do something about sports wagering by regulating it in some respect or taking responsibility in some respects and then it could say that, where a state is doing something that's inconsistent, then that can be preempted. But the title of this statute says it all, to -- the -- an act to prohibit sports gambling under state law, so what Congress was saying there -- and when Congress passed the statute, it had a report from the Congressional Budget Office that specifically said this will have no budgetary impact on the federal government --"
2017.16-476,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,422.52,428.995,"Can we interpret that as saying that, if you do regulate, then it will be preempted?"
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,428.995,431.15,If -- it -- it may be preempted.
2017.16-476,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,444.26,444.37,Okay.
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,444.62,447.15,-- obstructs the accomplishment of a federal objective.
2017.16-476,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,447.15,448.495,"Now, I'm seeing this, I think."
2017.16-476,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,453.125,454.71,Forget the Airline Dereg Act.
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,506.61,510.09,"I wish I'd said that myself, Justice Breyer. (Laughter.)"
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,510.09,512.17,But you did say it in New York --
2017.16-476,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,512.17,513.42,"Yeah, I'm trying to get your argument."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,513.42,513.63,Yes.
2017.16-476,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,514.91,515.67,Is that your argument?
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,515.67,516.87,That is my argument.
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,543.04,543.99,"May I ask you, is this a commercial --"
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,543.99,545.04,-- appears in earlier cases.
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,545.04,545.29,-- is this --
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,545.29,547.01,It goes back to 1911 in the Coyle case.
2017.16-476,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,547.01,547.79,I got it.
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,548.79,561.48000005,"Mr. Olson, is this a commercial activity by the state? If it's licensing casinos and horse racing, isn't it involved in a commercial activity?"
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,561.48000005,571.92,"Certainly, it is a commercial activity when -- when govern -- when state -- individuals are engaged in betting on sports, having a sports book --"
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,571.92,574.51,Why isn't it when the state is licensing that?
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,574.51,575.42,It -- it doesn't change --
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,575.42,576.7,It's making money from the license.
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,576.7,580.245,It doesn't change the character of the underlying activity.
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,589.2,591.595,"Well, I have never understood gambling not to be."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,600.205,601.77,"Yes, there's no question --"
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,601.77,612.78,"So if it -- if it is a commercial activity by the state, haven't we already said that the federal government can regulate that activity by the state?"
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,612.78,613.47,Yes.
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,614.12,628.22,"So why is it that telling the states that it can't license, participate in, authorize, or otherwise involve itself in gambling a strict prohibition of a commercial actor?"
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,628.22,647.495,"It's a -- it's -- the question is interstate commerce, and, yes, just as the language in the New York case, which I just quoted, Congress may regulate that field. If it does regulate that field, which Congress has not chosen to do in this case, it then can preempt inconsistent state laws."
2017.16-476,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,648.33,655.04,"Mr. Olson, you -- you have not challenged 3702 subsection (2), have you?"
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,655.04,658.14,370 -- subsection (2) is simply a counterpart to subsection (1).
2017.16-476,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,658.14,659.955,But you didn't challenge it?
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,659.955,665.95,"We -- we challenged the entire statute, but we were not sued under that section."
2017.16-476,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,689.54,694.76,"But -- but by its -- by its terms, though, subsection (2) operates on the individuals and not the state."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,694.76,704.655,"Only -- only if individuals operate pursuant to law, which means pursuant to the state law, which is referred to in subsection (1)."
2017.16-476,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,725.86,739.76,"One part of subsection (1), it seems, is -- is not challenged either, and that's the ban on the state itself operating gambling casinos."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,739.76,789.605,"This -- this would be something similar, Justice Ginsburg, to the Reno versus Condon case or the South Dakota -- I mean, South Carolina versus Baker case, where the federal government chose to enact a law of general application to -- that applied to private parties engaged in interstate commerce on -- and applied the same law to the states when the states were engaged as a market participant in the same -- to the same degree as interstate commerce -- in -- in interstate commerce. So, to the extent that Congress had initially decided to regulate this area and put itself into the field of regulating private persons engaged in activity, it could then address the states if the states choose to engage in the same activity."
2017.16-476,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,789.605,813.04,"So, if you took this statute and you take the prohibition on private parties and you can have a comparable prohibition on the state, what do you accomplish by knocking out the ""authorized by,"" if you have two parts that are not constitutionally infirm and they achieve almost the same thing?"
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,813.04,824.17,"It would be constitutionally infirm, Your Honor, had -- because the state -- because the Congress didn't attempt to regulate interstate commerce directly."
2017.16-476,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,838.71,840.32,"Well, this is pretty comprehensive."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,845.42,846.2,"Yes, it's --"
2017.16-476,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,846.2,852.89,And so I don't know whether it's -- you seem to be saying that they can't regulate it if the regulation is going to be a total ban.
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,852.89,853.35,No.
2017.16-476,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,853.35,857.105,But that -- that's -- it's -- that's very comprehensive.
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,857.105,857.79,No.
2017.16-476,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,908.53,908.98,Mr. Olson --
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,908.98,912.515,It also said in the Senate report it won't have any regulatory impact.
2017.16-476,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,912.515,940.24,"So suppose I read these cases as setting up a principle that the federal government can't conscript state officials for its own purposes, you know, the federal government can -- does whatever it wants, consistent with the Commerce Clause, but it can't conscript state officials in order to do -- help them -- help the federal government do it. If that's the way I see these cases, what's being -- who is being conscripted in order to do what here?"
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,940.24,946.27,What is -- it's both conscription and the Court uses the word commandeering and directing the states.
2017.16-476,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,946.27,946.39,"Yeah, so --"
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,946.39,949.51,"All of those terms, all of those verbs are applied in this."
2017.16-476,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,967.74,976.91,"I mean, just the way you say that, Mr. Olson -- the federal government is saying to the states you can't do something -- so that sounds to me the language of preemption."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,986.745,1028.515,"It is so fundamental in the -- at the Constitutional Convention and as -- and discussed in most detail in the New York case, that the difference is that in those circumstances where Congress has taken the step of regulating commerce, it can preclude state efforts that interfere with that or conflict with that. But when it sets out at the initiative, at -- at the -- at the first stage of -- of regulating the legislature, here we have a situation where a court has ordered, pursuant to my opponents' briefs, ordered, told New Jersey, you can't repeal a statute that you've tried to repeal."
2017.16-476,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1029.91,1052.195,"So do you see no difference between the federal government saying to a state, look, you can't take some preferred policy option that you would like to take, and, on the other hand, the federal government saying to a state, you must help us do something? Because I thought that our cases were all about the second thing."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1069.73,1071.66,New Jersey -- in many ways.
2017.16-476,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1095.02,1127.635,"Mr. Olson, may I -- may I just ask you to qualify that can't -- ""must enforce?"" Because the Third Circuit, the first time around, said each state is free to decide how much of a law enforcement priority it wants to make of sports gambling. So there's no -- there's not going to be a federal prosecution if the state says we got -- we have other things to do that are more important than -- than casino gambling or sports gambling."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1127.635,1131.46,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, the court said that."
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1189.4,1189.83,I'm sorry.
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1193.78,1196.91,"It -- no, it says that the repeal --"
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1196.91,1197.505,Well --
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1197.505,1198.7,-- must be reversed --
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1198.7,1205.235,"If -- if a act is unconstitutional, those laws basically go by the wayside no matter what."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1212.56,1213.29,"No, it doesn't."
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1217.43,1223.86,"Mr. Olson, if every governor enforced every law on the book, the state would be more than bankrupt."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1226.065,1227.14,I understand that.
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1227.14,1233.48,"There are countless laws, and even laws that are in force, that are not enforced totally."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1233.48,1234.39,I understand --
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1234.39,1236.355,States make choices all the time.
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1236.355,1236.93,Yes.
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1240.27,1243.795,There is nothing here telling this state that it has to enforce this law.
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1243.795,1254.28,"If -- if there's an order from a federal court saying that the legislature, having repealed a statute, must un-repeal it, put it back on the books."
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1277.84,1291.53,"What's the difference between that and this law is unconstitutional? This law is preempted or just a simple ruling by the court, this law is preempted? Period, end of story."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1291.53,1293.22,This was a repeal.
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1293.22,1301.745,"If -- if -- if, as I said, the court had simply said this is preempted."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1301.745,1322.36,"And what this -- what the ""this"" is in your question is a repeal of a prohibition of sports betting, which means the repeal that the legislature carefully did in response to the Third Circuit's decision and the government and the leagues both saying you may repeal any law you wish --"
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1322.36,1363.605,"I have three ways of looking at this case or of the issues here. The first way is to say that this is a repeal, which it seems you're arguing, and you're saying to us does or does not this statute permit a repeal? And if I say it permits repeals of all kinds, partial or complete -- partial or not partial, we avoid the constitutional question because then you could do whatever kind of repeal you want. The second way to look at this is that the statute does not prevent repeals at all. That's what you're arguing right now."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1391.67,1400.52,"Yes, because the effect of the statute is to prohibit New Jersey -- the statute was intended to ban sports --"
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1400.52,1401.06,That's the second --
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1401.06,1401.23,-- betting.
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1401.23,1402.425,-- that's the second.
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1404.64,1410.485,"No, this is -- this is a one way, and I submit the only way, of looking at the statute."
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1418.82,1419.42,That's my second way.
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1419.42,1420.33,-- sports betting is --
2017.16-476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1420.33,1420.97,That's my second way.
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1420.97,1423.035,-- taking place under state law.
2017.16-476,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1437.09,1437.28,Mr. --
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1437.28,1437.57,-- all the --
2017.16-476,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1437.57,1448.72,"-- Mr. Olson, you -- you did make the argument below that there was no authorization because the statute didn't regulate how sports betting would take place. You've abandoned that argument on a statutory interpretation ground."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1448.72,1449.02,"Well, we didn't --"
2017.16-476,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1449.02,1450.565,"And I'm curious, why?"
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1450.565,1457.83,We only were responding to a -- arguments by our opponents and a Third Circuit decision that says --
2017.16-476,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1457.83,1464.12,"But -- but -- but, we normally -- we normally interpret statutes in ways to avoid constitutional difficulties, not in ways to create them."
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1464.12,1464.54,Yes.
2017.16-476,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1491.54,1493.72,"But you -- you'd take a win on statutory grounds, wouldn't you?"
2017.16-476,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1493.72,1504.16,"We would take the win except, Your Honor, the consequence of that is that we would have a statute intending to prohibit the spread of sports betting."
2017.16-476,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1533.42,1540.855,"Thank you, Mr. Olson. Mr. Clement."
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1540.855,1574.67,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: PASPA does three basic things: First, it tells the states that they may not themselves operate or advertise sports gambling schemes, such as a sports-based lottery or a sports book. Second, it tells private parties, in 3702(2), that they may not operate or advertise a sports gambling scheme pursuant to state law. And, thirdly, it tells states that they may not authorize or license third parties to conduct those sports gambling schemes that would violate federal law."
2017.16-476,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1574.67,1575.26,Mr. Clement --
2017.16-476,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1575.26,1578.055,But it does so by this mechanism.
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1593.145,1597.615,"No, Justice Kennedy, we don't think PASPA operates in that way."
2017.16-476,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1618.9,1621.99,"But the -- the partial repeal is forbidden, correct?"
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1621.99,1624.165,This partial repeal is forbidden.
2017.16-476,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1624.165,1624.695,Correct.
2017.16-476,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1624.695,1625.31,Mr. --
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1625.31,1627.1,"This partial repeal, but think about how strange --"
2017.16-476,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1627.1,1630.705,What -- what partial -- what partial repeals are not forbidden? What could the state do?
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1630.705,1640.35,"Well, first of all, I think it's important to recognize that what PASPA regulates -- and it does regulate it quite comprehensively -- is the operation of sports gambling schemes."
2017.16-476,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1658.54,1667.12,"Could a state enact a law -- I mean, the federal government enact a law saying no state shall pass an income tax greater than 6 percent?"
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1667.12,1679.71,"I -- I think it might be able to do that because I -- I -- put it this way, I mean, I don't know why in principle that would be so different from the statute at issue in Baker, which says no state shall issue a bearer bond."
2017.16-476,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1679.97,1681.145,No state shall issue?
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1681.145,1682.29,A bearer bond.
2017.16-476,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1698.62,1713.795,"Well, it seems to me that there would be something a little more odd about it, which is it goes to the fundamental powers and prerogatives of a state to sort of function their own -- own government, if you say you can go so far as to regulate what level of income tax they can charge."
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1713.795,1715.09,"Well, you're right, Mr. Chief Justice."
2017.16-476,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1734.04,1734.13,Well --
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1734.13,1735.685,-- it's a National League of Cities problem.
2017.16-476,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1737.63,1741.11,"Well, you could imagine a situation where it's the same kind of commandeering."
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1759.79,1762.37,"Again, I don't think that's a commandeering problem."
2017.16-476,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1775.01,1779.81,The Chief's -- the Chief's hypothetical indicates that this blurs political accountability.
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1786.85,1793.17,"And precisely in New York, this Court said there's not an accountability problem with preemptive legislation."
2017.16-476,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1793.17,1793.56,If it's for --
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1793.56,1801.46,"And I do think it's worth -- I -- I'm -- just to finish the point, I mean, I do think it's worth recognizing that you have three pieces, three legs of the stool, if you will."
2017.16-476,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1813.4,1822.80999995,Are there other statutes that rely on -- on prohibition of state action without an accompanying federal policy?
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1822.80999995,1825.26,"Justice Kennedy, I don't know that there are."
2017.16-476,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1854.74,1855.53,Isn't it enough just to say --
2017.16-476,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1855.53,1856.34,It's a certain kind --
2017.16-476,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1856.34,1866.31,"Isn't it enough just to say it's illegal for entities, people or otherwise, to engage in gambling on sports events? That would be the federal government regulating this area."
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1873.53,1877.825,"And -- and, Mr. Chief Justice, I think, at the end of the day, that's what PASPA does."
2017.16-476,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1904.89,1909.33,"But, that's a very odd way -- that's a very -- and this is, of course, subsection (2)."
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1914.14,1914.81,"But, Mr. Chief --"
2017.16-476,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1914.81,1919.47,"In other words, if the state law says you can do it, that's the only situation in which it's illegal."
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1922.67,1940.08,"But, Mr. Chief Justice, that's why I think the oddity goes away entirely if you understand that before Congress passed PASPA, it was already unlawful as a matter of federal criminal law for a private party to operate a sports gambling scheme in violation of state law, so, in a sense --"
2017.16-476,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1940.08,1941.61,In violation of state law.
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1941.83,1942.9,In violation of state law.
2017.16-476,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1942.9,1944.32,"No, go back for a second."
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2049.24,2065.57,"Well, I'll try to answer the whole thing, but I'll start with the proposition that we know there's absolutely nothing wrong with congressional legislation that operates on states as market actors. And that's what the first four prohibitions in 3702(1) plainly do."
2017.16-476,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2116.86,2122.975,"But -- but you -- you begin by saying that this is market participant as to the first three, but it's not as to the fourth."
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2122.975,2125.78,"Well, it's -- I -- I don't mean to be pedantic."
2017.16-476,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2180.07,2185.56,"Well, you seem -- you said subsection (2) is the other side of the coin of subsection (1)."
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2193.45,2205.24,"Well, I don't know if I used the phrase ""other side of the coin,"" Your Honor, but I do think that it is not just severable; I think it operates independently, and it operates without even a constitutional issue."
2017.16-476,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2205.24,2211.57,"To do the same thing, right? Because it says that it is illegal for individuals to follow state law --"
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2211.57,2211.965,Well --
2017.16-476,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2211.965,2221.35,"-- or to engage in activity protected, authorized under state law; which seems to me to be the same thing as saying states shall not authorize individuals to do that."
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2221.35,2223.29,"Well, Your Honor, a couple of points."
2017.16-476,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2274.08,2282.865,"But, Mr. Clement, how do we know that Congress would have passed (2) without (1)? (1) makes the regulation free because it says, states, you have to do this."
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2301.395,2301.78,So --
2017.16-476,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2301.78,2302.675,-- because it's free.
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2303.86,2307.74,"So -- so, Justice Gorsuch, I'd like to make two points in response to that."
2017.16-476,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2321.05,2321.95,That's neither here nor there --
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2321.95,2322.1,Okay.
2017.16-476,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2322.29,2323.61,-- for purposes of my -- my question.
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2348.03,2405.28,"So, Justice Gorsuch, if I could, I'd like to refine the question -- the -- in this way -- and you tell me if it's unfair -- but I think really the critical question is: Would Congress have wanted to have the first four prohibitions in (1) and the prohibitions in (2), if it couldn't have the ""licensed or authorized by law"" provision? I think that's the relevant question, because their constitutional argument only goes to ""licensed or authorized by law."" And I think, although all these counterfactual questions are difficult, I think this may be the easiest one that you'll ever have, because I think the statute operates almost the same way. The net effect of a statute that said that states can't sponsor, operate, advertise, promote sports gambling schemes and neither can private parties pursuant to state law; and, by the way, they can't do it in violation of state law because of other provisions -- that world, what it would mean is we should have gone for the injunction against the private parties. Which, by the way, we did in the district court."
2017.16-476,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2454.5,2455.01,One -- one --
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2455.01,2456.785,"-- tidy law-making, but it's not vital."
2017.16-476,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2456.785,2466.97,"Give me a one-sentence answer. In the Airline Deregulation Act, the Congress wanted a world, i.e., the United States, where market forces set prices."
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2473.78,2487.43,"The -- the Congress wanted there to be, putting aside the grandfather clause, no state-sponsored or -operated gambling taking place by either individuals or by the state."
2017.16-476,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2487.43,2487.58,Right.
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2504.465,2505.77,Can I amend my answer?
2017.16-476,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2505.77,2506.39,Yes. (Laughter.)
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2506.39,2516.61,"Congress -- Congress, in all of these statutes, did not want there to be sports gambling schemes operating in interstate commerce."
2017.16-476,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2516.61,2517.39,"Well, Congress could --"
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2517.39,2518.135,They were indifferent --
2017.16-476,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2518.135,2522.025,Congress could have prohibited sports gambling itself.
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2528.995,2544.39,"Two things, Justice Alito. First is: Congress could have prohibited all sports gambling; but that would have required it to regulate individuals as sports gamblers as opposed to entities, businesses that were providing sports gambling schemes --"
2017.16-476,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2544.39,2544.59,All right.
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2556.795,2582.21,"Ironically enough, Justice Alito, it actually furthers federalism values by saying: instead of having a one-size-fits-all policy, which says as a matter of federal law, everybody who operates a sports gambling scheme is going to face two years in the federal penitentiary and a fine of $10,000; this statute basically says, look, 46 states right now are more or less doing what we want, but they're doing it in 46 different ways."
2017.16-476,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2582.97,2590.44,Or -- or does it serve the interest of making it cheap by allowing Congress not to have to expend any funds to enforce its laws?
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2590.44,2608.01,"With all due respect, I don't think trying to do this on the cheap was their principal concern. As I said, as a general matter, when Congress passes a new federal statute, criminal statute, it's -- doesn't really have like, a big budgetary impact; because you don't, like, have to make like a new AUSA to enforce that statute."
2017.16-476,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2655.82,2661.11,"Mr. Clement, what -- what's the line you would draw as between preemption and commandeering?"
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2661.11,2686.12,"I would draw the line that this Court drew in New York and Printz, because it was writing its opinions against the backdrop of all sorts of preemption statutes that various parties were saying were relevant and the Court was distinguishing. I would say that, unless the Congress basically tells the states that they must regulate -- that they may, basically, pass federally-prescribed legislation, or enforce a federally -- a federal policy as in Printz --"
2017.16-476,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2686.12,2696.12,So what's the difference between saying you must pass a certain piece of legislation and saying you must maintain a piece of legislation on the books?
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2696.12,2703.16,"I -- I don't think that there is a distinction necessarily between those two, but I don't think that's what PASPA does."
2017.16-476,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2708.63,2709.935,How is it different from that?
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2709.935,2716.74,"It -- it's different about that because it basically tells the states, look, you want to repeal that prohibition, you can do that."
2017.16-476,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2748.925,2761.41,Could Congress just go through federal -- the -- the statutes of the states and pick out a long list of statutes that can't be repealed except in full?
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2761.41,2762.985,May I answer the question?
2017.16-476,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2762.985,2763.34,Certainly.
2017.16-476,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2763.34,2765.16,"No, I don't think it could do that, Justice Alito."
2017.16-476,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2797.005,2808.315,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wall."
2017.16-476,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2808.315,2815.87,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think Mr. Olson has boiled down the state's case to what I take to be his two basic arguments."
2017.16-476,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2918.97,2919.21,Mr. Wall --
2017.16-476,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2919.21,2920.555,They've never argued there's any --
2017.16-476,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2920.555,2939.075,"Can you go back to the basic question, and it was raised, I think, by the dissent, Judge Fuentes, who said you start this discussion from the fact that a law exists, if it's a partial or full repeal, the law doesn't exist."
2017.16-476,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2969.38,2983.72,"So I think that would be right for a lot of the things that the state would do; but when the state says, we're going to repeal our law in such a way that nobody in the state can run a sports lottery or sports book, except for the 12 state licensed casinos and racetracks that already conduct authorized gambling operations --"
2017.16-476,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2983.72,2986.36,"Well, but that's the issue that the court below avoided."
2017.16-476,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3021.615,3037.865,"So I think it's even simpler than that, Justice Sotomayor, and it gets to something Justice Gorsuch said earlier. They want to interpret the statute as barring all repeals so that they can create a constitutional problem with two words of the statute or law and leverage that to try to take down the entire thing. And our point's pretty simple."
2017.16-476,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3049.67,3050.32,But where's the line?
2017.16-476,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3050.32,3051.11,-- there's no --
2017.16-476,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3051.11,3070.225,"The Third Circuit said de minimis private gambling isn't covered. On page 30 of your brief, you indicate maybe the state could have a certain dollar threshold, and that wouldn't be authorizing. I -- I'm really not clear why that wouldn't be authorizing if you specify a threshold dollar amount in state law."
2017.16-476,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3077.51,3095.94,"I think the only thing the Court needs to say here, Justice Gorsuch, is: in the context of PASPA, if you -- or whatever -- however the state get -- gets there, legislating up, legislating down, amendment, repeal, enact, it doesn't matter -- if what it's doing is channeling sports gambling to particular preferred -- state-preferred providers, that's an authorization."
2017.16-476,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3095.94,3098.57,"But we have no record about that, as Justice Sotomayor points out."
2017.16-476,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3108.55,3116.735,"Justice Gorsuch, I don't think it's a record question. I think it's, look, in the 2012 law, they affirmatively said, we're going to let only the casinos and racetracks do it."
2017.16-476,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3124.84,3154.5,"I'm sorry, but the earlier version actually explicitly licensed -- it explicitly licensed and set up a complete operation requirements and other things. That -- I don't think they would have had a snowball's chance to say that that wasn't licensing or -- or effectively operating. But here, what they're saying is there were no laws -- there's a law prohibiting all gambling, we're now going to repeal part of it and say some gambling is okay."
2017.16-476,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3155.99,3199.88,"Justice Sotomayor, unless what the Court wants to say is no repeal can be an authorization, even if New Jersey took away its prohibition only at the Borgata -- which would provide a roadmap, I think, for flouting the Supremacy Clause; because then you could just enact a prohibition and peel it back wherever you wanted. Unless the Court is prepared to say that a repeal can never be an authorization, which I think would elevate form over substance, this particular repeal is -- and -- and I think all the Court needs to say is, for PASPA purposes, if you're channeling to particular entities, here, 12 state-licensed casinos and racetracks, that's an authorization. And read in that way, there's no constitutional problem; because it requires affirmative conduct by the state to enable -- it's no longer a conscription, we're not telling them they have to maintain anything, the state, it can sit there and do nothing, and it's perfectly compliant."
2017.16-476,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3200.3,3204.195,"But what if the repeal -- what if the repeal is across the board, no exceptions?"
2017.16-476,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3204.195,3208.155,"If New Jersey just repeals its prohibitions, we have said we don't have a problem with that."
2017.16-476,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3208.155,3217.47,"Well, is that serious? You have no problem if there's no prohibition at all and anybody can engage in any kind of gambling they want, a 12-year-old can come into the casino and --"
2017.16-476,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3217.47,3217.81,I -- I --
2017.16-476,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3217.81,3218.85,-- you're not serious about that.
2017.16-476,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3218.85,3220.89,"I -- I'm very serious about it, Mr. Chief Justice."
2017.16-476,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3231.58,3236.36,"Well, but when you put the state in a position that that's the only thing they can do, that's not a real choice."
2017.16-476,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3236.36,3237.75,"Oh, it's not the only thing they can do."
2017.16-476,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3250.62,3251.02,But the government --
2017.16-476,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3251.02,3252.28,-- that Congress may have assumed Mr. --
2017.16-476,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3252.28,3266.63,"-- but the government -- Mr. Wall, the last time around, the government did say, in recommending that we deny cert, that PASPA does not require New Jersey to retain prohibitions it adopted pre-PASPA."
2017.16-476,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3279.695,3280.55,No.
2017.16-476,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3355.09,3366.79,"You're saying this is authorization, not a repeal, because it's limited to the casinos, which probably have all kinds of other rules and regulations, 9:00 a.m. opening and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah."
2017.16-476,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3373.54,3374.125,Exactly.
2017.16-476,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3374.125,3374.41,Okay.
2017.16-476,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3374.41,3388.07,"If you're trying to figure out what constitutes an authorization to operate a sports gambling scheme, any law that says everybody can't do it, except for you two or three, that's an authorization. And it doesn't matter whether the state gets there by legislating up or down, because it's substance over form."
2017.16-476,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3388.07,3388.22,All right.
2017.16-476,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3412.78,3439.33,"I think that is their argument, but I think it doesn't make sense for the simple reason Mr. Clement gave. Baker would not have been different if, in addition to having a prohibition on states and individuals, it had said states are preempted if they try to authorize private conduct that's separately barred by the Act. If this Court finds that to be a latent commandeering violation, the government would respectfully submit it's going to spend an awfully long time figuring out how to unblur the clear line between preemption and commandeering."
2017.16-476,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3439.33,3442.675,"Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Olson."
2017.16-476,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3442.675,3445.365,"Thank you, Your Honor. May it please the Court:"
2017.16-476,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3445.365,3450.01,"If I've got your argument right just now, just say yes. Otherwise forget it."
2017.16-476,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3450.01,3451.62,You had it right before. (Laughter.)
2017.16-476,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3451.62,3455.62,"No, but I had it right just now? Okay, you weren't -- forget it. Forget it."
2017.16-476,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3456.51,3460.535,"Mr. Olson, I do have a question following up on what the Chief asked earlier."
2017.16-476,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3480.845,3482.43,"Well, I don't know where it stands."
2017.16-476,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3485.22,3490.59,"No, but you argued to us that no state legislature would do that. But here we have --"
2017.16-476,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3490.59,3490.71,I --
2017.16-476,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3490.71,3494.34,-- two have -- two bills introduced that would do just that.
2017.16-476,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3494.34,3497.085,"Well, they have not -- they're not laws yet."
2017.16-476,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3509.61,3509.98,Why?
2017.16-476,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3509.98,3510.87,-- all limitations.
2017.16-476,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3510.87,3533.01,"Let -- let me ask you, what's so crazy about Congress perceiving that states would never want 12-year-olds to go into gambling houses and that the states would find some way of prohibiting that or living with rules of some sort of creating laws, regulations, conduct that would prohibit that sort of thing?"
2017.16-476,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3533.01,3543.73,What Congress can do is enact a statute that places restrictions on sports betting and -- and have a finely-reticulated statute.

2017.16-476,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3571.16,3574.04,"No, no, no, I'm not talking about fantasy at all."
2017.16-476,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3576.94,3580.69,There are four states that are -- are permitted to continue?
2017.16-476,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3580.69,3584.895,"Nevada -- Nevada has sports betting, and it has it regulated."
2017.16-476,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3607.05,3625.45,"So why don't we -- why don't we legalize -- this is a hypothetical -- marijuana because all of -- and all drugs, because there's a rampant market out there for those drugs, but we've made a policy choice that we don't want the state involved in promoting that type of enterprise."
2017.16-476,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3625.45,3626.08,And the federal --
2017.16-476,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3626.08,3626.83,Why is this any different?
2017.16-476,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3626.83,3634.16,The Congress of the United States enacted laws with respect to marijuana and with respect to other substances.

2017.16-476,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3734.34,3765.07,"Thank -- thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. This is -- as the federal government said on page 15 of the federal government's brief -- we are saying that state laws that attempt to change what New Jersey has done are nullified by PASPA. Anyone familiar, as this Court is, with the history of the Constitutional Convention knows that there was specifically on the agenda an opportunity for Congress to nullify state laws."
