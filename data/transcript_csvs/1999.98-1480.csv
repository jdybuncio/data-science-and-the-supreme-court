1999.98-1480,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.567,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 98-1480, Robert A. Beck v. Ronald Prupis."
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,9.947,13.35,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1480,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,82.905,88.21,"Well, he wasn't injured by the formation of the agreement, and that was the conspiracy."
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,88.21,91.72,"Yes, that's correct, he's not injured..."
1999.98-1480,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,91.72,93.843,And that's all the conspiracy was.
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,93.843,96.846,"The conspiracy itself, though, has several objects."
1999.98-1480,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,150.551,154.734,"Well, let's say that we rule against you on this point."
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,177.119,195.651,"But here, the way that the statute was drafted, Justice Kennedy, the statute itself created four separate causes of action, and this Court in Salinas defined the words, to conspire, which only appear in the statute once, as being this criminal animal."
1999.98-1480,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,195.651,198.533,"Well, that was a criminal case, was it not, Salinas?"
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,198.533,208.44,"Yes, sir, but just because those words are defined in a criminal context, they shouldn't have a different meaning in another section when that other section refers to them."
1999.98-1480,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,208.44,213.683,"Well, you say it creates four separate causes of action, but that's the issue, does it?"
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,213.683,217.544,"It is the...  well, it's the way the statute's written, though."
1999.98-1480,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,239.549,241.161,"Well, all of those were criminal acts."
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,244.812,246.184,The question here...
1999.98-1480,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,246.184,249.056,"I mean, you're just stating the conclusion when you say that."
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,249.056,258.333,"The question here, Justice Kennedy, is whether or not 1964(c) provides a civil remedy for each of those causes of action."
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,258.333,265.686,"Well, they could provide a remedy for (d) without necessarily providing a remedy that gives you recovery here."
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,314.729,315.898,"Yes, sir."
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,315.898,321.812,"Now, how has your client been harmed by the act of conspiring, directly harmed by the act of conspiring?"
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,321.812,329.089,Section 1964(c) requires an injury committed by reason of this section.
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,329.089,332.361,By reason of a violation of 62.
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,332.361,335.881,"Yes, and that violation, the conspiracy..."
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,335.881,338.535,You're using the noun again.
1999.98-1480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,338.535,339.705,Stick with the verb.
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,339.705,344.837,"How did the conspiring, the formation of that agreement harm your client?"
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,344.837,356.395,There had to be overt acts that are performed as a result of that these people conspire in order to trigger 1964(c)'s injury requirement.
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,356.395,365.142,"That may well be, and he may have been injured by the overt act, but I don't see how he was injured by the violation of (d), which is the conspiring."
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,365.142,378.29,"In order to have this conspiring of people, they have to have an object, which is the three subsections of...  the three prior subsections of 1962."
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,397.891,399.113,"Well, that's further down the line, though."
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,415.595,426.952,"No, it's directly down the line, Justice Scalia, from the decision that's made in the conspiracy that we have to continue with this conspiracy, and to do that we have to get rid of this person."
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,458.692,460.943,But it wasn't one of the predicate acts.
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,460.943,461.364,No.
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,461.364,467.477,"I mean, your argument for direct results of the conspiracy would be much stronger if, indeed, it was one of the predicate acts."
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,467.477,480.157,"Yes, it would, Justice Scalia, but there's no basis to make a distinction between overt acts committed in furtherance of the conspiracy and predicate acts committed in furtherance of the conspiracy when we're under 1962(d)."
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,480.157,481.488,"If we're under (d), right?"
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,481.488,484.291,"If we're under (d), and here that's all that we're under."
1999.98-1480,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,515.611,522.496,"What do you say about, is the...  the language of 1964(c) is very similar to the private treble damage antitrust suit."
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,522.496,523.066,"Yes, sir."
1999.98-1480,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,523.066,528.709,And can a whistleblower bring an antitrust suit against a group of price fixers?
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,528.709,530.422,Probably not.
1999.98-1480,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,530.422,534.103,"Not, all right, so how...  what's the distinction?"
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,534.103,535.996,The distinction is an antitrust.
1999.98-1480,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,554.015,559.141,So I thought perhaps this...  your opponents are basically saying...  it's the same concept that's here.
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,568.968,571.691,That is what my opponents are saying in this case.
1999.98-1480,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,585.878,588.71,"But Mr. Starkman, it does undercut your plain meaning."
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,626.967,631.98,"There are three answers to that, Justice Ginsburg."
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,659.46,681.662,"I find it ironic that you're appealing to what Congress intended, and you tell us it intended to reach organized crime, which indeed I think it did, which...  you know, I view that as people in pin-striped suits carrying machine guns, and here you're going after people in doctor's robes carrying scalpels."
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,694.131,699.905,We only need to go so far as what the language itself says.
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,737.208,743.743,I don't think it reads in anything to say that you have not been hurt by the conspiring.
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,761.915,770.52,"But the conspiring is not just the conspiring to commit the predicate acts that happens when they first sit down, Justice Scalia."
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,790.814,797.268,"Well, I think you're right, I think the strongest argument...  incidentally, I don't think it's your opponent who makes the argument about the conspiring."
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,799.199,800.15,"Yes, sir, Washington Law Foundation."
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,800.15,824.467,"And the weakest point of that argument, it seems to me, which the amicus is willing to accept, is that if that argument is right, you would not only...  your client would not only be not able to recover for a...  an act that is in furtherance of the conspiracy but not one of the predicate acts..."
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,824.467,824.757,Uh-huh.
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,824.757,827.896,your client wouldn't even be able to recover for a predicate act.
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,827.896,828.917,Yes.
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,828.917,831.539,And you say that deprives (d) of all of its meaning.
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,831.539,832.801,Which it does.
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,832.801,835.773,But why does it deprive (d) of all of its meaning?
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,873.811,881.285,"Because, Justice Scalia, in order to do that, we have to take the words, to conspire, and give them two completely different meanings in two different sections."
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,905.391,908.463,But I'm not giving them two different meanings.
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,951.764,953.533,"It is a procedural device, then."
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,984.553,988.476,Although that is the usual consequence of conspiracy law in the civil context.
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,988.476,988.806,Yes.
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,988.806,990.418,It renders more people liable.
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,993.431,1016.885,"Yes, Justice Scalia, but here, 1962(d) is identified as one of the prohibited conduct, areas of conduct, and in Salinas this Court defined what that was, and all 1964(c) says, its plain language is that we are going to recognize a civil remedy, a civil action for that criminal violation."
1999.98-1480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1048.285,1053.29,"May I ask in that connection, how significant to your case is it that there may be a whistleblower involved?"
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1056.933,1060.694,"I think it does, Justice Stevens, but it's not crucial."
1999.98-1480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1067.048,1072.391,"Is that because he's a whistleblower, or independent of his possibility of doing any whistleblowing?"
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1072.391,1090.134,"It's independent, because for example, if they were just retaliating, and this whistleblower...  for blowing the whistle, first it's not in furtherance of the conspiracy, but it's also not proximately caused by the conspiracy, so it's not the fundamental issue of whistleblowing."
1999.98-1480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1094.056,1098.207,"What under the allegations of the complaint, what was the nature of his threat?"
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1098.207,1104.401,That he could cause the conspiracy to cease to exist.
1999.98-1480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1112.169,1119.024,Would you translate that to facts instead of sort of a general...  what did he do that prevented the conspiracy from being consummated?
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1119.024,1123.366,"Well, one thing he did was, report this to the regulators."
1999.98-1480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1124.668,1126.307,But if he's already done that...
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1126.307,1129.67,He began to report it to the regulators.
1999.98-1480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1131.97,1138.154,And your notion is that by firing him they would prevent him from reporting facts to the regulators?
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1138.154,1138.445,No.
1999.98-1480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1170.226,1179.432,"Would you say, in an analogy, as Justice Breyer suggested to the antitrust cases, is this like firing a salesman who refuses to go to price-fixing meetings?"
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1179.432,1194.842,"No, it's not, because there you again have...  well, it is on some levels, but the analogy isn't apropos because you have the antitrust injury requirement, which this Court has rejected in the RICO context."
1999.98-1480,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1200.436,1205.7,"Well, you say that we've rejected the antitrust injury concept in RICO."
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1207.662,1208.183,"Yes, sir."
1999.98-1480,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1208.183,1209.162,In Sedima?
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1209.162,1210.214,In Holmes.
1999.98-1480,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1210.214,1211.035,In Holmes?
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1211.035,1236.44,"It was actually stated in a footnote that...  and this is almost a literal quote...  the antitrust injury requirement has no analogue to the...  to RICO, and it was for this very reason that there is no underlying, or there's no countervailing policy to promote racketeering that would work in the RICO setting."
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1236.44,1242.474,So it's any injury that is a consequence of an act that's necessary for the completion of the conspiracy.
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1242.474,1245.166,If that satisfies proximate cause.
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1245.166,1245.987,"Yes, well, okay."
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1245.987,1247.627,Because proximate cause can go further.
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1247.627,1260.806,"Let's assume that in order to complete their scheme they have to close one factory and give the business of that factory to another factory, and they do it."
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1268.26,1268.681,No.
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1268.681,1269.472,Why not?
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1269.472,1271.302,Because they would not be direct victims.
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1271.302,1272.974,Why wouldn't they be direct victims?
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1272.974,1273.435,Because...
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1273.435,1280.979,"It is essential to the scheme that you close A, just as it was essential to their scheme here, according to your complaint, that they get rid of your client."
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1280.979,1286.495,The factory is the nearest analogy to Beck.
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1293.478,1294.85,They hurt the factory?
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1294.85,1299.622,"Let's assume the factory was a separate subsidiary, because then I think it makes a little more sense."
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1310.39,1312.801,Take the factory out of the picture.
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1331.084,1337.289,"Yes, because they are proximately injured by the act of conspiring."
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1337.289,1339.639,But if they were executives of the factory...
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1339.639,1341.22,If the...
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1341.22,1342.372,they wouldn't have a cause of action.
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1342.372,1348.194,"Assuming the factory is a separate animal, that it's a separate company, then the company would have that action."
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1350.996,1353.858,I assume these were executives of a separate company.
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1353.858,1354.359,"No, because..."
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1354.359,1355.888,Then they wouldn't have a cause of action.
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1355.888,1359.662,"No, I don't believe so, sir, because I don't think that their injury is direct."
1999.98-1480,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1382.457,1397.697,"But I take it on Justice Scalia's hypothetical if you don't interpose the subsidiary structure, if they simply close the factory that's part of their operation, every employee in the factory would have the RICO cause, for the same reason that the executives would in the second hypo."
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1397.697,1399.908,"I think so, Justice Souter."
1999.98-1480,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1399.908,1400.338,Yes.
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1400.338,1402.188,I think so under the plain language of the statute.
1999.98-1480,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1442.366,1442.646,I find it...
1999.98-1480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1442.646,1443.385,I'm sorry.
1999.98-1480,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1445.588,1461.918,"As I understand it, when you say the conspiracy, you mean by conspiracy an agreement to do everything that is necessary, ultimately to effect a predicate act."
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1461.918,1467.371,Ultimately to effect the objects of the conspiracy.
1999.98-1480,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1467.371,1468.943,Which is ultimately a predicate act.
1999.98-1480,0,33100,jay_starkman,,1468.943,1469.984,"Maybe, and maybe not."
