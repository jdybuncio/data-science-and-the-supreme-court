1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,0.0,45.439,"We will hear arguments next in 75-73, Bellotti, the Attorney General of Massachusetts against Baird and 75-109, Hunerwadel against Baird."
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,55.446,58.462,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-73,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,207.179,213.359,Did the Three-judge District Court had the benefit of any state court construction in reaching that interpretation?
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,213.359,223.158,"No, it did not, Your Honor, because the statute in fact had never been allowed to go into effect and no case had therefore come up to the state court."
1975.75-73,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,223.158,234.847,Did the Three-judge Court give any consideration or was it asked to give any consideration to abstaining in order to prevent the Massachusetts Courts to interpret the meaning of the statute?
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,234.847,243.838,"Yes, it was asked to abstain, Your Honor, and it decided that such abstention was unnecessary without giving reasons."
1975.75-73,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,263.489,276.606,"Well, then you say in affect that even though the Three-judge Court is not to abstained, it was obligated to construe the State Statute more narrowly than it did?"
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,276.606,278.808,"I am suggesting that there were alternatives, Your Honor."
1975.75-73,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,308.363,321.906,"So, you say that the Three-judge District Court should have left the statute standing and in particular cases, perhaps there might have been an unconstitutional application, but it would be sufficient for that evil for the day, so to speak?"
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,321.906,324.997,"That is right, Your Honor."
1975.75-73,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,346.964,358.543,"The parents of a 12 or 13-year-old girl compel, often they compel the child to have an abortion under the Massachusetts Statute?"
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,358.543,368.135,"I would say, Your Honor that that would be consent, and that therefore, the abortions --"
1975.75-73,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,368.135,381.837,I should contemplate that the child is first taking the procedure and her parents second now force the situation where the child takes no position at all.
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,393.287,401.529,"Not on the face of the statute, Your Honor, because on the statute requires that the physician obtain a consent of both the minor and their parents."
1975.75-73,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,421.058,432.979,"In what other areas under Massachusetts law is the consent, the affirmative consent of a minor required to be given?"
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,432.979,444.982,"Your Honor, there are a number of provisions and in fact, they are set out in the dissent to District Court's opinion in a footnote."
1975.75-73,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,661.034,668.329,That goes to the fact that even if the girl is living away from home or the other side of town and has not seen her parents for the last three years?
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,668.329,669.951,"Your Honor, in Massachusetts --"
1975.75-73,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,669.951,672.143,(Inaudible)
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,672.143,678.978,"No, the statute will not, Your Honor, because of the provision for consent by a state court for good cause shown."
1975.75-73,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,686.196,689.02,You are (Inaudible) that we want to keep the family together?
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,689.02,690.253,Where it is together or?
1975.75-73,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,690.253,693.33,It applies to all whether they are together or not?
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,693.33,696.866,"It applies in the first instance to all, Your Honor."
1975.75-73,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,710.834,715.185,The plaintiff in this case was alleged to be residing with her parents?
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,715.185,718.451,"That is quite right, Your Honor, she was residing with her parents."
1975.75-73,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,783.98,816.374,"According to page 23 of the jurisdictional statements, the dissenting opinion in the footnote, the doctor's response was that usually it is the first time he has met the person when he walks into the room to perform as he said, because of this an average of half a dozen or more abortions at one session."
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,816.374,816.582,Usually.
1975.75-73,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,816.582,824.281,"Now, is there some -- with a minor, is there some consultation by some other counseling person that precedes that?"
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,824.281,835.38,"Your Honor, in all cases, there is as the record shows, an hour of prior conversation with adults and minors mixed together and often in groups."
1975.75-73,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,835.38,836.308,But not with the physician?
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,836.308,837.347,Not with the physician.
1975.75-73,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,850.393,859.061,"Well, one way for the state to attack that problem would be to require that a physician consult with the patient, is it not?"
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,859.061,859.154,Right.
1975.75-73,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,859.154,861.175,Rather than to go about the way they have done it?
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,861.175,883.243,"That is one method, Your Honor, assuming that the patient would be in the position to be able to appreciate and make a judgment with regard to the abortion decision and as we say, this interest is one of a number of interests that we think that the state is pursuing in enacting Section 12P."
1975.75-73,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,938.764,948.83,"In understanding this case for your Massachusetts Statute, it is different from the Missouri one and that it requires the consent of both parents?"
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,948.83,950.952,"It does, Your Honor that is a difference."
1975.75-73,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,950.952,954.704,So that here then one parent has absolute veto power.
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,954.704,963.834,"Well, we disagree that the veto power is absolute, but both parents do have the power over the consent, the criteria of consent."
1975.75-73,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,963.834,966.47,Even when they were separated?
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,966.47,968.552,"No, Your Honor."
1975.75-73,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1018.272,1019.461,I do not think I have this straight.
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,1024.241,1032.887,"I am saying that on its face, the consent of both would be necessary because you have used the word separated rather than divorced."
1975.75-73,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1057.344,1069.715,"If one parent were diseased or has deserted his or her family, that then only the consent of one would be sufficient?"
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,1069.715,1072.128,"Yes, that is right, Your Honor."
1975.75-73,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1072.128,1075.052,Alright and It does not seem to me to tie into your statute really --
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,1075.052,1090.219,"Well, it certainly does not fit the word deserted on its face and I am not suggesting that the statute as written would guarantee that the consent of only one parent would suffice in that instance."
1975.75-73,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1241.777,1246.625,"Mr. Rosenfeld, does the statute tell us anything about the procedure that is to be followed at such a hearing?"
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,1250.443,1254.924,The statute does not speak specifically to those items.
1975.75-73,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1269.26,1275.51,Would you construe the statute as permitting the pregnant minor to go before the Court without giving notice to her parents?
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,1275.579,1276.911,"Yes, we would, Your Honor."
1975.75-73,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1303.835,1310.224,"You are then suggesting that the decision can be made without the benefit of the family history, which you suggest it was a reason for the parental consent?"
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,1310.224,1331.592,"Well only, Your Honor, only if a state court Judge familiar with these kinds of cases, were to exercise his judgment in that regard, and I do not believe that any general rule, any inflexible rule can be stated that would dictate an outcome in one direction or the other."
1975.75-73,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1348.775,1359.15,"But, it is the view of the state, if I understand you correctly then that the interest of the pregnant minor’s parents is insufficient to entitle them to notice in a hearing of this kind?"
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,1359.15,1360.278,"No, excuse me, Your Honor."
1975.75-73,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1426.173,1431.948,"Mr. Rosenfeld, how does the statute change the common law of Massachusetts, if at all?"
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,1431.948,1437.584,"Well, Your Honor, this statute we believe quantifies the common law."
1975.75-73,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1449.087,1450.874,So it does not change the common law?
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,1450.874,1454.118,"It does not, but I have an additional point, Your Honor."
1975.75-73,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1472.041,1473.182,It is the common law?
1975.75-73,0,41951,s_stephen_rosenfeld,,1473.182,1473.741,It does change the common law.
1975.75-73,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1503.029,1506.16,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1975.75-73,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1819.083,1823.728,"Mr. Riley, enlighten me on the Massachusetts situation."
1975.75-73,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1833.46,1836.056,It is a very informal procedure in my mind.
1975.75-73,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1836.056,1838.511,"Well, I am not asking about formality or informality."
1975.75-73,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1840.69,1853.083,"I would say that a child could go into the Court and have a hearing within the day that she goes in, and there is a daily motion session in most of the Courts of Commonwealth of Massachusetts where --"
1975.75-73,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1853.083,1858.379,There is not the backlog that would delay this for weeks?
1975.75-73,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1858.379,1858.507,No.
1975.75-73,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1862.854,1867.434,"Well, does your statute still provide?"
1975.75-73,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1892.525,1914.594,"Well, in other situations where medical treatment is necessary, for example, a blood transfusion or other medical treatment that is necessary and has to be performed within a particular period of time, state court systems have been able to adjust and adopt themselves to deal with that problem and provide the necessary hearing and make the necessary determination as to whether or not--"
1975.75-73,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1914.594,1921.904,"I am not asking that some have not, and I am asking what the Massachusetts situation is, apparently you do not know?"
1975.75-73,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1921.904,1930.669,"Well, as far as the Supreme Court judge may have a hearing, the statute provides a hearing as he deems necessary."
1975.75-73,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1956.654,1962.454,(Inaudible) procedure in your equity side of the Courts of Massachusetts?
1975.75-73,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1962.454,1964.665,We have a temporary restraining order.
1975.75-73,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1964.665,1968.792,"You mean, they are on immediate application, it is?"
1975.75-73,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1968.792,1972.554,It is daily in most counties.
1975.75-73,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1972.554,1975.563,Your time has expired Mr. Riley.
1975.75-73,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1975.563,1978.857,Thank you.
1975.75-73,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1978.857,1980.889,Lucas?
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,1980.889,1983.565,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-73,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2048.565,2052.482,"(Voice Overlap) shown an exception, Mr. Lucas?"
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2052.482,2053.86,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1975.75-73,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2053.86,2063.014,"I say you have spoken of unfettered control, is not the Massachusetts for a good cause shown provision and exception?"
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2063.014,2076.125,That is one potential exception but it is totally undefined and there are an infinite number of circumstances in which there could be good cause according to the patient but not according to the Superior Court.
1975.75-73,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2122.627,2140.14,Are you suggesting that the Massachusetts Courts would not either on their probate side or on their equity side make some provision for expedited hearing if they thought there was an emergency even though the statute does not so many words say they should?
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2140.14,2142.939,"We are suggesting that, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1975.75-73,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2148.096,2157.873,"I take it when you say that you are suggesting it, you are relying on some provision on Massachusetts law or some customer practice in Massachusetts that you know of, now what is it?"
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2157.873,2158.336,"No, I am not."
1975.75-73,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2160.585,2176.446,"Correct, but certainly I do not know if you practiced in Massachusetts or not, but I would gather that in most states there are any number of Court rules or customs that are made to accommodate the situations where the statute is completely silent on the point?"
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2176.446,2176.933,That is true.
1975.75-73,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2182.486,2186.616,"You do not know what the Supreme Court of Massachusetts might set up as rules, do you?"
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2186.616,2187.587,We have no idea what they might do?
1975.75-73,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2187.587,2189.541,And you made no effort to find that?
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2189.541,2193.192,"Well, we have certainly ascertained that there is no law on this subject because the statute was enjoined."
1975.75-73,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2193.192,2197.455,But you did not get the material because you ran in favor of the Court before they even get the chance to look at it?
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2197.455,2198.918,"That is correct, we did and --"
1975.75-73,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2198.918,2201.773,"So, how do we know what will be done in the state court?"
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2205.878,2206.316,Our position would be --
1975.75-73,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2206.316,2209.602,"You do not know what Supreme Court of Massachusetts speaks, is that right?"
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2209.602,2218.304,That is correct and the state has not suggested any reasonable ways in which it would be likely under traditional abstention principles enunciated by the Courts.
1975.75-73,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2218.304,2221.522,In fact the state did ask the Court to abstain?
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2221.522,2223.241,"The state asked the Court to abstain, yes and the Court refused to."
1975.75-73,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2223.241,2225.865,The Court did not and they did not give any reason for it?
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2225.865,2226.381,That is true.
1975.75-73,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2232.47,2244.984,Suppose the Supreme Court of Massachusetts would say that this statute required that the judge get the best medical assistance that he can get and the best medical adviser he can get and that it be expeditiously held within 24 hours.
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2246.926,2250.862,We would still assert that the minor cannot be burdened with being required to be in the Court.
1975.75-73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2250.862,2261.194,Do you have any statutes about expediting applications for temporary restraining orders or is that a matter of practice and the local rules of Court?
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2261.194,2262.723,I do not know in Massachusetts law.
1975.75-73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2265.582,2277.44,"In most states, a temporary restraining order can be obtained without notice to anyone by walking in and finding the judge and presenting the matter to him, is that not so?"
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2277.44,2277.872,That is true.
1975.75-73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2310.251,2356.474,"Suppose a 12-year-old or 13-year-old girl had inherited very substantial amount of money or real estate securities, jammed it to transfer them, laying aside for the moment that no person in his right mind would accept the transfer or pay anything for it, from a 12-year-old or 13-year-old, how do you distinguish the right of a 12-year-old or 13-year-old girl to give away a home worth $500,000.00 and a million dollars worth of securities without the consent of her parents or her guardian or anyone else and the situation confronting us here?"
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2356.474,2365.813,We would that on the grounds that that was primarily economic and social welfare legislation under the distinction the Court adopted in Dandridge v. Williamson and cases as I mentioned.
1975.75-73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2365.813,2375.005,The court can control that the state cannot control on the child’s dealing with her property?
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2375.005,2375.696,"Yes, we would think that --"
1975.75-73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2375.696,2379.414,But cannot control in the health area?
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2379.414,2380.467,"Yes, we would think that is true."
1975.75-73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2399.186,2417.566,"The assumption that in each cases that there would be an undue delay, but you have, at least for me satisfied me that the Courts of Massachusetts would not give, looking at this whole statutory structure, would not give the highest priority to a swift determination of these questions?"
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2417.566,2419.175,Even if they did.
1975.75-73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2436.611,2444.693,"(Inaudible) the equity judges have managed to get along pretty well for a couple of hundred years on general equity principles, is it not?"
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2444.693,2450.732,"That is true but in this particular case, there is no guidance whatsoever for what practice they should take into account."
1975.75-73,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2453.053,2461.014,"Well, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts at least had gone part way towards curing that if it did had a chance?"
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2461.014,2463.043,"It could have gone some of the distance, yes it could have."
1975.75-73,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2466.862,2476.766,"You think that the more different the problems and the more diverse the problems are, the more you make out a classical case where the District Court should have abstained."
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2499.579,2504.672,"Yes, we will disagree with that strongly because the state court would have to litigate."
1975.75-73,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2522.232,2530.361,"Well presumably, the Massachusetts legislature was willing to have that burden placed on the state courts when it enacted the statute?"
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2530.361,2532.553,"Presumably, they were yes."
1975.75-73,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2588.055,2598.525,You think the plaintiff in this case would have had standing to attack the statute if in fact her parents had consented her or would have consented if she asked them?
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2598.525,2603.325,"I would not -- if her parents had consented, I would think that she had no standing."
1975.75-73,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2603.325,2619.138,"Well then, do you not think the state has quite illegitimate objection to the District Court’s refusal to divulge to the state which who was defending the action, the names of the parents because really, all we have is the assertion of the plaintiff that her parents did not consent."
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2624.961,2635.885,"Well, our position was not that the disclosure of the patient’s name and bringing the parents into the case would have been unnecessary because of other parties withstanding in the case and it would have been destructive and damaging to the patient."
1975.75-73,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2635.885,2641.385,You said a moment ago that if her parents had in fact consented she would not have standing to bring the case?
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2641.385,2641.79,That is true.
1975.75-73,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2644.738,2654.458,If the state was never enable to find out in effect whether she had standing because they were not permitted to examine her parents as to whether they would have consented?
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2654.458,2662.267,If her parents had been willing to consent then there would have been no reason for her to become involved in the litigation and to have taken such care to avoid exposure of her name.
1975.75-73,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2662.267,2671.11,"Well, all we have is her say so. Ordinarily in a lawsuit you are entitled to examine, all she did was make representations as to what her parents would have done."
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2678.725,2681.652,That would be true ordinarily but in this case I do not think that it was essential.
1975.75-73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2700.744,2715.339,Twenty-five reasons could occur to me in less than not many seconds on why a girl who has already made in all these briefs a strong case and I think accurately that this is a period of great stress.
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2735.646,2737.054,In many cases that would be true.
1975.75-73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2737.876,2744.919,How you can you generalize as you were saying that the Court could decide in talking with her?
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2744.919,2745.402,Perhaps --
1975.75-73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2745.402,2749.37,Whether in fact her parents were likely to consent?
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2749.37,2751.889,Perhaps I misunderstood Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s the question.
1975.75-73,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2761.198,2769.105,What he is probing out -- what he was probing out and what I am concerned about is how do we know if the parents would not have consented and that there would have been no case here at all?
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2769.105,2770.796,"We certainly do not, we do not know that."
1975.75-73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2770.907,2779.681,Is that not the business of the Courts to find out before they bring them out on this stage of litigation?
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2779.681,2783.336,"Well, with other parties who had standing in the litigation it was not really necessary."
1975.75-73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2795.314,2800.316,"As I understand, these other parties have not yet resolved of course for the finality?"
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2800.316,2801.112,That is true.
1975.75-73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2836.008,2837.654,"We will never know that, will we?"
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2837.654,2859.572,That is true and also the Court addressed the case in terms of the statute on its face rather than as applied to this particular minor and the Court made an express determination that this minor was fully confident to bring the action and that she was confident to give an informed consent and that was another reason for dispensing with notifying her parents.
1975.75-73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2859.572,2860.561,"Well, this girl --?"
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2860.561,2861.501,She was 16.
1975.75-73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2861.501,2862.236,Sixteen.
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2862.236,2863.13,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2863.13,2871.791,"(Inaudible) case for that kind of statement in your case was a 16-year-old girl than with the 12, of course I am sure you (Voice Overlap)"
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2871.791,2873.242,That is certainly true.
1975.75-73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2920.54,2928.895,Thank you gentlemen.
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,2932.548,2934.36,"Thank you, your Honor."

1975.75-73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3118.167,3137.109,Such a minor girl would have a cause of action against a doctor who either because of the statute or independent of any statute refused to perform the procedure without the consent of the parents?
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,3137.109,3142.855,"No, Your Honor, I do not think that she would, unless in a very rare set of circumstances."
1975.75-73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3151.267,3167.299,"I am concerned about the malpractice aspect and the problem of taking on the burden of proving later that a 12-year-old girl giving an informed consent, could simply say without the consent of the parents I will not have anything to do with it?"
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,3167.299,3171.52,I think the doctor could do that and I think some doctors do and some doctors will.
1975.75-73,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3227.583,3231.924,"Mr. Lucas, could I ask you a question that has run through my mind as I listened to the argument."
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,3240.668,3242.614,That is a very interesting question.
1975.75-73,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3259.365,3275.983,"(Inaudible) think for example growing long hair is whimsical in nature that has been given constitutional protection, at least in some circuits, I wonder if it is right to affect one's appearance by having some kind of a special emblem on an arm or something like that might be somewhat --"
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,3275.983,3279.758,I think that is a really kind of case that could go either way.
1975.75-73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3309.835,3317.784,"What if it was a symbol, an anti war symbol, you get the First Amendment involved in the tattoo then?"
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,3317.784,3321.421,That could come up in something very simple to Tinker context.
1975.75-73,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3352.724,3365.976,"(Inaudible) to follow-up on Justice Steven’s question, instead of just wanting to wear an armband, they wanted to have an armband tattoo in such a way that there was medical evidence to suggest there was some danger attached."
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,3368.228,3370.251,I think my answer would be different in a case like that.
1975.75-73,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3381.094,3382.915,Let it make it a little easier or harder then.
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,3388.211,3392.082,That again gets in the same area as the personal appearance and the hair area.
1975.75-73,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3405.682,3408.9,There are dangers of infection with ear piercing as you know?
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,3408.9,3411.402,Yes and I am not sure --
1975.75-73,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3411.402,3415.779,Unless so when a nurse does it then why not a physician does it?
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,3415.779,3420.589,I would not be surprised of that.
1975.75-73,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3420.589,3424.79,How critical your argument is the fact that both parents' consent is required?
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,3428.524,3429.296,We are not.
1975.75-73,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3443.775,3446.415,Two consent requirements really change the constitutional issue?
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,3446.415,3447.103,"No, I do not."
1975.75-73,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3447.103,3448.72,"Yeah, I just wanted to make sure."
1975.75-73,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3448.72,3456.929,"Mr. Lucas before you go on, I suppose Massachusetts has a customary law requiring parental consent for matter to marry?"
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,3456.929,3458.878,"Yes, Your Honor that is true."

1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,3480.582,3481.453,I do not think it would.
1975.75-73,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3510.998,3519.702,"State in the same reasons suggested, have included the parental interest in the child’s welfare?"
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,3519.702,3520.774,That would not be --
1975.75-73,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3520.774,3526.8,"Included in both instances I take it, the consent to marriage and the consent to abortion?"
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,3526.8,3527.928,"Yes, Justice Powell."
1975.75-73,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3602.733,3611.68,"You are saying that some 18-year-olds, 17-year-olds, and no more than 21-year-olds, if sol why cannot they get married without consent?"
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,3611.68,3616.146,Because of the other state interest that justifies drawing some line at some point in that.
1975.75-73,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3616.146,3622.959,"I do not see any difference in the state is interest on this point, when you say that 12-year-old got more sense than some 17-year-old."
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,3630.822,3631.928,"That is perfectly correct, Your Honor."
1975.75-73,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3631.928,3633.618,But what good is it to your argument?
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,3633.618,3641.534,"It is just to illustrate that if you ban abortions for someone under age 14, there are going to be a few whose rights are very important to them."

1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,3655.392,3660.557,It does come up in the line drawing area situations that we discussed in the brief.
1975.75-73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3672.084,3674.977,Is not the right to marry a fundamental right?.
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,3674.977,3676.594,"Yes it is, Your Honor."
1975.75-73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3678.044,3681.191,Do you think the state can regulate it?
1975.75-73,2,39756,roy_lucas,,3681.191,3682.054,We would agree with that.
