1965.597,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,17.728,"Number 597, James E. Mills, Appellant, versus Alabama."
1965.597,0,17049,alfred_swedlaw,,20.844,23.058,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.597,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,25.343,28.184,"Yes, there are two counsels here."
1965.597,0,17049,alfred_swedlaw,,28.184,29.544,Yes sir.
1965.597,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,29.544,30.252,Yes.
1965.597,0,17049,alfred_swedlaw,,32.673,34.333,"Thank you, sir, we are both of Birmingham."
1965.597,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,41.783,45.767,Yes.
1965.597,0,17049,alfred_swedlaw,,45.767,57.074,"This case concerns Section 285 of the Alabama Corrupt Practices Act, regulating election practices."
1965.597,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,111.447,115.644,It's the only morning paper in Birmingham?
1965.597,0,17049,alfred_swedlaw,,115.644,116.086,"Yes, sir."
1965.597,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,127.015,128.713,And this is the only morning newspaper?
1965.597,0,17049,alfred_swedlaw,,128.713,132.758,This is the only morning newspaper.
1965.597,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,326.285,334.176,"May I ask, Mr. Swedlaw, is this directly involved to do any electioneering or to solicit any votes?"
1965.597,0,17049,alfred_swedlaw,,334.176,335.129,Yes sir.
1965.597,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,335.129,335.547,Is that all?
1965.597,0,17049,alfred_swedlaw,,336.507,337.28,"Yes sir, that's all."
1965.597,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,337.28,339.307,-- any electioneering or to solicit any votes.
1965.597,0,17049,alfred_swedlaw,,339.307,340.185,"On election day, yes sir."
1965.597,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,340.185,344.857,I see.
1965.597,0,17049,alfred_swedlaw,,344.857,357.606,"The statute having been declared unconstitutional, as provided by Alabama procedure, the State appealed directly to the Supreme Court of Alabama."
1965.597,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,600.659,613.014,Does that mean that you do conceive that the publication of this editorial constituted electioneering or the solicitation of votes on election day?
1965.597,0,17049,alfred_swedlaw,,613.014,617.53,"The Alabama Supreme Court, Judge Fortas, has so construed it and --"
1965.597,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,617.53,626.59,"And you -- you don't dispute that and you represent to us that if you went back to trial, you would not dispute that."
1965.597,0,17049,alfred_swedlaw,,626.59,647.946,"Your Honor, we disputed it initially in the court below but the application of the statute by the Alabama Supreme Court is a binding construction of it and binding on this Court, may I suggest, to the same effect as though it were written into the statute."
1965.597,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,647.946,653.284,"And to the same effect as if that conclusion we arrived at, at the trial?"
1965.597,0,17049,alfred_swedlaw,,653.284,654.614,Yes sir.
1965.597,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,655.648,658.793,You had your day in the court on that and it's been decided against you (Voice Overlap) at the end of it.
1965.597,0,17049,alfred_swedlaw,,658.793,659.242,Yes sir.
1965.597,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,659.242,663.045,"And you're stuck with it and without reading, and as you suggest, we're stuck with that reading."
1965.597,0,17049,alfred_swedlaw,,663.045,665.897,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2088.728,2094.338,"May it please the Court, I will take that up in rebuttal and use it all at one time, if you please."
1965.597,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2094.338,2103.035,"Don't you think we ought to -- well, if you are raising the question of vagueness that you should raise it in some sense either even to --"
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2103.035,2105.5,"Alright, yes sir, I would be glad to."
1965.597,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2105.5,2108.878,You don't need to use all your time but we would like to know --
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2108.878,2115.395,I would like to save some for rebuttal because mine is all mixed up in that situation.
1965.597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2226.44,2227.755,Or vice versa?
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2227.755,2229.543,Or vice versa.
1965.597,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2288.113,2302.256,"I gather that these two rely to this argument, doesn't it, pretty much under First Amendment aspect of electioneering and soliciting and if you have some business coverage in which you said were dealing with First Amendment finding."
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2302.256,2303.44,Yes sir.
1965.597,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2303.44,2308.374,And the doctrine of vagueness particularly requires passage of the publicity.
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2309.362,2310.357,"That sir, yes sir."
1965.597,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2311.263,2314.701,-- electioneering and solicitation doesn't provide that kind of --
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2314.701,2320.286,There is no definitive wording here that we might know what solicitation would be.
1965.597,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2383.749,2386.996,"But, there is no doubt about this particular incident, is there?"
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2386.996,2387.743,Sir?
1965.597,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2387.743,2395.733,"I say there is no doubt that this particular editorial was a solicitation of votes, you probably just said that."
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2399.456,2400.06,"Well, yes and no."
1965.597,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2400.06,2401.472,You've used that by saying --
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2401.472,2409.337,"Your Honor, I agree with it to this extent, the Supreme Court has said that the article constituted solicitation."
1965.597,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2409.337,2416.876,"Well, the last paragraph of the editorial says, â€œBirmingham and the people of Birmingham deserve a better break."
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2421.064,2421.551,Yes sir.
1965.597,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2421.551,2423.223,That's what it says.
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2423.223,2423.435,Yes sir.
1965.597,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2423.435,2430.436,"And do you -- that does seem sort of like a solicitation of votes, doesn't it?"
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2430.436,2431.845,That's exactly true.
1965.597,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2445.466,2447.064,"Well, you said vote for the mayor-council government (Voice Overlap)"
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2447.064,2449.52,"Yes, he said vote -- he said vote for it (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.597,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2449.52,2450.88,-- you phrase it.
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2450.88,2450.974,And what did he --
1965.597,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2450.974,2452.587,"Now, tell us how you phrase it."
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2452.587,2463.441,"What did he do in this particular case, if Your Honor please, was that he first stated the facts which were news items and appeared in the news items in other parts of the paper."
1965.597,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2486.949,2488.743,I should think Mr. Perrine.
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2493.003,2493.387,I think --
1965.597,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2493.387,2496.299,And that's precisely what the State cannot prevent under the Constitution.
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2496.299,2499.387,"I think it was a solicitation of votes, yes sir."
1965.597,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2537.434,2539.456,"Well, may I ask --"
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2539.456,2539.71,Yes sir.
1965.597,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2539.71,2540.969,Mr. Perrine --
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2540.969,2541.514,Perrine.
1965.597,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2541.514,2541.872,Perrine.
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2560.344,2561.89,Yes sir.
1965.597,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2562.075,2574.967,And you have to rely only on that assuming it's a solicitation in and of itself as First Amendment proscribed the statement here.
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2574.967,2578.296,In and of itself which says that we must have freedom of speech.
1965.597,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2582.089,2588.365,"Irrespective of that -- under the vagueness argument, you are standing to argue that is it's too vague as applied to other people."
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2588.365,2588.547,Yes sir.
1965.597,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2588.547,2589.643,The billboards and all of those.
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2589.643,2603.695,"Yes sir, not only -- not only to the billboards, it applies as vague as to individuals, as to the press, as to the radio, as to the TV, or in fact any type of communications under this section."
1965.597,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2635.46,2637.273,"They didn't object to the conduct, did they?"
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2638.863,2640.088,They objected the fact that he --
1965.597,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2640.088,2641.646,That's what you're trying to defend here.
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2641.646,2641.813,That's right.
1965.597,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2641.813,2642.745,He said.
1965.597,1,33939,kenneth_perrine,,2642.745,2649.039,"What he said, his speech."
1965.597,2,34535,leslie_hall,,3129.903,3135.644,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1965.597,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3188.872,3190.489,Is that all you're going to say --
1965.597,2,34535,leslie_hall,,3190.489,3190.93,"Yes, I'm not going to --"
1965.597,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3190.93,3192.451,-- the question of jurisdiction.
1965.597,2,34535,leslie_hall,,3192.451,3194.138,-- go too much into that because --
1965.597,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3194.138,3194.419,Yes.
1965.597,2,34535,leslie_hall,,3194.419,3202.571,-- actually Mr. Hawkins and I are quite interested in getting the decision as far as the constitutionality.
1965.597,3,17739,burgin_hawkins,,3611.439,3627.22,"-- prior to that time, many acts of corrupt practice at the polls, intimidation of voters getting them drunk, buying votes, there are many types of corruption."
1965.597,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3811.487,3811.938,What about the --
1965.597,3,17739,burgin_hawkins,,3811.938,3813.365,But I am sure --
1965.597,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3813.365,3814.374,Could I ask you?
1965.597,3,17739,burgin_hawkins,,3817.094,3818.95,Urging people to vote?
1965.597,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3827.657,3832.423,That is electioneering in one of its most traditional sense.
1965.597,3,17739,burgin_hawkins,,3832.423,3833.231,I don't think it was that -- I don't --
1965.597,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3833.231,3836.292,It was urging -- getting out to vote -- just urging people to vote.
1965.597,3,17739,burgin_hawkins,,3836.292,3842.58,"Justice White, I don't believe that that was the original intent of this legislature --"
1965.597,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3842.58,3842.983,"Well, you can tell it from the word."
1965.597,3,17739,burgin_hawkins,,3842.983,3848.048,-- but to prohibit people from getting numbers of people out to the polls.
1965.597,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3870.682,3874.609,"Well, I would think almost anybody would think that was electioneering."
1965.597,3,17739,burgin_hawkins,,3877.318,3881.441,I don't think that's what the statute intended to prohibit.
1965.597,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3881.441,3885.059,(Inaudible) to prohibit it.
1965.597,3,17739,burgin_hawkins,,3885.059,3889.451,Taking those very people --
1965.597,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3889.451,3900.381,(Inaudible)
1965.597,3,17739,burgin_hawkins,,3900.381,3915.022,"If that was a case before Your Honor, I would confess, I wouldn't argue such a ridiculous thing that a man cannot get him a taxicab and go to the polls to vote although I think it's just ridiculous to argue that."
1965.597,4,17049,alfred_swedlaw,,4798.611,4800.927,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.597,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5190.457,5191.791,"Mr. Swedlaw, may I interrupt you just a moment."
1965.597,4,17049,alfred_swedlaw,,5191.791,5192.515,Yes.
1965.597,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5192.515,5197.801,I didn't get the name of the case you were referring to that you say has been undermined.I thought you said Palco --
1965.597,4,17049,alfred_swedlaw,,5197.801,5202.874,"Polakow, P-O-L-A-K-O-W is the --"
1965.597,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5202.874,5204.202,Is that in your brief?
1965.597,4,17049,alfred_swedlaw,,5204.202,5214.38,"-- case, yes sir, it's cited in the State's brief and we had -- we have the citation, I think it's 319 U.S.--"
1965.597,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5214.38,5215.491,Polakow?
1965.597,4,17049,alfred_swedlaw,,5215.491,5219.241,Yes sir.
1965.597,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5219.241,5220.58,Thank you.
1965.597,4,17049,alfred_swedlaw,,5220.58,5223.924,It's 319 U.S. 1155.
1965.597,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5223.924,5225.75,"Thank you, sir."
1965.597,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5225.75,5226.793,What's that?
1965.597,4,17049,alfred_swedlaw,,5226.793,5231.868,"319 U.S. 1155, I think."
1965.597,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5231.868,5233.618,It's 750 and it say (Voice Overlap) --
1965.597,4,17049,alfred_swedlaw,,5233.618,5236.176,750 to 755.
1965.597,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5236.176,5238.536,Yes.
1965.597,4,17049,alfred_swedlaw,,5238.536,5245.17,The parallel between the Fanny Hill case and the Mills case we think is evident.
