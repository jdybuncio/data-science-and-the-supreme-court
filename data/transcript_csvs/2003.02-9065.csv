2003.02-9065,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.055,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90... it's 02-9065, Shakur Muhammad, also known as John Mease v. Mark Close."
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,70.012,74.304,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-9065,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,168.093,170.572,But I don't understand this about this case.
2003.02-9065,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,253.875,262.048,"Well, I suppose one of the reasons you got into it was that the Sixth Circuit said that you had... had to comply with Heck against Humphrey, and you didn't agree with it."
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,262.048,268.448,"Well, that's right, and you know, this is undoubtedly a valid First Amendment retaliation claim."
2003.02-9065,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,281.08,285.499,Can we reach this... I can't reach the Sixth... the question that the circuit thought was here.
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,296.135,298.57,--It's not... I don't believe it's an--
2003.02-9065,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,298.57,301.049,"If I said what I said, is that correct what I've said?"
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,301.049,318.344,"--I don't think so, because it's not an unexhausted claim, and I believe the whole point of this case is the... is the misstatement of the law by the Sixth Circuit that would deem this a non-civil rights claim, basically a habeas claim completely contrary to this Court's precedent in Preiser."
2003.02-9065,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,334.197,346.002,"Well, does the Heck Humphrey issue that comes to us one that is affected by whether good-time credits are lost?"
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,346.002,353.161,The... whether good-time credits are lost is a... is a consideration and whether there is a fact or duration case.
2003.02-9065,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,353.161,354.276,Right.
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,354.276,355.269,And this case is nothing about--
2003.02-9065,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,355.269,368.394,"So after all the briefing, the additional briefing that's gone on, do we know now for sure whether good-time credits are affected here?"
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,368.394,369.508,--I think we do.
2003.02-9065,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,391.222,393.164,But is... is that really the point?
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,398.858,399.767,It... that's right.
2003.02-9065,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,399.767,401.337,And those are quite different things.
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,423.007,438.982,"That's right, but there's nothing about this claim that would ever, you know, ever lead to the result, under the test necessarily imply the invalidity of the deprivation of good-time credits, which, by the way, I don't believe we were deprived of good-time credits, because of the reasons I state in my brief."
2003.02-9065,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,443.152,446.374,"Well, let... let's... could we just make a short excursus there?"
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,465.814,466.89,--That... that is true.
2003.02-9065,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,468.171,470.028,Then... then isn't that the end of your argument--
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,470.028,470.771,--I don't think so.
2003.02-9065,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,470.771,472.257,"--because doesn't it... I mean, let me just finish--"
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,472.257,472.507,Sure.
2003.02-9065,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,472.507,474.652,--my... my question so you know where I'm going.
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,489.141,500.658,"I don't think that... I think that that aspect of the claim, you know, aside from waiver and aside from not challenging the conviction that led to the good-time credits, if they exist, is still not true, I don't think."
2003.02-9065,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,536.984,544.293,"Well, but for ease of judicial administration, do we really want to have to look at how old he's going to be and all of these things?"
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,552.588,566.129,"--Well, that may be true in another case, but it's not true in our case, because we're not challenging, you know, nothing about our constitutional claim would necessarily imply the invalidity of that insolence conviction."
2003.02-9065,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,566.129,585.365,"Well, sticking with Justice O'Connor's question, suppose good-time credits were involved here, but insofar as the prisoner is concerned, it was wholly peripheral, and assume that the good-time credits would not click into operation for another 20 years."
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,590.937,610.173,"In... I mean, I think that... that Preiser created a clean line, and this Court has decided repeatedly that good-time... the loss of good-time credits falls on the fact or duration side of that line, and I think it makes sense to continue to maintain that clean line, and it's the kind of thing where good-time credits are the hard case."
2003.02-9065,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,610.439,620.742,"So you think it does... so you think that if good-time credits were unequivocally involved here, that the Heck rule would apply?"
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,620.742,624.457,--I don't... I... I think that's what this Court's precedents would suggest.
2003.02-9065,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,641.464,649.349,"Well, this is... this is very strange when we... when the original idea, I thought, of Heck was typing the kind of claim."
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,723.281,735.048,"--Well, I... that's... part... along the lines of the argument the respondent makes in trying to use a... sort of a but-for kind of take, or test, or a relevance kind of test, but that is not the test."
2003.02-9065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,742.19,750.242,I... I thought your response to that was that provocation was no defense to the charge--
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,750.242,750.479,--That's right.
2003.02-9065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,750.479,751.561,--to the charge of insolence.
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,751.561,755.072,The respondent is... is arguing that... that it goes to credibility.
2003.02-9065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,758.105,769.145,"But is not your position, and I don't know that the other side has contested it, that provocation would not have been a defense to the charge of insolence?"
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,769.145,769.395,That's right.
2003.02-9065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,769.971,775.255,"And therefore, your provocation claim does not invalidate the insolence conviction."
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,775.255,776.841,"--There's... there's... that's correct, Justice Scalia."
2003.02-9065,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,778.144,783.596,"How... how do I decide that, because that, it seems to me, is why I kept thinking I'm having trouble with this case?"
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,783.596,783.967,--Well--
2003.02-9065,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,783.967,798.911,"It is inconceivable to me that under any law of any place that if a guard has gone and brought this whole thing about as a way of retaliating against a First Amendment right, I can't imagine a tribunal that wouldn't throw out the whole thing."
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,835.896,836.434,--And it is.
2003.02-9065,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,846.299,851.478,"You couldn't... you couldn't say, hearing examiner in the prison, I want to tell you something."
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,859.939,868.59,"--In fact, we actually... the hearing officer himself, in his deposition, which is at joint appendix 102 to 103, indicates he... he... retaliation was not a defense."
2003.02-9065,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,871.069,873.298,"No, but that's a... that's an issue of fact."
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,897.363,897.546,--It's--
2003.02-9065,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,897.546,905.908,--any state law authority for saying that so that we could make that assumption that you are correct in your statement when we decide this case?
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,905.908,909.419,"--To tell you the truth, I just assumed it as... as a logical matter."
2003.02-9065,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,912.141,931.626,"You assumed that in... in the... in the disciplinary proceeding for... that, let's say, in a disciplinary proceeding for insolence, he would not be... the prisoner would not have the opportunity of saying, he got me into this situation in retaliation for filing these actions?"
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,932.657,933.196,--Right.
2003.02-9065,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,947.435,949.293,But we're talking here about insolence.
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,951.855,953.38,--The... the hearing officer himself said that--
2003.02-9065,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,953.38,956.064,"Well, is there any state law authority that we could look to?"
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,956.064,958.581,--I'm not aware of any and I'm sorry that I--
2003.02-9065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,958.581,960.605,"Well, it doesn't seem unreasonable to me."
2003.02-9065,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,981.677,982.958,--But he doesn't admit that.
2003.02-9065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,982.958,984.156,--to resist the provocation.
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,984.156,985.521,--And in any event--
2003.02-9065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,985.521,986.551,What's so unreasonable about that?
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,986.551,996.954,--I think that what... whether we challenge the... the misconduct... the result of the misconduct proceeding in this case is really not relevant because--
2003.02-9065,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,996.954,1000.752,"Well, his... his complaint doesn't say the kind of thing you just said."
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,1037.161,1039.39,--The... the complaint is very clear.
2003.02-9065,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1055.82,1056.813,--This is the amended complaint.
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,1095.384,1102.631,"--Well, the two complaints are actually very similar, maybe identical, except for the... removing the request for expungement."
2003.02-9065,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1104.367,1114.648,"Well, isn't that a rather significant difference, because that says the whole thing is no good, the insolence is no better than the threatening, the whole thing is no good?"
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,1114.648,1117.37,--Mr. Muhammad was... was not represented by counsel.
2003.02-9065,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1125.172,1131.738,"But that's not what... that isn't the complaint that was before the Sixth Circuit, so at a minimum, shouldn't we send it back to the Sixth Circuit--"
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,1131.738,1132.075,--No.
2003.02-9065,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1132.075,1133.595,"--and say, look, you looked at the wrong complaint?"
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,1133.595,1136.029,"Well, it was the complaint that was before the Sixth Circuit."
2003.02-9065,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1140.487,1144.202,"Nonetheless, they ruled on a complaint that is not the one he was complaining about."
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,1144.202,1149.486,"But... but it doesn't matter, because they relied on Huey v. Stine and the case law in the Sixth Circuit."
2003.02-9065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1154.649,1157.721,Excuse me. All of this is relevant why?
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,1161.231,1161.519,--I don't--
2003.02-9065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1161.519,1166.143,Wasn't that issue waived by the other side and wasn't... wasn't there a finding?
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,1191.285,1192.028,--That's absolutely right.
2003.02-9065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1193.226,1193.68,So it's waived.
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,1195.166,1195.332,--Right.
2003.02-9065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1196.159,1204.248,"Especially having granted cert on a... on... on a significant question, to which that... that is... is preliminary."
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,1204.248,1217.994,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia, and if good-time credits are not at issue, it doesn't matter if we're challenging the insolence conviction, because nothing about this claim is going to affect the fact or duration of... of confinement, so that, you know--"
2003.02-9065,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1217.994,1221.875,"Though the state does dispute you on the good-time credit, does it not?"
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,1221.875,1223.278,--The state does dispute.
2003.02-9065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1225.507,1226.788,"But too late, but too late."
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,1229.184,1229.384,That is my point.
2003.02-9065,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1231.58,1231.796,Okay.
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,1236.964,1237.18,--Well--
2003.02-9065,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1237.18,1253.105,"--if you can chop up the... the action in that way, if all you're complaining about is six days that he spent in pre-trial detention and your winning on that would have nothing to do with anything else, would not set aside the rest of the... of the loss of good time or anything else, then you're obviously right."
2003.02-9065,0,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,1253.105,1253.577,--That's right.
2003.02-9065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1253.577,1254.591,That's what she says.
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1677.429,1688.12,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-9065,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1714.869,1718.296,Why didn't you waive the question of good-time credits?
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1721.723,1721.723,Yes.
2003.02-9065,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1721.723,1723.459,Why... why is this something we should consider?
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1723.459,1735.841,"First of all, we believe it's... it's a matter of straightforward statutory... not even interpretation, just reading the text of the Michigan statutes on good time, so it's not some fact issue that... that can be waived."
2003.02-9065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1736.75,1737.659,Excuse me?
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1740.548,1741.746,"--No, it's not a legal argument."
2003.02-9065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1749.753,1762.401,You did not... did you make the point below that the other side has to lose because he lost good-time credit?
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1762.401,1779.103,"In our first motion for summary judgment, which was in 1998, we argued that Heck and Edwards controlled the case, that he was in effect challenging his good... or his misconduct hearing determination."
2003.02-9065,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1804.328,1805.98,Then why isn't it waived?
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1805.98,1809.529,"Well, we submit it's... it's a straightforward matter."
2003.02-9065,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1820.758,1820.958,Okay.
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1831.122,1833.64,We did not argue it in those terms.
2003.02-9065,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1845.323,1854.611,"But your position... your position as I understand was that even if he did not lose any good-time credits, that you... nevertheless, Heck controls."
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1854.611,1855.271,--Yes.
2003.02-9065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1855.271,1856.757,And that's the question--
2003.02-9065,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1856.757,1857.379,--And that's what--
2003.02-9065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1857.379,1858.698,--on which we granted certiorari.
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1884.128,1884.704,Yes.
2003.02-9065,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1885.985,1893.992,"But even if you did, it's not in the case, none of it's in the case on the assumption your colleague there was making, or your opponent."
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1970.813,1972.299,"--Yes, that... that's correct."
2003.02-9065,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1980.472,1980.655,Fine.
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2026.641,2037.665,"--We argue that they are not separate, that the nature of this challenge does in fact necessarily imply the invalidity of his misconduct determination."
2003.02-9065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2095.455,2098.222,Is... is... is that so?
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2123.569,2132.773,The Heck v. Humphrey analysis says that there were certain claims that are not cognizable on a money damage action under 1983.
2003.02-9065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2146.026,2164.33,"I'm saying it... it does not affect it if he would have been convicted anyway, and the contention of the other side is that he was guilty of the offense, both the major offense, if he had been guilty of that, and the minor offense, regardless of whether there was provocation on the part of the guard."
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2164.33,2167.407,--Correct.
2003.02-9065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2170.008,2173.268,"Well, why... why do you... why do you assert the opposite?"
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2173.268,2186.066,"--Well, that... that implicates the element of the common law tort of malicious prosecution, as discussed in Heck and Edwards, and those elements include favorable termination and probable cause."
2003.02-9065,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2186.066,2198.903,But I think what you're not... this isn't an issue of whether provocation is a defense to a charge of insolence.
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2217.479,2226.107,"Well, if... if he's correct that this retaliation is independent of the hearing process, that's... that's his argument."
2003.02-9065,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2236.777,2239.399,Is not... not retaliation separate in the hearing process.
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2287.696,2305.695,"--Under Sixth Circuit law, to establish a claim for retaliation, there has to be protective conduct that the inmate engaged in and there has to be adverse action taken against that plaintiff that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage--"
2003.02-9065,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2305.695,2305.878,Fine.
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2307.697,2307.852,--But that's--
2003.02-9065,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2307.852,2312.765,--of the prisoner that's retaliation is that... that... has to do with that--
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2312.765,2313.508,"--No, conduct of the guard."
2003.02-9065,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2313.508,2316.646,"--would be his threatening look, but not his insolent look."
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2316.646,2331.878,"If this situation had proceeded exactly as petitioner alleges up to the point where they were nose to nose for a few seconds and then they had both walked away, there would be no retaliation claim, there would be no constitutional violation at all."
2003.02-9065,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2379.144,2391.693,"But the Sixth Circuit was addressing a complaint that looked like it was attacking the whole thing, because it asked for expungement of the disciplinary... of the disciplinary action."
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2402.55,2405.689,The Sixth Circuit issued its order.
2003.02-9065,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2413.779,2417.206,You could have made a motion to remand or something.
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2417.206,2418.237,"--We could have, but we did not."
2003.02-9065,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2423.522,2432.605,"Well, do you aggrieve, looking at the Sixth Circuit opinion, that it was examining the original complaint, not the amended complaint?"
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2432.605,2452.107,"It referred to the original complaint, but the... the holding of the Sixth Circuit on page 106 of the joint appendix, they say in an earlier Sixth Circuit case, and they quote it, in order to grant the plaintiff in this case the release he... relief he seeks, we would have to unwind the judgment of the state agency."
2003.02-9065,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2456.465,2467.035,"I thought you agreed that the Sixth Circuit was looking at the initial, original complaint, not the amended."
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2467.035,2470.09,That they... they mentioned the initial complaint and not the amended complaint.
2003.02-9065,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2470.683,2471.243,Yeah.
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2471.243,2483.382,"But we believe that the rationale that they used, that his challenge did implicate the validity of his misconduct hearing, is correct on both his original complaint and his amended complaint."
2003.02-9065,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2483.382,2485.24,May I ask you a hypothetical question?
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2508.524,2511.246,"Yes, we believe... that's the question the Court granted cert on."
2003.02-9065,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2513.287,2514.097,And that's the one we probably ought to hear some argument about.
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2514.097,2515.061,--That's... that's correct.
2003.02-9065,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2520.905,2522.392,And why would it preclude relief in that case?
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2523.589,2543.568,"--Because as in the Edwards v. Balisok and... and Heck v. Humphrey, the proper method of analysis is to look to the most closely analogous common law tort, look to traditions of common law, public policy considerations in light of the purposes of Section 1983."
2003.02-9065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2561.417,2581.546,"More than the facts of the case, we... the reason we... we... we adopted that common law rule was to prevent a collision between 1983 and habeas corpus law and prevent 1983 from being used as an end-run around habeas corpus limitations."
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2581.546,2591.743,"--Again, on... on the facts of the case, that's... that was the situation presented, because in that case there was a collision between the habeas statutes and the 1983--"
2003.02-9065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2591.743,2593.313,And that collision was... was in the reasoning of the Court.
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2594.056,2594.428,"--Yes, it was."
2003.02-9065,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2609.167,2621.343,"--So that even if setting a... a ruling in favor of the plaintiff would not in any way call into question the prison disciplinary proceeding, it still should... Heck should still apply?"
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2621.343,2621.92,No.
2003.02-9065,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2655.894,2676.533,"Well, it looked like the Sixth Circuit is on the short side of a five-to-one split among the courts of appeals on how Heck v. Humphrey is to be applied, that the Sixth Circuit views it differently than the other circuits that have addressed it."
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2676.533,2678.641,I believe that's correct.
2003.02-9065,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2678.641,2678.878,Do you agree?
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2678.878,2679.588,I believe that's correct.
2003.02-9065,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2679.588,2680.681,"Yeah, based on--"
2003.02-9065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2680.681,2680.819,--How... how is--
2003.02-9065,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2680.819,2695.896,"--its own Huey decision, and I really thought very likely that was why this Court granted cert here, to see whether the Sixth Circuit rule is out of step with what we said in Heck v. Humphrey."
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2695.896,2718.02,"The Sixth Circuit, and all of the court of appeals' decisions that have attempted to apply the Heck v. Humphrey analysis to conditions cases, are necessarily involved in... in extension of the Heck rationale to this other factual context, because Heck and Edwards involved good-time losses."
2003.02-9065,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2736.597,2741.593,"But, of course, that conceivably was waived, because you didn't get into it below."
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2766.569,2771.148,--A... a claim for damages cannot go forward unless there's favorable termination.
2003.02-9065,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2781.345,2784.317,I don't see the difference in the Sixth Circuit rule anymore.
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2794.393,2795.357,That's... that's correct.
2003.02-9065,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2795.357,2816.722,"--that the Sixth Circuit simply thought that if this individual wins, if Mr. Muhammad wins, they would have to unwind the entire judgment of the hearing, which would include the judgment having to do with insolence."
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2816.722,2818.308,That's correct.
2003.02-9065,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2818.308,2820.892,And so if that's what they base it on--
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2820.892,2821.841,That's correct.
2003.02-9065,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2821.841,2825.079,--is their rule different from that of any other circuit?
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2825.079,2838.353,The way the Sixth Circuit is different from most of the other circuits is that they apply the Heck v. Humphrey analysis to punishments of conditions and not just to punishments affecting the duration of confinement.
2003.02-9065,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2838.353,2840.461,What is the condition--
2003.02-9065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2840.461,2840.999,--They meaning the Sixth Circuit?
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2840.999,2845.457,"The Sixth Circuit applies it to conditions, punishments, and duration punishments."
2003.02-9065,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2845.457,2847.026,What do you mean by a conditions punishment?
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2847.026,2862.341,"The... the punishments that Mr. Muhammad received were the loss of good time, confinement to administrative segregation, essentially remaining in his cell, plus loss of privileges for 30 days."
2003.02-9065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2866.965,2870.021,"--Thus, only the loss of good time could have been challenged in habeas?"
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2870.021,2871.052,Correct.
2003.02-9065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2871.052,2873.531,And the conditions couldn't have been challenged in habeas?
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2873.531,2873.781,Correct.
2003.02-9065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2873.781,2874.646,And that's the distinction--
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2874.646,2876.382,The distinction in this case--
2003.02-9065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2876.382,2878.323,--that the other circuits think is crucial?
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2878.323,2878.877,--Correct.
2003.02-9065,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2890.954,2895.579,And it... it's your position that there should be no remedy whatever for this person?
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2895.579,2899.089,It's our position that if he is--
2003.02-9065,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2899.089,2903.175,If... if... we're disregarding the good-time credits.

2003.02-9065,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2933.724,2934.754,And other circuits disagree.
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2943.133,2944.414,--Correct.
2003.02-9065,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2944.414,2945.49,That's the difference?
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2945.49,2945.9,Correct.
2003.02-9065,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3008.565,3015.874,"And the condition here... and one thing is the abstract level on which you're speaking, the other is concretely what this case is about."
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3042.911,3046.748,--Some... some major misconducts are mandatory non-bondable.
2003.02-9065,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3049.886,3050.835,So insolence is not mandatory.
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3055.27,3078.083,"--On... on page 14 of the joint appendix we've quoted from the policy directive, and the standard is, if there is a reasonable showing that failure to do so would constitute a threat to the security or good order of the facility, so on a case-by-case basis, a prisoner charged with a bondable major misconduct could be placed in pre-hearing detention."
2003.02-9065,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3078.083,3082.624,"--Well, when you say bondable, I mean, you don't mean if a person posts a bond they're out on the street?"
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3082.624,3082.996,"No, no."
2003.02-9065,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3086.256,3090.593,"But that's what this case is about, those six days when he was in administrative detention."
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3090.593,3094.103,Those are the six days for which he is seeking damages.
2003.02-9065,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3094.103,3116.022,"And... and do you have, rather than being in the general prison population, do you have any statistical indication of... on charges of insolence, are people more often than not, or is it rare that they would be in administrative detention awaiting the hearing?"
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3116.022,3123.453,"I... I don't have the statistics of... the Department of Corrections probably could compile that, but I don't know."
2003.02-9065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3140.171,3151.522,"But was... was this argument raised below that there's no cause of action because there's no assurance that he wouldn't have been kept for six days anyway, even if it was bondable?"
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3153.38,3156.352,"It was not argued in those terms, no."
2003.02-9065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3158.293,3159.286,Why do we want to get into that?
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3160.195,3160.567,--No.

2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3186.656,3187.194,Correct.
2003.02-9065,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3187.194,3191.031,"Now, we look to see what happens if he wins."
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3223.231,3252.294,"Our response to that in... in... in response to the question that the Court granted certiorari on is that even if good time was not at issue in the case, if the only punishment he received affected the conditions of confinement, our argument is, it's still appropriate to look to the traditions of the common law and public policy considerations to determine whether a cause of action in those circumstances is cognizable in 1983."

2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3307.899,3320.159,--One of the elements of the constitutional cause of action for retaliation is adverse action against the prisoner because of his protective conduct.
2003.02-9065,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3349.488,3369.533,"So that you say basically, the importance of Heck and Humphrey here is the way it says you ought to refer to common law analogies in analyzing whether there ought to be a 1983 action, and that has nothing to do in the final analysis with whether there's a collision between habeas corpus and 1983."
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3375.766,3376.675,"Yes, that's correct."
2003.02-9065,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3376.675,3381.793,"So that even though there isn't a habeas corpus problem, you still go through the same methodology?"
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3381.793,3382.331,Correct.
2003.02-9065,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3387.244,3394.469,Are you essentially making an exhaustion of... of state remedies then?
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3408.67,3409.042,--Yes.
2003.02-9065,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3409.042,3411.437,--or are you saying 1983 is premature?

2003.02-9065,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3414.742,3416.805,Where does he get the favorable determination?

2003.02-9065,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3426.836,3433.895,"So you're saying essentially he hasn't exhausted his internal administrative remedies, and that's why the 1983 is improper?"
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3433.895,3439.179,We say the... his failure to exhaust is another independent reason why he does not have--
2003.02-9065,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3439.179,3442.03,You're saying he has to both exhaust and prevail?
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3442.03,3442.773,--That's correct.
2003.02-9065,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3444.442,3452.432,"And that seems somewhat inconsistent with at least the negative implication of the Federal statute, which says all he has to do is exhaust."
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3452.432,3468.945,"Well, the... the Court addressed that question in Heck v. Humphrey, and it said that even if a person exhausts his remedies, if he has not favorably terminated, he cannot bring the lawsuit unless and until he gets favorable termination."
2003.02-9065,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3472.002,3475.717,"Well, that's the Heck v. Humphrey's gloss, but that's an additional requirement."
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3479.515,3481.539,"--Well, that's correct."
2003.02-9065,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3487.939,3488.072,Yes.
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3488.072,3489.27,--malicious prosecution.
2003.02-9065,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3489.27,3489.558,Right.
2003.02-9065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3489.558,3499.551,"It... it usually does not require prevailing, but it does require prevailing when... when your cause of action is that... that you have been subjected to the law improperly."
2003.02-9065,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3499.551,3500.332,That's correct.

2003.02-9065,2,18542,corinne_a_beckwith,,3505.328,3520.726,"Turning to the actual question presented in this case, there is no justification for the Sixth Circuit's rule extending the Heck favorable termination requirement to prison hearings that don't involve the fact or duration of custody."
