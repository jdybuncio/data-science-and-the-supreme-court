1970.109,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,20.055,"We'll hear argument next in Number 109, Time Incorporated against Pape."
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,20.055,20.844,Mr. Chief Justice --
1970.109,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,20.844,22.838,Mr. Reuben you may proceed whenever you are ready.
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,22.838,25.769,-- may it please the Court.
1970.109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,403.526,405.25,It wasn't just a negligent omission.
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,409.905,415.124,"Well, I think Captain Pape would call it “deliberate,” I call it “conscious” omission."
1970.109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,415.124,416.037,"Well, of his knowing anyway."
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,416.037,417.196,"Yes, absolutely."
1970.109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,417.196,418.196,He knew exactly what he was doing?
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,418.196,420.585,Absolutely.
1970.109,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,421.313,430.895,"After our -- after this Court's decision in Monroe against Pape, did Mr. Monroe proceed in his action against Mr. Pape?"
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,430.895,432.845,"Yes, he did, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1970.109,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,447.493,450.18,"It happened, however, after the institution of this libel suit?"
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,450.18,459.22,Yes sir and that was called to Seventh Circuit's attention and they said that it was of not any relevance in this cause.
1970.109,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,459.22,464.345,"Well, despite the chronology, you think it's of any relevance or not?"
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,464.345,466.034,I certainly do.
1970.109,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,478.565,482.963,"Well, not guilty perhaps, but not beyond the preponderance of -- by a preponderance of the evidence, he is civilly liable?"
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,482.963,487.355,We used the term guilty in the suit [Attempt to Laughter] of course in Chicago.
1970.109,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,487.355,497.227,"I suppose it might be argued contra that the article contributed to that result, and I say argued?"
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,497.227,503.83,"Well, I suspect that, that was something that Captain Pape would have addressed to the Court in the Monroe versus Pape."
1970.109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,509.839,523.657,"Well, of course the officer might have been found guilty of or found liable for violating Civil Rights without having committed the acts which are alleged in the story?"
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,523.657,524.97,"That's correct, Mr. Justice White."
1970.109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,524.97,526.761,"Which is really a rather critical point, isn't it?"
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,526.761,539.082,"Well, I suggest to you that the courts looked to the sting of the article and sting of the article was it violated the Civil Rights of the Monroes which is the sting of the burden."
1970.109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,539.082,549.514,"Well I know, but I mean to recover it all on libel suit, you just don't find whether somebody was stung or not stung, you find whether some statements were true or untrue among other things?"
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,549.514,563.367,"As I understand the law of libel, a substantial truth is allowed and if the gist of the libel is a violation of the Civil Rights of Monroe --"
1970.109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,563.367,575.127,"Well, I gather though if it had been found in this case that, at least it can be said that the report that was published was a false report of the what was said in the Civil Rights report?"
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,575.127,575.699,This is what --
1970.109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,575.699,576.439,"Well, that's one step."
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,576.439,577.23,-- Court of Appeals.
1970.109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,577.23,586.68,"And secondly it was -- it must have been found by the jury that the statements substantively were false, some of them anyway?"
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,586.68,588.772,The case never went to the jury.
1970.109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,596.853,601.116,Was it never been found in this case substantively?
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,601.116,601.747,That's correct.
1970.109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,601.747,605.401,Whether any of the statements in the Civil Rights Report are true or false?
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,605.401,607.155,That's correct.
1970.109,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,617.482,619.552,I think we should perhaps Mr. Reuben test that.
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,630.639,639.464,"I do not concede it, but the District Judge assumed it for the purpose of deciding the motion at the close of all the evidence."
1970.109,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,639.464,642.08,"I know, but I am taking about your position?"
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,642.08,644.751,My position is I do not concede that it is false.
1970.109,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,644.751,648.054,So what you say there is no false statement in the article?
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,648.054,650.764,"That is correct, but I don't think that's before Court."
1970.109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,653.025,655.297,And (Inaudible)
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,655.297,658.355,"I think you have to, I have to be candid."
1970.109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,658.355,660.505,Yes.
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,660.505,661.275,After the --
1970.109,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,661.275,662.905,(Inaudible)
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,662.905,668.806,Because the District Judge did not -- no trier of fact has decided that.
1970.109,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,670.841,675.125,But we never get to New York times rule unless of course (Inaudible)
1970.109,0,21443,don_h_reuben,,675.125,683.041,"That's why you have to assume it's false and the question is actual malice, that's the issue that the District Judge went off on here."
1970.109,1,37831,patrick_w_dunne,,1544.116,1551.789,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.109,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1595.992,1603.452,"Well, I thought -- I thought the posture of the case is finally moot to the point where they said, “Yes we're wrong, but we had no malice?”"
1970.109,1,37831,patrick_w_dunne,,1603.452,1617.664,"They said that they intentionally stated something different than the Commission report, but that they had the right to do it and could do it and were not wrong."
1970.109,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1674.806,1696.437,"When you distinguish this from a case if the -- where the writer had put the word alleged in but the fellow who took the print together, down in the print shop, inadvertently drafted because it was at the end of a line."
1970.109,1,37831,patrick_w_dunne,,1696.437,1698.88,"Makes all the difference in the world, Mr. Chief Justice."
1970.109,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1698.88,1702.366,"And what is the difference, what would that do to the case?"
1970.109,1,37831,patrick_w_dunne,,1702.366,1715.079,"The man who inadvertently, in a print shop, drops out the word Allege is doing an unintentional act, doing unintentional act whereas --"
1970.109,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1715.079,1716.612,So it bears only on malice.
1970.109,1,37831,patrick_w_dunne,,1716.612,1721.679,"It bears only on malice, it truly bears only on malice, but that is an unintentional act."
1970.109,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1736.315,1740.847,"Well, doesn't it come out exactly the same as far as the reader is concerned?"
1970.109,1,37831,patrick_w_dunne,,1740.847,1757.554,"Well, it comes out quite the same but my point is that we do agree, we do agree that this Court, we do agree that New York Times, Mr. Sullivan, this Court said that there must be malice and malice is of course, the known falsity or the reckless disregard on whether or not the falsity is true or not."
1970.109,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1757.554,1772.455,"Well, then we move from there, do we not to the question of whether the conscious choice to drop the word alleged is a proof of a malice or evidence of malice, don't we?"
1970.109,1,37831,patrick_w_dunne,,1772.455,1785.504,"Surely, surely and what could be a better proof of malice than have someone, have someone knowingly report something different from another document."
1970.109,2,21443,don_h_reuben,,3186.569,3188.311,I do not consider it irrelevant.
1970.109,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3193.688,3196.843,Is every policeman a public official?
1970.109,2,21443,don_h_reuben,,3196.843,3200.301,I would think so but I don't think you have to reach it here.
1970.109,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3229.661,3233.801,You say you don't have to decide whether the driver of a car wasn't public official?
1970.109,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3233.801,3236.302,Not in this case.
1970.109,2,21443,don_h_reuben,,3238.715,3244.931,Mr. Dunne argues malice from the tone of the article.
1970.109,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3324.751,3327.126,The knowledge of falsity of what Mr. Reuben?
1970.109,2,21443,don_h_reuben,,3327.126,3330.414,Knowledge of falsity of the ultimate facts.
1970.109,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3331.289,3332.066,Well let's assume --
1970.109,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3332.066,3339.115,Assume that you take out the word allegedly other than that he believed it was wrong?
1970.109,2,21443,don_h_reuben,,3339.115,3366.208,"He believed -- in his testimony as he believed that in the context of justice that the word alleged were simply a device, an editorial device of the Civil Rights Commission to introduce or discuss the Pape case in the language of Mr. Justice Frankfurter, which the Commission was apparently smitten with or at least thought was an accurate –-"
1970.109,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3366.208,3372.732,Why is that there was an imperative need of him to take out the word allegedly?
1970.109,2,21443,don_h_reuben,,3376.044,3402.866,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I don't think there was an imperative need but I suggest to you that if the case is going to go off on whether there was an imperative need, then you truly have a chilling effect on pruning it if a court can come back after some years, in this case ten years after the fact and say, well, there's a better way to say this."
1970.109,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3402.866,3412.376,"You mean it's a chilling effect on Time Magazine, when they printing a direct quote and should leave it as it is, what's chilling about that?"
1970.109,2,21443,don_h_reuben,,3412.376,3436.723,"I suggest to you that the chilling effect is to say the Time Magazine that although you honestly thought this was true, you should have stated it a different way and because you didn't state it a different way, because we disagree what your editorial judgment that you are guilty of actual malice, you are guilty of knowledge of falsity."
1970.109,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3462.072,3481.719,"Mr. Reuben, in this case if Time Magazine not only was conscious of what it was doing but knew that it was misstating the Commission's Report but it believed in the truth in good faith of the underlying allegations, what then?"
1970.109,2,21443,don_h_reuben,,3481.719,3487.743,"I say there is no liability, there's nothing submissible to the jury because –-"
1970.109,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3487.743,3503.216,"And so the Time Magazine is perfectly free as long as it believes –- as long as it says we have good faith belief in the underlying allegations, Time Magazine is free to say anything it wants to about the Civil Rights Commission's Report?"
1970.109,2,21443,don_h_reuben,,3503.216,3518.484,"Within the context of what it believes to be true, within the context of what –- of course that isn't this case, but within the context of what it believes to be true, it can't go on and say, Captain Pape, according to the Civil Rights Commission did many other incidents."
1970.109,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3538.322,3540.925,Is that critical to your case in a --
1970.109,2,21443,don_h_reuben,,3540.925,3543.988,"No, I don't think it is in this case, absolutely not."
1970.109,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3574.4,3575.552,Thank you Mr. Reuben.
