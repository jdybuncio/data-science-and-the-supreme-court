1969.85,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.457,"Number 85, Association of Data Processing Service Organizations against Camp."
1969.85,0,17669,bert_m_gross,,17.354,21.077,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,239.99,244.72,They might have had it without that regulation.
1969.85,0,17669,bert_m_gross,,244.72,245.111,If they have --
1969.85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,245.111,249.001,Let’s assume that it just started out doing it.
1969.85,0,17669,bert_m_gross,,249.001,255.827,"If they have authority under the acts of Congress Your Honor, they would not need the specific authorization."
1969.85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,255.827,258.385,So the question is the statutes?
1969.85,0,17669,bert_m_gross,,258.385,264.157,"That’s correct, the question is statutory authority."
1969.85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,762.627,771.792,"Under your view of the standing issue, would you, would be not reach the merits namely the question of the authority that comptroller to authorize?"
1969.85,0,17669,bert_m_gross,,771.792,775.591,"No Your Honor, not in this situation."
1969.85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,775.591,776.904,A case should go back to the Court of Appeals.
1969.85,0,17669,bert_m_gross,,776.904,780.242,A case would go back for trial.
1969.85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,870.384,875.231,What bearing do you think the Flast case has?
1969.85,0,17669,bert_m_gross,,875.231,884.607,"Your Honor, I feel that Flast v. Cohen shows a philosophy of standing that would grant standing in this case."
1969.85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,995.561,1002.551,"Well, suppose there are some trial cases of the court that would have been decided differently under your theory?"
1969.85,0,17669,bert_m_gross,,1002.551,1008.257,Not under the narrow scope of statutory aid to standing Your Honor under the broad --
1969.85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1008.257,1014.374,"You mean they -- we must -- for you to win, must we buy the bank service corporation approach?"
1969.85,0,17669,bert_m_gross,,1014.374,1018.315,"No, we have two basic issues Your Honor."
1969.85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1018.315,1024.246,You’re saying that it isn’t enough for standing just to show an economic injury?
1969.85,0,17669,bert_m_gross,,1024.246,1027.249,I think it is if you overrule about three to four cases of this Court.
1969.85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1027.249,1028.617,Are you urging that we do that?
1969.85,0,17669,bert_m_gross,,1028.617,1033.008,"Yes, Your Honor and in our brief we have set forth that rather extensively."
1969.85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1045.107,1048.946,"But accepting those cases, you still think you have pending in this case?"
1969.85,0,17669,bert_m_gross,,1048.946,1055.668,"Yes, following Tennessee Electric Power, we think we have standing under the doctrine of statutory aid to standing."
1969.85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1055.668,1058.106,When the statutory aid is under the bank service corporation?
1969.85,0,17669,bert_m_gross,,1058.106,1059.154,That is correct.
1969.85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1059.154,1060.219,That’s the only source?
1969.85,0,17669,bert_m_gross,,1060.219,1064.266,"That’s the only statute we rely on, Your Honor."
1969.85,1,16789,alan_s_rosenthal,,1192.311,1196.739,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.85,2,17669,bert_m_gross,,2917.309,2919.024,Thank you.
1969.85,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2998.887,3002.213,"There you’re getting at the merits, aren’t you?"
1969.85,2,17669,bert_m_gross,,3002.213,3011.096,"No, Senator Bush is saying that again that we should not authorize banks to go into competition."
1969.85,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3120.728,3125.404,"Thank you Mr. Gross, thank you Mr. Rosenthal for your submissions."
