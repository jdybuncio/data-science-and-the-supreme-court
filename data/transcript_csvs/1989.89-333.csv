1989.89-333,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.106,"We'll hear argument next in Number 89-333, California v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission."
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,11.139,13.391,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,154.25,161.32,"Well, literally I take it you would say then that the state would have the authority... the authority to require a license from the state."
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,161.32,162.356,"Yes, that is correct."
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,164.039,167.308,Even though it's licensed by the--
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,167.308,169.776,--By the... by FERC under the Federal Power Act.
1989.89-333,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,184.602,193.291,"--Well, Mr. Claps, what's... what has been happening as a practical matter in the years since the First Iowa decision?"
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,201.814,202.714,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-333,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,235.468,241.189,And have minimum flow requirements been imposed by the state since First Iowa?
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,241.189,246.193,"--The states, especially in California, routinely impose minimum flow requirements."
1989.89-333,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,246.76,257.901,"And if those minimum flow requirements make the project economically infeasible, as is alleged here, that's all right?"
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,257.901,258.483,--That is correct.
1989.89-333,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,287.003,298.043,"Do you think that's the... the language and understanding of First Iowa, which seemed to take a very restrictive view of the meaning of this particular provision?"
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,298.043,302.513,"Well, first, in First Iowa, we think that the Court's discussion of Section 27, Justice O'Connor, was dictum."
1989.89-333,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,302.513,303.513,"Well, I know you think that."
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,303.513,304.549,Because the--
1989.89-333,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,304.549,314.237,"But, let's... let's look at what the Court said, nonetheless, and didn't the Court at least articulate a very restrictive view of the meaning of the Section?"
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,314.237,315.187,"--Yes, it did."
1989.89-333,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,331.116,335.318,"Moreover, you're telling me that nobody's been paying any attention to it."
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,335.318,341.638,The reality is that hydropower projects have in fact complied with both Federal water law and state water law.
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,352.279,355.731,And another reason is it was perfectly feasible and easy to do so.
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,364.337,366.539,"Well, we... we don't believe that that's the case, Justice White."
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,366.539,367.972,"I know, but I said arguably."
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,367.972,368.855,"Okay, well--"
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,368.855,370.107,Let's assume that it would.
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,370.107,370.641,--Okay.
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,379.713,380.03,Uh-huh.
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,380.03,385.584,Our view in this case is that the Court's decision in First Iowa... the analysis of Section 27--
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,385.584,387.202,Would allow the state to have a veto.
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,387.202,387.919,--Would allow the state to have a veto.
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,387.919,390.404,And that is... I think that's your outright argument in your brief.
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,390.404,391.12,"Yes, that's correct."
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,394.606,395.072,I know.
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,395.072,401.462,The state has simply imposed conditions that require the project to meet higher flow requirements than those contained in the FERC license.
1989.89-333,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,401.462,408.116,"Well, now what... what do we know about the effect of those higher flow requirements imposed by the state on the feasibility of this project?"
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,408.116,417.388,"I don't think... as far as I know, Justice... or Mr. Chief Justice, I don't believe that there's any evidence in the record concerning the effect of these conditions on economic feasibility."
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,432.664,436.449,"Well... evidence or not, the court of appeals thought that it would amount to a veto."
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,436.449,439.385,"Well, yes, the court of appeals said that potentially that could happen."
1989.89-333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,461.084,471.039,What... what state laws do you think are affected by the Federal Power Act?
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,471.039,472.072,What's... I... do--
1989.89-333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,472.072,475.676,What state laws are preempted by the Federal Power Act?
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,475.676,481.83,--In our view the... the state laws that would be preempted are those that are in contrary... contrary to clear congressional directives.
1989.89-333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,484.932,486.866,Such... such as?
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,486.866,493.388,"--Well, I... as I recall, I think there is a provision in the Federal Power Act for example that prohibits monopolies or restraints of trade."
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,503.511,507.196,"Well, why wouldn't Section 27 then permit it?"
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,507.196,509.481,--Section 27 on its face would.
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,517.886,534.299,"Well, that's... that's all First Iowa, I suppose, meant that if... if Congress clearly authorized the FERC to... to build a project, the state couldn't prevent it."
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,534.299,536.449,--I... I think that's clearly the expectation of Congress.
1989.89-333,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,585.898,592.068,How do... how do you describe under California law the state's interest here?
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,604.793,613.799,"There's specific statutes that protect the public interest in water for in-stream uses, and particularly for the protection of fish, Justice Kennedy."
1989.89-333,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,630.111,640.282,"If... if you have a riparian owner who wishes to use the water, and the state has an interest in preserving fishing, does that come out of the public trust doctrine or just--"
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,640.282,650.257,"No, it, comes... the riparian doctrine has been so modified in California now that the same conditions that apply to appropriated use also apply to riparian use as well."
1989.89-333,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,651.357,651.707,--All right.
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,662.065,672.688,"--Well, the state interest in that case would be to reassess the appropriated right in order to protect the fish needs to the extent that the state determines that fish needs have to be protected under those circumstances."
1989.89-333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,679.941,682.793,"But, what about putting hydropower development into business?"
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,692.982,693.601,That's right.
1989.89-333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,693.601,714.015,"So, I presume then, if you read this Section 27 the way you read it, California can license a hydroelectric plant that does not have the approval of FERC because it says nothing herein shall be construed to affect or intended to affect in any way, or in any way interfere with the laws of the respect... with respect to what you say are in-stream uses."
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,714.015,714.531,That is correct.
1989.89-333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,714.947,716.115,"So, you don't need a FERC license."
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,718.632,720.501,--But the project couldn't operate.
1989.89-333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,720.501,720.934,Why?
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,720.934,722.751,Because it... it wouldn't have the FERC license.
1989.89-333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,722.751,723.736,You don't need the FERC license.
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,732.726,739.73,"If you were to read Section 27 in the abstract and devoid of anything else in the Federal Power Act, you would come to that conclusion, Justice Scalia."
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,739.73,740.665,That's the way you read it.
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,740.665,741.382,"No, that's not the way you would read it."
1989.89-333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,754.49,759.459,But this says nothing herein contained shall be construed as affecting or intending to affect.
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,759.459,761.245,I... I understand your point.
1989.89-333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,763.145,763.995,"Well, I know you don't."
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,763.995,765.063,That's... that's an argument to which--
1989.89-333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,765.063,777.771,"But... but it seems to me if you... if you allow this language to cover in-stream uses, and... and I don't see any difference in that regard from preserving fish or generating power... it seems to me you've got the whole act."
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,783.075,784.492,"--No, that's not correct."
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,784.492,785.111,Oh?
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,787.896,791.348,Some of the lands involved here are Federal lands and some are private lands.
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,791.348,791.765,--I see.
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,791.765,794.633,But the Federal lands are administered by the BLM; they're not forest lands.
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,794.633,795.233,"Well, I know."
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,795.733,800.286,"But they are, say, partially Federal and partially private."
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,800.286,803.072,Where is this project?
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,803.072,808.976,It's... it's... it's a long project that... that covers both public lands and private lands.
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,810.259,810.542,Right.
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,810.542,813.261,"--but, as I say, part of the land is Federal and part of the land is private."
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,894.515,904.788,"Do you think... do you think, really, that on the facts of California that it was inconsistent with First Iowa?"
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,904.788,905.973,On the facts of California?
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,905.973,906.456,Yeah.
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,906.456,907.34,"No, we... we think--"
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,907.34,909.842,"Well, let me... let me put another way."
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,924.767,927.053,"--Well, if I understand your question, I think the answer is yes."
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,932.271,935.742,Under... under... in first Iowa?
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,935.742,938.694,"Not as... not as interpreted by First Iowa, no."
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,939.844,940.344,"Well, I know, but--"
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,940.344,940.911,--the Court said that--
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,940.911,943.746,--what was the... what was the use involved in--
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,943.746,944.598,--In California?
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,944.598,946.198,"--No, in First Iowa?"
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,946.198,947.717,Or in First Iowa?
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,952.169,953.204,Been an irrigation dam?
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,953.204,959.624,--Would have done... virtually prohibited all dams that would have impaired fish in any respect whatsoever.
1989.89-333,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,959.624,964.726,"They also said that you had to get a license from the state, didn't they, in First Iowa?"
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,966.844,969.546,I don't recall that the Court said that--
1989.89-333,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,969.546,971.498,"But I mean, I thought that the State of Iowa had said--"
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,971.498,972.248,"--Oh, the State of Iowa--"
1989.89-333,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,972.248,972.615,--had said that.
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,972.615,973.215,--I'm sorry.
1989.89-333,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,973.215,974.534,Yeah.
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,974.534,984.573,"Yes, the... the State of Iowa in the First Iowa case argued that Section 9(b) of the Federal Power Act requires the hydropower project to go to the state to get a permit."
1989.89-333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1042.928,1045.213,Why do you say it was dictum in... in--
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1045.213,1064.008,"Well, because the actual holding in First Iowa was that Section 9(b) of the act simply imposed an informational requirement only and, therefore, that Section 9(b) in itself did not require a hydropower project to obtain a state water right as a condition precedent to getting a FERC license."
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1113.441,1122.713,"--[inaudible] suggesting that if we have another view of the... the... of what was said in First Iowa, that we overrule it."
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1124.415,1125.398,We don't ask that.
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1128.7,1133.086,"Well, I know, but what if we... what if we think it isn't just dictum as you say, that it's holding."
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1135.238,1149.614,--We want the Court to disavow the dictum of... in First Iowa in the same way that in the California case the Court disavowed the dictum of two prior cases that had interpreted Section 8 as limited to proprietary rights.
1989.89-333,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1211.088,1230.083,"Now, Mr. Walston, the court in the State Energy Resources Conservation case and in the LaJolla Band of Mission Indians case has described its view taken in First Iowa."
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1250.313,1257.169,"--Well, I... I don't believe that that... the holding, or the language that you're describing is central to those decisions, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-333,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1277.347,1290.056,"Well, then in the state... in State Energy Resources the Court said that allowing states to veto Federal decisions could destroy the effectiveness of the Federal act, meaning the Federal Power Act."
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1290.056,1290.906,I... I don't--
1989.89-333,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1290.906,1296.294,And it had similar language in the LaJolla Band of Mission Indians case.
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1296.294,1303.031,"--That... I... I can only respond, Justice O'Connor, that that was not the intent of Congress in 1920 when it passed the Federal Power Act."
1989.89-333,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1326.48,1337.871,"Well, Congress has had before it now the language in First Iowa and the subsequent references, and has done nothing to change that scheme."
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1337.871,1340.323,"Well, the... no, I... I must respectfully--"
1989.89-333,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1340.323,1340.656,For a good many years.
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1340.656,1343.358,"--I must respectfully disagree, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-333,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1357.166,1360.218,But we assume Congress knows about these cases--
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1360.218,1360.82,--Well--
1989.89-333,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1360.82,1361.37,--don't we?
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1361.37,1372.46,"--Well, certainly Congress knows about it, but I'm not sure that congressional inaction that takes place several generations later is relevant in construing the original meaning of Congress in 1920."
1989.89-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1383.583,1384.102,May I ask this question?
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1395.91,1406.766,"--Well, our... our view is that... no, we're not asking... we're simply asking the Court to consider and decide this case in the same way that it considered and decided the case of California v. United States."
1989.89-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1406.766,1410.752,But wouldn't you have done the same thing if California v. United States had never been decided?
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1411.952,1412.919,"Well, I--"
1989.89-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1412.919,1413.871,Didn't that suggest to you--
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1413.871,1414.371,--wait--
1989.89-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1414.371,1416.154,--an argument that none of these 49 states had thought--
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1416.154,1416.573,--We certainly--
1989.89-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1416.573,1417.723,--has thought of it for several years?
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1417.723,1425.512,"--We certainly... we certainly would probably would have pressed the issue, but I... I don't think that we would have gotten as far as we have gotten today... and we certainly wouldn't the mean argument."
1989.89-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1425.512,1426.012,xxx.
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1426.012,1426.545,Pardon me?
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1426.545,1427.662,You mean you've lost so far?
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1427.662,1428.547,"Yes, that's right."
1989.89-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1432.433,1441.455,I thought it was your... your submission that California had in effect changed the... the law and now everybody was getting on the bandwagon to make sure we take advantage of this change.
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1441.455,1449.044,"--Well, no, we... we simply ask this Court to interpret Section 27 in the same way the Court interpreted Section 8."
1989.89-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1449.894,1450.394,With a different statute.
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1450.394,1454.679,--have joined us is because the states feel very strongly about the issues.
1989.89-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1454.679,1457.364,But not strong enough to go to Congress on... on the point?
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1457.364,1461.935,"Well, perhaps... you know, if all else fails, then there's certainly that remedy available to the states."
1989.89-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1462.335,1465.054,"But this is the first place you go to get a change in the law, in other words?"
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1465.487,1469.874,"--Well, it's... it's... we don't think that we're getting a change in the law."
1989.89-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1475.945,1480.897,And contrary to the way the Court interpreted whether it's dictum or not in a case of about 40 years ago.
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1480.897,1489.852,"--Yes, but what has changed, Justice Stevens, I think, is that in California v. United States this Court took another look at those issues."
1989.89-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1489.852,1490.704,In a different statute.
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1492.721,1494.989,"Well, it wasn't... no, and it wasn't called on to."
1989.89-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1514.237,1516.837,But he's quite about that because there are differences between the cases.
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1519.455,1526.545,"The statutes are very similar, Justice Stevens, and I... I cannot accept the proposition that they are different in any fundamental way--"
1989.89-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1526.545,1527.295,Is there a counterpart to Section in the other statute?
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1527.295,1527.611,--Pardon me?
1989.89-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1527.611,1528.211,Why don't you go ahead?
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1528.211,1529.079,All right.
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1570.656,1583.064,"But you... you seem to agree that you can't just take... construe the section... Section 27 literally, the way it reads."
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1583.064,1586.166,"No, and neither did the Court in California v. United States."
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1586.166,1594.522,And so how do we go about sorting out which controls Section 7 allows the state to impose and which ones that it doesn't?
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1594.522,1601.176,The Court should treat Section 27 in the same way that it did Section 8 in California v. United States.
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1613.416,1615.602,Despite Section 27?
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1615.602,1617.97,"--Yes, that's correct."
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1618.787,1629.862,And so... but... but that means that the state can set a... a different in-stream flow than the Federal Power Commission sets.
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1629.862,1633.064,"--It could only set a more stringent, a higher standard of flow."
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1636.599,1637.249,And... and--
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1637.249,1637.968,If... if the reverse--
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1637.968,1641.836,--And then... and completely veto the project?
1989.89-333,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1641.836,1643.003,"--Well, it could lead to that."
1989.89-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1715.468,1717.034,"Very well, Mr. Walston."
1989.89-333,1,41816,sternen_l_nightingale,,1721.152,1724.354,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-333,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1804.64,1818.815,"Mr. Nightingale, is it the government's position here that the state cannot impose any requirements that the FERC doesn't, even though the requirement wouldn't constitute a veto?"
1989.89-333,1,41816,sternen_l_nightingale,,1818.815,1825.886,"Your Honor, our position is that the state cannot impose conditions that are inconsistent with the license terms."
1989.89-333,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1854.673,1859.559,Supposing it sought to impose a requirement which didn't conflict?
1989.89-333,1,41816,sternen_l_nightingale,,1859.559,1869.832,"If it... if there were no conflict between the state regulation and the terms of the license, it would be our position that it would not be preempted."
1989.89-333,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.652,1884.692,"I thought you... Section 27 refers to the state's regulations with respect to irrigation, municipal use... and what else is it?"
1989.89-333,1,41816,sternen_l_nightingale,,1884.692,1894.9,"Section 27 refers to state laws relating to the control, appropriation, use or distribution of water used in irrigation or for municipal or other uses."
1989.89-333,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1894.9,1895.466,Or other uses.
1989.89-333,1,41816,sternen_l_nightingale,,1905.438,1910.175,Our position is that Section 27 expressly saves state law from preemption.
1989.89-333,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1920.717,1921.1,"No, no."
1989.89-333,1,41816,sternen_l_nightingale,,1921.1,1921.55,--such that--
1989.89-333,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1921.55,1930.839,But isn't it your position that... that a state regulation dealing with in-stream flows just isn't within Section 27?
1989.89-333,1,41816,sternen_l_nightingale,,1930.839,1935.977,"--Yes, in this case because it doesn't create a proprietary right in water."
1989.89-333,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1936.577,1957.14,"Well, what if... what if in this case instead of the Commission finding that, you know, we set the minimum flow because we wanted the minimum flow at that point... we wanted this kind of balance... the Commission says, well, sure, we set the minimum flow but it really doesn't make a lot of difference to us, and then the state came along and set a smaller minimum flow."
1989.89-333,1,41816,sternen_l_nightingale,,1966.996,1975.102,"--Your Honor, I think it's hypothetical that would not arise because the way the process works is to channel state concerns through the licensing process."
1989.89-333,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2295.168,2312.263,"The state... the state argues that under California, where the state's interests are represented, what's going to happen is the same water and the same stream is going to be subject to really a differential degree of preemption that doesn't seem to make any sense."
1989.89-333,1,41816,sternen_l_nightingale,,2317.984,2320.269,"--Well, I think it's considerably overstated."
1989.89-333,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2365.048,2369.749,What happens if the dam is for reclamation and power purposes?
1989.89-333,1,41816,sternen_l_nightingale,,2369.749,2378.336,"If Congress has authorized the project to include hydropower purposes, the Secretary of the Interior, I understand, takes that."
1989.89-333,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2479.554,2480.187,Mr. Nightingale--
1989.89-333,1,41816,sternen_l_nightingale,,2480.187,2480.604,--Yes?
1989.89-333,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2480.604,2494.73,--is it the fact that states have been licensing these hydropower projects and engaging in the kind of activity that the state seeks to have us confirm here?
1989.89-333,1,41816,sternen_l_nightingale,,2494.73,2510.59,"Yes, Your Honor Under Section 9(b) of the Act an applicant is required to submit satisfactory evidence with respect to compliance with state laws and it's been FERC's practice to look for that evidence."
1989.89-333,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2529.904,2536.557,"So, as a practical matter, FERC has been requiring full compliance with any state requirement?"
1989.89-333,1,41816,sternen_l_nightingale,,2536.557,2539.342,I won't say full compliance; people go through the process.
1989.89-333,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2832.697,2850.575,"Well, Mr. Nightingale, would you distinguish California against the United States on the basis of the type of condition that the state sought to attach to the use of water there as opposed to the stream flow requirement here as perhaps all in the light of Section 8 or 27?"
1989.89-333,1,41816,sternen_l_nightingale,,2850.575,2855.478,Our first position is that First Iowa should be enforced according to its terms.
1989.89-333,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2868.636,2876.642,But you would not distinguish the two cases on the basis of the nature of the conditions which the state sought to attach?
1989.89-333,1,41816,sternen_l_nightingale,,2876.642,2878.678,No.
1989.89-333,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3059.642,3061.327,xxx.
1989.89-333,1,41816,sternen_l_nightingale,,3061.327,3062.544,--I'm sorry.
1989.89-333,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3337.501,3338.367,"Thank you, Mr. Nightingale."
1989.89-333,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,3341.536,3343.921,"Some comments, Mr. Chief Justice."
