2003.02-1541,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.288,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-1541, Iowa v. Felipe Edgardo Tovar."
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,67.328,72.241,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1541,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,107.907,131.312,"Well, if someone is going to plead guilty, I guess the question may boil down to whether he has a right to be told the he could be represented by an attorney in making the decision to plead and that it might be useful to him to have an attorney's advice in making that decision."
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,131.312,132.965,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1541,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,134.49,136.059,It's a guilty plea.
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,157.607,166.069,"--Separating the... the two issues, first, the question of whether he was explicitly told in this proceeding that he had a right to counsel at this proceeding."
2003.02-1541,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,173.005,173.748,"My goodness, he wasn't told."
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,191.377,192.037,Yes.
2003.02-1541,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,192.037,194.266,And I didn't even think that was an issue in this case.
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,205.616,217.505,"What... what I'm saying, Your Honor, is... is this, that in... in the total context, he clearly knew that he had a right to counsel and, indeed, that really is the... the words that submit that--"
2003.02-1541,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,217.505,220.56,"I mean, nobody is really... at least, is that an issue in front of us?"
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,220.56,223.327,"--You know, I... I don't... I don't think... I don't think it should be, Your Honor."
2003.02-1541,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,223.327,240.805,I thought it was very much the issue before the Iowa Supreme Court because that court said what was missing here was information about the utility of a lawyer at the plea stage before you enter the plea with you at that hearing.
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,278.106,281.284,"Your... Your Honor, I... I don't think he actually signed a form."
2003.02-1541,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,334.495,339.203,But do we have the transcript of the... of that initial hearing where he waived counsel?
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,339.203,346.383,--The initial hearing... the checklist is in... is in the documents that... that were given... given to this Court.
2003.02-1541,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,346.383,348.119,"Well, that wasn't the basis."
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,362.442,363.928,"Yes, Your Honor, that--"
2003.02-1541,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,363.928,366.612,--in... in connection with the guilty plea--
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,366.612,367.355,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1541,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,367.538,370.493,--not that he wasn't advised that he had a right to counsel.
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,379.743,380.979,--That... that's exactly right.
2003.02-1541,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,389.319,398.357,"So what is your... what everybody I think is trying to do is ask you what is your argument on the point that we thought was why we granted the case, or at least I thought why."
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,398.357,398.729,Yes.
2003.02-1541,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,398.729,401.512,What... what is the reason that the Iowa court is wrong--
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,401.512,401.678,Yes.
2003.02-1541,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,401.678,404.446,--on... on the point just as Justice Scalia put it?
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,404.446,405.31,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1541,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,467.4,483.579,"Well, but... but in... in the context of entering a plea, it certainly would be useful for the defendant to know that if he had an attorney, the attorney might take a look at... at the sobriety tests."
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,508.267,515.78,"Well, Your Honor, I think... I think there are a number of useful... useful functions, the ones you described, also collateral consequences."
2003.02-1541,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,515.78,517.265,"And collateral consequences, yes."
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,517.265,525.978,"But... but generally in exercising these rights and describing these rights, you give the general... the general right, not... not the specific services."
2003.02-1541,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,561.354,571.552,"This... this comes after, I take it, General Miller, the discussion between the judge and the defendant as to whether or not the elements of the offense are present?"
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,571.552,578.461,It would... it would have... I guess it would have to come after that.
2003.02-1541,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,582.159,582.531,Yes.
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,582.531,587.239,The... because that's... that's the... that's our... that's our real assurance that guilty--
2003.02-1541,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,587.239,602.1,"Well, and if... if the defendant represents to the court that the factual basis for the plea is there, that he committed the offense charged, why is there any great interest in trying to persuade him not to do that?"
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,602.1,619.273,"--You know, I... I don't think there is a great interest, Your Honor, and I don't... I don't think... I don't think the... the system is served here particularly what... what the Iowa Supreme Court required that, you know, a... and a lawyer can give you an independent assessment of... of whether it's wise to plead guilty."
2003.02-1541,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,630.668,631.123,I--
2003.02-1541,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,631.123,634.838,"--Well, the Iowa court made rather a long laundry list of requirements."
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,655.355,660.556,"Well, I... I think that... that he has to know that he has... has the right... right to counsel."
2003.02-1541,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,661.549,664.893,You don't think he has to know that counsel would be helpful.
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,664.893,667.372,--The... he knows that counsel is... would be helpful.
2003.02-1541,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,667.372,668.737,He doesn't have to be told that counsel would be helpful.
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,668.737,668.941,He doesn't have to be told.
2003.02-1541,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,678.025,684.999,But you do agree that he's... you do agree that the advice should include explicit advice that he has a right to counsel at the plea hearing.
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,684.999,689.829,--He should... he should know at the plea hearing that he had a right to counsel.
2003.02-1541,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,689.829,698.291,But he doesn't have to be told by the judge that he has a right to counsel at the... he was not... this... in this case he was not told by the judge he had a right to counsel at that hearing.
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,698.291,707.29,"The... the judge said, you know, I... I see you... you made application, which would have been for this hearing, for... you... you did not make application--"
2003.02-1541,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,707.29,723.72,"Well, why... why is it clear that it would be for this hearing because the judge followed up, after saying that, did you want to represent yourself at today's hearing, which would seem to me to imply that the judge did not know whether or not he had already decided not to have counsel at that hearing?"
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,723.72,726.033,"--Well, I think that question was really did you change your mind."
2003.02-1541,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,726.898,727.641,"Well, of course--"
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,727.641,732.637,--you made... you made a decision at the initial hearing going forward towards this hearing that you wouldn't have counsel.
2003.02-1541,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,733.48,742.873,"--Maybe... maybe you... you should say that he should be advised of his right to counsel, but if he isn't, it is a harmless mistake if it is clear from the record that he knew it."
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,742.873,744.981,That... that certainly would--
2003.02-1541,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,744.981,756.331,"Even... even if there is a... a... an absolute right to have the judge tell you you're entitled counsel, if it's clear on the record at least that you were told, there's... there's no foul."
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,756.331,756.991,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1541,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,756.991,758.272,"But it's not clear on this record, though."
2003.02-1541,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,758.272,758.477,But that you knew.
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,758.477,759.099,Yes.
2003.02-1541,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,764.838,766.49,"Well, if you draw... draw presumptions, maybe it is."
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,781.268,800.299,"Well, I... I think, Your Honor, in... in the context of the discussion at the initial appearance and then drawing that towards the... forward into the... the plea... plea hearing, that... and... and certainly indulging the... the presumptions here, that... that that... that he did know."
2003.02-1541,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,802.899,819.163,"Well, but the... all I'm saying is the record doesn't establish it, and we've been... in some situations been rather meticulous about what ought to be on the record because then you solve all the problems of collateral attack if the record does disclose it rather than relying on presumptions and inferences."
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,819.801,819.967,Yes.
2003.02-1541,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,820.544,822.113,Where did this case come out of?
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,827.936,829.05,"It... it was, Your Honor."
2003.02-1541,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,843.251,849.65,"--But that was basically the rule... what would be in the Federal system, a rule 11 colloquy, and it's all canned."
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,858.938,860.424,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1541,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,880.198,885.11,--He does have a right to counsel at the plea hearing.
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,916.318,939.269,"What... what we're saying, Your Honor, is that... that that was covered by the... the words that Justice Breyer mentioned at... at the outset, that you know, I... I see you waived application for counsel at... at the prior... it would have been at the prior proceedings, which would have been for this proceeding, and do you... you know, do you continue to want to represent yourself."
2003.02-1541,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,939.269,941.787,But I think there's something important afterwards.
2003.02-1541,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,946.245,947.814,--That was at the sentencing.
2003.02-1541,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,947.814,952.811,--certainly one inference is that to represent you at this kind of proceeding.
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,952.811,953.554,"Yes, yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1541,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,954.297,957.148,That... that was not said at... at his plea hearing.
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,974.981,986.869,"--That... that was at... at that proceeding, and... and we argue that that... those are the... those are the key words that really... really wrap up this issue, that he was told before he had a right to counsel at this hearing."
2003.02-1541,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1010.069,1015.27,The States seem to take various positions on this.
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,1022.451,1026.637,The State has... has not on this... on this particular issue.
2003.02-1541,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1026.637,1029.032,"Iowa hasn't, but have other States?"
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,1029.032,1030.453,"Not... not that I know of, Your Honor."
2003.02-1541,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1030.453,1032.105,This... this being?
2003.02-1541,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,1039.973,1050.377,"I... I was assuming on... on the matter that was before the Court as... as a matter of the cert petition, that... that I do not know of other jurisdictions that decided solely on... on State grounds."
2003.02-1541,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1052.939,1053.804,"Very well, General Miller."
2003.02-1541,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1055.29,1065.238,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1541,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1102.806,1103.715,Page 18 of what?
2003.02-1541,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1103.715,1105.407,--Of the appendix to the certiorari petition.
2003.02-1541,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1266.896,1275.645,Would a Miranda warning be sufficient to advise the... the defendant that you have a right to counsel?
2003.02-1541,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1283.736,1292.159,"I think it would be constitutionally sufficient, but it's certainly better practice to make sure that the defendant understands that the right extends beyond the questioning itself."
2003.02-1541,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1380.83,1385.371,"Mr. Stewart, do you know what the general practice is in Federal courts?"
2003.02-1541,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1400.437,1414.062,"--Well, as to the... it does... Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 in its current form says that if the defendant appears at the plea hearing without counsel, he is to be informed that he has a right to counsel at trial and at every other stage of the proceedings."
2003.02-1541,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1433.464,1436.891,Do you know the practice in... in other States generally?
2003.02-1541,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1436.891,1447.953,"--My sense is that there is probably a great deal of variation not only from State to State, but among different courts within different States I think, and I think that's probably the... the likelihood in the Federal system as well."
2003.02-1541,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1447.953,1457.862,"Well, I... I suppose my comment was in response to the argument that, well, it really doesn't make any difference, which is the... the intimation I... I saw in... in the brief."
2003.02-1541,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1462.525,1475.695,I don't think we would assume that any... necessarily any layperson would be aware of the potential for suppressing evidence or the possibility of negotiating a plea arrangement.
2003.02-1541,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1523.25,1528.284,Why... why wouldn't the same argument apply to all of the rights that you're going to lose if you plead guilty?
2003.02-1541,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1533.402,1541.826,"Well, I... I think those rules really do focus on things that will actually happen in any criminal trial if the defendant decides not to plead guilty."
2003.02-1541,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1585.376,1594.459,"Mr. Stewart, as I understand your argument, you're... you're arguing not only are these warnings not constitutionally mandated, you're also saying they're probably unwise in a number of situations."
2003.02-1541,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1601.518,1606.348,"No, I don't think there would be any Federal law barrier to States requiring warnings such as these."
2003.02-1541,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1672.107,1673.471,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,1675.512,1691.942,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1541,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1724.802,1725.34,Where is it--
2003.02-1541,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1725.34,1728.517,"--That... that isn't what the Supreme Court of Iowa required in this case, is it?"
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,1734.461,1735.659,Correct.
2003.02-1541,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1763.606,1789.529,"My... I guess the difficulty that I have with that is no... no question about the... the soundness of those general statements, but they are so general that they... they raise the question whether there are really very many defendants that don't know that to begin with and whether there is a real utility in requiring those warnings and hence paying the price in the mistaken cases when they're not given."
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,1791.758,1792.834,Yes.
2003.02-1541,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1822.76,1824.535,Did they say how they knew that?
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,1824.535,1826.681,"No, Your Honor."
2003.02-1541,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1826.681,1845.711,"Did they say... did they... I mean, I'm... I am impressed by the fact that rule 11(b), which is a product of the rulemaking process and presumably, I'm sure, it reflects the experience of trial lawyers, which is not my experience, and... and they try to get in things like the ABA."
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,1887.876,1888.891,No.
2003.02-1541,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1888.891,1897.519,But you're... you're saying that the Constitution requires the thing that the lawyers themselves through their groups have felt is desirable but not important enough to put in the rules.
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,1899.46,1901.334,Not necessarily.
2003.02-1541,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1917.376,1931.782,"But, Ms. Wilson, you know, as to how much that requires, when we invented the Miranda warning, we... we simply required that... that the defendant be told you have a right to counsel."
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,1949.781,1958.697,"The... those particular warnings were used both in the Miranda case and in the Patterson case, Sixth Amendment right to counsel at post-indictment questioning."
2003.02-1541,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1983.013,1999.731,"Why... even on this very record, when he came for the sentencing, the judge did say, as Judge Kennedy... Justice Kennedy pointed out, that are you sure you don't want more time to consider having counsel."
2003.02-1541,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2016.411,2017.193,I think you're right.
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2019.3,2025.161,He... the defendant would have been able to file a motion in arrest of judgment.
2003.02-1541,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2038.452,2042.622,"But the judgment is entered only after the sentence, I would assume."
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2043.737,2044.191,Correct.
2003.02-1541,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2044.191,2059.623,"So it... it just seemed to me that a judge, being so solicitous about this crime that didn't carry any jail time, would... would certainly say the one that does carry jail... jail time, yes, you think you want to talk to a lawyer?"
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2064.049,2064.625,Correct.
2003.02-1541,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2102.398,2109.579,Is... is there any allegation in this case that the defendant didn't know he had a right to appointed counsel for the plea?
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2112.429,2115.28,"No, and I do want to address that."
2003.02-1541,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2115.28,2115.856,Are you making it now?
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2115.856,2124.484,"I am indicating that the record simply doesn't show whether the defendant had any knowledge of the right to plea counsel, and unfortunately--"
2003.02-1541,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2124.484,2126.259,"No, but that's not an issue in this case, is it?"
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2126.259,2134.903,--It is and... and the... the State did say that this issue was not addressed in the Iowa Supreme Court.
2003.02-1541,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2159.657,2163.994,"But in any case, you... you didn't cross petition and you didn't raise this in the brief in opposition I take it."
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2163.994,2164.215,Correct.
2003.02-1541,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2164.215,2177.49,"We're... all of this... it goes back to a prior conviction not his most recent one I take it, and all the facts we're talking about were at... those associated with the prior conviction, not this more recent one."
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2177.49,2178.027,Correct.
2003.02-1541,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2206.802,2206.968,All right.
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2209.94,2210.562,Yes.
2003.02-1541,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2210.562,2211.055,Is that right?
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2211.055,2211.427,Yes.
2003.02-1541,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2211.427,2212.064,And they can decide it.
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2212.064,2212.913,"Correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-1541,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2212.913,2213.906,"I mean, we can't decide it."
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2220.137,2218.568,Correct.
2003.02-1541,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2220.676,2221.186,Send it back.
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2227.363,2228.023,"No, Your Honor."
2003.02-1541,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2228.023,2229.964,--that haven't been raised and then send the thing back?
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2229.964,2230.79,"No, Your Honor."
2003.02-1541,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2230.79,2231.905,Why should we do it here?
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2231.905,2234.794,"Again, it... it was raised below."
2003.02-1541,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2240.7,2243.301,"Well, but you didn't cross... as Justice Souter--"
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2243.301,2243.467,No.
2003.02-1541,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2243.467,2244.582,--you didn't cross-petition.
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2244.582,2244.665,No.
2003.02-1541,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2244.665,2246.418,You didn't put it in your brief in opposition.
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2246.418,2247.182,No.
2003.02-1541,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2247.182,2254.612,"Well, I guess if we just... what we'd normally do here is we say... suppose we didn't agree with your... on your basic argument."
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2267.699,2268.359,Correct.
2003.02-1541,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2268.359,2270.938,Is there a reason we can't do that?
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2271.414,2272.612,"No, Your Honor."
2003.02-1541,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2276.138,2283.181,The... the Court usually remands for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2283.181,2284.007,Correct.
2003.02-1541,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2284.007,2304.774,"And... and if the Court just addresses what's before them, whether the sentences that Mr. Stewart read to us whether the... if the Court decides it, that's not what the Constitution requires, then it vacates or reverses and remands and Iowa could take it from there."
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2304.774,2320.21,"Correct, Your Honor, but the... the point at which the Iowa Supreme Court did decide is... is still a valid point, that regarding whether there needs to be a brief discussion regarding the usefulness of counsel and the dangers of proceeding pro se."
2003.02-1541,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2320.21,2337.877,"So how do you deal with the question that was posed that it raises a false hope, and if you tell a defendant a lawyer might know defenses that you don't know, but wouldn't the defendant then ask the judge, Judge, would you please tell me what those defenses might be?"
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2337.877,2344.193,"And then the appropriate response from the court would be, I can't advise you."
2003.02-1541,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2354.224,2357.651,But the attorney is going to cost me $200 an hour.
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2364.627,2366.279,"That's exactly correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-1541,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2366.279,2368.054,You ought to know that attorneys are useful.
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2373.255,2382.998,It at least indicates that the defendant has been given some warning regarding how an attorney may assist him.
2003.02-1541,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2390.595,2401.491,Was it in this case that the judge told the defendant he was not entitled to free counsel because he was dependent on his parent where he was going to Ames or something like that?
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2401.491,2403.72,That was at the sentencing hearing.
2003.02-1541,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2447.603,2456.991,Do you know any other jurisdiction that has required such a... a litany of warnings before a plea could be accepted?
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2456.991,2458.256,Specific litany?
2003.02-1541,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2506.182,2507.584,You say applied that standard.
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2510.64,2515.303,--Have either required or preferred a discussion of the dangers of proceeding pro se at a plea proceeding.
2003.02-1541,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2515.303,2517.904,"When you say preferred, what do you mean by that?"
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2517.904,2533.962,"It... the failure to use those particular standards may create a rebuttable presumption, but the other factors in the case may show that a defendant did validly understand or did understand the right to counsel."
2003.02-1541,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2533.962,2536.813,And did the... you're talking about now Federal courts of appeals?
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2536.813,2538.215,Federal circuits.
2003.02-1541,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2538.215,2543.333,And... and they held this as a matter of Federal constitutional law?
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2543.333,2547.214,I... I believe so.
2003.02-1541,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2548.7,2550.763,Any other circuits?
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2550.763,2553.075,I can't remember off the top of my head.
2003.02-1541,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2611.737,2617.947,"In your brief, Ms. Wilson... let me make sure I've got the right one."
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2627.962,2628.638,--Correct.
2003.02-1541,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2628.638,2636.712,And then you don't cite any Federal... Federal cases such as the ones I presume you were referring to.
2003.02-1541,2,43466,theresa_r_wilson,,2641.17,2646.538,It was a cooperative effort between my office and the National Legal Aid and Defender Association.
2003.02-1541,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2646.538,2648.312,And which one dropped the ball?
2003.02-1541,3,43004,thomas_j_miller,,3349.319,3362.489,"I would just pick up on... on Justice Ginsburg's question or comment there that in terms of usefulness of counsel, there's a... you know, we've explored a lot of difficulties and cross currents here today."
2003.02-1541,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3379.125,3380.611,"Thank you, General Miller."
