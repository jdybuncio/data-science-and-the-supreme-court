2014.13-935,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.57,"We'll hear argument next in Case 13-935, Wellness International Network v. Sharif."
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,7.553,10.505,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-935,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,64.785,74.657,"But we've already held that a fraudulent conveyance against a noncreditor is an Article III violation, is a Stern claim, essentially."
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,74.657,75.257,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-935,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,75.257,76.173,Or non-Stern claim.
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,79.459,81.242,Because this action is a case--
2014.13-935,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,81.242,87.213,"I mean, it's not the same thing because he actually possessed this trust, it's in his name as trustee--"
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,87.213,88.096,--Yes.
2014.13-935,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,88.096,90.498,"--and so it's a little bit -- it's a lot different, but--"
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,90.498,91.35,Yes.
2014.13-935,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,103.674,104.857,"--Oh, but -- but that's the same in a fraudulent conveyance."
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,116.248,126.537,"Well, it's different, Your Honor, because in a fraudulent transfer claim, the debtor actually passes title over to someone, under the definition of 548 or the--"
2014.13-935,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,126.537,129.905,"But here, he's claiming that the beneficiary has title."
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,129.905,143.463,"--Yes, but that's the very dispute that the Court was asked to decide under Thompson v. Magnolia Petroleum, the issue is not what the debtor claims his title is, but whether he has actual possession."
2014.13-935,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,205.536,208.671,The ben -- who is the beneficiary of this trust?
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,210.004,210.92,"Well, that's--"
2014.13-935,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,210.92,212.186,That's what's claimed.
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,212.186,213.369,"--That's what's claimed, yes."
2014.13-935,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,213.369,228.212,And so what would be the effect of a declaration by the bankruptcy court that -- that Respondent was the alter ego; that it was actually his property?
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,235.715,249.206,"Well, yes, she would be bound because if we accept their characterization, the trustee, through his litigation conduct, binds the beneficiary under well-established Illinois law, the law of -- it's just basic trust law."
2014.13-935,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,272.416,282.189,"Would the court, the bankruptcy court, have had the power to notify her or to subpoena her to come in as a party?"
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,282.189,292.479,"Yes, because if -- if she was a necessary party to the action, the normal rules of Federal Civil Procedure apply through the bankruptcy rules and she would have been required to be brought in."
2014.13-935,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,295.681,296.281,Because she's the representative.
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,296.464,299.399,They created this construct of this trust--
2014.13-935,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,299.399,302.351,So am I right about the basic facts?
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,322.079,322.914,--Right.
2014.13-935,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,322.914,324.097,Where is that on the list?
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,342.391,343.324,That's correct.
2014.13-935,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,343.324,358.151,"Can the bankruptcy court, it happens here, that the claim is not Saudi Arabia, the claim is not my cousin, the claim is that the $5 million was a living trust of which there seems to be very little record, which belonged to his mother."
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,362.136,362.802,No.
2014.13-935,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,364.602,365.254,It's a simple claim.
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,368.14,368.59,Right.
2014.13-935,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,386.552,388.702,Is that the only basis for distinguishing Stern?
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,388.702,390.269,"--No, it's not, Your Honor."
2014.13-935,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,391.035,391.535,What else?
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,391.535,391.868,--Okay.
2014.13-935,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,399.502,403.156,"Whether there's a trust or not is not a question of Federal law, is it?"
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,403.156,411.51,"--But the question of whether something belongs to the bankruptcy estate is a Federal question, even if State law informs the answer."
2014.13-935,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,412.693,413.426,Well--
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,413.426,414.609,--in other -- under other statutes.
2014.13-935,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,417.225,419.561,--It's a question of Federal law even if State provides the answer.
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,419.561,425.998,"--Yes, Your Honor, and that's -- the Court has Interpreted federal statutes dealing with property rights, the Paulsen--"
2014.13-935,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,425.998,427.5,And that wasn't the case in Stern?
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,427.5,429.552,--That was not the case in Stern.
2014.13-935,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,430.318,436.289,"Well, likewise there, what was in the estate is a question of Federal law, even if State law provided the answer."
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,436.289,452.065,"--The difference here would be if there had been a dispute between the debtor and Stern and her bankruptcy trustee over who got the right to go sue Pierce, the -- the son-in-law, that would have been this case."
2014.13-935,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,474.077,505.529,"Suppose that Illinois law, and suppose that Illinois law governs the -- this -- the issue of the trust, and suppose Illinois law says that when a -- when it is held that the trustee is -- that -- that the trust is the trustee's alter ego, that the property does not become the -- that the -- the property at issue does not become the property of the trustee until there is a judicial declaration that that -- that occurs."
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,505.529,516.335,"Well, I don't think that changes the analysis, because, ultimately, in a bankruptcy case, if you're going to have to have a dispute with the debtor--"
2014.13-935,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,516.335,519.453,So that's -- that would be a question of the status of this under Illinois law 7--
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,519.453,519.786,--Correct.
2014.13-935,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,519.786,520.386,"--not under Federal law, right?"
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,520.386,522.405,It would inform the decision.
2014.13-935,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,671.912,675.964,But you've not explored the question completely.
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,675.964,676.297,Sure.
2014.13-935,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,676.297,693.407,"Basically the argument that the SG and the -- of you and the SG is that you need express consent -- or I guess the other side, saying you need express consent and they didn't give express consent."
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,694.442,696.125,"Well, Your Honor, we think that you don't need it."
2014.13-935,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,738.519,743.456,"We don't have to reach both of these questions if we find one of them in -- in your favor, do we?"
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,743.456,744.472,That's correct.
2014.13-935,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,747.841,748.458,Which one is the better one?
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,755.847,771.789,"Well, I think the first question has real world effect in the sense that if the Court were to take away from bankruptcy judges the power to litigate disputes with the debtor over what they possess comes in or out of the bankruptcy estate, you'd see a sea change in how cases were handled."
2014.13-935,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,776.257,779.375,Even -- even if consent were sufficient to confer jurisdiction?
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,789.997,812.779,"--I think there's a lot of confusion out there, Your Honor, and I think that certainly people are also concerned about the consent question, because the situation that you have today is that both parties could consent, and the bankruptcy judge could enter a judgment, and then the party who loses can turn around and say, well, there's a question about whether I really consented or not or whether it was appropriate."
2014.13-935,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,812.779,813.346,Can -- can--
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,813.346,815.898,So both are -- are problems for the courts right now.
2014.13-935,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,815.898,821.216,"--Can I ask, you said implied consent should be sufficient."
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,827.054,833.724,"Well, I think would you would have implied consent where you have -- here you have a debtor who moved for summary judgment."
2014.13-935,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,869.547,872.166,"You've -- you've said, I think, that the consent has to be knowing and intelligent."
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,877.32,886.175,"Congress didn't require that here in Section 157, and, you know, it's a maxim of the law that knowledge -- you know, lack of knowledge of the law is no excuse."
2014.13-935,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,910.473,916.36,"There is a problem, however, here, and that problem is that Stern wasn't decided until the appeal."
2014.13-935,0,56125,catherine_steege,,923.198,924.248,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-935,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,925.233,926.516,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,935.356,937.708,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-935,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,953.382,958.369,"But that's too broad an answer, because that would be true of fraudulent conveyances."
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,958.369,962.42,"Well, and -- and it also does not involve an attempt to augment the estate."
2014.13-935,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,964.356,967.658,"How about a simpler rule, if you have legal title to something?"
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,967.658,969.591,--Well--
2014.13-935,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,969.591,976.164,"If you -- if you possess it physically or you have legal title to it, then the bankruptcy court can determine."
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,976.164,977.464,"--Well, I think--"
2014.13-935,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,977.464,979.716,They -- he has -- the trustee had legal title.
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,980.899,982.932,--The trustee had bare legal title and you think that that's--
2014.13-935,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,982.932,985.117,--that there's an equitable requirement to hold it for someone else.
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,985.117,1003.495,"--And -- and under 541(d), if it is true that the trustee only -- only holds bare legal title, and then ultimately the trust is not looked through because it's found not to exist or because it's found to be the alter ego of the trustee, then the -- then the equitable interest would not have come into -- to the estate."
2014.13-935,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1003.495,1003.595,Yeah.
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1004.028,1004.261,And so that's true.
2014.13-935,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1004.261,1010.932,--I'm trying to get away from the augmentation argument because it's really difficult to apply in a case like this.
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1014.634,1015.836,"Well, I -- I don't think that that's true."
2014.13-935,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1027.558,1028.06,"Well, then--"
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1028.06,1031.612,--they were talking about the baseline that you have there with the estate is the property--
2014.13-935,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1031.612,1032.746,"--Well, tell me why my rule is not simpler."
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1032.746,1034.131,"--Well, I think--"
2014.13-935,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1034.131,1041.134,If you -- if you physically possess it at the time you declare bankruptcy or you have legal title to it--
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1041.134,1042.819,--I think that--
2014.13-935,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1042.819,1045.086,--then the bankruptcy -- then it's not a Stern claim.
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1045.086,1065.433,"--I suppose that -- that that -- what this is feinting towards is the system that the parties have talked about that developed under the 1898 Act that ended up being a relatively reticulated system as described in the Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller case, in which there are multiple categories in which the bankruptcy court would have jurisdiction to make these determinations."
2014.13-935,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1084.795,1087.012,In Stern we said we would look to history.
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1087.012,1087.946,--Pardon?
2014.13-935,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1087.946,1089.964,In Stern we said we would look to history.
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1089.964,1112.162,"Portions of the Stern opinion looked to history but it did not indicate that the historical precedents for this were going to be dispositive and we don't think that -- that the rationale of Stern, Granfinanciera, and Northern Pipeline requires that as an Article III matter, nor does the statute here, because the statutory definition of -- of property of the estate refers to property wherever located and by whomever held."
2014.13-935,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1123.72,1124.353,So let's to go -- let's go to the hypothetical.
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1131.558,1132.841,"--Well, I--"
2014.13-935,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1132.841,1139.981,"That she holds legal title but, in fact, she -- it's really his money."
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1139.981,1150.453,"--Well, I -- I think -- I think it would -- if she held legal title and the property had already been transferred to her and that's what the bankruptcy judge determined, then it wouldn't be property of the estate."
2014.13-935,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1204.338,1234.54,"Counsel, on the consent question, is -- under your theory, is there anything wrong with Congress adding a proviso to every Federal contract saying the contractor hereby agrees to waive any Article III objections to having disputes with the government resolved by something we'll call the congressional courts where the -- the individuals serve for 3 years and Congress has a lot more sway over their decisions?"
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1234.54,1239.242,"Well, I suspect yes, if for no other reason than be -- I mean--"
2014.13-935,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1239.242,1240.177,"Yes, yes what?"
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1241.277,1243.545,"--Yes, if for no other reason than because--"
2014.13-935,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1243.545,1244.429,"Yes, it's okay."
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1244.429,1249.116,"--Yes, that that would be a problem -- I'm sorry, that that would not be permissible."
2014.13-935,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1252.516,1253.785,I thought it was an unforgettable question.
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1255.718,1257.57,--I promise you I won't forget it now.
2014.13-935,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1257.57,1258.487,Yes.
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1260.522,1268.442,The reason -- the reason why this would be a problem is -- is because of the structural concerns that you raise there which we don't think are present here.
2014.13-935,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1286.253,1286.82,You--
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1286.82,1287.586,--There is two things here.
2014.13-935,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1300.311,1314.72,"Well, there's judicial control in the sense that you have deferential appellate review and whatnot, but it still takes out of the Federal courts our constitutional birthright to decide cases and controversies under Article III."
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1314.72,1315.487,--And I think--
2014.13-935,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1315.487,1317.02,It's hard for me to see how--
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1317.02,1318.153,--But I think--
2014.13-935,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1318.153,1321.807,"--sort of vague -- vague notions of, oh, well, the judges are involved there somewhere."
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1321.807,1323.741,--But I don't think that this is vague.
2014.13-935,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1384.397,1388.866,--You need to go back to your experience in your office.
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1418.951,1419.57,I--
2014.13-935,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1419.57,1427.507,"And you say one would be enough for the party to win, so would two, but we think it's important to answer both and we will."
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1427.507,1430.29,--I do believe that the Court has done that.
2014.13-935,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1432.909,1433.509,Perhaps so.
2014.13-935,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1435.542,1437.811,That's what I wondered.
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1439.063,1439.496,--I--
2014.13-935,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1439.496,1441.096,--strikes you that that would be a mistake?
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1443.031,1444.131,--Well--
2014.13-935,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1444.131,1448.183,--or in any precedent of this Court that prohibits it.
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1448.183,1448.602,--I--
2014.13-935,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1448.602,1452.654,So I think saying it is a mistake does not necessarily make it one.
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1452.654,1455.437,--I think that that's something that would be in the discretion of the Court.
2014.13-935,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1481.585,1482.754,Could I ask you--
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1482.754,1483.304,The second--
2014.13-935,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1483.304,1485.556,--Could I ask you this quick question before your time runs out.
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1500.732,1503.768,--I don't think you have to get to the point of saying that the rule is invalid.
2014.13-935,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1536.405,1537.439,Do you agree that there's--
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1537.439,1538.341,There is--
2014.13-935,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1538.341,1539.441,--Excuse me.
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1543.826,1546.028,"--Well, I think that the Court 23--"
2014.13-935,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1546.028,1548.13,I thought that I heard that that's what the Petitioner said.
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1548.13,1550.565,"--When you said, “ a voluntarily bankruptcy petition ”?"
2014.13-935,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1550.565,1551.049,Yes.
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1551.049,1564.207,The Court didn't grant cert on that question but we do think that there's lots of other conduct here but ultimately there's also the forfeiture after Stern itself was decided that we think would be adequate to decide that there was consent in this case.
2014.13-935,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1564.207,1569.261,"Mr. Gannon, I hate to protract your presentation here."
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1582.251,1584.12,I said two different questions.
2014.13-935,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1584.12,1584.82,Ah.
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1584.82,1585.736,I think that--
2014.13-935,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1585.736,1589.088,What about two constitutional questions given that we're supposed to--
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1589.088,1589.338,--I think that--
2014.13-935,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1589.338,1593.89,--avoid the determination of constitutional questions?
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1593.89,1599.044,"--I do realize that that is the general prudential rule that the Court applies, but I think that it normally does so in a context of--"
2014.13-935,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1599.044,1600.227,I understand--
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1600.227,1608.25,--here it would be upholding the statute in both regards and therefore I don't think that the normal concerns about constitutionality rise to the same level.
2014.13-935,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1608.25,1609.216,Counsel.
2014.13-935,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1610.334,1614.053,You were saying that you wanted to talk about the importance of both questions.
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1619.188,1628.727,"Well, I do think that the Court was not able to decide the consent question in executive benefits last term, and that there is a circuit split on it."
2014.13-935,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1639.518,1653.861,"The government agrees with the Petitioner that the first question, what goes into this estate, that if we had to choose between the two, which would you say is the more important?"
2014.13-935,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1653.861,1665.586,"I -- I think that -- that it would be good to settle that for the purposes of bankruptcy courts, but you would still have the unsettled consent question that has been kicking around ever since Stern and on which there's already a circuit split."
2014.13-935,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1665.586,1666.352,--And vice versa.
2014.13-935,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1666.352,1668.871,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1676.876,1679.078,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-935,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1701.942,1709.615,"That really begs the question, your client possessed something and he says it really belonged to someone else."
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1717.886,1719.402,--Two -- two point--
2014.13-935,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1719.402,1721.418,"I mean, there may be a clear one, but it still begs the question."
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1721.418,1722.437,--Right.
2014.13-935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1767.066,1779.624,"So you're just saying that they didn't decide it correctly, but it's terribly easy to imagine a different debtor who goes into bankruptcy and he lists Item 1, 2, 3, and 4."
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1853.505,1881.922,"--I -- I -- and I think the example is a good one because I do think the trust is very important because we do have decades of law on that, but the example is not problematic because if in that situation the trustee says, I see some other bankruptcy trustee, sees -- I see some other property, and the debtor says, that's not mine, I do think it's true that there wouldn't be a litigable claim there unless the third party also asserted ownership to the property."
2014.13-935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1912.041,1920.38,And what is the example of 6 through 10 that you could find that wouldn't involve the issue you have described?
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1950.417,1955.069,--So long as the third-party asserts--
2014.13-935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1955.069,1955.502,Yes.
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1955.502,1956.504,"--Yes, that's right, but -- but--"
2014.13-935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1956.504,1956.937,"Yes, he can't do it."
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1980.285,1994.727,"--I don't -- I don't think that's fundamental because you have -- what you're talking about, I mean, this Court already crossed that bridge I think in Stern in saying when you're augmenting the estate with third-party property, you don't assume at the beginning of the Article III litigation that the other side has a claim."
2014.13-935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1997.193,2000.811,You said for thousands of years -- I got that point -- for thousands of years this has been the law.
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2029.93,2031.897,"Well, a couple of--"
2014.13-935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2031.897,2032.782,I'll read it.
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2032.782,2033.115,"--First of all, all of the cases--"
2014.13-935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2033.115,2034.548,"Besides -- besides Stern, he means."
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2034.548,2035.865,"--Well, Stern -- yes, Stern is--"
2014.13-935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2035.865,2053.277,"Stern is a case of a third party and counterclaim, and there never would have been the money in the estate had it not been for the fact that the debtor in fact asserted a claim, a counterclaim against a claim that was being made by an outsider to the estate."
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2065.25,2084.395,"--I -- if you look at all of the cases cited on both sides' brief, I think the rule is best stated in the Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller -- which is one word -- case that says when there is a bona fide claim of adverse possession -- or excuse me, of ownership by a third party, that can't be extinguished except through plenary proceeding."
2014.13-935,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2099.237,2100.121,Who is the third party?
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2110.629,2111.895,--The third -- go ahead.
2014.13-935,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2111.895,2113.747,--There is only the trustee.
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2120.751,2123.287,"So two -- there's -- well, three."
2014.13-935,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2138.297,2139.563,I thought she was dead.
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2139.563,2144.881,"--When the bankruptcy was commenced, she was still alive, and she had the it's a revocable living trust right."
2014.13-935,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2154.153,2160.224,"Did she say, when she was alive, did she say, bankruptcy court, wait a minute, this belongs to me?"
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2160.224,2163.842,"--She was in Syria, I think, I'm not sure at what point."
2014.13-935,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2265.939,2271.159,"But in the cases you just cited, did the courts say who decides the question of whether there's bare legal title?"
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2271.159,2273.945,Those cases were--
2014.13-935,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2273.945,2276.48,"You you said the case very clear, only bare legal title goes."
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2285.152,2285.402,--Right.
2014.13-935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2295.824,2306.797,No argue -- so -- so where you have brought me so far is these cases say what they say is you have to -- you can't just grab it; you have to proceed under Section 23 and have a proceeding.
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2321.389,2322.155,--In the older cases 22--
2014.13-935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2322.155,2322.772,Yeah.
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2322.772,2330.042,"--the rule that would apply, Justice Kennedy, would be the Talburg v. Scott Kitzmiller rule, you have to have a plenary proceeding to go get it."
2014.13-935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2330.042,2331.059,A plenary proceeding.
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2332.644,2340.081,"That would have been it's sort of the equivalent now the parties are treating, I think, not incorrectly as equivalent now of an Article III proceeding."
2014.13-935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2341.298,2342.731,It didn't take place before the bankruptcy judge?
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2342.731,2353.872,"--Well, at the -- most of these cases at the time, remember, the district court was the bankruptcy court and the question was whether it's the exercise of summary jurisdiction versus a plenary Article III proceeding."
2014.13-935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2353.872,2354.489,"Oh, I see the problem."
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2354.489,2355.839,A plenary proceeding.
2014.13-935,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2420.698,2425.582,"Just to clarify the record, I asked the question whether they were or weren't."
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2425.582,2426.934,Fair enough.
2014.13-935,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2440.009,2441.694,"Well, we've said that, too, against--"
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2441.694,2446.079,--Held that it's an Article -- Alderson basically an Article III claim in Grand Financier.
2014.13-935,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2471.213,2472.413,--So give me examples.
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2507.052,2507.536,Right.
2014.13-935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2542.059,2560.954,"But -- but you say that's always going to be the case, that you need an Article III proceeding whenever the bankruptcy trustee determines that something belongs to the debtor and is in the bankruptcy estate and some other private party says, no, it belongs to me."
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2565.173,2567.191,--I don't think this Court needs to decide that.
2014.13-935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2573.311,2575.03,Is that what you're arguing here?
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2575.03,2594.858,"--I -- I -- I would not be surprised if this Court were to hold one day that if a third party has a claim to property, comes into court and says, that's my -- that's my house, I know the debtor says it is, that says it's his and the trustee thinks it's his, that's my house, that that person is entitled to an Article III adjudication Alderson--"
2014.13-935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2594.858,2598.143,That's exactly -- because -- it's interesting.
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2683.149,2685.532,--That was my answer was I don't think it will gut the bankruptcy court.
2014.13-935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2692.087,2692.904,"Yes, yes."
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2701.227,2704.329,"Well, and I don't think -- I don't think we're pushing Stern forward."
2014.13-935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2733.098,2750.058,And I suppose the constitutional provision authorizing Congress to establish a uniform law of bankruptcy does not authorize Congress to establish bankruptcy courts that can decide questions which would normally be decided by Article III courts.
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2750.058,2750.976,That's clearly right.
2014.13-935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2779.66,2782.362,That's -- let me proceed with this question one more step.
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2836.846,2841.733,I think due process viewed that way is not sufficient.
2014.13-935,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2901.503,2907.274,"By the way, is are the arguments you're raising now any different as applied to magistrate judges?"
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2915.529,2916.964,"--Well, a couple of points."
2014.13-935,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2924.235,2929.122,"So your answer is yes, because you can do -- on express consent, you can do reports and recommendations."
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2929.122,2940.58,"--As -- as to final adjudications of private rights matters, magistrate judges can still do something, can still litigate and resolve public rights, whatever those kinds of rights and matters are."
2014.13-935,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2994.396,2997.398,"I agree, but we didn't say that you couldn't consent in Schor."
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2997.398,2998.334,--I understand that.
2014.13-935,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3006.623,3009.506,"No, consent is enough for arbitration, and there you give up 18--"
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,3009.506,3010.875,--I understand that.
2014.13-935,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3026.618,3031.771,"Well, but it's something which has to be enforced by a court except in very extraordinary circumstances."
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,3037.492,3038.858,--Right.
2014.13-935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3056.554,3057.989,There's very little difference 15--
2014.13-935,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3057.989,3059.422,All those things make it worse.
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,3073.515,3080.504,"--But that's pursuant to Congress's Article I power to say, here is a type of contract that we're going to say is enforceable under a particular situation."
2014.13-935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3082.137,3082.971,"--That's just contract law, isn't it?"
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,3084.973,3085.456,Right.
2014.13-935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3085.806,3086.206,But--
2014.13-935,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3086.206,3088.489,This is the parties' contract.
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,3099.28,3099.68,--I understand.
2014.13-935,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3113.273,3115.123,"--No, because that's what happens in arbitration."
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,3125.764,3133.784,"--What I'm saying is, you're not -- you're not consenting to the exercise of the judicial power, to the dilution of the Article III court's authority 25--"
2014.13-935,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3133.784,3135.036,"Well, I understand that Alderson--"
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,3135.036,3136.12,--to issue judgments that are precedential.
2014.13-935,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3136.12,3136.736,--Please.
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,3137.353,3138.255,"Well, that's all I was going to say."
2014.13-935,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3138.255,3168.44,"I -- you know, I understand that formalism matters in many contexts, but the fact that the arbitrator himself doesn't issue the judgment, and instead you have to take it across the street and the Federal court has to issue the judgment, basically on the arbitrator's say-so, again, seems to me -- I mean, the arbitrator case seems to me much more threatening to the integrity of the Federal judicial system than a system of bankruptcy courts which are, from the very beginning all the way through, supervised by -- by district courts."
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,3168.44,3176.713,"Well, I mean, the the key difference, though, I think, is that, as I said, bankruptcy courts are exercising judicial power."
2014.13-935,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3231.131,3233.983,Could you spend a moment just talking about the forfeited argument on appeal?
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,3233.983,3235.669,--On the -- the--
2014.13-935,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3235.669,3243.105,The -- the argument that consent can be presumed from your forfeiture of the argument on appeal.
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,3243.105,3247.642,"--And I'm glad you put it this way, Your Honor, because I think they're they're different points."
2014.13-935,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3289.819,3291.236,But isn't forfeiture quite different from consent?
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,3293.821,3297.423,And I'm sorry I delayed getting to Justice Sotomayor's question.
2014.13-935,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3321.523,3324.991,You think a final judgment has to be a valid final judgment in order for there to be an appeal?
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,3324.991,3326.577,--I think it has to be--
2014.13-935,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3326.577,3328.093,It can be final and it can be invalid.
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,3328.093,3330.928,"--Well, it's not a question of being a defect."
2014.13-935,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3342.036,3352.508,"I mean, if a court enters a judgment against you and you say that court never had jurisdiction to enter that judgment, you can't take an appeal because there wasn't a final judgment because the court below lacked jurisdiction."
2014.13-935,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,3353.342,3367.751,"Well, no, the argument would be: If -- at any point on appeal, I can raise the problem that the court to which I'm appealing lacks appellate jurisdiction, lacks jurisdiction to resolve the case, that's the kind of non-waivable problem."
2014.13-935,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3491.945,3493.114,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-935,3,56125,catherine_steege,,3495.297,3511.325,"In response to the test that Justice Sotomayor proposed about possession, that, in fact, under the historic cases -- the Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller case, that's the easy situation, the situation we have here where the debtor has actual possession of the property."
2014.13-935,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3702.461,3704.313,TaubelScott.
2014.13-935,3,56125,catherine_steege,,3704.313,3705.33,Yes.
2014.13-935,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3705.33,3719.49,"Burrell, he says that 21 they say that where possession was assertively held, not for the bankrupt, but for others prior to bankruptcy, the party in possession who is not subject to summary judgment can be divested only if a plenary sued under Section 23."
2014.13-935,3,56125,catherine_steege,,3739.101,3741.936,"But that's not this case, because the debtor has possession."
2014.13-935,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3776.859,3777.676,"Well, the money here is in his bank account."
2014.13-935,3,56125,catherine_steege,,3778.192,3778.561,--Yeah.
2014.13-935,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3793.671,3794.104,"Thank you, counsel."
