1987.87-5546,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.57,"Mr. Stevens, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,8.57,11.122,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-5546,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,233.702,235.885,Were there four questions?
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,235.885,237.654,"Two questions, Your Honor."
1987.87-5546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,244.539,250.193,"As I recall, we require only relevant mitigating circumstances to be considered."
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,254.68,261.5,"Your Honor, what the Court said in Lockett was it is required that the circumstances be relevant."
1987.87-5546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,275.26,276.876,That's not a circumstance of the offense.
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,287.751,290.453,"It goes to whether or not he did it, though, Your Honor."
1987.87-5546,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,340.333,343.821,Wasn't that put in terms of an assumption for the sake of argument in Lockhart?
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,343.821,346.939,"Possibly, Your Honor."
1987.87-5546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,377.708,383.196,"Well, or it can affect the jury whether you tell it to affect them or not."
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,389.2,393.485,It couldn't affect the jury if they're honestly obeying their oath in this case.
1987.87-5546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,430.593,437.18,I am just referring to what our comment could have been referring to when we said it may be of use to the Defendant.
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,440.298,443.666,"I think it's unquestionably of use to the Defendant, Your Honor."
1987.87-5546,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,490.295,502.371,"Mr. Stevens, we'll resume there at 1:00 p.m.--"
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,558.375,561.843,"That is correct, Your Honor, and I don't believe... I do disagree with the state."
1987.87-5546,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,603.903,610.907,I think the only charge on punishment was in the appendix on page 13?
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,610.907,611.807,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.87-5546,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,611.807,623.631,"But the record doesn't indicate... the record, not just the appendix, but the record, apparently, does not incorporate the charges on the guilt phase?"
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,623.631,634.588,"I do believe that the jury was instructed to consider all the evidence... excuse me, to consider the instructions for the previous part of the trial."
1987.87-5546,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,634.588,635.388,Yes.
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,635.388,646.663,"And I would like to emphasize that we rely on lockett as our principal authority, but Lockett was a statutory case."
1987.87-5546,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,652.05,659.288,"But Lockett, of course, didn't deal with instructions; it just dealt with the admissibility of evidence, as I read the opinion."
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,659.288,662.406,"I don't know just the admissibility of evidence, Your Honor."
1987.87-5546,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,695.413,704.435,"You're not contending that any evidence that you offered should have been admitted, and wasn't admitted in violation of Lockett, are you?"
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,704.435,704.735,No.
1987.87-5546,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,746.261,755.617,"Instruction on the punishment phase just repeated what the Court said at the guilt stage... or you wouldn't be here, I take it?"
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,757.051,770.811,"We would be here, Your Honor, because again, our problem is that, even if the jury could have considered all the evidence, there was no procedural vehicle for that jury to give effect to its consideration."
1987.87-5546,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,801.063,805.217,"Now, did you ask for a broader instruction than you got?"
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,805.217,806.517,"We did, Your Honor."
1987.87-5546,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,806.517,808.686,And in what respect was it broader?
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,808.686,816.775,It was broader in respect that it tried to bring the statute as applied in this case into compliance with Lockett.
1987.87-5546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,872.861,889.371,"Mr. Stevens, what besides the residual doubt, which you say couldn't have come to special issue No. 2, what else couldn't have come into the special issue questions?"
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,889.371,894.292,"Under the facts of this case, Your Honor, I'd like to frame the question a little bit differently if I could."
1987.87-5546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,955.663,960.401,Surely the state is entitled to specify the purposes for which you have to consider it.
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,970.922,984.099,"But the fact that the state may or may not be able to specify the purposes; but I certainly don't think they can specify the purposes to the extent that they preclude giving independent weight to relevant, mitigating factors."
1987.87-5546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,984.099,998.09,"Well, I'm perhaps with you on that, but you allow that everything except the residual doubt element could have come in on one of the special issues."
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,998.09,1000.876,It could have come in for limited consideration.
1987.87-5546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1000.876,1001.978,For limited consideration.
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,1001.978,1004.044,Only for the purpose of probability.
1987.87-5546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1031.83,1049.958,"Still, except for the residual doubt element, you must acknowledge what has happened here is at least within the language of our earlier cases; that the jury could, except for residual doubt, could have taken into account all of the mitigating elements you are concerned about with one exception?"
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,1049.958,1055.362,The cases are a little bit confusing to me.
1987.87-5546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1072.074,1076.776,"Okay, but that's still technically whether it's ""must"" or ""may"", it would still technically come within that."
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,1084.381,1088.833,It gets back to what I said earlier about consideration versus proper consideration.
1987.87-5546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1088.833,1089.233,I understand.
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,1096.022,1097.489,I do think there is in Lockett.
1987.87-5546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1120.321,1131.612,"I thought that meant just independent from all other mitigating factors, where you interpret it to mean what unrelated to any specific showing."
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,1131.612,1150.257,"I think it means independent of any factors mitigating or aggravating, and in this case, in Mr. Franklin's case, when it was shown that he had committed two prior rapes; when it was shown that he had a bad reputation; that was an aggravating factor as far as probability of future dangerousness goes."
1987.87-5546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1166.217,1172.237,"Well, is your premise, then, that Lockett undercuts Jurek?"
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,1172.237,1174.772,Not necessarily.
1987.87-5546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1221.17,1233.311,"Well, Jurek was a facial attack on it, though."
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,1237.965,1239.015,"It did, Your Honor."
1987.87-5546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1285.51,1287.696,"Well, there is this difference."
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,1313.513,1318.583,I don't think this question was presented as I read the briefs in Jurek or the decision in Jurek.
1987.87-5546,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1366.748,1369.35,"It depends in the way of what you mean by ""consider""."
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,1383.693,1391.529,"Even if that's true, Texas is still not providing a procedural mechanism."
1987.87-5546,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1391.529,1395.065,But then you're going beyond... they you're cutting into Jurek.
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,1416.164,1420.549,"No one suggested either that you couldn't add that, Your Honor, and I think that when you--"
1987.87-5546,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1420.549,1422.568,But that would make it an amendment of the statute.
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,1422.568,1424.001,--I don't think it does.
1987.87-5546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1435.575,1438.594,"Well, here's what Jurek said on that point:"
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,1460.11,1466.514,--I don't know that it was complied with.
1987.87-5546,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1502.603,1522.683,"But you want an instruction to the jury that said, wholly aside from any of these questions you have to answer, if you feel like... if you think the mitigating circumstances indicate the Death penalty is not appropriate, you may answer any of these questions that you want to know."
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,1522.683,1525.568,We asked for two sorts of instructions and that was one of them.
1987.87-5546,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1525.568,1530.104,"Yes well, and the others had the same effect."
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,1530.104,1545.597,"The other one, basically, I think request No. 1 asked the jury to consider mitigating evidence, and if that evidence requires an answer No. 1 or No. 2, then you can answer it ""no""."
1987.87-5546,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1545.597,1555.571,"I thought you really said if the mitigating evidence indicated the Death penalty were inappropriate, you may answer question No. 1 ""no""."
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,1555.571,1556.971,"That's what we did, Your Honor."
1987.87-5546,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1565.927,1569.581,"Yes, but they have... it has the same effect either way."
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,1569.581,1576.485,"It does, and we think the effect is one of making the statute as applied constitutional."
1987.87-5546,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1580.187,1585.924,But Lockett didn't purport to disturb Jurek did it?
1987.87-5546,0,36755,mark_stevens,,1585.924,1587.309,Absolutely not.
1987.87-5546,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1701.63,1702.981,"Thank you, Mr. Stevens."
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,1705.266,1717.574,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-5546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1898.659,1902.444,May I ask you a question about the second statutory question--
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,1902.444,1903.046,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-5546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1903.046,1907.414,--that asks if he would commit criminal acts that would constitute a continuing threat to society.
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,1916.52,1922.691,"The question simply asks, if he is allowed to live--"
1987.87-5546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1922.691,1932.149,"It's if he's allowed to live, not if... the words ""continuing threat to society"" made me wonder if it was intended to mean if he were turned loose in society?"
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,1932.149,1940.553,"--The court, to my knowledge, has never restricted society to free society as opposed to, for example, being confined in prison."
1987.87-5546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1940.553,1944.873,"So that the predicate is, ""if not put to death"", he would do those things?"
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,1944.873,1946.223,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.87-5546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1946.223,1947.039,Okay.
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,1947.039,1979.094,"The state's position is, then, that any juror who has any residual doubts about the actual guilt of the defendant is not sufficient to rise to the level of a reasonable doubt as to his guilt, still can find expression for those concerns in the Texas special issues to determine that, by giving additional weight to the evidence of deliberateness, as was brought out in Franklin's case, the jury would be able to return a ""no"" answer on that special issue."
1987.87-5546,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2027.325,2030.479,"Well counsel, suppose that the instruction here were,"
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,2040.001,2042.287,If those were the--
1987.87-5546,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2042.287,2042.987,Valid?
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,2042.987,2053.659,"--those were the only issues presented, and those were the concerns that the jury is to be taking into account in its sentencing decision."
1987.87-5546,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2053.659,2056.594,Can the Court give that instruction in every case?
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,2056.594,2064.283,The instructions that the courts typically give are that you are to consider all of the evidence in answering the special issues.
1987.87-5546,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2064.283,2067.902,"Well, but I'm asking if you could give the instruction that I proposed?"
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,2067.902,2069.604,That the--
1987.87-5546,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2069.604,2079.126,And may consider all of the mitigating circumstances; all of the evidence that's been presented to you; but only in order to answer question Nos.
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,2081.328,2125.773,"--That would be permissible, because our position is that all relevant mitigating evidence; all the evidence that goes to determine the individual culpability of this particular Defendant, and the evidence that goes to determine whether he can be rehabilitated, whether he's going to continue to be a threat to society, or whether there is a possibility of treating him or at least restraining him in such a way that he does not continue to be a threat, is covered in these two special issues, so that any relevant mitigating evidence that would be presented by the defendant, can be considered within the two special issues, and the jury could properly be limited to consideration of the evidence within those special issues."
1987.87-5546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2125.773,2127.156,May I follow up on that?
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,2168.866,2174.837,I'm not sure that it would be proper to say that the evidence can be limited only to the second special issue.
1987.87-5546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2174.837,2175.754,Or the first or the second.
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,2175.754,2179.074,Be limited to the first or the second special issue.
1987.87-5546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2189.596,2194.433,"Or say he was 18, and he said a man of 18 shouldn't be... he wanted to argue that?"
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,2194.433,2203.706,"--If the only thing that the defendant does is introduce the fact that his age at the time of his offense, certainly that can be considered in mitigation in the jury."
1987.87-5546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2203.706,2217.533,But how could it if the judge gave the instruction that Justice Kennedy proposed: the fact that he's 18 is only relevant to the question whether he would constitute a continuing threat to society... you may not weigh it for any other purpose?
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,2217.533,2222.318,Or that he did not have the maturity to act with the kind of deliberateness--
1987.87-5546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2222.318,2223.151,Correct.
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,2223.151,2226.904,--that we would ascribe to people that we think deserve the Death penalty.
1987.87-5546,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2308.591,2340.895,"But the assertion here is that you may come up with, and the assertion is that there was in this case an element of mitigation that was mitigating not because it went to one of these two factors but for some other reason, such as in particular the fact that he had been well-behaved the last time he was in prison, which could go to whether he would be dangerous in the future, issue No. 2, or it could also go to the question whether he was basically a pretty good person; a person of good character."
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,2350.119,2359.308,Because this is an aspect of his character that is a relevant consideration that the jury needs to take into account.
1987.87-5546,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2383.924,2384.674,I know it is.
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,2415.812,2434.456,"This Court has said that the relevant concerns that the jury must take into account and must be looking at are the individual culpability of the defendant what comes before it; and the aspects of that defendant's character that demonstrate, for example, whether he is going to be capable of being rehabilitated."
1987.87-5546,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2450.966,2452.418,In this case--
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,2475.783,2524.347,"That's correct, because as this Court pointed out, the relevant considerations, the concerns, that the jury is to be looking at is the individual culpability of this defendant; this is the purpose of individualized sentencing; this is why we want to have the juries engage in individualized sentencing, because we want to look at the culpability of this particular Defendant to determine his, for example, his degree of participation in the offense; his degree of the culpability that he bears for the very type of crime that he committed; whether it was a particularly savage and brutal crime; whether there were perhaps mitigating aspects even in the circumstances of the offense, in the way that the crime was committed."
1987.87-5546,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2780.546,2786.164,"Was that juror excused for cause or not for cause, the one that couldn't see the difference between intentional and deliberate?"
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,2791.168,2793.77,"I don't recall, Your Honor."
1987.87-5546,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2795.889,2805.761,"I would think, if the difference is as obvious as you say, and you have a juror who can't understand it, you shouldn't have to waste a preemptory challenge."
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,2805.761,2808.379,"I would think that it would have been for cause, but I don't recall exactly."
1987.87-5546,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2899.837,2914.763,"Is it fair to say, counsellor, that with reference to Franklin's requested instructions, he did not seek to add any special issues, but simply to instruct the jury how the special issues were to be answered; and that was done?"
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,2915.563,2919.549,He certainly did not attempt to add any special issues.
1987.87-5546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3010.641,3021.866,"Yes, but couldn't you make the same argument in Lockett, that all the evidence was received and could have been considered, but just for limited purposes, rather than with respect to the ultimate question?"
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,3021.866,3032.572,The statute in Ohio really did not allow the jury to consider the evidence that was not directly related to the three specially defined mitigating circumstances.
1987.87-5546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3045.064,3045.414,No.
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,3067.878,3084.106,"I think that that evidence, I really fail to see that that particular evidence has any kind of relevance to the jury's consideration, other than as it goes to the question whether this particular defendant is going to be a future danger."
1987.87-5546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3085.974,3095.164,"Well, they could believe, you know, he was sincerely repentant and all the rest of it, yet not have a strong enough character to avoid involvement in future criminal activity."
1987.87-5546,1,46670,william_c_zapalac,,3110.507,3133.955,--I think that that type of evidence would also be in the way that you phrased it could also be relevant to the first special issue in whether this particular defendant is capable of actually engaging in the type of behavior that is so personally culpable that the jury would be justified in imposing the death penalty.
1987.87-5546,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3173.247,3174.949,"Thank you, Mr. Zapalac."
1987.87-5546,2,36755,mark_stevens,,3177.115,3178.567,Thank you.
1987.87-5546,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3197.628,3205.865,"But am I right, counsel, that the only thing you requested was that the jurors consider those factors with respect to special issue Nos."
1987.87-5546,2,36755,mark_stevens,,3207.967,3216.137,"--Two types of instructions: one, consider the mitigating evidence when deciding the true answer of special issue Nos."
1987.87-5546,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3226.259,3228.278,Which instruction was that?
1987.87-5546,2,36755,mark_stevens,,3228.278,3233.497,"Two... well, three, four and five did it exclusively; and two was a mixed instruction."
1987.87-5546,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3233.497,3243.103,But each one of those refers only to the jury's consideration of questions of special issue Nos.
1987.87-5546,2,36755,mark_stevens,,3244.153,3245.305,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.87-5546,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3245.305,3256.077,"Your point is it sort of rewrites to... I mean, it says you can answer No. 2 ""no"" even though the answer is ""yes""?"
1987.87-5546,2,36755,mark_stevens,,3256.077,3257.462,"Correct, Your Honor."
1987.87-5546,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3267.468,3290.584,"You're talking about No. 5 in particular, your instruction that you may answer special issue No. 2 No. 2 ""no"" even though its real answer is ""yes""."
1987.87-5546,2,36755,mark_stevens,,3292.317,3293.202,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.87-5546,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3334.196,3338.296,"Thank you, Mr. Stevens, the case is submitted."
