1983.82-206,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.701,"We will hear arguments first this morning in Firefighters Local Union v. Stotts, and the consolidated case."
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,14.532,17.802,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,74.549,76.482,I take it this was a Title 7 case.
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,76.482,77.872,"It was, Your Honor."
1983.82-206,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,250.985,258.841,"Mr. Blair, in your view, does it make any difference whether this is treated as an interpretation of the decree or a motion to modify it?"
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,258.841,265.485,"--Justice Rehnquist, in terms of the ultimate result, I don't think it makes any difference."
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,290.871,297.557,"Mr. Blair, may I ask, have any of these white firefighters been reinstated?"
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,297.557,299.938,"Justice Brennan, they have."
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,305.8,306.472,Yes.
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,306.472,311.975,"However, there are continuing effects from this injunction."
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,311.975,313.004,"Well, as to them?"
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,313.004,314.165,"Yes, as to them."
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,314.165,314.987,As to those who have been reinstated?
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,314.987,315.367,As to them.
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,329.076,330.997,What exactly have they lost?
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,330.997,336.002,--They have lost... they got no seniority credit during the time that they were laid off.
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,336.002,337.281,And how long was that?
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,337.281,339.394,That was approximately a month.
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,339.394,339.903,A month.
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,339.903,340.634,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,340.634,342.046,And how about back pay?
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,342.046,344.317,There is back pay due and owing.
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,347.388,348.109,"Is that also a month, Mr. Blair?"
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,348.109,348.887,I beg your pardon?
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,348.887,350.279,Is the back pay also a month?
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,350.279,364.289,"The back pay with regard to those three firefighters would be a month, but with regard to the seven additional drivers, the five additional inspectors, and the nine additional lieutenants, there would also be back pay due and owing by our contention."
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,366.139,369.542,"How, by your contention, how much would they be owing?"
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,369.542,386.264,"--If Your Honor please, I have never really computed that, but as to those people who were bumped down in classification, they would be due the amount that is the difference between what they would have earned had they been retained on the job and what they earned in a lower-paying classification."
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,386.264,390.075,Does the city have any authority to make then whole in this respect?
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,390.075,394.449,It's the union's contention that the city does.
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,394.96,395.779,That it does?
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,395.779,396.63,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,396.63,399.982,"Well, if it does, why isn't this case moot?"
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,399.982,420.767,"If Your Honor please, we would respectfully submit that a proposition that the city could, by with the stroke of a pen, as Respondents contend, right the wrong and make this case moot, is tantamount to suggesting that if a case can be settled, a case is moot."
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,424.199,429.782,"Well, suppose your contention were accepted by the... you said you are asking the city to make them whole."
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,433.856,436.256,"Yes, Your Honor, we would say it, the case was not moot."
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,436.256,436.757,You still say it's not.
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,437.356,441.379,"Because this case is capable of repetition, yet evading review."
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,453.448,463.854,"While I have you interrupted, may I ask, did the Tennessee Supreme Court hold that the memorandum of understanding with the union was unenforceable?"
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,463.854,464.775,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,464.775,465.746,Under state law?
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,465.746,467.066,It did.
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,467.066,475.112,"How does that bear, if it does, on the provision of 703(h) as to bona fide seniority system?"
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,475.112,478.443,"If Your Honor please, I don't believe it has any effect whatsoever."
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,479.685,481.845,Even if it is illegal under state law?
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,481.845,482.726,--That's right.
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,506.001,511.354,"You mean, independently of the memorandum with the union, which I gather your state court has said is unenforceable."
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,511.354,512.025,That's right.
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,512.025,512.896,Void under state law.
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,512.896,513.617,Right.
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,513.617,515.608,There was a unilateral policy which--
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,515.608,516.289,That's right.
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,516.289,517.177,--provided this?
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,517.177,518.409,Right.
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,533.44,535.34,"I guess most of them are, aren't they?"
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,535.34,545.308,"Well, I would say most are, but that doesn't mean that they are exclusively, and we would submit that there are at least some mentions in the legislative history which would support our position as well."
1983.82-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,545.308,548.851,"Do you know of any that has passed on this question, any decisions?"
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,548.851,560.866,"There are a few decisions which have ruled on this question, and they are mentioned in the amicus brief of the International Association of Firefighters on the merits in this case."
1983.82-206,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,560.866,569.063,"Mr. Blair, if the District Court's order is invalidated, does back pay and seniority automatically follow?"
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,569.063,576.388,"Well, if Your Honor please, it would be our position on behalf of the union that it certainly should--"
1983.82-206,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,576.388,580.33,Would a separate suit be necessary for that purpose?
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,580.33,581.382,--I don't believe so.
1983.82-206,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,585.424,590.158,"Obviously my questions indicate that I, too, am concerned about mootness."
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,590.158,593.189,"If Your Honor please, there can be--"
1983.82-206,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,593.189,594.649,May I ask why it would automatically--
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,594.649,595.43,--Excuse me.
1983.82-206,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,595.43,597.871,--Finish your answer to Justice Blackmun.
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,598.933,612.862,"Well, I was going to address myself to the fact that there are these continuing effects and that this is one of those cases that deals with the doctrine of or is affected by, covered by, if you will, the doctrine capable of repetition yet evading review."
1983.82-206,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,614.902,628.861,"Yes, I did want to ask about the specific consequences because I was wondering if, as you answered in response to Justice Brennan, the collective bargaining agreement is not enforceable, what is the source of the city's legal obligation to pay the back pay?"
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,628.861,631.722,"Well, if Your Honor please--"
1983.82-206,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,631.722,637.048,"I understand they have the power to do it, but I think you are also contending on behalf of the union they have an obligation to do it."
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,637.048,638.877,--Under their own rules and regulations--
1983.82-206,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,638.877,640.638,Just the matter of their own rules and regulations.
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,640.638,641.149,--That's right.
1983.82-206,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,641.149,642.921,Don't they have the power to change those rules?
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,642.921,644.912,"Certainly they do, but they haven't."
1983.82-206,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,644.912,652.937,"So in all events, isn't it a managerial decision as to whether they will pay the back pay and the seniority, regardless of who wins the lawsuit?"
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,652.937,677.543,"Well, if Your Honor please, it certainly would be our contention on behalf of the union that if they have a rule and regulation that is in effect and an obligation arises out of the enforcement of that rule and regulation, that an employer could not at that point at its whim say, well, that's not our rule and regulation anymore, after the fact, and thereby in effect erase the obligation or do away with the obligation."
1983.82-206,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,705.922,706.893,Sort of a stop.
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,714.396,721.382,"Well, if Your Honor please, it is true that as to those people who were laid off--"
1983.82-206,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,721.382,722.043,--Right.
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,722.043,733.971,"--When you got down to the bottom of the seniority list, if you will, that the three white firefighters were affected were hired the same day as the three blacks who would have been affected had the seniority policy of the city been applied."
1983.82-206,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,735.42,740.135,"And the policy apparently required they be laid off in reverse alphabetical order, is that right?"
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,740.135,740.866,That's right.
1983.82-206,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,740.866,742.747,What was the source of that decision?
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,742.747,757.386,"Well, if Your Honor please, as I think this court recognized in California Brewers, every seniority system is going to have aspects of that system which are not based on the length of employment."
1983.82-206,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,774.006,776.607,It as the city's decision rather than the collective bargaining agreement.
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,777.679,778.881,"That's right, Justice Stevens."
1983.82-206,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,778.881,779.69,"Okay, thank you."
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,788.375,790.498,"I do, Justice Powell."
1983.82-206,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,879.326,886.802,Is any of that other than the income tax unique to Memphis as compared to every other large city in this country?
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,886.802,900.319,"Justice Marshall, I can't really speak authoritatively to that except that I would say this, that I don't imagine that there are a great many cities which are in the position of Memphis in that they have reached the maximum sales tax that they can impose."
1983.82-206,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1052.32,1071.351,"Mr. Blair, did the department when it entered into the consent decree waive its right to prove that future beneficiaries of the affirmative action were not actual victims of the discrimination, if it existed?"
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,1071.351,1073.073,No.
1983.82-206,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1083.139,1095.608,"Well, did the department waive its right to prove that these people who benefitted from the order of the court were not actual victims of discrimination?"
1983.82-206,0,15441,allen_s_blair,,1095.608,1101.152,"--With regard to the relief granted, yes, but not with regard to additional relief that might be requested later."
1983.82-206,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1150.344,1154.015,Mr. Solicitor General?
1983.82-206,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1154.015,1157.057,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-206,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1439.113,1448.259,"Mr. Lee, can the employer entering into a consent decree waive that requirement, in your view?"
1983.82-206,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1448.259,1469.104,"--I suppose that an employer could, as a matter of agreement, at the front end of the decree, could agree to it, and thereby would waive it, but Teamsters is rather careful in spelling out the procedure that is to be followed, and it is a two-step procedure."
1983.82-206,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1525.119,1538.908,"May I ask, Mr. Solicitor General, does it make any difference in your argument that the Tennessee Supreme Court has held that this particular memorandum between the union and the employer is unenforceable under state law?"
1983.82-206,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1538.908,1541.229,"It does not, Justice Brennan, for this reason."
1983.82-206,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1542.681,1549.066,"Just let me ask, that doesn't bear on the question whether this is a bona fide seniority system within 703(h)?"
1983.82-206,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1549.066,1574.571,"--No, it does not because it is very clear from the record in this case, from the testimony of the mayor and others in the joint appendix that absent the court order, the city is within its right as a matter of its own exercise of governmental prerogatives, would have followed this seniority system It was the city's system, so that absent the court order, it is the seniority system that would have prevailed."
1983.82-206,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1574.571,1588.51,"Mr. Solicitor General, may I just be sure, under your argument, if the parties in advance had agreed on precisely what the district court ordered as a part of the original consent decree, are you contending that would have been beyond the court's power to approve?"
1983.82-206,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1588.51,1602.26,"No, so long as those innocent third parties were in fact represented, as I think they could have been held to have been represented by the Firefighters Union which did intervene in this case."
1983.82-206,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1602.26,1609.293,"Well, then, doesn't your argument depend on the court's order being a modification as opposed to an interpretation of the decree?"
1983.82-206,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1617.428,1640.545,"It was a kind of a logical sequence, you could make that order, but that is far too much of a distortion of the interests in the facts of this case, of innocent third workers, third parties, to say that they did in fact agree to that, because in fact they simply never got beyond the pattern and practice issue in that case."
1983.82-206,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1640.545,1650.35,"--You certainly wouldn't suggest that the city itself, by agreeing to a consent decree, could waive the rights of nonvictims."
1983.82-206,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1650.35,1653.462,"Of course not, and that is exactly the point that I hope that I was making."
1983.82-206,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1773.031,1775.142,Very well.
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,1777.833,1780.475,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-206,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1815.248,1824.376,"Mr. Fields, do you, do you contend that the order entered by Judge McRea in this case, the most recent order, is a modification?"
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,1824.376,1826.036,"--No, sir, I do not contend it's a modification."
1983.82-206,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1826.036,1828.067,You disagree with the Court of Appeals then.
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,1828.067,1828.988,No.
1983.82-206,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1828.988,1836.561,"Well, the Court of Appeals said the principal issue raised on this appeal is where the district court erred in modifying the 1980 decree."
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,1836.561,1845.076,"Well, Your Honor, first, it's our belief that the district court simply effectuated the purpose of the decree, and did--"
1983.82-206,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1845.076,1849.229,Then you do think the Court of Appeals was wrong in saying that it was a modification.
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,1849.229,1850.07,"--No, I do not think the Court of Appeals... no."
1983.82-206,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1880.131,1884.753,"Well, why do you think the Court of Appeals then referred to it as modifying the decree?"
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,1884.753,1886.896,"Your Honor, I don't know."
1983.82-206,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1916.193,1919.335,What would you suggest we do if we agree with you?
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,1919.335,1928.902,I suggest that you vacate the judgment below and remand for a determination of mootness.
1983.82-206,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1928.902,1930.054,A determination.
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,1943.043,1943.832,"Yes, sir, that's correct."
1983.82-206,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1943.832,1947.434,"Completely, and do away with the consent decree, and--"
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,1947.434,1948.403,"No, sir."
1983.82-206,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1952.166,1952.957,"--Well, it's a judgment, isn't it?"
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,1954.938,1957.021,"--The consent decree is, yes, sir, but this--"
1983.82-206,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1957.021,1963.744,"Well, then why... normally, normally we strip the whole thing down clear through the district court."
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,1963.744,1965.176,"--No, this court has--"
1983.82-206,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1965.176,1970.709,"Well, do you... I don't know... you can't... I don't think you can have it both ways."
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,1970.709,1977.164,--The only thing on appeal in this case is the preliminary injunction that the district court entered in May of 1981.
1983.82-206,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1991.292,1998.576,But if that... unless you say that the case... unless the mootness necessarily undermines the case--
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,1998.576,2002.44,"Well, but the mootness doesn't go to the specific... the provisions of the consent decree."
1983.82-206,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2003.111,2008.113,--Could we ever hold that a particular part of a decree was moot without holding that the whole case was moot?
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,2008.113,2018.702,"--Your Honor, I am... my position is in this court, and I don't think anyone has said to the contrary, that the decree itself is valid, that--"
1983.82-206,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2018.702,2021.844,So there is still an underlying case in controversy?
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,2021.844,2031.407,"--No, there's no underlying case in controversy in terms of the court's preliminary injunction as a result of further enforcing the decree."
1983.82-206,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2034.409,2036.282,Mr. Fields?
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,2036.282,2037.081,Yes.
1983.82-206,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2037.081,2044.878,"If the city was short of money again, could this situation be repeated in the future?"
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,2044.878,2048.11,"It is our position, Your Honor, that that is a different case."
1983.82-206,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2065.622,2074.287,"Well, I'm just asking whether it is possible that in the future this city might run short of money and need to implement some kind of a layoff program."
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,2074.287,2079.86,"--Yes, Your Honor, but that layoff would have to be determined as to those circumstances."
1983.82-206,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2145.244,2150.677,"Well, I suppose the Department was bound by the city's seniority plan."
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,2150.677,2151.889,"--No, Your Honor."
1983.82-206,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2155.431,2160.023,"Well, I suppose the department was bound by the city's plan."
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,2160.023,2161.353,The fire department?
1983.82-206,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2161.353,2162.434,Yes.
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,2162.434,2164.765,"Yes, it was, but the city is the defendant in this case."
1983.82-206,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2231.839,2236.543,"Well, may I ask, Mr. Fields, that on page 31 of your brief--"
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,2236.543,2237.444,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-206,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2237.444,2255.514,"--In arguing mootness, you say this: even if the May 18 order were reversed, employees who were laid off in 1981 still would receive no seniority credit for that period unless the city itself chooses to alter its layoff policy."
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,2255.514,2256.786,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-206,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2256.786,2259.258,Is that Tennessee law or is that federal law or what?
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,2259.258,2263.081,"No, that's the state of... the state of the situation in the court now."
1983.82-206,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2271.847,2273.286,Why is there not?
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,2273.286,2277.89,Because the union or those employees have never made a claim for that.
1983.82-206,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2277.89,2287.157,"Well, they are making, they are making, they are litigating the issue here, and unless they have, unless they win on this issue, there is no basis for a claim."
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,2287.157,2290.608,"If they win or they lose, Your Honor, there is no basis for it."
1983.82-206,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2290.608,2291.568,Exactly.
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,2300.524,2305.917,"Well, Your Honor, there is no basis for it because everything has been achieved by the preliminary injunction."
1983.82-206,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2413.739,2420.334,"Well, are any of them losers of a month's back pay and seniority credit?"
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,2420.334,2420.862,"--Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1983.82-206,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2420.862,2428.429,Are any of those reinstated employees nevertheless out a month's back pay and seniority credit?
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,2428.429,2440.506,"They are as a result of what the city did, but like we say in our brief, the city could change that unilaterally, just as it adopted this layoff program unilaterally."
1983.82-206,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2440.506,2443.558,You mean unilaterally it can pay them a month's back pay?
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,2443.558,2444.938,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1983.82-206,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2445.649,2448.531,And what... how do they restore the month's seniority credit?
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,2448.531,2452.074,"--They just grant the seniority, change their seniority days."
1983.82-206,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2465.762,2468.954,Is that a matter of grace on the part of the city in your view?
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,2468.954,2470.496,"Yes, sir, it is."
1983.82-206,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2470.496,2476.888,Then there is a way to enforce that by the individuals?
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,2476.888,2480.21,"No, sir, as far as I can tell there is no way to enforce it."
1983.82-206,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2481.442,2485.286,"Then it doesn't carry much water here, does it?"
1983.82-206,2,39191,richard_b_fields,,2485.286,2486.595,--In this court?
1983.82-206,3,15441,allen_s_blair,,3503.938,3505.49,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-206,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3505.49,3506.161,Very well.
