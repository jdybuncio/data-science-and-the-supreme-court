1978.78-610,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.029,Mr. Justice Brennan.
1978.78-610,0,41873,samuel_h_porter,,16.512,21.401,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-610,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,128.595,133.187,Is the school district -- are there boundaries of the school district coterminous with the boundaries of the City of Columbus?
1978.78-610,0,41873,samuel_h_porter,,133.187,135.126,"Not entirely, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1978.78-610,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,203.997,207.273,"All the others, it adds up to 99%."
1978.78-610,0,41873,samuel_h_porter,,207.273,211.77,"37 -- 67.5 white, 32.5 non-white."
1978.78-610,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,211.77,212.364,I see.
1978.78-610,0,41873,samuel_h_porter,,212.364,214.577,There are very few others.
1978.78-610,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,217.67,222.142,"Well, either -- what are they -- a certain -- white or non-white."
1978.78-610,0,41873,samuel_h_porter,,222.142,225.18,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1978.78-610,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,347.649,381.76,"Mr. Porter, don't you think that the District Court's findings are pretty well-insulated from review by the language from Judge Edward's opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in this case which is at page 199 of the petition where he says if the detailed findings in this paragraph tracking the language of the date and case, and he's referring to the District Court's postdated opinion, cannot appropriately be implied from the District Judge's post datement-- date and opinion, and we think they can and should be."
1978.78-610,0,41873,samuel_h_porter,,390.944,402.563,"If the question, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and I'm not sure that I understand it, if it -- if the question is, “Is that an appropriate finding of system-wide liability by the Court of Appeals?” It is our position that it is not."
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,1705.659,1710.888,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.78-610,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1810.376,1824.315,"Mr. Atkins, you speak of the court remaining true to its teachings in Dayton and I'd like to ask you about a finding of Judge Duncan and then ask you about some language from Dayton."
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,1890.554,1894.515,"No, I do not, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1978.78-610,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2031.18,2037.373,"Well, what do you think the court meant by “system-wide segregation?”"
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2048.453,2065.293,"I think the court recognized, as this Court did in Keyes, that state action can take place either by the passage of a law in a legislature or by the action of a school official imbued with the power of the state constitution and legislature."
1978.78-610,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2112.83,2125.049,"But supposing that just happened once, just one site selection that taken place with a deliberately segregative attempt on -- intent on the part of one."
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2134.708,2136.652,"No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1978.78-610,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2142.728,2143.151,"Well, what --"
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2143.151,2154.973,-- finding of a single violation with a single school even taking into account whatever reciprocal effects there might have been would certainly not justify a system-wide remedy and we are not arguing that here.
1978.78-610,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2155.985,2160.485,"Well, then, what -- there is some intermediate finding then, I take --"
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2160.485,2160.809,Yes.
1978.78-610,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2160.809,2172.801,Everybody concedes that the District Court has to make between a single segregative act and the imposition of a system-wide remedy.
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2176.749,2188.386,"I think -- and I think the District Court and the Court of Appeals, if I might say, each wrestled with that problem as indeed this Court has wrestled with it."
1978.78-610,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2292.685,2300.562,"Now, as I understand it, this lawsuit was brought in, what, 1976?"
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2300.562,2302.198,1973.
1978.78-610,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2302.198,2303.05,1973
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2303.05,2303.971,The trial was 1975-1976.
1978.78-610,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2303.971,2327.262,"Alleging and the basis for the lawsuit was and had to be, a claim that the Columbus School Board was then violating the law of the State of Ohio and the Constitution of the United States by maintaining a dual school system, i.e. a school system, ones -- some schools for Negros and other schools for white people."
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2329.789,2331.909,"That was essentially the claim, yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-610,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2331.909,2341.257,"And, at that time, how many all-white or all-black schools were there in the system?"
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2341.257,2351.138,I must -- in attempting to respond to that -- complete the answer I didn't want to fully give when you're asking the question.
1978.78-610,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2372.885,2377.265,"Well, the -- but the gist of the lawsuit had to be that at the time of the lawsuit --"
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2377.265,2378.054,That's correct.
1978.78-610,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2378.054,2393.848,"The School Board of Columbus was maintaining and -- a school system that was illegal, incidentally, under the law of Ohio and also, most relevantly here, under the Constitution of the United States, as of the time the lawsuit was filed, isn't it?"
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2394.197,2394.481,That's correct.
1978.78-610,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2394.481,2395.351,-- had to be that?
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2395.351,2405.857,"That's correct, and our -- and we believe the conclusion reached by the court, both courts below, was that because --"
1978.78-610,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2405.857,2408.471,"First of all, what's your answer before you get too far away from --"
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2408.471,2408.903,Yes.
1978.78-610,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2408.903,2414.488,"-- my question, how many schools at that time were all one-race schools?"
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2414.488,2418.843,"All one-race schools, I don't know the specific number."
1978.78-610,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2421.998,2427.863,"If it's a dual school system, I think -- I should suppose that would be rather relevant evidence."
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2428.001,2434.128,"Yes, but this was before the court and it is in this record before the court in the appendices."
1978.78-610,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2486.966,2487.624,"Well, the -- but the --"
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2487.624,2488.824,-- of isolated instances.
1978.78-610,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2488.824,2492.383,The relevant time is the time when the lawsuit was filed.
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2492.383,2492.519,I understand.
1978.78-610,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2492.519,2493.908,And the claim had to be that --
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2493.908,2494.232,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-610,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2494.232,2495.166,-- as of that time --
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2495.166,2495.202,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-610,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2495.202,2500.908,-- the Columbus School Board was administering an officially segregated system.
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2500.908,2502.467,I understand.
1978.78-610,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2503.807,2512.234,"And I would suppose that evidence quite relevant to that was how many schools, as of that time were all-white and all-black."
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2512.234,2536.545,"The evidence at the time of trial showed as I recall the statistics, that 70% of the black students then in Columbus elementary schools were in schools which had been mentioned by record evidence before the District Court as having been specifically impacted by segregative activity."
1978.78-610,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2536.545,2537.872,"Of course that doesn't answer my question at all, does it?"
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2537.872,2538.453,I understand.
1978.78-610,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2539.696,2540.344,You don't know.
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2540.344,2540.782,I can --
1978.78-610,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2540.782,2541.047,You don't --
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2541.047,2542.051,-- by saying I don't know the specific --
1978.78-610,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2542.051,2542.169,Right.
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2542.169,2543.088,-- number of schools.
1978.78-610,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2543.088,2543.74,Alright.
1978.78-610,1,42337,thomas_i_atkins,,2543.74,2545.011,I didn't count that.
1978.78-610,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2736.867,2752.88,Thank you Mr. Atkins.
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2754.377,2758.34,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-610,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2800.578,2803.374,"That really doesn't answer my question either, does it?"
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2803.374,2805.619,"Well, I was simply trying to assist the court based upon the record."
1978.78-610,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2805.619,2812.753,"The schools that were involved in Brown against Board of Education were all-black schools and all-white schools officially, weren't they?"
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2812.753,2813.394,That's correct.
1978.78-610,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2813.394,2815.994,Were there any of these in Columbus?
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2815.994,2818.458,There were virtually all-black schools in Columbus at the time of trial.
1978.78-610,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2818.458,2822.074,Were there any of the kind that were dealt with in Brown against Board of Education?
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2822.074,2825.663,I would think not because of the record in this case which is that there was no state statute in effect at the time.
1978.78-610,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2825.663,2828.546,"Well, that's -- what I meant is, does the record show in this case?"
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2828.546,2835.421,The record in this case shows that it was not the type of complete segregation that was in effect in --
1978.78-610,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2835.421,2837.169,And that was what was involved in the Brown case.
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2837.169,2842.101,That's correct.
1978.78-610,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2842.101,2868.641,"And you would agree, I suppose, General Days, would you not, that it's pretty well-established that what the constitution requires is a school system that's racially neutral, that no child and no parent of that child has any constitutional right to attend a particular school with any particular race or racial balance."
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2868.641,2870.333,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.78-610,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2892.579,2898.42,"Oh, I suppose if you went back to 1854, you could find that there were no schools for Negros at all."
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2898.42,2898.718,I think that's probably true.
1978.78-610,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2898.718,2901.753,And that all of the schools were 100% white.
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2901.753,2922.955,"I think that the information with respect to the condition of the schools in 1954 reflects the fact that there was an expressed constitutional responsibility on the part of the Board as of 1954 to try to dismantle a system that was for all intents and purposes, dual given the totality of the circumstances."
1978.78-610,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2924.559,2926.356,"Mr. Days, before you get back."
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2926.356,2926.473,Yes?
1978.78-610,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2926.473,2929.623,You didn't mention teachers.
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2929.623,2929.923,Teachers?
1978.78-610,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2929.923,2933.753,Weren't all Negro teachers exclusively in Negro schools?
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2933.753,2934.267,That's correct.
1978.78-610,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2934.838,2937.077,At the time this lawsuit was brought?
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2937.077,2938.026,"No, not at the time that this suit was brought."
1978.78-610,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2938.026,2939.014,That's 1954.
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2939.014,2941.502,In 1954.
1978.78-610,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3036.774,3048.618,"Mr. Days, what factors does the court consider or what findings ought it to make in distinguishing between the two types of cases that you've just described?"
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3048.618,3054.082,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think that's an issue that was not directly addressed in the Dayton decision."
1978.78-610,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3102.46,3111.507,"Well, but how -- regardless of the presumptions, what is the issue?"
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3111.507,3112.263,What is the issue?
1978.78-610,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3112.263,3113.344,Yes.
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3113.344,3128.715,"It seems to me, the issue has to be a showing by the school board of ways in which its own discriminatory pattern did not in fact have an impact upon specific schools or specific areas of a system, but that burden falls upon the school board."
1978.78-610,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3128.715,3143.75,"Well, do you say that if you proved even one isolated segregated instance that that would shift the burden to the school board, and the school can -- schools district consisting of 176 schools like this, to show that none of the others have been affected?"
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3143.75,3145.051,We do not contend that.
1978.78-610,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3145.051,3148.359,"Well, then where is the tipping point?"
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3148.359,3157.46,"Well, the tipping point is when the court finds that there is a system-wide violation, that is, where the discriminatory practices infect the entire system."
1978.78-610,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3157.46,3161.87,In how -- what question does it ask itself to make that determination?
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3161.87,3166.538,"Well, I would suggest, Mr. Justice Rehnquist that it is not for the court to ask questions of itself."
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3182.446,3192.716,"That's right because, by definition, if it's an isolated violation then one can easily determine -- a court can easily determine what the remedy will be."
1978.78-610,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3192.716,3196.239,So at what point does the burden shift?
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3196.239,3200.152,The burden shifts when there's an establishment of a system-wide violation.
1978.78-610,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3200.152,3200.278,And --
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3200.278,3222.4,"And I think if we look at the record in this case where the Court pursued questions of whether faculty assignments were discriminatory, whether citing policies were discriminatory, whether optional zones and discontiguous zones were discriminatory, once it arrived at a judgment that the system was segregated, then the burden shifted to the school board."
1978.78-610,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3335.787,3342.203,"But General Days, Judge Duncan said he wouldn't even attempt to consider the influence of housing."
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3349.081,3360.427,"Judge Duncan, when he issued the statement that Your Honor quoted earlier, was of course operating without the guidance of Dayton."
1978.78-610,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3404.388,3413.528,"Did Swann also make it as clear, very clear, that there was no constitutional requirement of racial balance to reflect the communities?"
1978.78-610,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3413.528,3414.646,That's correct.
1978.78-610,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3414.646,3420.359,And we said in Swann that if that was what we found we would've reversed.
