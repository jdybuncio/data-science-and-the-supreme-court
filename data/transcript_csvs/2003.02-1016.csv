2003.02-1016,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.999,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-1016, Lee Till v. SCS Credit Corporation."
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,68.526,77.731,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1016,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,131.89,146.173,"When you say traditionally it's been understood to mean real interest rate plus time value of money, it means real interest rate for the particular lender."
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,151.187,164.812,"Under chapter 13, you're simply trying to value the money."
2003.02-1016,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,177.831,193.169,"Well, that's right, but the interest rate that I have to pay when I buy a house with a very small down payment is much higher than the interest I have to pay if I make a much larger down payment."
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,193.169,194.078,That's...
2003.02-1016,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,194.078,201.88,"And the interest I have to pay, if I make, you know, over $200,000 a year is less than I would get if I have a lower income."
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,219.053,219.713,I...
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,219.713,227.31,"You're...  you're talking about interest in the open market, though, which is not what we're talking about here."
2003.02-1016,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,232.261,262.976,"I'm surprised to hear you saying this because I thought your brief acknowledged that even after you begin with the...  with a discount rate, you know, the...  the Fed's discount rate...  I thought your briefs acknowledged that the bankruptcy court could add to that a...  a surcharge depending upon the riskiness of the chapter 13 debtor."
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,262.976,264.379,That...
2003.02-1016,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,264.379,265.881,You didn't acknowledge that?
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,272.181,304.874,"I was going to get to that, but in certain circumstances an additional risk factor may be required, but it is our position that there are many other statutory elements under...  provisions under chapter 13 that cover the types of risks that would normally be included in a contract, for instance."
2003.02-1016,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,304.874,312.426,"Well, I...  I think the same thing that's bothering Justice Scalia, or that prompted his question in any event, is...  is troubling me."
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,347.061,355.113,Because you need to limit the purpose of that premium.
2003.02-1016,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,390.407,399.445,"Well, but if that was true, you could bring up the same thing when you're cross-examining the expert on the coerced loan approach and say, well, we don't want 21 percent because there's a wage assignment."
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,400.809,402.007,No.
2003.02-1016,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,415.936,437.096,"It showed what the creditor had been getting before, and that, I thought, was the argument, that in...  out of chapter 17...  13, in chapter 13 our contract rate was 21 percent, and that represents what it would cost this borrower if he were today to take those funds, get the same funds."
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,456.126,457.78,Well...
2003.02-1016,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,457.78,462.731,"I think you're...  you're saying that that's a wrong approach, and maybe you'll say why."
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,462.731,463.928,Yes.
2003.02-1016,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,513.794,516.683,You think that makes this a better...  a better borrower?
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,526.055,527.458,In many...
2003.02-1016,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,527.458,528.384,"Gee, that's...  that's a novel approach."
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,528.384,555.489,"In many respects, it is safer because here you're talking about a subprime lender who did enter into a contract where it assumed a great amount of risk, but now the debtor's debt structure, his payment obligations have been modified by the chapter 13."
2003.02-1016,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,555.489,564.982,"So you think a lender has two different loan candidates in front of him, one he thinks is going to go through bankruptcy and the other he thinks is not, so he's going to give the loan to the first one?"
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,564.982,567.833,I think that...
2003.02-1016,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,567.833,568.659,That's...  that's very difficult for me to assume.
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,568.659,598.38,"a lender may charge additional interest if...  under State law if the lender has indication that the debtor may go through bankruptcy, but normally in the subprime market, that's all factored in because most subprime candidates are candidates for possible bankruptcy in the future."
2003.02-1016,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,598.38,604.818,Is it a fact that most chapter 13 bankrupts don't make it to the end of the program?
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,604.818,606.304,Well...
2003.02-1016,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,606.304,607.79,"In fact, the vast majority fail."
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,607.79,611.216,That's not necessarily true when you talk...
2003.02-1016,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,611.216,613.445,I thought we had statistics on that.
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,613.445,626.82,"The problem is most of the statistics focus on the default rate just from the filing, the number of filings."
2003.02-1016,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,649.938,654.025,Are there statistics on that kind of cases that you're describing now?
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,654.025,656.747,There...  I have found limited statistics.
2003.02-1016,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,682.753,684.118,It's still not a very good risk.
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,684.611,685.725,Well...
2003.02-1016,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,685.725,686.263,you lend money to somebody.
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,688.659,694.808,The subprime lender's risk in the open market is not good either.
2003.02-1016,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,695.346,696.665,"Well, I think it's better than 2 out of 3."
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,696.665,701.329,It's five times higher than the prime market.
2003.02-1016,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,701.329,706.902,Let...  let me ask you a...  the...  the way I see these two approaches.
2003.02-1016,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,755.986,756.541,I don't know.
2003.02-1016,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,756.541,759.247,A prime rate of 8 percent at most?
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,823.603,839.085,That totally eliminates the fact that a chapter 13 has been filed and that there are certain minimal requirements for chapter 13 confirmation.
2003.02-1016,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,852.498,855.842,I'm talking about using the rate of the loan that was actually made.
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,855.842,869.754,But there is nothing in the statute that requires the creditor to be compensated for all of those items that were included in the pre-petition contract.
2003.02-1016,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,869.754,886.101,"No, but he has to be given the current value of his security and the current value of his security, which is not going to be received 20 years from now or 5 years from now, depends upon how much of a credit risk there is that that money will actually be paid."
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,886.101,899.847,"How could the...  how could you possibly contract in advance for the present value of this particular allowed secured claim, $4,000?"
2003.02-1016,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,916.028,917.393,In...  in an open market.
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,925.854,926.431,That's...
2003.02-1016,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,926.431,929.031,I'm just saying that that's...  that that's a reasonable starting point.
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,948.6,949.965,That's not the question.
2003.02-1016,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,965.484,967.713,Let me ask you this...  this piece of it.
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,1002.72,1005.608,That's a good question.
2003.02-1016,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1039.045,1040.531,A what payment?
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,1040.531,1047.589,"A balloon payment instead of periodic weekly payments, which is usually what you have in a chapter 13."
2003.02-1016,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1047.589,1059.563,"As I understand it, your expert in this case, your economist, testified that the prime rate was 8 percent and that in his view a reasonable risk premium would be 1.5."
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,1072.361,1072.832,That's...
2003.02-1016,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1072.832,1077.29,to my mind is conceding that he has no basis for picking 1.5 percent.
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,1077.29,1083.318,That 1.5 in that case was actually a local bankruptcy rule.
2003.02-1016,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1098.8,1101.855,"The risk...  the risk of a prime borrower, of a fat cat borrower."
2003.02-1016,0,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,1101.855,1108.338,"But, again, we're not talking about borrowing on a new loan in a chapter 13."
2003.02-1016,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1138.719,1140.222,"Very well, Ms. Harper."
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1142.517,1155.604,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1016,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1203.158,1203.696,Is that right?
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1215.956,1229.536,"Your Honor, this is an important point because I think there is some misconception about what the court of appeals held in this case, and I think that's due in part to the fact that respondents, at least as I read their position, are not really defending the approach taken by the court of appeals."
2003.02-1016,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1267.431,1278.205,"I agree with you, and...  and the respondent is not defending that approach, but rather the approach that you use the rate of the...  of the original loan as the starting point, and then adjust it as necessary."
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1278.205,1301.506,"That's correct, and I just want to emphasize, though, that...  that the adjustment that the court of appeals would make is not one I think that anybody before the Court now would defend because the court of appeals would adjust only if you could prove that the...  a particular secured creditor is now making loans at some other rate and there's no reason to think why that has anything to do with what the present value of plan payments would be under 1325."
2003.02-1016,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1302.52,1307.888,"So, but you're saying...  but you're saying that under the respondent's view, that...  that the creditors would be treated differently?"
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1307.888,1315.44,"If respondent's view is that you should have a presumption in favor of the pre-bankruptcy contract rate, then that would be the result."
2003.02-1016,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1341.242,1347.762,Where do you get the principle that all secured creditors have to be treated equally?
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1349.787,1354.261,"Well, Your Honor, on...  I would refer you to page 19..."
2003.02-1016,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1354.261,1355.853,I'm sure it's true of all unsecured creditors.
2003.02-1016,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1357.422,1359.734,Page 19 of what?
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1359.734,1360.477,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1379.796,1381.571,Similarly situated creditors.
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1381.571,1382.109,"To be sure, Your Honor."
2003.02-1016,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1382.109,1384.254,Not secured versus unsecured.
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1384.254,1393.726,That's why I gave the example that I did of two creditors that extend car loans and the only difference between them...  they have the exact same allowed value under the code for their claim.
2003.02-1016,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1404.894,1406.008,"Well, why isn't that a valid distinction?"
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1406.008,1417.691,"Because, Your Honor, from the standpoint of section 1325(a)(5), the relevant inquiry is what is the present value of the promised future payments from the debtor."
2003.02-1016,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1432.181,1432.802,"Well, and the risk..."
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1432.802,1433.711,that those are different for creditors...
2003.02-1016,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1433.711,1439.489,"The risk of the security will just disappear too, you know, be totally devalued."
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1439.489,1442.999,"Your Honor, I don't think that's embodied in section 1325(a)(5)."
2003.02-1016,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1464.714,1465.829,What has that to do with it?
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1467.936,1468.762,"Well, Your Honor, what..."
2003.02-1016,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1468.762,1479.453,"I mean, the reason I say that is I thought we were following a statute, and what the statute tells us is that the value of what they receive has to equal $4,000."
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1494.436,1498.772,"Your Honor, my only point is that this Court in Rash noted that the higher replacement..."
2003.02-1016,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1498.772,1506.203,"Whatever it said in Rash, reading the statute, unless they actually contradicted that, doesn't the statute say what I just said?"
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1514.126,1514.581,I think...
2003.02-1016,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1514.581,1520.07,I would have thought that that kind of thing is something bankruptcy judges are paid to make judgments about all the time.
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1520.07,1522.482,"Well, I...  I generally with...  with Your Honor's statement."
2003.02-1016,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1536.394,1536.849,"Of course, you do."
2003.02-1016,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1536.849,1537.326,"Of course, you do."
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1545.211,1567.519,"Your Honor, if...  if this Court believes that risks of nonpayment need to be taken into account, then we submit that the best way to do that is to start with a market indicator such as the prime rate that captures the time value of money and the risk of inflation and then...  then allow...  and...  and some risk of nonpayment, and then allow the bankruptcy court, which...  which, by the way, has just made a determination under 1325(a)(6) about the likelihood that...  that the payments will be made."
2003.02-1016,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1568.412,1571.839,Start with a figure that you know for sure is wrong.
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1583.766,1584.509,Your Honor...
2003.02-1016,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1584.509,1587.276,Why begin with...  with something...
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1587.276,1588.103,"Your Honor, the answer to your question..."
2003.02-1016,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1588.103,1601.728,"that you know is going to be abysmally low except for the fact that it will mean less money for the secured creditors and more money for the unsecured creditors, among whom is often numbered the United States?"
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1601.728,1603.585,"Your Honor...  Your Honor, the answer to your question..."
2003.02-1016,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1650.973,1660.715,"Well, you could ask them to just look at the contract rate and, if need be, make some adjustment to that because of the fact that they won't have to..."
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1660.715,1661.664,Your Honor...
2003.02-1016,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1661.664,1663.316,go through the collection process.
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1663.316,1674.19,"the difficulty with the contract rate approach is that it varies from creditor to creditor, and there really is no reason to think that...  that either secured creditors, or unsecured creditors for that matter, for purposes of...  of this case, should be treated differently."
2003.02-1016,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1681.149,1684.659,"In this case, as I understand it, this lender always charged 21 percent."
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1692.256,1704.266,"And...  and another secured creditor may have made a loan prior to that at a prime rate to the same debtor, and it always charges the prime rate, neither of which is particularly relevant to the question of what's the value of the promised payments under the plan."
2003.02-1016,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1704.266,1706.867,"But if the second one was so stupid as to do that, why should he be protected?"
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1706.867,1708.891,"Well, Your Honor, it's not a matter of stupidity."
2003.02-1016,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1739.849,1752.852,"Because if this had been foreclosure value, then if we were going through this exercise, well, the creditor would...  would then sell the asset and...  and charge a...  a new borrower with the same rate of interest."
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1756.279,1767.962,"That...  that's correct, and Your Honor, I would add that in fact we think it's possible to read the statute so there's no risk of nonpayment at all because the statute refers to property to be distributed under the plan, and it requires the bankruptcy court to make a finding that the debtor will be able to make payments."
2003.02-1016,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1774.444,1775.537,"Thank you, Mr. Salmons."
2003.02-1016,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1775.537,1775.909,excludes that.
2003.02-1016,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1776.28,1778.388,"Mr. Brunstad, we'll hear from you."
2003.02-1016,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1778.388,1796.442,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1016,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1817.768,1819.171,How...  how many default?
2003.02-1016,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1819.171,1826.563,"Your...  your opponent says that the...  that that's...  if you're taking after the thing is confirmed, after...  that it's a 63 percent."
2003.02-1016,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1826.563,1828.459,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1016,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1844.146,1844.6,After confirmation.
2003.02-1016,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1844.6,1846.292,"Those are...  that's a total number, Your Honor."
2003.02-1016,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1846.292,1846.846,Okay.
2003.02-1016,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1849.43,1854.344,"Since...  and since this is an after-confirmation case, why...  why don't we take that percentage?"
2003.02-1016,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1854.344,1862.805,"Well, Your Honor, giving them the benefit of the doubt, we...  the best we can say, based upon what we know, is approximately a 63 percent success rate."
2003.02-1016,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1862.805,1863.176,After...
2003.02-1016,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1863.176,1877.833,"What do you say to Mr. Salmons' argument that in fact the...  the plan is not supposed to be confirmed unless the judge makes a...  a determination that it can be followed, and it therefore isn't legitimate to take this kind of risk into consideration at all?"
2003.02-1016,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1877.833,1883.405,"It's what we call the feasibility standard, Your Honor, and it applies in every single one of the reorganization chapters."
2003.02-1016,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1901.089,1915.478,"Well, how do we know how...  how many...  what's the percentage of people in this chapter that default within a year on...  on a payment of about $128 a month I guess, that was a small percentage of what they were paying into the court?"
2003.02-1016,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1916.488,1917.64,"Well, there are two sources."
2003.02-1016,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1922.332,1924.477,60 percent fail within a year?
2003.02-1016,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1927.162,1930.627,60 percent fail within the 3 to 5-year period.
2003.02-1016,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1930.627,1930.927,No.
2003.02-1016,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1930.927,1936.2,I asked you how many...  this is...  or let's take it then giving you the benefit of the doubt.
2003.02-1016,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1955.314,1957.643,"The statistics are not disaggregated on that basis, Your Honor."
2003.02-1016,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1957.643,1957.914,Correct.
2003.02-1016,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2003.445,2008.729,"Your Honor, the contract rate is the best evidence, the single best evidence of the market rate."
2003.02-1016,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2008.729,2010.875,"Contract rate...  if there has to be a number that's wrong, it has to be that one."
2003.02-1016,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2010.875,2011.784,But it is less...
2003.02-1016,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2011.784,2029.18,"The contract rate by definition was entered into at some significant period of time prior to the present, and the present, by chance in this instance, is 2 years later, and we know that interest rates fell at least 1 or 2 percent during that time."
2003.02-1016,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2029.18,2030.666,But not for subprime...
2003.02-1016,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2030.666,2030.999,So...  what?
2003.02-1016,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2030.999,2032.252,But not for subprime loans.
2003.02-1016,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2032.252,2033.228,That's impossible.
2003.02-1016,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2034.176,2034.753,"No, Your Honor."
2003.02-1016,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2035.124,2037.725,"If that's so, then the risk went up."
2003.02-1016,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2037.725,2039.544,"No, that's not correct, Your Honor, and this is why."
2003.02-1016,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2039.544,2039.954,No.
2003.02-1016,3,39443,rebecca_j_harper,,3604.701,3608.788,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-1016,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3755.165,3756.568,"Thank you, Ms. Harper."
