2019.19-518,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.065,7.73,"We'll hear argument next in Case Number 19-518, the Colorado Department of State versus Micheal Baca."
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,15.435,35.115,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Constitution authorizes states to use their plenary authority to remove a bribed elector, one who engages in a rebellion, or one who would perpetrate a bait and switch on the people of their state by voting contrary to a binding pledge."
2019.19-518,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,133.625,145.33499995,"Well, my first question is to ask if there is anything that General Purcell said on behalf of the State of Washington with which you disagree?"
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,145.33499995,147.77,"Thank you so much, Mr. Chief Justice."
2019.19-518,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,163.27,173.125,Would you state for me exactly what you think the limits on the state power to replace electors are?
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,173.125,178.235,"Your Honor, here, I would echo my colleague from Washington."
2019.19-518,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,200.42000005,212.89,"So, if you selected electors, one of the requirements is they had to be relatives of the legislators, that would be all right?"
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,212.89,218.015,"Your Honor, here in Colorado, we picked electors in 1976."
2019.19-518,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,226.275,246.18000005,"What if the rule is, you know, the electors are chosen pursuant to slates, but anyone who says anything disloyal to the State between the time they're selected and the time they cast their vote will be replaced?"
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,246.18000005,256.635,"Your Honor, as my colleague from Washington noted, once people are voting to make a choice, people have a right for their ballots to be counted."
2019.19-518,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,268.79999995,281.14499995,Any other limitations on the power of the State? What about the bribery cases that have been -- or bribery hypotheticals that have been discussed?
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,281.14499995,284.055,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2019.19-518,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,308.115,315.22,That's even after the electors have been chosen? In -- in other words --
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,315.22,315.78,The State is --
2019.19-518,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,315.78,317.72,Go ahead.
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,317.72,324.56,"Mr. Chief Justice, the State is indeed authorized to remove electors who have taken a bribe, if that's your question."
2019.19-518,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,324.56,326.505,Yes.
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,363.05500005,382.795,"Your Honor, we disagree. The Constitution clearly gives states plenary power over electors and as -- acting as a steward of the presidential election system. That means, if electors were to take a bribe, for example, or not to show up, it's on the State to address that point."
2019.19-518,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,405.21,408.79,"Thank you, General. Justice Thomas?"
2019.19-518,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,408.79,417.52,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. General, you start your brief questioning standing in this case."
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,430.52500005,440.315,"Your Honor, the past cases involving removal from an elected office, like Powell, for example, involve an official with a salary."
2019.19-518,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,459.025,465.46000005,"So, in -- in a removal case, at what point do you think there would be an injury in fact?"
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,465.46000005,473.695,"Justice Thomas, insofar as someone gives up a salary, like in Humphrey's Executor, you have injury in fact."
2019.19-518,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,483.05,495.02,"On -- on a separate issue, you know, throughout, I guess, our history, there have been not pledges among electors."
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,505.0,507.85,"I can, Justice Thomas. It was Oregon."
2019.19-518,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,531.22,547.61,"You attach yourself to the arguments of General Purcell, so I do want you to -- I understood his comments on -- on the federal -- scope of the federal function concept or argument."
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,551.54,553.86,"With pleasure, Justice Thomas."
2019.19-518,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,583.085,585.23,"Thank you, General."
2019.19-518,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,585.23,588.74999995,Justice Ginsburg?
2019.19-518,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,588.74999995,611.69999995,Can you give us an idea of the practical consequences of a ruling one way or another? How would a ruling against you actually alter our democratic processes? Most states already require elector pledges.
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,623.79500005,664.64,"Your Honor, the chaos that could result from upholding the Tenth Circuit's ruling is one that could occasion a constitutional crisis, as was noted by my colleague from Washington. If states have no ability to remove bribed electors and all that's left is Congress's ability to choose to count or not count, the mere fact of bribing electors in an open enough way would knock out electors, would limit who could vote, and ultimately could sway the outcome of a presidential election. It's the role of the states to oversee confidence in our election systems, to ensure that the public's voice is heard."
2019.19-518,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,670.31000005,678.425,"Returning to the standing question, Baca was removed from his post."
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,699.37,712.71,"Your Honor, the auditor in Smith believed that he suffered a stigma, having to implement an unconstitutional statute. And that concern of his stigma was not sufficient to give him standing."
2019.19-518,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,717.14500005,719.82,Thank you.
2019.19-518,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,719.82,721.935,Justice Breyer?
2019.19-518,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,721.935,725.035,Good morning. A technical question.
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,761.64500005,789.09,"Your Honor, I would start with Justice Ginsburg's opinion in the Northwest Airlines case, where she made plain that whether or not there's a claim for relief in a statute is not a jurisdictional question. What we're dealing with here, both under Section 1983 and Eleventh Amendment immunity, is strategic decisions made by our state in the course of litigation. We made those decisions because we wanted to litigate this case on the merits."
2019.19-518,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,793.72,796.13,"Well, yes, but that isn't my question."
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,820.88000005,830.785,"Justice Breyer, this Court will opt for whatever ground it chooses. With respect to whether the Court has to rule on this issue, the answer is no."
2019.19-518,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,836.93,837.54,Got it.
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,865.43500005,872.34,"Justice Breyer, the first statute was in the late 19-teens in Oregon, but before that, there were --"
2019.19-518,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,872.34,881.21499995,"I thought that was a statute which required a pledge that didn't punish people for how they voted, but, regardless, same point."
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,881.21499995,889.07,"Your Honor, we don't have a history of what types of changes were made. What we know is they happened all the time."
2019.19-518,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,904.64,905.03,That isn't --
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,905.03,905.4,-- until --
2019.19-518,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,905.4,906.17,-- my question.
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,923.46,926.725,"We don't know of any such instances, Your Honor."
2019.19-518,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,926.725,928.085,Thank you.
2019.19-518,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,928.085,930.685,Justice Alito?
2019.19-518,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,930.685,951.015,"In past elections, were there concerted campaigns to influence electors after the popular vote was cast for the purpose of either reversing the result that was produced in the Electoral College by the popular vote or throwing the case into Congress?"
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,951.015,959.84999995,"Justice Alito, the most famous such case would have been in 1876 involving the Tilden/Hayes disputed election."
2019.19-518,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,959.84999995,989.40999995,"My other question is essentially the same one I -- I -- that concerns me with respect to the positions of all the counsel in these two cases, and that is limitation, if any, on the arguments that are being made. So is it your position that a state has plenary power to remove an elector? If not, what -- under what circumstances can an elector not be removed?"
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,989.40999995,998.01,"Your Honor, from McPherson, we do see plenary authority, oversight, and removal power of electors."
2019.19-518,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1007.55999995,1029.51499995,So suppose the legislature is in the hands of a political party other than the party of the candidate who wins the popular vote in the state. Can the legislature simply remove all of the electors who were pledged to vote for that candidate and replace them with other electors?
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,1029.51499995,1032.56,"Justice Alito, this is an important point."
2019.19-518,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1081.485,1102.84,"Well, if we agree with you that the legislature has plenary power to remove electors, then won't the people of your state understand when they cast their vote for President that the legislature has the power to remove the electors pledged to the candidate they favor and replace those electors with other electors?"
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,1102.84,1105.35,Justice Alito --
2019.19-518,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1105.35,1105.83,Won't they be without --
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,1105.83,1112.86,"-- what we're asking for, what we believe the right to vote cases require, is that the public be told what they're voting on."
2019.19-518,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1125.09,1130.865,But what is the -- what is your best -- what is the best right-to-vote case that stands for that principle?
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,1130.865,1138.27,"In Gray versus Sanders, it says the public has a right for their ballots to be counted."
2019.19-518,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1138.27,1142.265,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Kagan?"
2019.19-518,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1142.265,1170.785,"General Weiser, first, on your Tenth Amendment point, why doesn't Thornton foreclose that argument? Thornton said that the Tenth Amendment reserves only those powers that the states held prior to the ratification of the Constitution. I would think that the power we're talking about here is -- is -- is not such a power but, instead, was created by the Constitution in the first instance. So how can the Tenth Amendment support you consistent with Thornton?"
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,1170.785,1178.405,"Thank you, Justice Kagan. What I would suggest here is a similar principle to what Justice Kavanaugh articulated earlier."
2019.19-518,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1191.645,1198.99499995,"But, again, I thought that that was only as to the powers that the states held prior to the ratification of the Constitution."
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,1198.99499995,1218.795,"Your Honor, as a strict matter, that is what the Tenth Amendment does, but there's also the interpretive principle picked up, for example, in Gregory versus Ashcroft that says, when looking at intrusions on state power, limits on state power, given to the feds, you do so lightly."
2019.19-518,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1218.795,1219.95,Okay.
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,1242.75499995,1245.23,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
2019.19-518,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1273.44,1288.255,"And -- and if you're relying on the Qualifications Clause, couldn't you be said to be imposing a qualification too? In other words, that the candidate actually have received more votes than anybody else in your state?"
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,1288.255,1304.775,"Respectfully, Your Honor, I wouldn't interpret that as a qualification to be President, particularly because the right of the states to have a system where the people could be heard is part of the original constitutional design and then again confirmed in the Twelfth Amendment itself."
2019.19-518,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1304.775,1306.87,"Well, it sort of assumes the conclusion."
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,1323.85,1330.01,"Your Honor, if you assume electors have this discretion, you've assumed the answer to this case."
2019.19-518,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1332.46,1332.74,Exactly.
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,1346.15,1356.205,"Your Honor, our position is that the Constitution is silent on whether or not you can have electors representing how the public votes."
2019.19-518,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1365.04,1368.5,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Gorsuch?"
2019.19-518,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1368.5,1411.11,"Counsel, I'd like to continue the same line of questioning that Justice Kagan raised with you and -- and Mr. Lessig suggested. If -- if states enjoy plenary power to remove electors, what would prohibit them from passing a law to say -- for example, to say that -- that all electors have to -- have to vote for presidents -- presidential candidates who support certain positions or who have done certain things or who have visited the state. Now I understand your ex post argument; that is, states can't change the rules of the election after the election and have to provide voters notice."
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,1417.22499995,1440.38,"Your Honor, I'm trying to square how this fits with a popular vote system because, if you give people the power to vote and they exercise the power, then our argument is you count their votes. What I believe you'd be getting at would then be a preclearance process where you'd have to preclear what electors could be on the ballot before people could vote on them."
2019.19-518,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1441.72,1441.84,Well --
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,1441.84,1442.25,Yes.
2019.19-518,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1442.25,1464.445,"-- just to interrupt you, I'm sorry, counsel, but you've -- you've indicated it would be fine for people to have an advisory vote to 12 wise people who would then make the final decision. Why -- why couldn't you also have a system in which the people provide advice within certain parameters set by the legislature?"
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,1464.445,1477.15,"Your Honor, I think that's the same context I had in mind, which is you would basically give people an advisory vote and then, after the fact, you'd have to ask whether the --"
2019.19-518,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1477.15,1478.27,"No, not after the fact."
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,1523.665,1531.91,"In this situation, the State can add limitations as long as they comply with other constitutional provisions."
2019.19-518,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1531.91,1534.025,And do those?
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,1534.025,1539.495,The requirement to visit a state I don't believe clearly violates any constitutional provision.
2019.19-518,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1547.16,1549.795,So the presidential candidate is on the ballot.
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,1555.17499995,1574.285,"Yes, it would be because, if you tell electors they can only vote for -- pick whatever the concern would be -- tax returns, people over 50, the concern is you could be adding a new qualification to be President and thereby disqualify, in effect, someone from being President who the Constitution would qualify to be President."
2019.19-518,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1574.285,1582.345,"How about other -- how about political positions or -- you -- you say visiting the state, that's permissible, that condition would be permissible in your view?"
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,1582.345,1589.925,"Your Honor, I don't see off the top of my head any other constitutional constraint that would address that issue."
2019.19-518,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1601.46,1602.02,Thank you.
2019.19-518,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1602.02,1604.94,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Kavanaugh?"
2019.19-518,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1604.94,1608.59,"Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, General."
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,1613.07,1616.465,"Thank you for that question, Justice Kavanaugh."
2019.19-518,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1639.375,1689.785,"But wouldn't -- if that were the design, why not just leave it to the states, as opposed to going through all these details about how the electors are supposed to operate? As you know, Justice Jackson in Ray, looking at that history, said no one faithful to our history can deny that the plan originally contemplated was that electors would be free agents to exercise an independent and nonpartisan judgment as to the people best qualified for the nation's highest offices. That's the end quote from Justice Jackson. So that implies not a choice but actually a requirement that the states give this kind of independence, free agent status, to electors."
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,1708.25499995,1715.135,"Your Honor, our text -- textual hook is the delegation of the authority to the states."
2019.19-518,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1749.745,1760.64,Why do you think the founders did not leave it up to the states to decide whether they wanted their members of Congress to be electors?
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,1760.64,1770.77,"Your Honor, the Constitution had a series of compromises between separating powers between the states and the federal government and between the states."
2019.19-518,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1776.775,1778.52999995,Thank you.
2019.19-518,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1778.52999995,1779.85,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.19-518,0,63244,philip_j_weiser,,1782.97999995,1789.235,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. As we've noted, this case is all about State authority."
2019.19-518,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1810.67,1814.77,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Harrow."
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,1814.77,1822.445,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about a tradeoff between flexibility and rigidity."
2019.19-518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1933.055,1935.02,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,1944.365,1952.555,"No, Your Honor, we filed an -- an opening brief, and I'll -- I'll sign on to exactly what he said in the first hour."
2019.19-518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1952.555,1967.535,Thank you. You gave a number of examples there of situations that have gone awry and there was no way to take account of them.
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,1974.42,1980.27,"The limits, Your Honor, are that electors must be permitted to vote with discretion."
2019.19-518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1996.01,1996.41,So I take --
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,1996.41,1996.87,-- the State.
2019.19-518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1996.87,2005.52499995,-- I take your -- I take your answer when I ask for limits to be that they must be allowed to vote in their discretion that you don't have any limits?
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2005.52499995,2012.275,"Your Honor, there are no limits in that voting by ballot so long as the ballot is for a person."
2019.19-518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2016.9,2017.75,"But, literally, as opposed to, say --"
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2017.75,2018.35,-- have to imagine --
2019.19-518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2018.35,2022.44,"-- not a giraffe? I mean, of course, they have to vote for a person."
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2022.44,2029.85,"Your Honor, Congress concluded in 1872 that the Greeley vote wasn't a vote for a person because it was a vote for a non-living person."
2019.19-518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2050.355,2057.305,"So the elector can decide, I am going to vote -- I'm going to flip a coin and however it comes out, that's how I'm going to vote?"
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2057.305,2063.705,"Yes, Your Honor, that's the same discretion that U.S. senators have, representatives have, congressional electors have."
2019.19-518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2067.835,2070.87,"Well, that sounds pretty limitless to me."
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2111.26,2113.825,"Not legally, no, Your Honor."
2019.19-518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2135.16,2138.615,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas?"
2019.19-518,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2138.615,2162.945,"Yes, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, you mentioned that senators are free to vote or members of the House of Representatives, but there's some degree of accountability for them when they vote a particular way. What's the accountability here for an elector who strays from what is expected?"
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2162.945,2166.585,"There are several forms of accountability, Justice Thomas."
2019.19-518,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2203.965,2223.54,"But there's also accountability in chambers -- within the Senate, there's accountability as far as removal from office. But you're saying that with an elector, that those other forms of accountability are not available?"
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2223.54,2247.79,"They are, Your Honor. There is absolutely party discretion, party meetings, just like any other representative body. And -- and just to -- to quibble slightly, Justice Thomas, with what you said in terms of removal of a U.S. Senator, there's no precedent that we have found of a U.S. Senator being removed, perhaps even by an appointing governor in the case of a vacancy, on the basis of a vote."
2019.19-518,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2255.89,2294.95,"But let's say the -- you know, you mentioned with respect to the State that the State could not -- that after someone dies, that their system is so rigid that you can't make changes because of the -- the death of the candidate. But I think that, on your side, you -- as the Chief Justice alluded to, you have a similar problem because the elector, who had promised to vote for the winning candidate, could suddenly say, you know, I'm going to vote for Frodo Baggins, and that's -- I really like Frodo Baggins."
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2302.07,2317.88,"Your Honor, I -- I think there is something to be done because that would be the vote for a non-person, you know, no -- no matter how big a fan many people are of Frodo Baggins. That -- that said, I do think the important point is that the framers hashed out these competing concerns."
2019.19-518,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2331.025,2331.995,Thank you.
2019.19-518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2331.995,2335.475,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Ginsburg?"
2019.19-518,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2335.475,2345.63,"I don't understand your point about rigidity, because, as I understand, the State's position is it's the states have a choice."
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2385.15,2399.895,"Justice Ginsburg, the states do have great flexibility, as you mentioned, in choosing the mode and method of appointment, but the laws that they've written here, the laws that were enforced against my client, Mike Baca, were -- are very rigid."
2019.19-518,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2438.85499995,2451.265,"And how do you answer the standing question, that you have no economic -- Baca has no economic injury, so he has no standing to complain?"
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2451.265,2454.195,"There is standing, Justice Ginsburg."
2019.19-518,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2484.485,2487.05,Thank you.
2019.19-518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2487.05,2489.535,Justice Breyer?
2019.19-518,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2489.535,2501.775,"Thank you. To go back to the technical point, you brought a suit under 1983 and -- against a state."
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2509.415,2523.71,"Your -- Your Honor, I'll echo what Attorney General Weiser said, which is that it's -- and, indeed, I'll cite to the Court's opinion just last week in the Sineneng-Smith case, when the Court said that the courts' job is to resolve disputes as framed by the parties."
2019.19-518,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2532.33,2545.955,"The problem that I view is that then any two people, a plaintiff and defendant, who would like an issue decided by us, simply have to waive enough matters so that it has to come before us because it's not jurisdictional."
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2552.23,2568.145,"Your Honor, I don't think this case implements something like that because this case is one that courts surely could hear. It was initially brought individually against the Secretary of State through a compromise that involved the plaintiffs giving up a right to attorneys' fees and other accommodations."
2019.19-518,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2577.82,2579.4,"Yeah, I'll look -- I'll look at that."
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2611.755,2613.705,Justice Breyer --
2019.19-518,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2613.705,2614.95,What's your view about that?
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2614.95,2615.345,Well --
2019.19-518,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2615.345,2619.705,"What's your actual view? You didn't mention it, so you don't think it is, probably."
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2619.705,2625.105,"No -- no, I think, Justice Breyer, to be clear, that the Greeley example supports our side."
2019.19-518,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2628.23,2629.12,I know it's your side.
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2633.88,2639.645,"Your Honor, just so I understand, the Greeley votes, the three that were rejected by Congress, were actually faithful."
2019.19-518,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2641.87,2642.19,All right.
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2654.32499995,2672.62,"It -- it can, Your Honor. The courts and Congress have never interpreted the Electoral Count Act and what it means for a vote to be regularly given. It -- Congress I do think possibly has the power to reject a faithless vote under certain circumstances, but we note it has never done so."
2019.19-518,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2684.25,2685.43,Thank you.
2019.19-518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2685.43,2688.175,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Alito?"
2019.19-518,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2688.175,2710.8,"We have to interpret the Constitution to mean what it means, regardless of the consequences, but I am interested in -- at least in understanding what the consequences of your position would be. And we are told by experts on elections that the consequences would be potentially chaotic."
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2767.21,2770.135,"We -- we do deny it, Justice Alito."
2019.19-518,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2805.285,2807.19,Do you deny that there's a greater --
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2807.19,2807.905,And the basis to conclude --
2019.19-518,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2807.905,2813.84,-- do you deny that there's a greater chance of this happening? And didn't Mr. Lessig support such an effort in 2016?
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2813.84,2822.61,"Your -- Your Honor, Mr. Lessig has been representing these electors from -- from the beginning in 2016."
2019.19-518,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2823.15,2824.44,That -- that wasn't my question.
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2833.475,2862.9,"Your Honor, I believe that he supported the legal discretion that electors have that we're here today arguing for. And -- and -- and the reason is, A, that that's in the Constitution, but, B, that if we're going back to the chaos point, the center has always held -- the center has always held -- we know that 18 states today, Justice Alito, have no such laws. And the -- the states are not about to say that there's some constitutional requirement that they implement them."
2019.19-518,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2866.15,2866.53,I'd like to ask --
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2866.53,2867.77,-- that there is federalism here.
2019.19-518,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2867.77,2870.92,-- one more question if I possibly can.
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2881.465,2890.175,"Your Honor, yes, they do have some power to remove elector, just not a removal power that interferes with the core function of voting by ballot."
2019.19-518,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2890.175,2893.69,What is the limit of their power to remove?
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2893.69,2899.96,"The -- the limit of the power to remove is, again, that -- that interference with the core function."
2019.19-518,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2917.35500005,2930.25,"Can an elector be removed for bribery, absent conviction by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, before the time when the electors meet to vote?"
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2930.25,2931.93,"No, we don't think so, Your Honor."
2019.19-518,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2943.805,2951.525,A member of Congress could not be removed from office by a two-thirds vote without a criminal conviction?
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2951.525,2958.67,"Oh, the -- the Congress certainly has power to remove, but it must go through a full process."
2019.19-518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2977.755,2980.245,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Kagan?"
2019.19-518,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2980.245,2998.94500005,"Mr. Harrow, suppose that I read the Constitution and I find that it just doesn't say anything about this subject, you know, that there are some hints here and there are some hints going the other way and mostly I just read it and I say the Constitution is silent. What should I then -- then do and why?"
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,2998.94500005,3005.615,"Justice Kagan, in that case, I think the original understanding would control."
2019.19-518,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3018.55,3018.81,Meaning the --
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,3018.81,3019.935,-- and the meaning of the word --
2019.19-518,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3019.935,3024.77,"Sorry, do -- do you mean the original understanding like prior to ratification?"
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,3024.77,3025.77,The -- the --
2019.19-518,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3025.77,3048.59,"Because I would think that pretty -- pretty quickly, it -- it -- it flipped even if you're right, pretty -- you know, so that from the first, there were these pledges and there has never been a substantial amount, a substantial number of faithless electors, so I would -- I would think that the -- the history both at the time and since would cut against you."
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,3049.645,3063.63,"No, Justice Kagan, because our quibble is not with the pledges and our invocation of history is not with the pledges or the idea of party control and of having two major parties in our system. The idea is with enforcement of the vote."
2019.19-518,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3082.31,3092.685,"What would you say if I said that if I think that there's silence, the best thing to do is leave it to the states, to not impose any constitutional requirement on them?"
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,3092.685,3098.75,"Your Honor, I -- I would push against because I don't think there's silence, especially here in this state --"
2019.19-518,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3098.75,3100.21,"I know, but that's the hypothetical."
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,3115.11500005,3125.24,"Because, Your Honor, when, Justice Kagan, when you said there are all these states doing what Colorado is doing, it has actually never been the case that a state has done what Colorado is doing."
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,3134.935,3137.69,And -- and -- and so --
2019.19-518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3137.69,3140.11,"Justice -- go ahead, please."
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,3140.11,3146.495,"No, no, Your Honor. If -- if -- if you're ready to move on, then, fine, I was going to continue making another point."
2019.19-518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3146.495,3148.77,"No, that -- that was directed to Justice Kagan."
2019.19-518,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3148.77,3150.435,"No, I'm done, thank you."
2019.19-518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3150.435,3152.83,Okay. Justice Gorsuch?
2019.19-518,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3152.83,3161.32499995,"Counsel, suppose Mr. Baca had asked Congress to count his vote and Congress decided to do so."
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,3163.66499995,3166.86,"I -- I -- yes, you would, Your Honor."
2019.19-518,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3178.24,3179.87,I believe you're fighting my hypothetical.
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,3189.555,3211.415,"If Congress had counted his vote instead of the vote of the replacement elector, Celeste Landry, then no, perhaps not because in that he wouldn't have lost the office. I will say he didn't get a chance to vote for vice president either, so assuming on Your Honor's hypothetical that he had his ballots fully cast, then no, we -- we probably wouldn't be here."
2019.19-518,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3211.415,3211.97,Okay.
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,3218.99,3220.86,"He -- he did not, Justice Gorsuch."
2019.19-518,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3223.925,3224.645,Okay.
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,3229.525,3233.52,"Justice Gorsuch, it's even less, it's one dollar in nominal damages."
2019.19-518,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3233.52,3269.84,"One -- one dollar. So it's a one dollar nominal damages. And why -- why should we exercise our discretion to hear this case when the nominal damages are one dollar, he didn't seek Congress to count his vote, though as you point out, it's unclear whether there's a mechanism to do so, and we have a cause of action that doesn't exist based -- that -- that -- that we are asked to overlook because of a stipulation by the parties? Why isn't that a sort of manufactured litigation that this Court should -- should decline its -- should -- should -- should bother with, with using its discretion whether to decide a case?"
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,3269.84,3278.12,"Justice Gorsuch, because once there is jurisdiction -- and, again, I'll just emphasize that the question of -- of whether --"
2019.19-518,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3278.12,3294.565,"I'm accepting there's jurisdiction, counsel, but this Court has discretion over what to entertain, and it also has some -- some authority to emphasize the importance of -- of the adversarial process and its proper uses."
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,3294.565,3296.7,"It -- it does, Justice Gorsuch."
2019.19-518,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3325.965,3327.87500005,Thank you.
2019.19-518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3327.87500005,3330.245,Justice Kavanaugh?
2019.19-518,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3330.245,3333.47,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And good afternoon, Mr. Harrow."
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,3345.045,3352.505,"Justice Kavanaugh, the political parties provide the context for nominating electors and the appointment of electors."
2019.19-518,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3372.77999995,3381.225,And Justice Kagan noted a question about what to do if the text is silent.
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,3411.38,3439.35,"Justice Kavanaugh, in addition to the historical practices that we've already discussed, including in the exchange with Justice Kagan, I'll also point the Court to the history of constitutional amendments that have been introduced to try and abolish the office of elector precisely to eliminate the elector discretion that everyone who -- that was introducing the amendment assumed exists. As we point out in our brief, this starts in 1801 with no less than Thomas Jefferson saying: Hey, maybe we should get rid of the office of elector."
2019.19-518,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3469.275,3472.36,Thank you very much.
2019.19-518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3472.36,3476.19,"Counsel, you have a few minutes for wrap-up if you'd like."
2019.19-518,1,63245,jason_harrow,,3476.19,3477.16,Sure.
2019.19-518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3551.465,3556.075,"Thank you, counsel. General Weiser, you have two minutes for rebuttal."
2019.19-518,2,63244,philip_j_weiser,,3556.075,3558.07,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
