1982.81-1314,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.652,We will now hear argument next in W. R. Grace Company against a Local of the International Union.
1982.81-1314,0,38195,peter_g_nash,,37.486,45.25,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, this case arises here on a petition for certiorari of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals."
1982.81-1314,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,92.467,94.856,"Mr. Nash, you said the union had notice."
1982.81-1314,0,38195,peter_g_nash,,101.088,113.035,"--Not necessarily so, Your Honor, but that becomes relevant later on when we get to the argument about the court order that enjoined the company and the union, and whether or not that's a valid defense to a breach of contract action."
1982.81-1314,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,184.678,188.317,Was the intimation of the company's position that both of them could not apply?
1982.81-1314,0,38195,peter_g_nash,,188.317,188.959,That is correct.
1982.81-1314,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,188.959,191.815,Why did the company take that position?
1982.81-1314,0,38195,peter_g_nash,,191.815,192.3,Because--
1982.81-1314,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,192.3,198.812,"The company can bind itself with the EEOC, and I should think still continue to be bound with the union."
1982.81-1314,0,38195,peter_g_nash,,198.812,208.262,"--Possibly, sir, but there was a tension, and I think an admitted tension between the conciliation agreement and the collective bargaining agreement."
1982.81-1314,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,208.262,210.184,I don't see where you get the concept of tension.
1982.81-1314,0,38195,peter_g_nash,,226.615,229.956,"That is correct, but I think we have different facts in this case, Your Honor."
1982.81-1314,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,247.997,252.932,Are you saying that the EEOC agreement under these circumstances binds the union?
1982.81-1314,0,38195,peter_g_nash,,252.932,259.898,"If the union had notice, as it did, of the EEOC conciliation process, and if the union--"
1982.81-1314,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,259.898,265.725,You said a moment ago in answer to my question that the mere fact that the union had notice didn't result in binding the union.
1982.81-1314,0,38195,peter_g_nash,,265.725,288.854,"--If the union had notice of the process, of the EEOC conciliation process, and was afforded an opportunity to participate in that process, then, yes, I am saying that the conciliation agreement between the company and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission may amend or change the collective bargaining agreement, but I am not saying that the union was without remedy in that case."
1982.81-1314,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,288.854,291.463,What is your authority for the position you have just stated?
1982.81-1314,0,38195,peter_g_nash,,291.463,301.429,"The authority for that position is, I think, multiple but primarily PEPSICO, Inc., versus FTC, 472 F2d--"
1982.81-1314,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,301.429,303.82,I mean a case from this Court.
1982.81-1314,0,38195,peter_g_nash,,303.82,303.929,--179.
1982.81-1314,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,303.929,305.882,Another case from this Court.
1982.81-1314,0,38195,peter_g_nash,,305.882,310.364,"Furthermore, I think that is consistent with what this Court held in Zipes versus TWA."
1982.81-1314,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,310.364,313.551,So Zipes is your authority from this Court?
1982.81-1314,0,38195,peter_g_nash,,313.551,314.441,Yes.
1982.81-1314,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,331.512,336.604,"If the employer conciliates with the EEOC, he can repudiate any inconsistent agreements he has made?"
1982.81-1314,0,38195,peter_g_nash,,336.604,341.54,"Not to the extent that it forecloses the union from having a remedy, Your Honor."
1982.81-1314,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,377.774,380.134,How would that cause of action be decided?
1982.81-1314,0,38195,peter_g_nash,,382.617,408.309,"It would be similar to a proceeding in a Title VII now where there is a consent decree, a reasonableness proceeding or a fairness proceeding in which it is determined whether or not the conciliation agreement entered into is in fact reasonable and fair, whether it meets the requirements of Title VII without unduly impinging upon the rights of the majority employees presently in the workforce."
1982.81-1314,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,447.998,448.981,Was that an injunction?
1982.81-1314,0,38195,peter_g_nash,,448.981,452.995,"--The court, I believe, interpreted it as an injunction, Your Honor."
1982.81-1314,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,542.587,546.131,Has any remedy been worked out for Mr. Jowers at all?
1982.81-1314,0,38195,peter_g_nash,,546.131,546.85,--No.
1982.81-1314,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,546.85,549.411,He is not working for Grace anymore?
1982.81-1314,0,38195,peter_g_nash,,549.411,551.239,I don't know whether he is or not.
1982.81-1314,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,699.881,702.224,"Can't you strip it down even further, Mr. Nash."
1982.81-1314,0,38195,peter_g_nash,,707.848,709.331,"No, I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1982.81-1314,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,724.918,729.166,"But that concession is really partly one of fact and partly one of law, isn't it?"
1982.81-1314,0,38195,peter_g_nash,,738.725,742.427,I would respectfully disagree to a certain extent.
1982.81-1314,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,842.433,864.595,"Mr. Nash, there does seem to be language in the brief that was filed by the union in the Court of Appeals that, although not crystal clear, would seem to be contrary to your position and would indicate there was not a waiver of the issue on the Barrett/Sabella award question."
1982.81-1314,0,38195,peter_g_nash,,870.765,877.451,--I think an examination of that language will not indicate that the union at any time argued that any deference was due to Mr. Barrett's award.
1982.81-1314,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,964.806,965.743,Very well.
1982.81-1314,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,972.288,974.818,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.81-1314,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1196.089,1197.822,"Mr. Phillips, may I interrupt you right there."
1982.81-1314,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1226.013,1236.774,"--Maybe not as strong a case, although I don't think those facts differ... I mean, I don't think that we would set aside the conciliation agreement simply because the union declines to participate in the process."
1982.81-1314,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1236.774,1240.883,"Even though, as I understand it, the conciliation agreement is founded on a mistake of law."
1982.81-1314,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1240.883,1241.695,Yes.
1982.81-1314,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1241.695,1246.256,"It is founded on the assumption that the seniority provisions were unlawful, which of course turned out to be incorrect."
1982.81-1314,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1246.256,1260.078,"It is true that this Court's decision in Teamsters cast some doubt on the conciliation agreement, although it is still an open question whether the kind of relief granted in the conciliation agreement might otherwise have been permissible as a remedy for any kind of hiring discrimination."
1982.81-1314,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1260.078,1269.324,"But the violation, as I understand it, insofar as the sex discrimination charge is concerned, strictly was on the basis that the seniority provisions were unlawful, isn't that right?"
1982.81-1314,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1269.324,1285.646,"Yes, that is true, that is true, although again there was a finding of reasonable cause to believe there had been hiring discrimination, and then whether or not in the circumstances of this particular case, where you have immediate layoffs, it might well have been regarded at that time as a basis for modifying the layoff procedures, that is all."
1982.81-1314,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1285.646,1293.455,"Is it the EEOC policy in a three-cornered situation like this just to ignore the third party, the union, or to get them involved in the situation?"
1982.81-1314,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1293.455,1304.043,"No, Your Honor, the EEOC's compliance manual expressly provides that notice should be given to the union at any time it appears that provisions in the collective bargaining agreement may conflict with proposed conciliation efforts."
1982.81-1314,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1307.496,1312.12,"But if there was a violation here, the union would have been guilty of a violation as well as the employer?"
1982.81-1314,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1312.12,1313.197,I am sorry.
1982.81-1314,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1313.197,1321.053,"If the premise for the agreement, namely, illegality, if that was correct, the union would also have been guilty of a violation, would it not?"
1982.81-1314,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1321.053,1322.537,Of Title VII?
1982.81-1314,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1322.537,1322.991,Yes.
1982.81-1314,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1322.991,1341.202,"Presumably, although there was no charge against the union, so it would have been difficult... They would not have been within the proceeding itself since they had not been charged with violating Title VII, although it does seem that there is a concert of action of sorts that leads to the result that there are no women in the production units at the Southbridge plant."
1982.81-1314,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1449.204,1456.608,Mr. Gold.
1982.81-1314,2,34498,laurence_gold,,1456.608,1460.825,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.81-1314,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1717.284,1721.251,"Mr. Gold, you say that it is understood, but I don't know how."
1982.81-1314,2,34498,laurence_gold,,1731.262,1751.332,"What arbitrator Barrett did here, and what most arbitrators do, is to say that presumptively the prior arbitration award is to be followed, but there is a certain threshold past which an arbitrator is not required to go."
1982.81-1314,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1794.018,1794.768,He did not ignore it.
1982.81-1314,2,34498,laurence_gold,,1794.768,1796.407,"--He said,"
1982.81-1314,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1830.519,1843.717,"Mr. Gold, before you get to the court stage, is there any established doctrine under 301 and arbitrations as to what public law limitations there may be on an arbitrator's award?"
1982.81-1314,2,34498,laurence_gold,,1862.132,1870.252,The answer to that varies at different stages of the proceeding.
1982.81-1314,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1885.481,1887.698,Never the twain shall meet?
1982.81-1314,2,34498,laurence_gold,,1887.698,1888.479,--Right.
1982.81-1314,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2265.406,2275.932,Does footnote 21 at the bottom of page 15 in your brief indicate counsel has been penalized for his failings in that regard?
1982.81-1314,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2275.932,2283.352,"Counsel, to my understanding, has gone on to greater and better things."
1982.81-1314,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2506.606,2514.197,The parties have changed position as nimbly as if they were dancing a quadrille.
1982.81-1314,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2514.197,2516.055,"--Thank you, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-1314,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2539.498,2542.606,The Teamsters are relying on the right to dance a quadrille?
1982.81-1314,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2542.606,2545.418,"I apologize, sir."
1982.81-1314,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2545.418,2548.76,"I say, the Teamsters Union... Is this the Teamsters case?"
1982.81-1314,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2551.978,2554.009,It would be an interesting sight.
1982.81-1314,3,38195,peter_g_nash,,3283.034,3288.172,"--Yes, I do, Your Honor, just a couple of things."
1982.81-1314,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3321.33,3325.36,I thought I had made my hypothetical slightly different from what occurred here.
1982.81-1314,3,38195,peter_g_nash,,3326.625,3328.921,"I misunderstood, then, too."
1982.81-1314,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3328.921,3333.419,Is my hypothetical precisely what was done here?
1982.81-1314,3,38195,peter_g_nash,,3333.419,3335.544,I guess I am saying that it is analogous.
1982.81-1314,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3335.544,3339.604,"In its effect, it is the same, is that what you are saying?"
1982.81-1314,3,38195,peter_g_nash,,3339.604,3340.135,Correct.
1982.81-1314,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3376.449,3383.477,"Wasn't the injunction simply an injunction against arbitration, and wasn't that injunction obeyed by the parties?"
1982.81-1314,3,38195,peter_g_nash,,3383.477,3387.054,"It was an injunction against that, but, no, it went further, Your Honor."
1982.81-1314,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3387.554,3389.038,What more did the injunction say?
1982.81-1314,3,38195,peter_g_nash,,3389.038,3394.349,"--It said that the parties are to abide by the conciliation agreement, not by the collective bargaining agreement."
1982.81-1314,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3394.349,3395.737,That was part of the injunction?
1982.81-1314,3,38195,peter_g_nash,,3395.737,3396.737,"That is my understanding, yes."
1982.81-1314,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3448.309,3450.231,Let me ask you a question about your court order argument.
1982.81-1314,3,38195,peter_g_nash,,3465.288,3474.988,"I don't think so, but I don't see the relationship."
1982.81-1314,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3474.988,3476.097,I don't see how that case is different from yours.
1982.81-1314,3,38195,peter_g_nash,,3476.097,3479.423,"Because in this case what the court said was,"
1982.81-1314,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3483.265,3486.373,"In my case, it's based on a contract, an argument about what a contract means."
1982.81-1314,3,38195,peter_g_nash,,3486.373,3487.637,"In this, the court said:"
1982.81-1314,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3493.136,3493.823,Right.
1982.81-1314,3,38195,peter_g_nash,,3493.823,3496.509,I think that that is the distinction between our cases.
1982.81-1314,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3496.509,3502.319,"Those are the arguments that were made in my hypothetical, and as a result the judge said, B.> [""] Then C says,"
1982.81-1314,3,38195,peter_g_nash,,3511.566,3529.512,"Let me go one step further on the fault argument and that is that in this case the union further argues that the fault is that the employer indeed discriminated against the females, and accordingly the employer cannot get out from under its collective bargaining agreement."
1982.81-1314,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3561.17,3564.029,"Okay, gentlemen, the case submitted."
