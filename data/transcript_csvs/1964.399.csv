1964.399,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,42.754,"399, United States, Petitioner, versus Archie Brown."
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,44.12,47.169,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.399,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,203.49,209.781,"Mr. Solicitor General, in this respect the statute as you have now described it is different."
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,218.947,219.28,No.
1964.399,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,401.078,407.667,"Mr. Solicitor General, can we just pause for a moment on that and see if I read the record correctly."
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,423.912,424.477,"Oh yes, yes."
1964.399,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,424.477,427.168,-- and he was not a functionary in the sense that --
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,427.168,427.361,No.
1964.399,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,429.895,430.243,Yes.
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,430.243,434.045,Indeed the fact that he was a member is to be taken into account.
1964.399,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,442.556,444.072,"Well, he was -- he was a functionary."
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,444.072,444.716,Yes.
1964.399,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,482.019,483.359,Although the statute â€“
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,483.359,489.691,The statute -- the statute is broader but I submit that the two questions are clearly separable.
1964.399,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,820.694,843.452,"(Inaudible) suppose the Communists held hearings and made a finding that the activities of the Ku Klux Klan against the Negroes were a burden on commerce and were interfering with rights of Negroes to work, opportunities for Negroes to work."
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,855.078,890.344,"If there were a parallel in the history of our industrial relations, they parallel in the evidence that was available, then I would think that there would be one and only one important difference and that is that this Court has repeatedly recognized that the Communist Party is different from most other organization that it is subject to domination by a power and that this greatly increases many of the threats that it presents."
1964.399,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,942.686,950.062,Suppose the state would define as members of the NAACP could not be members of the -- of a labor union.
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,951.528,951.57,Well --
1964.399,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,951.57,955.625,"And they made -- and they made findings, broad findings."
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,955.625,967.618,"Well, I think this Court is entitled especially in a case involving freedom of association to scrutinize the findings and determine whether they have some rational basis."
1964.399,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1020.507,1023.779,Do you think that would make the Constitution different?
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1023.779,1027.863,"I would think that each -- I would think, yes."
1964.399,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1149.68,1158.913,"Although not all the cost, it goes much farther than that you might apply your argument only to the facts of this case but the statute does go much farther than that."
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1167.955,1168.459,For five years --
1964.399,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1168.459,1170.567,After -- after he withdrew the exit.
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1170.567,1172.01,"Well, I think if we have that --"
1964.399,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1172.01,1180.85,"If you put it on the basis in what he's -- what he's doing, it seems to me that your statute is -- is far too broad for that."
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1180.85,1192.082,"Well, I would submit, Your Honor, that this is a statute where the -- its validity must be judged as applied in this case."
1964.399,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1294.111,1298.617,"Well, is there in your opinion a constitutional difference between those two?"
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1298.617,1311.502,"Yes sir, because I think that the constitutional issue turns here on the degree of the risk created by the man's being an officer of a labor union."
1964.399,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1338.133,1356.665,"Then believing -- then believing as you do that there is a constitutional difference, now do you believe that if we held with you in this particular case that there would be an implication that the other portion of it was also in accordance with the --"
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1356.665,1362.646,"Well, I wound think that would depend on how the opinion was written."
1964.399,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1380.679,1384.754,But that's what you neither nor do you wish to express the opinion on the other?
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1384.754,1389.585,"Well, Your Honor my -- my duty of course in all of these cases of acts of Congress is to defend them."
1964.399,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1392.119,1408.724,"We -- we go rather -- we go rather far, don't we in hypotheticals, in -- in arguments here before the Court both counsel and ourselves do that and isn't it reasonable for the Court to ask how far this would carry us, if we did --"
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1408.724,1413.55,"Well, I'm quite and -- and I'm sorry I thought I had been responsive."
1964.399,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1438.421,1440.454,That's what I want to know.
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1440.454,1443.88,And the case it isn't here because of my position.
1964.399,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1452.467,1458.357,"You just mentioned the Douds case, unless I misread that too."
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1473.887,1477.465,"Provides for imprisonment of a man who violates the statute, yes."
1964.399,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1477.5,1485.65,And that's -- that's because he has been a member of the Communist Party and was also an officer in the union.
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1485.65,1494.944,If that's because he is a member of the Communist Party and an officer of the union in this case at one and the same time (Voice Overlap) and that's the prohibited act.
1964.399,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1494.944,1495.61,Am I wrong?
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1509.849,1509.979,Oh!
1964.399,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1512.337,1515.676,Did they -- did they not point that out?
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1515.676,1517.173,It was pointed out in Douds.
1964.399,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1723.405,1748.32,"(Inaudible) assuming then that Congress have enacted statute of this kind where Congress hear cases (Inaudible) and although here as I recall it that they have the North America strike and I don't know what -- what else, some testimony about Korea and the (Inaudible)."
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1842.168,1847.656,"Well, first Your Honor's abstract the question come to this case in a moment."
1964.399,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1862.716,1863.622,(Voice Overlap)
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1863.622,1865.778,Yes.
1964.399,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2020.798,2026.088,(Inaudible) with the statute.
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2026.088,2027.202,There was no -- no finding.
1964.399,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2027.944,2030.779,Any -- any cons -- any evidence in this to go?
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2030.779,2038.136,"They -- in our brief, we've related to evidence before other congressional committees."
1964.399,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2038.136,2050.713,"Well, do you think for -- for the purposes of question Mr. Justice Goldberg has put to you that that we're -- if it's before us at all, we decide this in the context with the 1950 findings."
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2050.713,2051.967,"Well, I don't think that -- no."
1964.399,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2086.507,2089.05,So they had the same purpose.
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2091.81,2094.967,"Oh yes, it had the same aim (Voice Overlap)."
1964.399,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2158.755,2160.955,(Inaudible)
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2160.955,2162.386,"Clearly, we're not."
1964.399,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2222.431,2224.068,Do they belong to the union?
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2224.068,2224.685,Oh yes.
1964.399,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2227.102,2230.832,The only associations that would have range to be the right to be (Voice Overlap)
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2230.832,2233.766,"These two, like in a conflict of interest law."
1964.399,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2233.766,2239.495,You're suggesting that the (Inaudible) to send them to jail for year if they do belong to the Communist Party.
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2246.223,2247.111,If it --
1964.399,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2247.111,2249.665,Put him to jail for a year.
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2249.665,2264.358,"It may if they violate the statute just as if I upon leaving the government should engage in practice against the government in the matter that came before the Office of the Solicitor General, I would certainly be subject to fines and I think to imprisonment."
1964.399,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2264.358,2266.106,"Well, that's not if they have minor thing, is it?"
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2274.965,2281.572,"No, Your Honor, my -- what I sought to say was not their going to jail for a year was a minor thing."
1964.399,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2314.313,2314.533,But that --
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2314.533,2315.377,-- of one --
1964.399,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2315.377,2318.918,"But Douds -- but Douds certainly pointed out to this, didn't it?"
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2318.918,2319.114,Yes --
1964.399,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2319.114,2320.7,Did Douds point out the difference?
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2320.7,2323.25,But it -- Douds point out the difference.
1964.399,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2358.511,2358.862,First of all --
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2358.862,2359.945,But now the differ --
1964.399,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2359.945,2363.103,-- the Court filed as to the record here that we have.
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2363.103,2366.015,For -- for making false affidavits.
1964.399,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2366.015,2366.569,Well --
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2366.569,2367.678,"Now, let me come --"
1964.399,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2367.678,2371.393,"-- for practical standpoint, we submit the statute."
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2371.393,2371.746,Let me --
1964.399,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2371.746,2389.83,(Inaudible)
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2389.83,2391.269,There's no doubt about that.
1964.399,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2402.159,2407.804,"But General, the government in the Douds brief as I remember that I was in the Douds cases as I recall."
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2413.204,2413.535,Yes.
1964.399,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2413.535,2424.314,--that another alternative would be flatly to forbid Communists and persons believing in the overthrow of the government to be officers I believe in organizations.
1964.399,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2433.207,2434.031,Quite true.
1964.399,1,39319,richard_gladstein,,3358.293,3364.729,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.399,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3622.822,3624.809,That you haven't considered --
1964.399,1,39319,richard_gladstein,,3624.809,3625.727,Since what Your Honor?
1964.399,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3625.727,3626.86,(Inaudible)
1964.399,1,39319,richard_gladstein,,3626.86,3629.461,"Well, it happens he is not a member of the executive board now."
1964.399,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3631.518,3634.55,That (Voice Overlap).
1964.399,1,39319,richard_gladstein,,3634.55,3636.549,I think he ran but was defeated (Voice Overlap).
1964.399,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3638.084,3641.811,(Inaudible)
1964.399,1,39319,richard_gladstein,,3641.811,3649.079,"Now, it is interesting -- I'll have more to say about this later."
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,6958.764,6962.042,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1964.399,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7252.96,7256.534,Mr. Solicitor General what is that the risk of --
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7256.534,7282.733,"The risk that a man who is subject to -- who has loyalties to the Communist Party and subject to a degree to its discipline will use his position in the union to subvert the union from -- through trade union purposes, to the goals of the Communist Party as it has been found that this union has done for example."
1964.399,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7282.733,7284.946,"Like -- like what -- like, was it called that the Congress might --"
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7284.946,7287.158,Political strike is a prime illustration.
1964.399,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7287.158,7290.232,Is that what (Voice Overlap) the likelihood of political strike?
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7290.232,7294.283,"I think -- I think sir, I think that is the major, when I think there are other instances where the union --"
1964.399,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7294.283,7296.692,What is -- what is a political strike?
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7296.692,7309.38,"Well, I have in mind a strike like the North American strike that called as the response to the dictates of the Communist Party rather than because they believe it will be in the interest of the members of the Union."
1964.399,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7326.252,7328.463,Which over it's really the political strike we've got to --
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7328.463,7331.413,Well I -- I think that's the major thing.
1964.399,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7333.217,7338.372,Well are there -- are there some lawful end to the Communist Party that the -- that this --
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7338.372,7339.224,"Well, I think there are many --"
1964.399,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7339.224,7340.268,Without preserving --
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7340.268,7354.954,I think there are many times where the desire of the Comm -- the aims of the Communist Party may coincide with the goals that the employees would have even if there were no Communist.
1964.399,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7354.954,7359.686,Well what if that -- what if that's why is the Communist?
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7359.686,7386.262,"Well, I think that they're -- I acknowledged that it is possible that Brown or any other person may not himself in any instance attempt to misuse his union position just as a particular man may own stock in the Civil Aeronautics Enterprise and be a member of the CAB and never misuse his position as a member of the CAB."
1964.399,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7390.652,7403.58,"And so it's the -- so it's the strength of the inference between being a member of the Communist Party and the inference of these -- that these untoward circumstances will occur, events will occur that --"
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7403.58,7419.286,"Judged -- judged in the light of history -- industrial history or including the things that were available to Congress as a result of the CIO investigation of the Communist Unions in 1950, yes."
1964.399,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7419.286,7421.621,It was just a circumstantial evidence question.
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7422.722,7432.772,"It's a matter where the Congress could draw -- it's a matter where the Congress could draw this conclusion from the materials available to it, yes."
1964.399,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7432.772,7439.51,Or you mean the Congress can -- can base the -- the claming of the crime on that inference.
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7439.51,7441.402,I don't think the Congress bases the finding of crime --
1964.399,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7441.402,7448.421,"Well, can be allow the court -- well he can allow the Court or order of the Court to base it's -- or the Court has --"
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7448.421,7449.161,"No, it's whether --"
1964.399,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7449.161,7454.761,-- find its membership -- or the Court has to find his membership in the two organizations at the same time.
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7454.761,7455.99,"Yes, just like the --"
1964.399,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7455.99,7456.287,And Congress then --
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7456.287,7457.555,Just as --
1964.399,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7457.555,7461.226,"And Congress then - and Congress then say to the Court, you must therefore conclude why."
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7461.226,7461.441,Yes.
1964.399,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7507.596,7525.55,"Now suppose, as I understand that you're arguing that the interest in preventing political strikes is sufficient to outweigh the right of the public and freedom of association and the right of the individual's freedom of association."
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7543.296,7549.914,"Well, it seems to me that this Court in the -- in the Maryland case and in effect held that that could be done, didn't it?"
1964.399,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7549.914,7550.869,Not that I know of.
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7550.869,7552.596,Wasn't that Gerende?
1964.399,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7552.596,7554.548,If -- if the Court held that I didn't know it.
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7554.548,7556.381,It was one that -- well --
1964.399,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7556.381,7561.406,"I know the case very well, G-E-R-E-N-D-E."
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7562.123,7563.951,Yes.
1964.399,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7563.951,7566.502,Then it does follow and I will suppose it would --
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7566.502,7567.804,"Well, I did not --"
1964.399,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7567.804,7580.225,"I think it's necessarily follows that if being a member of the Communist Party, they should keep labor union from elected as an officer."
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7600.478,7600.531,Well --
1964.399,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7600.531,7606.063,I think -- I think that people would take care of it and that's what I thought the Constitution provide it.
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7607.771,7615.276,I think the character of the question of the balance and the issue I was trying to focus attention on is the same.
1964.399,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7623.936,7624.87,Not exactly the same.
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7627.872,7629.322,"Well I'm not sure, Your Honor."
1964.399,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7631.341,7632.16,That's right.
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7634.747,7637.362,At least I wouldn't say that it was frivolous.
1964.399,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7637.362,7643.034,But generally if we conceive that power to -- to Congress.
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7654.552,7654.989,Well you can --
1964.399,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7654.989,7657.814,"Mostly, we would not say that the government always wins and the Congress wins."
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7657.814,7658.497,No.
1964.399,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7716.175,7729.76,"Well, how could we draw the constitutional line between the right to hold this position in the union and the right just to be a member and exercise a -- the other rights of the membership in the union."
1964.399,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7734.367,7765.186,"Because you would prior -- I mean do it in your decisions and you would do it I would urge if it were to be such a line because you found that the Congress could not reasonably believe that the danger -- that the harm a man could do as a result of divided loyalties, would be sufficiently great as a member of a union to justify what it would be for a far greater restriction on his freedom to association."
1964.399,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7774.32,7775.801,Very well.
