2010.10-238,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.606,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 10-238, Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett and the consolidated case."
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,12.891,15.51,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,55.301,67.708,"Mr. Maurer, you -- you don't have any objection, you wouldn't have any objection, if Arizona trebled the amount at the outset?"
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,85.504,88.356,"That would be constitutional under Davis, Your Honor."
2010.10-238,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,113.089,117.391,"Could I try to understand that argument a little bit better, Mr. Maurer?"
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,147.194,163.689,"Your Honor, in Davis this Court recognized that a trigger like this, a -- the law that turns the choice of -- my choice to speak effectively into fundraising advantages for my opponents constitutes a substantial burden."
2010.10-238,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,170.593,181.151,"Well, it constitutes a substantial burden, so even if every single person makes a choice, yes, I want to continue to speak, it does not chill any speak -- any speech."
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,187.47,207.449,"Well, Your -- Your Honor, this Court in Davis recognized that when the government reaches into a campaign and attempts to manipulate campaign financing in order to -- in order to basically effectuate the outcome, that constitutes a -- an illegitimate governmental purpose."
2010.10-238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,207.449,227.512,"Mr. Maurer, suppose -- suppose the government imposes a fine of $500 for all political speech, and people nonetheless continue to engage in political speech and pay the $500."
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,232.749,234.285,"No, it would not, Your Honor."
2010.10-238,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,234.285,237.737,"But, in fact, there's no such restriction here, is there, Mr. Maurer?"
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,241.022,244.057,"I would disagree with that, respectfully, Your Honor."
2010.10-238,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,256.782,260.567,"Well, doesn't the government actually just give a selective subsidy?"
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,275.612,289.353,"Your Honor, in Davis, this Court recognized that in the context of competitive elections, which are a zero-sum game, what benefits one candidate will burden, necessarily, or harm the other candidate."
2010.10-238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,289.353,291.305,Didn't they call it a subsidy in Davis?
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,299.626,302.911,"In fact, it was not a subsidy in Davis, Your Honor."
2010.10-238,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,326.109,329.978,"There is, though, a significant difference between Davis and this case."
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,351.575,359.497,"Well, Your Honor, the -- I would point out that independent expenditure groups do not have that choice of participating in the subsidy or not."
2010.10-238,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,373.857,382.28,"But there's no particular as-applied challenge from independent speakers in this lawsuit, is there?"
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,382.28,383.23,"Yes, there is, Your Honor."
2010.10-238,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,385.498,391.469,My -- my understanding was that the suit was brought as a facial challenge to the entire law.
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,391.469,394.521,"This is a facial and as-applied challenge, Your Honor."
2010.10-238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,394.521,407.828,"In -- in this case, do you think the law is content-neutral within its own universe, which applies just to political speech, so it's not content-neutral in that sense?"
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,410.963,412.032,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
2010.10-238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,412.032,412.632,Why?
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,412.632,421.238,"Because the only thing that will trigger matching funds, particularly for independent expenditure groups, is the content of the message."
2010.10-238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,448.805,473.29,"In Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical -- I'm still trying to think about -- suppose there is one candidate for the -- for the pink party, and then three candidates for the orange party, and all three candidates for the orange party received the lump sum Justice Ginsburg was talking about."
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,481.193,484.126,It would not be -- I'm sorry.
2010.10-238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,489.78,491.382,I didn't understand the hypothetical.
2010.10-238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,493.898,497.369,One person is on one side; three people are on the other side.
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,511.61,513.545,"--Yes, that's absolutely true."
2010.10-238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,513.545,514.095,All right.
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,519.532,520.765,That's exactly right.
2010.10-238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,520.765,521.351,All right.
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,532.792,536.661,"Well, this case is not challenging a public financing system, and--"
2010.10-238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,536.661,545.117,I'm just asking as a theoretical matter whether there would be a constitutional problem in the case that I put under Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical.
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,545.117,546.467,"--Not under Davis, Your Honor."
2010.10-238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,546.467,548.385,How about not under Buckley?
2010.10-238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,548.385,549.302,How about under the First Amendment?
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,549.302,569.882,"There may be -- there may be instances where a public financing law is so lopsided that it creates a coercive effect, and Buckley was quite clear that one of the things that was acceptable about the public financing system at issue in that case was that it was voluntary."
2010.10-238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,583.142,598.567,"I thought that the point of Buckley was that the public funding, which you can accept or reject, the justification for it was that it increased rather than decreased speech."
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,611.642,615.077,"--Your Honor, if I -- if I had said that, I was mistaken."
2010.10-238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,615.077,615.946,Not matching funds.
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,616.913,617.546,"Oh, okay."
2010.10-238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,617.546,619.212,Public funding.
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,654.885,683.654,"Your Honor, in Riley v. National Federation of the Blind, this Court recognized that -- that the government cannot sacrifice speech for efficiency, and what -- if -- if we accept the holding of Davis v. FEC and accept that that is still a holding that is viable under the First Amendment, then what the -- the position of the Respondents is, is that they, in fact, can sacrifice free speech in order to be more efficient, but--"
2010.10-238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,683.654,689.642,"Can you -- can you tell me on that, because I take it you agree with Justice Ginsburg about Buckley."
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,703.399,705.501,"--Yes, that's what Buckley says, Your Honor."
2010.10-238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,705.501,706.151,I take it that's what it means.
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,709.619,710.638,No.
2010.10-238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,710.638,713.34,"Here they have a trigger, not -- not quantitatively."
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,738.539,739.189,Your Honor--
2010.10-238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,739.189,740.075,That would be helpful.
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,740.075,742.942,"--Your Honor, in Buckley this Court recognized--"
2010.10-238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,742.942,744.309,I'm not interested in Buckley.
2010.10-238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,759.286,762.321,"I assume your opinion can be based upon Buckley, however."
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,764.54,770.844,"--Yes, the presidential financing system is constitutional, Your Honor."
2010.10-238,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,796.891,802.729,Would there be anything unconstitutional about a system that worked roughly like this?
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,829.696,832.933,"That would be a constitutional system, Your Honor."
2010.10-238,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,859.501,867.004,"But that's interesting, Mr. Maurer, because I don't see all that much of a difference between Justice Alito's hypothetical and the facts here."
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,902.245,918.337,"Your Honor, one of the things that would distinguish that is that it -- Justice Alito's hypothetical completely divorces the amount of the grant from my political activity or the political activity of people who don't want to or cannot take public funds in Arizona."
2010.10-238,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,918.337,925.36,"Well, I think, to the contrary, in Justice Alito's hypothetical, just the State is estimating how much a person will spend."
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,931.514,947.024,"Your Honor, I believe the distinction would lie in the fact that the purpose of this law is not to provide necessarily the ability of candidates to run effective publicly financed campaigns."
2010.10-238,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,953.943,956.379,I think the purpose of this law is to prevent corruption.
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,959.497,970.305,"--Your Honor, I would respectfully disagree that the purpose of this law is to prevent corruption, and I would like to read from the executive director of the Clean Elections Commission who said that:"
2010.10-238,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,982.53,1011.882,"Well, Mr. Maurer, some people may use certain buzz words and other people don't use those buzz words, but isn't it true that for 40 years what public financing systems have been based upon is the idea that when there is a lot of private money floating around the political system, that candidates and then public office holders get beholden to various people who are giving that money and make actions based on how much they receive from those people, and that's the idea of a public financing system is to try to prevent that?"
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,1011.882,1021.005,"Well, that is the basis of public financing systems in general, but this system does not actually address that because this Court--"
2010.10-238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1021.005,1022.938,We have the contrary argue here.
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,1046.805,1066.784,"--Your Honor, it -- when this law was promoted, when it was drafted, when it was propagated and -- and -- and campaigned about to the people of the State of Arizona, it was presented as doing two things: Leveling the playing field and limiting spending in campaigns."
2010.10-238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1080.442,1089.213,"What about all the background, there had been a number of scandals in Arizona, there had been vote buying?"
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,1108.777,1113.479,"Well, they were selling their votes for outright bribes, Your Honor."
2010.10-238,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1140.748,1162.329,"Counsel, you keep -- I -- I just want to understand exactly what you claim the burden is, because I thought that what the circuit and the courts below said was that there was no evidence that any candidate actually didn't speak or didn't fund raise because of this law."
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,1195.483,1197.585,"--No, Your Honor."
2010.10-238,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1240.846,1256.223,"I -- I want to go, not rely on Davis, but just articulate for me, assuming my hypothetical, the burden is that you have to delay fund-raising or delay expenditures because you're choosing to do so."
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,1256.223,1259.425,--We are not choosing to do so.
2010.10-238,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1262.877,1269.865,"No, if you spend it -- if you spend it at the time you want to, you collect it at the time you want, no one's -- the law's not telling you not to do it."
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,1273.502,1274.202,No.
2010.10-238,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1274.202,1278.454,"Because your opponent won't speak as loud and won't respond, correct?"
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,1278.454,1281.256,"I -- I would respectfully disagree, Your Honor."
2010.10-238,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1310.675,1323.233,"Suppose the -- suppose the Court after this argument sent you a letter saying if you would like to file an additional brief, you have the opportunity to do so, and we're not going to allow your opponent to file a brief."
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,1325.852,1330.422,"--All thing -- all else things being equal, yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-238,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1330.422,1337.159,"Now, if we said you can file an extra brief, but if you do that your opponent will also be able to file an extra brief."
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,1338.944,1362.643,"It certainly would, Your Honor; and under Arizona's system, if you applied Arizona's system to this hypothetical, not only would Mr. Phillips be able to file an additional brief, but the State of Arizona would be able to file an additional brief, and the Solicitor General's office would be able to file an additional brief, and anyone who weighed in on the other side would be able to file an additional brief."
2010.10-238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1379.085,1392.143,Do you think it would be a fair characterization of this law to say that its purpose and its effect are to produce less speech in political campaigns?
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,1392.143,1397.38,"I believe that that is a -- a goal, and I believe that's the effect."
2010.10-238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1413.489,1424.614,"Do you think that if Joe Smith doesn't have much money, takes public finance at all, that that could discourage some other people, Brown and Johnson, from running?"
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,1424.614,1428.566,"No, I don't believe so."
2010.10-238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1428.566,1437.588,"No, there's not -- it's not going to -- it's not going to be a situation where government paying a million dollars to Smith to help him in the campaign would discourage some other person from running?"
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,1437.588,1439.707,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2010.10-238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1441.075,1452.883,"If we -- if we say, you can file a brief and if you do, other people can file, is that my -- forget the briefs."
2010.10-238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1457.251,1459.718,"It's very clear, however."
2010.10-238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1460.353,1469.709,"I did -- I did think you would give the other answer, to tell you the truth, because I just don't see why giving somebody a million dollars might not discourage a -- a poorer candidate from running."
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,1469.709,1485.401,"--Well, Your Honor, the courts that have looked at public financing systems, including the Buckley court, noticed or were made clear that one of the things that constitutes a constitutional public financing system is its voluntariness."
2010.10-238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1486.753,1487.137,"No, no."
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,1501.263,1502.03,--Well--
2010.10-238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1502.03,1502.93,And you say that just doesn't happen?
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,1502.93,1503.913,--I--
2010.10-238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1503.913,1504.482,Never happens?
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,1505.132,1505.632,--I--
2010.10-238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1505.632,1511.119,"And I gather that people who have looked into the Arizona scheme also say what you think will happen never happens, either."
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,1511.119,1512.203,--Your -- Your Honor--
2010.10-238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1512.203,1513.988,So should we look at both instances?
2010.10-238,0,45529,william_r_maurer,,1513.988,1521.76,"--Your Honor, it's not the question of people being dissuaded from running because their opponent may be able to mount an effective campaign."
2010.10-238,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1533.116,1534.234,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,1542.322,1544.322,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1563.401,1569.222,"But counsel, how -- the supposition that it results in more speech, let's take the independent expenditure example."
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,1593.503,1599.407,"--Well, Your Honor, it would result in more speech certainly if all the candidates got the $10,000."
2010.10-238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1607.228,1608.597,How would you -- what would that evidence look like?
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,1608.597,1617.453,"The evidence would -- would simply look -- plausibly, even just someone saying that they didn't spend money because of that, although that would be not very hard evidence."
2010.10-238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1624.407,1627.09,"Well, other than somebody saying it, I'm just curious what the evidence would look like."
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,1633.595,1635.762,"--I -- that's possibly true, Your Honor."
2010.10-238,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1655.759,1664.115,May I ask how it -- how it combats corruption unless it suppresses large contributions--
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,1664.115,1665.015,--It combats--
2010.10-238,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1665.015,1666.067,--by certain entities?
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,1703.454,1720.682,"--Your Honor, Arizona's triggered matching funds provision combats corruption in the same manner that public funding combats corruption, because that -- the law is designed to encourage candidates to accept public funding because it offers a viable public funding option to them while conserving the State's resources."
2010.10-238,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1733.573,1737.025,"Well, there are States that have public funding without having a matching fund provision."
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,1763.759,1778.269,"Well, Your Honor, I think for the same reasons I think that are implicit in the Buckley Court's upholding of public funding at the same time that the Court upheld contribution limits and disclosure requirements, I think implicitly therefore holding that the three could go together, serving the anticorruption interests."
2010.10-238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1815.144,1820.362,"So -- so the idea is this is a way of encouraging candidates to take the public financing, right?"
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,1820.362,1820.896,--Yes.
2010.10-238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1820.896,1829.701,Would it encourage more candidates to do that if you doubled the amount that was available for every additional amount that the privately financed candidate spends?
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,1839.259,1841.559,"It would encourage them more, Your Honor."
2010.10-238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1872.211,1875.096,"But that's kind of an odd line to find in the First Amendment, isn't it?"
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,1885.369,1907.218,"--I think somewhere in the First Amendment there is a line, Your Honor, implicit in Buckley, where a public funding law provides such substantial benefits without sufficient countervailing burdens to publicly funded candidates that it becomes coercive rather than voluntary, and therefore you have coerced someone into accepting a spending limit, which I believe would be certainly subject to strict scrutiny and almost surely unconstitutional."
2010.10-238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1924.661,1925.544,So it doesn't work?
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,1925.544,1933.75,"Certainly it doesn't work in the sense, Your Honor, if the goal were for everyone to accept public funding, it doesn't work in that sense."
2010.10-238,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1945.308,1955.282,Do you think that one reason for people to decline participation in the program is because they do not want to deter independent expenditures?
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,2003.577,2006.879,"Your Honor, independent--"
2010.10-238,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2006.879,2013.616,All of which is designed to probe this idea that this somehow does not deter independent expenditures.
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,2019.353,2024.591,"--Well, Your Honor, independent expenditure groups -- there's no evidence that it really in fact has been deterred."
2010.10-238,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2062.33,2066.032,I don't know how you can say that there's no evidence that it's been deterred.
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,2121.618,2125.086,"Maybe I should say there's no significant evidence, Your Honor."
2010.10-238,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2125.086,2125.52,Ah.
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,2125.52,2143.032,"But with respect to each of the items that you mentioned: With respect to the population point, Your Honor, there is no evidence in the record and it does not make sense that expenditures either by candidates or by independent groups would increase proportionally to the population of a State because most of the expenses of a campaign are fixed and--"

2010.10-238,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2144.065,2145.734,--has the same expenditures as New York State?
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,2145.734,2146.567,"No, no, Your Honor."
2010.10-238,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2147.436,2150.036,You don't expect the two to have any relationship?
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,2150.036,2151.238,"Of course not, Your Honor."
2010.10-238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2211.425,2215.21,"On that, there's a back and forth about the record and common sense."
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,2233.255,2235.291,"--I might think twice about it, Your Honor."
2010.10-238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2256.97,2260.822,"Well, if you're thinking twice and one way you're thinking is not to do it, that sounds like a sufficient burden."
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,2260.822,2272.48,"Well, Your Honor, if it were a sufficient burden, it would presumably have been a sufficient burden with respect to disclosure, where this Court has recognized that some people may not spend or contribute because of the disclosure requirements."
2010.10-238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2272.48,2275.849,"Our cases, as you know, have drawn a distinction between expression and disclosure."
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,2275.849,2277.349,Yes.
2010.10-238,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2285.538,2288.507,Are you saying that anything that has to be disclosed can also be prohibited?
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,2291.609,2294.292,"No, Your Honor, I wasn't suggesting that."
2010.10-238,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2295.244,2305.849,"It seems to me that this law has a severe criticisms leveled at it, severe legal invalidities alleged, quite without reference to disclosure."
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,2305.849,2322.442,"--Well, Your Honor, I was making the analogy to disclosure in the sense of the think-twice notion that Mr. Chief Justice raised, but I don't think -- I don't think this creates any more of a burden, indeed we would submit less of a burden, than a disclosure requirement."
2010.10-238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2355.579,2364.602,Your focus on persuasiveness -- your focus on persuasiveness is a particular view of the political process that may not be applicable in every case.
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,2388.983,2392.018,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think that the State is doing that."
2010.10-238,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2438.297,2449.772,"But even if it is the case that those candidates who choose not to participate are willing to spend additional money even though it triggers matching funds, I don't see what that proves."
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,2484.009,2500.053,"--Well, Your Honor, I think what it proves is that you -- the key point in here is that initial choice that is voluntarily made by each of the candidates, whether the system of public financing under which you may receive matching funds is better for them or whether the system--"
2010.10-238,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2500.053,2508.242,"Could I ask a question that goes back to Justice Kennedy's question, which I don't think you fully had a chance to -- or fully answered?"
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,2554.121,2563.793,"--Because, Your Honor, the discrimination, if you want to -- if you call it discrimination or different treatment, is based on the initial choices of the candidates as to how they're going to finance their campaigns."
2010.10-238,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2599.4,2606.22,"But if I'm the independent -- if I'm the independent expenditure maker, I haven't made a choice at the beginning."
2010.10-238,1,17943,bradley_s_phillips,,2612.958,2614.541,"And -- and, Your Honor, two points."
2010.10-238,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2748.478,2749.295,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
2010.10-238,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2764.487,2766.356,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2818.972,2828.061,"Mr. Jay -- Mr. Jay, do you agree with the -- the assertion of Mr. Phillips that this does not favor incumbents?"
2010.10-238,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2856.33,2857.047,"Oh, Justice Scalia--"
2010.10-238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2857.047,2861.049,Which -- which one should expect campaign finance restrictions to be.
2010.10-238,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2861.049,2888.282,"--Justice Scalia, I'm happy to -- to endorse the sentiment, because I think that the Petitioners' evidence in this case, the Petitioners who were incumbent office holders and say that they did not spend money because they were -- they feared the response that would be paid for by matching funds, I think their own evidence, including the declaration that they put in at Joint Appendix 364, says: If I can keep the spending down, me as an incumbent, I have a tremendous advantage."
2010.10-238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2912.8,2923.04,"Your answer -- your answer depends upon whether you believe that this scheme will keep the expenditures down, or rather, will elevate the expenditures."
2010.10-238,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2930.461,2934.247,"--It's not -- it's not a matter of deterring people from making contributions, Justice Scalia."
2010.10-238,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2987.132,2993.286,"Counsel, do you agree that under our precedents, leveling the playing field for candidates is not a legitimate State purpose?"
2010.10-238,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2993.286,2994.988,"We do, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.10-238,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2997.438,3009.228,"Well, I checked the Citizens' Clean Elections Commission website this morning, and it says that this act was passed to, quote, ""level the playing field"" when it comes to running for office."
2010.10-238,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3012.782,3022.971,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, whatever the Citizens Clean Elections Commission says on its web site I think isn't dispositive of what the voters of Arizona had in mind when they passed this initiative."
2010.10-238,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3036.315,3042.219,But would you agree that the matching fund provision by itself does not serve an anticorruption purpose?
2010.10-238,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3042.219,3057.978,"--Well, Justice Alito, the matching funds provision the State of Arizona has concluded is an important way of ensuring that candidates will take public financing, because it is a formula of ensuring that candidates will have enough money to run competitive races without wasting the State's money by -- by--"
2010.10-238,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3057.978,3060.196,And what about -- it's a general question.
2010.10-238,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3110.529,3112.113,"--I -- I will comment in this way, Justice Breyer."
2010.10-238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3137.346,3148.136,"But anything that, anything that makes it more attractive to take the public financing is okay?"
2010.10-238,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3148.136,3149.221,That's not our position.
2010.10-238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3149.221,3160.379,"I mean, what if -- what if the State of Arizona says we're not going to give -- just give money to the other candidates; we're going to send out officers of Arizona to argue on behalf of these other candidates?"
2010.10-238,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3161.479,3162.229,Yes--
2010.10-238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3162.229,3170.251,"And would you come in and say, well, it's perfectly okay because its purpose is to make public funding attractive to candidates?"
2010.10-238,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3175.305,3179.007,"--It doesn't make -- it doesn't just make it more attractive, Justice Scalia."
2010.10-238,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3228.956,3238.729,What you just said was that this law aims to allow publicly financed candidates to run on the same footing as privately financed candidates; isn't that right?
2010.10-238,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3238.729,3241.331,"--The same dollar amount footing, Justice Alito."
2010.10-238,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3241.914,3243.033,"Right, and that's equal--"
2010.10-238,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3243.033,3243.933,--far different mix of benefits and burdens--
2010.10-238,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3243.933,3245.735,"--that's equal -- that's leveling the playing field, isn't it?"
2010.10-238,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3245.735,3251.721,"--It's not, Justice Alito, because there is a far different mix of benefits and burdens that a publicly-financed candidate takes."
2010.10-238,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3290.446,3295.482,Why -- why do you think the elections commission then tells us its purpose is to level the playing field?
2010.10-238,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3295.482,3309.058,"I can't -- I -- I don't speak for the elections commission, Mr. Chief Justice, but the State of Arizona has said in -- in this case that the purpose of public financing, as indeed was the purpose of the presidential public financing system that this Court upheld in Buckley, is to combat corruption."
2010.10-238,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3316.229,3325.354,"Well, in your hypothetical of the -- of -- of a participating candidate who spends up to the limit, what happens if independent expenditures are then made on his behalf?"
2010.10-238,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3325.354,3331.673,Independent expenditures on his behalf don't -- would trigger public matching funds to any other matching--
2010.10-238,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3331.673,3332.107,"No, no."
2010.10-238,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3332.107,3333.407,--To any other candidate in the race.

2010.10-238,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3344.831,3346.85,"In a two-person race, Justice Kennedy--"
2010.10-238,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3346.85,3347.8,"I mean, that could -- that could happen?"
2010.10-238,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3347.8,3348.4,--It could.
2010.10-238,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3357.723,3366.764,But the -- but the point that you made that the participating candidate is limited leaves out the fact that there can be additional expenditures on his behalf by independent groups?
2010.10-238,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3366.764,3368.914,There can be -- may I finish the sentence?
2010.10-238,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3382.79,3383.756,"Thank you, Mr. Jay."
2010.10-238,3,45529,william_r_maurer,,3386.408,3388.694,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.10-238,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3489.31,3507.604,"Mr. Maurer, Davis starts off by saying that if what had been triggered was not an inequitable contribution limit raised but instead both a contribution raised for both candidates, that would have been perfectly appropriate, notwithstanding that that would have put many independent funders to a real choice."
2010.10-238,3,45529,william_r_maurer,,3514.358,3527.249,"I think what this Court was recognizing in Davis is that when the -- when the government relaxes restrictions on free speech, when there's more freedom, that doesn't constitute a violation of the First Amendment."
2010.10-238,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3539.14,3556.352,"Well, as I said, the Davis system that was -- the system that was specifically approved in Davis would disincentivize many people, many independent funders from speaking, would put that person to a choice of the kind that you say that your clients are being put to a choice, the exact same kind of choice."
2010.10-238,3,45529,william_r_maurer,,3556.352,3561.739,It would not have the unfair trigger that this system has.
