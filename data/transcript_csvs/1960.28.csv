1960.28,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,11.85,"Number 28 Raphael Konigsberg, Petitioner, versus State Bar of California et al."
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,11.85,17.353,"Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices."
1960.28,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1182.084,1202.587,Is it not true that the majority of your court has held in this case that refusal to answer relevant pertinent questions is a ground for denial in the California (Inaudible) admission to the Bar?
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,1202.587,1210.832,"This is, in effect, Mr. Justice Harlan, this is what the California case has said in this case and at this late date, that is correct."
1960.28,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1210.832,1211.206,(Voice Overlap) said it.
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,1214.887,1215.722,The basis of what?
1960.28,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1215.722,1217.248,That's what it's held.
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,1217.248,1220.046,This is the holding in the second Konigsberg case.
1960.28,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1231.736,1234.727,That holding is one that binds us.
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,1234.727,1235.344,That holding --
1960.28,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1235.344,1240.138,"That holding on state law is one which we have to accept, the California courts' view on."
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,1240.138,1241.884,"I -- I think not, Your Honor."
1960.28,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1526.174,1531.262,"I don't understand that, would you elaborate -- I mean, what should they have done?"
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,1531.262,1565.891,"I'm saying this, Mr. Justice Whittaker, that if there was any type of an instruction from this Court to the State of California, and I do not believe there was, I believe that, at most, this Court was saying that if, at some time in the future, another case arising where proper warning has been given so that the person who embarked upon the study of law knew when he started that if questions were going to be asked to him and he declined to answer them that he would be denied admission."
1960.28,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1671.863,1685.521,You mean the rules that governed and after admissions to the Bar must be those that are in effect at the time he completes his laws to the Court?
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,1685.521,1690.542,"I'm not sure, Your Honor, that I would go that far."
1960.28,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1758.357,1764.07,"There's no doubt that if he went back to the Committee and answered the question that he's refused to answer, he'd be admitted, isn't it?"
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,1764.07,1765.47,I don't think there's any doubt about it.
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2256.33,2263.878,Does that apply everything you've said not right to the specific question whether you are a member of the Party since 1951?
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,2263.878,2265.692,"I didn't hear the beginning, Your Honor."
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2265.692,2279.882,"There is this -- what you've just argued applied to his refusal to answer assuming it's an allowable question, the question whether he was a member of the Communist Party since 1951."
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,2279.882,2281.294,"I would say so, yes, Your Honor."
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2281.294,2291.774,"Well, how can you say that was dealt with and that was no frustrations unless you can say putting to one side of the -- the impermissibility of the question?"
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,2313.297,2316.021,If it please the Court.
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2319.103,2319.226,(Voice Overlap) put that --
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,2319.226,2321.662,-- question of the -- of whether it's a proper question.
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2321.662,2322.551,-- put that to one side.
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,2322.551,2323.353,"Yes, alright."
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2356.4,2358.136,On that record.
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,2358.136,2358.193,On that record.
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2358.193,2360.269,On that record.
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,2360.269,2361.413,That is correct.
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2384.158,2385.849,Not in those terms.
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,2385.849,2386.574,"Oh, I -- I --"
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2386.574,2389.315,But -- but what -- they weren't answered.
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,2389.315,2389.712,But if it please the Court --
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2389.712,2393.662,And the issues that were decided weren't that specific issues.
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,2393.662,2397.047,"Well, if it please the Court, the questions were identical."
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2400.561,2400.602,"No, not the --"
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,2400.602,2401.474,-- but the questions weren't --
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2401.474,2407.756,"-- not the preface, the issue, the basis on which reversal was sought in."
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,2432.869,2446.473,"Well, I -- I understand the distinction that -- that you're making, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, but it seems to me that it is not a distinction that is justified under the facts of the whole case."
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2468.64,2472.03,You make the whole question when you said based upon it.
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,2473.586,2474.808,Based upon a record --
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2474.808,2477.858,Not that he refused to answer that question.
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,2477.858,2487.594,"But based upon a record in which the identical question had been asked was before the Court, now asked again and before the Court is the identical question."
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2487.594,2498.516,I don't have to tell an experienced lawyer like you that question sometimes reflect different significances as to the uses made of them.
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,2498.516,2532.69,"I -- I would concede that of course, Your Honor, but what I'm saying is that when the question is asked following the history of this case in the whole context of the prioritization, it seems to me that the position adopted by Mr. Justice Traynor in the California Supreme Court that under the circumstances of the whole history of this case, it was at least incumbent upon the State to come forward with some type of evidence before they could then require that questions that are already been asked should now be asked again."
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2532.69,2538.891,"That -- but that judgment, that view of Mr. Justice Traynor for whom I have a greatest respect --"
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,2538.891,2539.276,Was not adopted --
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2539.276,2545.169,-- with reference to different legal question and no one will now represent it.
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,2545.169,2545.597,"No, Your Honor, this --"
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2545.597,2551.662,"He was deciding this according -- he didn't go on to constitutional ground, did he?"
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,2591.718,2604.952,"Yes, except that the essence of Mr. Justice Traynor's dissent even though the exact position where he was sitting at that moment was somewhat different than this Court."
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2622.622,2633.308,"Well, Mr. Justice Traynor is the last man in the world, not just knowing the difference between the grounds on which he went, in the ground on which his dissenting colleague man."
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,2633.308,2640.96,"Why, I -- I would suspect that he was well aware."
1960.28,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2827.847,2839.391,Do you think that a lawyer has a less duty of candor to the admitting authorities or ultimately to the Court in an ordinary layman has to his employer?
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,2839.391,2840.599,"No, I do not, Your Honor."
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2900.693,2906.659,"But the First Amendment isn't restricted to what might be called political view, social view, is it?"
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,2906.659,2907.392,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2907.392,2930.662,"Could he be -- could he be asked a lot of questions as to the function and belief in the State organized bar that he'd be asked questions as to belief in contingencies but he ask -- he asks questions as to the requirement, constitutionality to determine as -- under the Ohio Constitution by all except one member of the Court?"
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,2932.433,2943.868,"I think that what you come to on those questions, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, is the weighing and the balance of the value of the questions and the value to society in restricting the asking of those questions."
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2943.868,2945.916,What do you say to the kind of questions that are asked?
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,2945.916,2966.688,"I would say these kinds of questions are -- are of no great moment unless, unless there was some issues that a person knew that if his views were contrary to the views of the Committee of Bar Examiners, they weren't going to allow any one to be admitted who had a view contrary, let say, to the principle of the integrated bar."
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2966.688,2968.449,How did you know that?
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,2989.285,3002.017,I would have some question as to the propriety of it because I would submit that these are not matters upon which his answer either way would justify his being denied admission to the Bar.
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3004.617,3017.807,But it might disclose such -- such -- what shall I say (Inaudible) knowledge of the law that they might (Inaudible) a man who has -- who object to a decision on this ground rather than that really isn't such a practice.
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,3027.865,3032.17,I would suspect the Supreme Court of California would not permit his denial on that basis.
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3033.082,3033.875,Well --
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,3033.875,3035.843,-- the questions had moved in to a realm --
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3035.843,3046.04,Are you now suggesting that the California Supreme Court would deny an admission nearly because he was -- had been a member of the Communist Party of the years ago?
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,3046.04,3047.767,"I do not believe so, no."
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3047.767,3050.952,"Well, then -- then they're on a par."
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,3050.952,3061.552,"They're on a par, Your Honor, except insofar as weighing them in the balance of the importance to society that we not intrude into the area, then I think that the scales are quite different."
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3061.552,3073.641,"Do we have to guess here as to what is likely to give you effect of his answers in the eyes of the existing Supreme Court of California to vote as it is, is that it?"
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,3073.641,3076.617,"I'm not sure I thoroughly understand the question, I think not --"
1960.28,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3076.617,3087.305,"Well, you -- you indicated that -- that he wouldn't be denied admission by the California Supreme Court as he gave answers to some of the questions that I hypothesize."
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,3098.002,3103.75,"I -- this is the very reason, Your Honor, why I hesitated to speculate because I think it is not really to the heart of this issue."
1960.28,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3106.817,3107.154,You may.
1960.28,0,22800,edward_mosk,,3107.154,3109.045,-- stop at this time.
1960.28,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3109.045,3110.476,Mr. Belcher.
1960.28,1,23669,frank_b_belcher,,3110.476,3116.076,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.28,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3138.74,3140.764,(Inaudible)
1960.28,1,23669,frank_b_belcher,,3140.764,3143.767,"Yes, sir, I was just coming to those."
1960.28,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3310.83,3312.331,Can I ask you a question?
1960.28,1,23669,frank_b_belcher,,3319.396,3320.466,"Yes, sir."
1960.28,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3320.466,3320.498,(Voice Overlap)
1960.28,1,23669,frank_b_belcher,,3320.498,3333.811,"And the record, if by stipulation at the time of the last hearing, the first record was also made a part of his record so that the two records are now before the Court on this hearing."
1960.28,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4065.813,4068.056,Mr. Mosk.
1960.28,2,22800,edward_mosk,,4068.056,4069.982,"I shall also be quite brief, Your Honor."
1960.28,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4266.618,4266.84,"Well, now --"
1960.28,2,22800,edward_mosk,,4266.84,4267.751,But --
1960.28,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4267.751,4275.848,"-- on cross-examination, did he not throw up the barrier and say, ""I'll select the questions I'll answer?"""
1960.28,2,22800,edward_mosk,,4275.848,4283.099,"Mr. Justice Whitaker, there could have been that implication in the -- prior to the 1957 record."
1960.28,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4287.556,4303.728,"Do you contend that -- that this man would take the stand testifying that ""I am of good moral character,"" then when asked on cross, ""Are you a member of the Communist Party?"""
1960.28,2,22800,edward_mosk,,4305.771,4307.93,"That is my position, Your Honor."
1960.28,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4399.707,4399.779,Mr. Mosk --
1960.28,2,22800,edward_mosk,,4399.779,4401.935,And so we submit to the Court --
1960.28,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4401.935,4401.974,Mr. Mosk --
1960.28,2,22800,edward_mosk,,4401.974,4402.65,-- this time.
1960.28,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4402.65,4404.839,"-- excuse me, before you proceed."
1960.28,2,22800,edward_mosk,,4404.839,4407.656,"I'm sorry, yes, sir."
1960.28,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4407.656,4423.856,"Considerably earlier in your argument, Mr. Justice Harlan asked you whether or not we weren't here bound by the holding of the Supreme Court of California that the reason for withholding this man's certification was his refusal to answer material questions."
1960.28,2,22800,edward_mosk,,4428.042,4430.057,"I -- I, perhaps, did not answer it directly."
1960.28,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4514.417,4534.503,"Well (Inaudible) to give an extreme case, suppose the State said we -- whether on the ground that he refused to answer questions and the total -- no question about the record being a full record, and I'm reading it, one finds that he did not refuse to answer any question."
1960.28,2,22800,edward_mosk,,4546.266,4548.075,I could not disagree with Your Honor on that.
1960.28,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4548.075,4550.478,So that -- so that we have a clear case.
1960.28,2,22800,edward_mosk,,4579.41,4579.628,Well --
1960.28,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4579.628,4584.874,"But that the State would -- court went on that ground, hardly a subject to controversy."
1960.28,2,22800,edward_mosk,,4584.874,4586.9,My red light is here but I will like to --
1960.28,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4586.9,4586.972,"Go ahead, answer."
1960.28,2,22800,edward_mosk,,4586.972,4590.691,-- respond to the question.
1960.28,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4626.144,4635.736,"You can't do that, but if a door no matter how small is a sufficient aptitude to which a person can pass then the State can select that small door, can't it?"
1960.28,2,22800,edward_mosk,,4635.736,4637.479,Perhaps for some other case but not --
1960.28,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4637.479,4638.748,"But with this case, if --"
1960.28,2,22800,edward_mosk,,4638.748,4639.031,-- not --
1960.28,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4639.031,4645.527,"-- if -- if that door wasn't vaulted by this Court, I understand you ought to say it was."
1960.28,2,22800,edward_mosk,,4665.87,4666.491,I -- I cannot --
1960.28,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4666.491,4684.707,"In other words, it -- it can't -- the generality is it can't evade the protection of a constitutional right which this Court sets to protect, by pretending by an evasive use of state law but you got to get ultimately to that position."
1960.28,2,22800,edward_mosk,,4684.707,4687.855,"I -- I -- of course, I could not quarrel with that, Your Honor."
