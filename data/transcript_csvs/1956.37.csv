1956.37,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,27.426,29.409,"Mr. Blanchard, you may proceed."

1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3035.74,3036.265,May it please the Court.
1956.37,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3036.265,3038.201,Mr. Gressman.
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3038.201,3044.927,I would just like to add a few comments to what I had in my remarks last Thursday.
1956.37,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3082.429,3085.119,May I ask you before you move on?
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3111.609,3111.896,That's --
1956.37,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3111.896,3112.997,-- sustained the specification.
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3112.997,3113.732,"That's true, Your Honor."
1956.37,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3113.732,3114.285,Do you mean that?
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3114.285,3115.423,That's right.
1956.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3117.352,3118.466,"Excuse me, Mr. Gressman --"
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3118.466,3118.634,Yes.
1956.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3118.634,3125.594,"-- before you leave that, at 47, have you any comment on the sufficiency of what --"
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3125.594,3125.689,Yes --
1956.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3125.689,3127.288,-- Mr. Blanchard referred us to --
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3127.288,3127.702,"Yes, I do --"
1956.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3127.702,3129.123,-- which is sufficient?
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3129.123,3130.975,-- Your Honor.
1956.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3164.868,3172.228,"Now, what he was saying here was that in fact after examining him on that very day, he found in them no reference to any (Voice Overlap) --"
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3172.228,3183.017,"Those were slot machines and that brings up the point, Your Honor, that I emphasize last Thursday and that is that it's not enough to show that these two or three items were actually in existence."
1956.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3198.292,3206.801,"Well, now, what is the significance then of what Mr .Blanchard referred us to at page 51 of these lists of exhibit?"
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3206.801,3225.344,"Well, now, you -- again, he's referring to the supplemental record and while I don't think that any admission or a failure to object to a particular portion give -- adds to the power of the Court of Appeals to consider or add to something which is not --"
1956.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3225.344,3228.591,"Well, on the premise -- on the premise that there was no -- nothing irregular --"
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3228.591,3228.968,Yes.
1956.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3228.968,3230.72,-- about the Court of Appeals looking at it.
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3246.856,3247.616,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3248.913,3249.757,Was that the fact?
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3252.103,3260.783,"I'm not clear about that, Your Honor, if -- if it is true, it must be in the record but I'm not -- at the moment, I'm not familiar with that fact."
1956.37,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3329.713,3331.373,I don't quite follow.
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3353.225,3363.776,"No, I say that if they are -- if -- if they are in the record and that an issue is raised as to their relevance, it's incumbent upon the Government to prove that they are what it --"
1956.37,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3363.776,3365.001,In the contempt proceeding?
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3365.001,3365.898,"In the contempt proceeding, Your Honor."
1956.37,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3365.898,3367.78,I don't understand why.
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3367.78,3370.589,Because the contempt proceeding has to stand alone by itself.
1956.37,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3370.589,3379.478,"That's right, and I should think that you don't try out there the relevance of documents asked to be produced in the main case."
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3379.478,3381.905,"When you have a -- a general subpoena, Your Honor."
1956.37,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3387.79,3389.558,"I don't know what that means, general subpoena."
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3389.558,3410.433,"Well, calling without specifying the particular items which are called for as later specified in the order to show cost, but when you have a -- a subpoena which calls not for all the records of the corporation, not for any particular record but for certain categories of records."
1956.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3410.433,3412.262,What category here?
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3412.262,3414.242,"Well, you'll find those --"
1956.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3414.242,3420.447,What category here in connection with -- as related to your argument now?
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3420.447,3432.557,"Categories which would indicate the sales of slot machines, coin operated devices whether new or used between certain specified dates."
1956.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3455.54,3456.009,May I ask you?
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3458.966,3459.591,Yes.
1956.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3459.591,3460.795,-- before you move on?
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3460.795,3461.167,Well --
1956.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3461.167,3468.074,Are you saying there that they asked for certain papers relating to slot machines for answers?
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3469.964,3470.17,That's right.
1956.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3470.17,3472.066,-- and all papers relating to slot machine.
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3472.066,3473.784,Between certain specified dates.
1956.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3473.784,3482.444,And is it your argument that it's the duty of the Government to show that he had paid for this plus the fact that they're related to slot machines?
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3482.444,3486.368,"That's right, Your Honor, particularly where he brings that into issue in his testimony."
1956.37,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3486.368,3498.333,"Did they -- did the Government characterized the papers they wanted as papers related to slot machines or did the Government asked for certain books of account within a certain date, which was it?"
1956.37,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,3498.333,3502.053,They asked for certain books of account relating to slot machines.
