1987.87-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.266,"We will hear argument next in Number 87-526, Bobby Felder versus Duane Casey, et al.--"
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,93.893,97.886,Thank you.
1987.87-526,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,282.358,283.046,Six months from what?
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,283.046,288.502,--Six months from the date on which the claim is disallowed.
1987.87-526,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,299.359,307.333,So a notice of claim must be filed within 120 days of the wrong?
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,307.333,307.994,Correct.
1987.87-526,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,307.994,311.117,And then after it's filed there's another 120 days?
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,311.117,312.519,No.
1987.87-526,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,322.214,322.503,Right.
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,322.503,327.936,That second notice or document need not be filed right away.
1987.87-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,445.515,447.495,Mr. Steinglass--
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,447.495,448.146,Yes.
1987.87-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,448.146,453.579,"--if you have actual notice, is any writing at all necessary on the part of the plaintiff?"
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,453.579,459.574,The statute does not require actual notice.
1987.87-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,489.833,491.484,"It's a matter of decisional law then, you just don't know."
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,491.484,494.826,"That, I think, is the correct answer."
1987.87-526,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,525.905,533.181,"Mr. Steinglass, let me ask before you launch into that another question about the meaning of the state statute."
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,542.077,546.428,"I believe not, Your Honor."
1987.87-526,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,557.767,568.284,And your suit here or the plaintiff's suit here was against employees in both their official capacity and their individual capacity?
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,568.284,569.055,That is correct.
1987.87-526,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,569.055,573.126,"But the court below didn't make any distinction, I gather."
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,573.126,573.837,That is also correct.
1987.87-526,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,575.958,579.03,Did you ask the court to make such a distinction--
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,579.03,591.328,"Well, I think the central argument that was made in the case below was that the notice of claim requirement was simply inapplicable to 1983 cases, and a secondary argument was that it didn't apply as a matter of state law."
1987.87-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,694.155,707.885,"--Mr. Steinglass, is your principal complaint here the six-month statute of limitations after the notice is... after the city counsel has refused to act or the requirement of a notice at all?"
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,707.885,713.709,"No, I think this case principally involves the requirement of a notice at all."
1987.87-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,747.469,756.996,"So again, we don't know under Wisconsin law whether if you file the notice of claim and it's not acted on by the city council, how long thereafter you have to file?"
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,756.996,761.701,We have no definitive ruling as to what the Wisconsin Supreme Court thinks about that.
1987.87-526,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,761.701,767.823,And you don't know why you didn't go into federal court instead of the state court.
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,769.595,772.317,If the notice of claim requirement applies in federal court?
1987.87-526,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,772.317,773.339,Yes.
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,779.433,807.39,"Well, Your Honor, there is nothing in the record indicating why the plaintiff chose the state courts rather than the federal courts, but Congress gave plaintiffs that choice, and that is part of our system of concurrent jurisdiction and I have practiced law in Wisconsin for many years, and the Wisconsin courts are perfectly fine courts, quite capable of dealing with 1983 issues and other federal rights, and the plaintiff made that decision."
1987.87-526,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,807.39,811.363,"It didn't turn out that way, did it?"
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,811.363,811.934,What?
1987.87-526,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,811.934,813.585,"It didn't turn out that way, did it?"
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,813.585,814.155,"Well, apparently."
1987.87-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,830.213,837.9,I don't see exactly why the length of the limitations period is involved here.
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,837.9,854.721,"Well, Your Honor, it seems to us that if there is a three-year limitations period using the period identified by the Wisconsin Court of Appeals in this case, that entitles a plaintiff to wait that full period."
1987.87-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,854.721,858.094,"But the Supreme Court of Wisconsin never got to this question, as I understand."
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,864.078,881.017,"That is correct, but the use of the notice of claim requirement to deny a right to sue before the expiration of the full limitations period cuts off the ability to go to court."
1987.87-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,881.017,884.961,"But we don't know whether that's true in Wisconsin or not, as I understand it."
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,884.961,897.49,"Even if the limitations period was two years, I mean, the Wisconsin court in this case saw the notice of claim issue as being dispositive."
1987.87-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,897.49,898.079,Yes.
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,904.053,931.101,"No, what I really was planning to address was the way in which the short notice of claim requirement placed a burden on plaintiffs who were seeking access to the state courts, and what I was going to say was, I was going to analogize to this Court's discussion in Burnett about the practicalities of litigation and the difficulty that prospective claimants often have."
1987.87-526,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,945.23,968.176,"Well, Mr. Steinglass, it does strike me that just possibly people who want to rely on state courts for their litigation and file suit there generally speaking have to take those courts as they find them, with whatever procedural requirements those courts employ."
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,968.176,978.712,"Well, that argument can be made, but it has never been accepted with the breadth that your question suggests, Your Honor."
1987.87-526,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,985.387,1007.59,"Well, of course, with the FELA one can say that Congress was addressing specifically the procedural requirements that were to be met in those cases, and I am not sure that that is the thrust of the 1983 litigation, which did seem to be addressed to opening a remedy in federal courts."
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1007.59,1014.836,"--Well, we certainly don't dispute that an important function of 1983 was to create access to federal courts."
1987.87-526,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1067.3,1081.678,"Well, but one can find a focus and a Congressional intent to effect those very things in that particular Act, but I am not sure one can find it in 1983."
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1081.678,1098.171,"--Well, I can't point to any specific intent in which Congress said state courts must here 1983 cases or if state courts do hear 1983 cases they must follow these procedures or those procedures."
1987.87-526,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1136.416,1141.308,"Certainly you had a closely divided Wisconsin Supreme Court, didn't you?"
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1141.308,1142.369,"Yes, four to three, Your Honor."
1987.87-526,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1142.369,1145.161,And the three dissenters felt otherwise.
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1145.161,1145.84,That's right.
1987.87-526,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1145.84,1147.623,Distinctly felt otherwise.
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1147.623,1148.742,"So did the four lower court judges, but they--"
1987.87-526,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1148.742,1150.114,And some of them are pretty strong judges.
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1150.114,1154.965,"--That is true, but we clearly did lose in the Wisconsin Supreme Court."
1987.87-526,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1184.596,1190.6,Could the Wisconsin courts just decline to entertain 1983 actions?
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1190.6,1199.035,"Well, that possibility is there."
1987.87-526,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1202.797,1206.1,Is there any decision by this Court either way?
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1206.1,1210.384,"Not with respect to 1983 cases, at least not directly."
1987.87-526,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1229.235,1230.828,What would be the same kind of claims?
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1230.828,1235.029,"--Well, that's a question to which this Court has not provided a great deal of guidance."
1987.87-526,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1268.271,1270.943,"Well, you know the Wisconsin courts entertain those."
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1270.943,1283.361,"--Well, the non-discrimination principle, to be sure, weights the balance very heavily in favor of state courts entertaining cases, and I think that is how it should be."
1987.87-526,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1345.285,1346.163,Let's be sure about one thing.
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1354.699,1355.43,--That is correct.
1987.87-526,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1481.17,1483.824,Don't you have to go through every other rule of the state court?
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1483.824,1485.754,"Well, I--"
1987.87-526,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1485.754,1488.997,Don't you have to abide by every rule in the state court?
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1488.997,1489.778,--I would say the--
1987.87-526,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1489.778,1490.978,Except this one?
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1493.559,1494.911,--No.
1987.87-526,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1494.911,1496.28,Isn't that your position?
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1496.28,1498.654,"No, there may be other rules that apply."
1987.87-526,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1506.909,1508.429,Was that used against you?
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1508.429,1510.231,--The exhaustion case--
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1510.231,1510.89,Yes.
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1510.89,1511.972,"--was used against us in this case, yes."
1987.87-526,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1511.972,1512.943,And what other rule?
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1512.943,1516.176,"Well, I would... other rules that the plaintiff would not want to comply with?"
1987.87-526,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1521.347,1522.329,Is that in this case?
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1522.329,1524.239,"No, no, no other rules in--"
1987.87-526,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1524.239,1526.21,What I know is what other one is wrong.
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1533.506,1540.311,"--Well, we would abide by all the rules that are properly applicable."
1987.87-526,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1542.813,1544.785,Is it all of the rules except this one?
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1546.605,1566.468,"--Well, in this case the plaintiff did comply with all of the Wisconsin rules, and most of the Wisconsin rules that could be classified as procedural are rules that govern the conduct of litigation, that govern what goes on once a plaintiff files a case in court."
1987.87-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1657.867,1664.322,"Congress itself has imposed that sort of a regimen on Federal Tort Claims Act cases, hasn't it?"
1987.87-526,0,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,1668.456,1669.197,That is correct.
1987.87-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1703.368,1704.189,"Thank you, Mr. Steinglass."
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,1706.38,1727.154,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, petitioner did not lose this case in state court because the notice of claims statute at issue here was too difficult, too complicated, or too burdensome for him to comply with."
1987.87-526,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1740.701,1745.136,"Well, how would it have been possible to comply afterwards with the time limit?"
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,1745.136,1754.253,Under our notice of claims statute you have 120 days in which to file a written notice with the city.
1987.87-526,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1765.429,1768.881,But didn't... I thought the state court found there wasn't actual notice here.
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,1768.881,1773.073,--The state court found that there was neither written notice within 120 days--
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,1773.073,1773.764,Or actual notice.
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,1773.764,1774.435,--nor actual notice.
1987.87-526,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1775.236,1777.577,So there was no way this plaintiff could have met the requirement.
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,1777.577,1784.901,"--What I was saying was, we raised the defense of failure to comply with this provision in three separate answers."
1987.87-526,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1789.945,1794.177,Was the suit filed within the initial 120-day period?
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,1794.177,1795.93,"--No, but actual notice--"
1987.87-526,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1795.93,1800.902,"No, and so since there was no actual notice, there would be no way this plaintiff could have complied, as I see it."
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,1800.902,1804.175,--Actual notice does not have to be made within 120 days.
1987.87-526,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1824.119,1839.657,In your brief on Page 22 you appear to me to say that the statute requires only that the notice of claim be filed no later than 120 days before the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,1844.122,1848.733,There are two 120-day provisions.
1987.87-526,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1893.686,1909.806,"When you talk about actual notice, you are not suggesting that so long as the city knows some time during the period of the overall statute of limitations that you have a claim against them, that is actual notice, are you?"
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,1914.64,1924.815,"But the intent of the statute is to give the municipality an opportunity to investigate, and if appropriate, to resolve an issue such as this before litigation."
1987.87-526,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1936.513,1939.786,So then the state's interest is in settlement procedures?
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,1939.786,1943.228,The state's interest is in resolving these disputes without litigation.
1987.87-526,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1943.228,1944.277,Settlement?
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,1944.277,1955.345,"Resolution may be by payment of the claim, by settlement, or in many instances by denial of the claim and because of the reasons for denial it does not result in a lawsuit."
1987.87-526,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1955.345,1958.447,Isn't the best characterization of that an exhaustion of remedies rule?
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,1958.447,1968.403,"No, I don't believe so in this case that it is an exhaustion of remedies, because all the claimant is required to do is to file a document, a document."
1987.87-526,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1971.616,1975.899,"Well, but the state's interest is in an exhaustion of remedies procedure, is it not?"
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,1975.899,1978.962,"No, I don't necessarily agree with that."
1987.87-526,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2043.784,2052.839,"Mr. Langley, does the statute apply at all to a suit against an employee in the individual capacity of the employee?"
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,2052.839,2056.042,"That issue was not raised in this case, but I believe it does."
1987.87-526,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2092.094,2101.821,"If this claim had been filed... if the suit had been filed in federal court, do you think that the state could apply its notice of claim statute?"
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,2101.821,2107.255,"I think... first of all, this Court has not decided that issue."
1987.87-526,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2137.765,2143.598,Is that because it is close to an exhaustion requirement such as the Court dealt with in Patsy?
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,2143.598,2152.384,--There is in my judgment in reviewing those cases very little analysis of why that is the answer.
1987.87-526,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2178.09,2187.807,"Why is that true... you say that is true for exhaustion, right?"
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,2187.807,2188.569,I'm sorry.
1987.87-526,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2188.569,2194.854,You say there is no gap where the issue is exhaustion.
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,2194.854,2204.537,"No, I'm suggesting that there is no gap where the only issue is a precondition imposed by the state in bringing a lawsuit."
1987.87-526,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2230.414,2232.627,And you agree with that.
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,2232.627,2241.633,"I think an argument can be made the other way, but in my judgment if the issue were presented to this Court the answer would be yes."
1987.87-526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2241.633,2249.037,"May I ask, I guess there are two filings, the claim itself and then the claim for damages."
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,2260.093,2261.445,"No, it does not."
1987.87-526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2261.445,2262.875,What is the purpose of that requirement?
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,2262.875,2272.282,"The purpose is, if a claimant, if we can assume that a claimant acts in good faith, it puts the city on notice of what the claimant values that claim at."
1987.87-526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2291.104,2295.426,"Is the figure admissible, I take it... sort of like a settlement offer, I guess, then."
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,2303.473,2304.192,In my judgment it is not.
1987.87-526,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2404.429,2417.878,"Mr. Langley, the city certainly can't take the position here that it didn't know enough of the underlying facts to take any action it wanted to to straighten out its police department operation."
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,2417.878,2425.351,"That's correct in this case, but the overall purpose is to afford the city an opportunity to take remedial actions."
1987.87-526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2485.2,2498.11,"One difficulty with that argument is that if the statute only applies to state court litigation as most of the other courts seem to hold, I suppose the real impact is that you would just channel this litigation into the federal courts."
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,2498.11,2499.56,I don't believe that that will occur.
1987.87-526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2519.903,2521.696,You've got to do something within 120 days.
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,2521.696,2523.697,--You have to do something within 120 days--
1987.87-526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2523.697,2524.987,And a lot of people don't.
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,2524.987,2526.508,--but the obligation is a minimal obligation.
1987.87-526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2546.062,2547.001,Let me modify my point.
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,2553.436,2556.539,"No, I don't agree with that, either."
1987.87-526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2556.539,2564.004,"Or gives actual notice and shows no prejudice, but there are risks not to go... I mean, it is a lot safer to go into federal court."
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,2564.004,2576.06,"It's a lot safer to go to federal court, but I think if you, in looking at the decisions of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, the risks in providing actual notice and prejudice are minimal at best."
1987.87-526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2577.882,2580.834,"The action notice has to be something more than filing a complaint, doesn't it?"
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,2580.834,2590.939,"--Generally, generally counsel comply if they have not filed the notice of claim documents."
1987.87-526,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2615.937,2620.759,But after the 120 days it is federal court or nothing.
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,2620.759,2624.943,"No, again, my judgment is--"
1987.87-526,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2624.943,2633.739,"Well, give me the case that was over 120 days where the complainant recovered in the state court."
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,2633.739,2642.495,"--There are any number of cases where the claim was filed after 120 days... I'm sorry, not a 1983 claim."
1987.87-526,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2642.495,2645.166,"Well, that's what I'm talking about."
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,2645.166,2646.488,"You're correct, Your Honor."
1987.87-526,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2952.847,2960.922,How can you comply with it after 120 days has run?
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,2960.922,2974.44,"Again, by any type of actual notice after 120 days the Court has held that the action is not barred so long as the claimant can show that the municipality is not prejudiced."
1987.87-526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2994.064,2996.405,"Of course, there was opportunity, but may I ask one other question?"
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3004.55,3010.924,The court has held that the overall statute of limitations in Wisconsin is three years.
1987.87-526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3010.924,3017.869,So you are telling me that any time within three years the plaintiff could have given actual notice of the claim and then filed suit?
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3017.869,3026.454,"I think under the circumstances of this case it is reasonable to conclude that the Court would find that we were not prejudiced, and that had he made that minimal effort--"
1987.87-526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3026.454,3028.745,"If that is true, why isn't filing the complaint adequate?"
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3041.905,3050.27,--In theory I agree but the statute says that a claimant can neither bring nor maintain an action without complying with the statute.
1987.87-526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3052.712,3057.936,"I understand all that, but you are telling me that actual notice within three years is all they have to do."
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3086.815,3091.407,--But that is exactly what our court has said because of the underlying purposes of the statute.
1987.87-526,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3107.908,3114.291,I thought the most common way of effecting a settlement is sue somebody.
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3114.291,3115.553,--No.
1987.87-526,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3115.553,3122.779,And I suppose you could come back and negotiate with a plaintiff who has filed a suit.
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3122.779,3131.415,"Your Honor, in most municipalities these claims are resolved prior to litigation."
1987.87-526,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3131.415,3131.963,I agree with you.
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3131.963,3136.997,There are very few claims which are filed with the city which ultimately result in litigation.
1987.87-526,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3146.013,3146.584,All right.
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3159.271,3162.333,The next day he could not sue.
1987.87-526,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3162.333,3164.935,"Well, so actual notice isn't enough, is it?"
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3164.935,3170.39,"He would have to also comply with the second part of the statute, which is the claim provision."
1987.87-526,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3182.907,3194.063,"I take it you say, in effect then you are saying that the requirement that you give notice within 120 days is a nullity in your statute."
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3194.063,3196.417,"No, I cannot agree with that."
1987.87-526,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3197.576,3204.291,"Well, if you can give actual notice two years from the event, which you say you can."
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3204.291,3213.989,--But the claimant also must show if he is going to rely on the actual notice provision that the municipality was not prejudiced in so doing.
1987.87-526,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3218.269,3220.091,"Well, so actual notice isn't enough."
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3220.091,3222.052,That's correct.
1987.87-526,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3227.255,3236.391,And you must wait 120 more days to give the municipality the opportunity to make a settlement offer?
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3236.391,3237.132,To make a settlement.
1987.87-526,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3255.395,3262.308,"How is the issue whether the municipality has been prejudiced, how is that decided?"
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3262.308,3266.1,The question that the Court addresses--
1987.87-526,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3266.1,3267.382,"As I understand it, there is an actual notice."
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3273.297,3274.406,--Right.
1987.87-526,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3274.406,3280.05,But the plaintiff nevertheless still has the burden of proving the municipality was not prejudiced.
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3280.05,3280.58,Yes.
1987.87-526,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3280.58,3281.402,How does he do that?
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3281.402,3284.944,The question that the court will look at is--
1987.87-526,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3284.944,3285.874,"Well, how does he get into court?"
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3285.874,3287.136,--I'm sorry.
1987.87-526,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3287.136,3289.507,How does he get into court?
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3289.507,3290.528,He simply--
1987.87-526,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3290.528,3298.362,I thought you said no lawsuit until after he has satisfied the requirement of proving that the municipality was not prejudiced.
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3299.543,3302.785,--He would file his lawsuit after--
1987.87-526,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3302.785,3303.835,He files the lawsuit?
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3303.835,3304.707,--Files the lawsuit.
1987.87-526,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3305.638,3306.299,"Now, wait a minute."
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3307.831,3308.582,--Right.
1987.87-526,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3310.674,3315.906,I thought he couldn't do that until he established that the municipality was not prejudiced.
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3315.906,3318.258,"No, in terms of the first statute, the first section--"
1987.87-526,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3318.258,3322.161,"No, I am talking about the second, the actual notice provision."
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3322.161,3325.333,--The notice provision is the first section.
1987.87-526,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3336.148,3337.46,That's two different things.
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3341.254,3342.493,--Right.
1987.87-526,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3342.493,3348.347,How much time after he has given you actual notice does he have before he may file the lawsuit?
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3348.347,3356.793,The time limit that he has to wait for filing the lawsuit does not apply to actual notice.
1987.87-526,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3359.654,3363.788,How much time after he has given actual notice does he have to file the lawsuit?
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3363.788,3367.782,"Assuming that he has complied with the claim statute, he can file the lawsuit immediately."
1987.87-526,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3373.464,3376.366,Including proving that the municipality was not prejudiced?
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3376.366,3376.977,Yes.
1987.87-526,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3376.977,3377.816,Where has he done that?
1987.87-526,1,25655,grant_f_langley,,3377.816,3380.159,He has not done that in this case.
1987.87-526,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3498.046,3500.698,"Thank you, Mr. Langley."
1987.87-526,2,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3503.559,3504.779,Thank you.
1987.87-526,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3582.1,3585.132,Do you mean this is the first time you knew the statute was in?
1987.87-526,2,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3585.132,3593.547,--I didn't try the case below but the formal notification of the statute came through the affirmative defendant.
1987.87-526,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3593.547,3594.699,But the statute has been on the books.
1987.87-526,2,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3594.699,3617.292,"Well, it had been on the books since 1963 but it only applied to tort litigation until 1977, and when this case was filed, Your Honor, not a single federal or state court in this country had ever in a reported decision held that notice of claims statutes in any state applied to 1983 cases."
1987.87-526,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3619.624,3634.133,"And when you filed a case you knew that you had to not apply to it, and instead of going to the federal court you went to the state court, period, end quote."
1987.87-526,2,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3634.133,3638.027,"--That's entirely correct, Your Honor."
1987.87-526,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3638.027,3639.539,"Well, what else do you have?"
1987.87-526,2,42152,steven_h_steinglass,,3639.539,3667.255,"Well, what I have is that as this Court pointed out in Robertson versus Wegman, in which the Court indicated that the issue was not whether a particular plaintiff wins or loses in terms of determining the propriety of a state policy, but for the same reasons we would say that the issue is not whether a particular plaintiff might or might not have been able to comply with the statute."
1987.87-526,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3691.752,3692.734,"Thank you, Mr. Steinglass."
