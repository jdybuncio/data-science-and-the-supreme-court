1969.23,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,23.733,Number 23 Turner against Fouche and number 30 will follow that immediately.
1969.23,0,36318,michael_meltsner,,27.776,30.998,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.23,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,196.785,199.637,The judge himself reforms that last function?
1969.23,0,36318,michael_meltsner,,199.637,200.234,That’s correct.
1969.23,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,211.17,214.981,And the judge himself selects 32 from how many?
1969.23,0,36318,michael_meltsner,,215.571,221.206,"From not more than two-fifths, a number of about a 130 in this county."
1969.23,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,221.206,226.461,And he selects those subjectively or does he pick them in some random objectively?
1969.23,0,36318,michael_meltsner,,226.461,230.103,"No, he picks them from a box randomly."
1969.23,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,237.358,239.201,"Yes, I understand that part of the right."
1969.23,0,36318,michael_meltsner,,239.201,244.531,And then takes the first 23 names to constitute the grand jury.
1969.23,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,262.87,266.37,"What is the term of this grand jury, how long does it stay and exists?"
1969.23,0,36318,michael_meltsner,,266.37,270.633,"It’s about six months I believe, the term of court each grand jury."
1969.23,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,270.633,275.708,"And what is the term of the school board, members of the school board selected by grand jury?"
1969.23,0,36318,michael_meltsner,,275.708,277.771,Five years.
1969.23,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,277.771,281.392,"So the grand jury performs the function, whatever that happens to be a --"
1969.23,0,36318,michael_meltsner,,281.392,296.689,"Whenever there has to be a vacancy, now if there is a death or resignation, the school board will pick and interim candidate but the next grand jury will then act and is free to select whoever it wants for the position."
1969.23,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,372.78,377.423,Has there any -- ever been a non-white superior court judge?
1969.23,0,36318,michael_meltsner,,377.423,383.879,The record only shows the race of the judge now in office as white.
1969.23,1,15888,alfred_l_evans_jr,,1626.921,1631.695,Mr. Chief Justice Burger and may it please the Court.
1969.23,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1962.03,1966.541,"This is a rather recent statute as presently worded, is it not?"
1969.23,1,15888,alfred_l_evans_jr,,1966.541,1967.394,No sir.
1969.23,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1982.299,1983.725,After our decision in Whitus against Georgia.
1969.23,1,15888,alfred_l_evans_jr,,1983.725,1989.881,In Whitus and also Avery versus Georgia to meet the criticism of this Court in those decisions.
1969.23,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1989.881,1994.911,"How about the sentence, the long sentence you just read to us, I won’t repeat it."
1969.23,1,15888,alfred_l_evans_jr,,1994.911,1995.281,I think that --
1969.23,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1995.281,2000.467,At any time it appears for the jury commissioner that the jury list of both is not fairly represented and so on.
1969.23,1,15888,alfred_l_evans_jr,,2002.056,2006.184,"It is what I believe that particular -- that isn’t an issue yes, sir."
1969.23,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2006.184,2009.596,I understood so.
1969.23,1,15888,alfred_l_evans_jr,,2009.596,2019.894,"In any event, we think that qualifications as to character and intelligence are essential to the proper functioning of the jury system."
1969.23,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2058.63,2061.744,"How have they been handling, do you say it’s been satisfactory?"
1969.23,1,15888,alfred_l_evans_jr,,2061.744,2068.436,"Well, in the case at hand, the court directed a revision of the jury list."
1969.23,2,36318,michael_meltsner,,3202.54,3206.942,"In the very short time left, I’m going to try and deal with two or three of these issues."
