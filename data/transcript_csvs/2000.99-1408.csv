2000.99-1408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.053,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-1408, Gail Atwater v. The City of Lago Vista."
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,34.285,39.173,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.99-1408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,78.884,86.939,"Well, why would the common law be involved here Mr. De Carli if Texas law says otherwise?"
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,86.939,103.295,"Mr. Chief Justice, the common law should be considered because it is our position that the Fourth Amendment incorporates the protections, the restrictions on arrest that existed at the time of the Fourth Amendment's adoption."
2000.99-1408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,103.295,118.023,"Well, but you're arguing here that this offense should not have led to a custodial arrest, now as part of that argument has to be a condition of Texas law, isn't it?"
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,126.053,136.86,"No, Your Honor, because it is our position that the Fourth Amendment restricts the use of custodial arrest for minor offenses such as this."
2000.99-1408,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,145.489,148.558,Even with a warrant you couldn't do a custodial arrest?
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,148.558,151.867,"No, but let me qualify that."
2000.99-1408,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,189.827,206.992,"See, my problem is with your common law argument because the Fourth Amendment does not contain a warrant requirement, it just says if you do have, get a warrant, it has to be based upon probable cause, blah, blah, blah, blah, but the only root requirement of the Fourth Amendment is that the arrest be reasonable."
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,217.145,221.276,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia, and for that reason we say--"
2000.99-1408,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,221.276,224.672,Why would a warrant make it more reasonable?
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,224.672,236.733,"--Because, Your Honor, it would interject a neutral and detached magistrate who we would hope would say Officer Turek, why are you arresting this woman for not wearing a seat belt?"
2000.99-1408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,241.133,243.038,Would that be a magistrate's prerogative ordinarily?
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,246.195,256.628,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and for that reason I'm willing to concede that if a warrant were obtained, this arrest still would be reasonable."
2000.99-1408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,275.388,299.796,"What about the situation of a traffic violator, maybe parking tickets or maybe seat belt use, who continues repeatedly to refuse to use a seat belt or to pay the parking fee when parking a car and has a whole string of tickets for it?"
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,320.966,330.968,"Justice O'Connor, I believe that time would come when, if I understand you correctly, you're alluding to nonappearances, the repeat offender."
2000.99-1408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,330.968,342.613,"Well, it's possible that a nonappearance could amount to something that generates jail time, but I'm just talking about the repeat offender."
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,342.613,343.154,Okay.
2000.99-1408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,343.154,346.351,Without an offense that requires jail time.
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,346.351,348.121,Without the nonappearance problem.
2000.99-1408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,369.419,373.804,"Not punishment, a concern for highway safety."
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,373.804,395.023,"Well, Your Honor, the thing is, even the repeated, the fact if there are repeated penalties and there is no heightened penalty, well then the legislature has made a determination that on the balance that does not regard that aspect of highway safety is that sufficient to justify the intrusion."
2000.99-1408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,395.023,414.35,"I notice that Judge Weiner in the case below had a suggested approach, a different approach, that when there's a plausible articulable reason for affecting such an intrusion, it's lawful."
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,414.35,434.372,"Yes, Your Honor, and I read that as trying to encompass what this Court in its opinion issued last week referred to as vehicular bound imminent threats to life and limb which would be driving while intoxicated, driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol."
2000.99-1408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,434.372,436.995,"Oh, presumably that can generate jail time."
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,436.995,438.596,In some cases.
2000.99-1408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,469.351,477.383,Does repeated nonuse of a seat belt for minor children constitute a threat to safety?
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,477.383,503.156,"--Justice O'Connor, I think it would be a closer question, but I would still defer to the fact that if the legislature has not increased, has not provided for heightened penalties, for repeat offenders, repeat nonuse of seat belts, that still it is not that limited category of offenses that impose an imminent threat to life and limb on the road."
2000.99-1408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,503.156,504.861,When you say... go ahead--
2000.99-1408,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,504.861,515.876,"--Suppose in this case the driver was from another state, could there have been an arrest made."
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,515.876,518.666,"No, Your Honor, and let me explain why."
2000.99-1408,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,532.825,537.315,So the risk of nonappearance is not part of the balance that you want the police officer to--
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,537.315,557.989,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I think the approach to that, there already is a way of dealing with that and that is if a party does not appear, then that's a separate offense, there is a penalty provided for that, a warrant may be issued for that person's arrest, and they are then subject to punishment for that additional offense."
2000.99-1408,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,557.989,566.643,--Can a police officer in an out of state case use the time honored tradition of giving you a police escort to the station where you pay your fine?
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,566.643,568.165,Your Honor--
2000.99-1408,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,568.165,571.019,"That's a stop, it's a seizure of sorts."
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,571.019,573.987,--The problem that we--
2000.99-1408,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,573.987,575.83,That's sort of an old tradition in some of our states.
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,575.83,592.214,"--Well, it depends... the problem with that approach is it leads to, and in part what respondents, respondents have implicitly made this argument that this was a brief arrest."
2000.99-1408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,619.086,625.091,"Mr. De Carli, a moment ago you said you thought perhaps reckless driving might be a breach of the peace."
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,632.274,653.054,"Mr. Chief Justice, it is clear at common law that breach of the peace when used in the context of the law of arrest referred to a group of offenses that either involved violence or the type of conduct that would incite immediate violence."
2000.99-1408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,653.054,656.498,The opposing briefs suggest differently.
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,673.81,699.407,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that if we look to, again the decision of last week, and other decisions of this Court, Delaware v. Prous, I guess Sitz would be an example, there are certain offenses, in the context of the traffic offenses where by their very nature they impose a grave risk of harm to others on the road."
2000.99-1408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,699.407,710.718,"What if Texas here had said that this particular offense was, you know, that it could be 10 days in jail or 300 fine?"
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,713.411,717.166,"Mr. Chief Justice, it would be a much closer case then."
2000.99-1408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,717.166,720.188,Could you answer... answer yes or no and then explain.
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,720.188,739.149,"Well, let me, part of my vacillation is in... we proposed a rule, in looking back at that, I now wonder, well, perhaps the correct approach would be to rely exclusively on the common law."
2000.99-1408,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,745.146,746.619,The common law as of what date.
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,746.619,751.364,As of the adoption of the Fourth Amendment which would be 1791.
2000.99-1408,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,751.364,755.726,"What is your answer to the Chief Justice's question, yes or no."
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,755.726,758.874,Unless there were... the answer would be no.
2000.99-1408,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,760.296,780.351,"What do you make of the nightwalker statute argument that at the same period in which you're arguing there was at least a threshold of immunity set here, it was clear in English law that nightwalkers who were not breaching the peace in your sense could be arrested."
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,780.351,799.686,"Justice Souter, I think the correct, I believe the correct way to look at the nightwalker statutes is this was a time before any lighting, anybody that was walking about in the dead of night it was reasonable to presume that that person was a felon, until--"
2000.99-1408,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,799.686,806.816,"Yeah, but the fact that the person was a felon, even that he intended to commit a felony, is that what you mean?"
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,806.816,810.579,--Well that the person may have committed a felon or they were up to no good.
2000.99-1408,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,823.929,827.07,They didn't have insomniacs back then?
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,827.07,832.397,I think Justice Kennedy they stayed indoors because it was too dark.
2000.99-1408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,832.397,851.063,"You answered the Chief Justice's question that if the state had said we regard not buckling up as very serious, therefore 10 days in jail, then you would have no case to complain about a custodial arrest for that, is that so?"
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,851.063,860.985,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, again, it depends on, our case is a core case, I mean it falls under the rule the common law end of any balancing--"
2000.99-1408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,860.985,862.794,But I'm just asking you the question.
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,862.794,863.16,--Yes.
2000.99-1408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,863.16,872.969,"Is it just... so a seat belt in one state could be one thing if the state chooses to make it a more serious offense, and another thing in another state?"
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,872.969,883.04,If the line is drawn not based on the common law but as we had proposed in our brief the jailable versus fine only distinction.
2000.99-1408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,883.04,904.585,"Now here in this very case, could the officer have said, child endangerment is a felony, so it's not simply the misdemeanor of not buckling up, but you've put your children in danger and therefore the offense is child endangerment which is a felony."
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,904.585,907.312,Several responses to that Justice Ginsburg.
2000.99-1408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,975.721,978.232,"Well, the facts here are very unattractive."
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,991.582,994.747,--We'd like to think so Justice O'Connor.
2000.99-1408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,994.747,1007.261,But I think what we're concerned with is the broader rule because it has millions of permutations and applications across the country.
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,1020.645,1021.915,It might.
2000.99-1408,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1033.367,1040.146,"So what do you think, Bob, it seems to me that the strongest argument against you has nothing to do with this case, it has to do with the police officers being human."
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,1058.481,1059.021,Right.
2000.99-1408,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1059.021,1064.364,And the problem with your side and the people who are supporting it is are they coming up with something that works?
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,1080.76,1123.637,"Justice Breyer, I really do believe that in the context of traffic offenses, and I'll explain a little bit later why it's valid to limit a holding or a rule to traffic offenses, it is not all that complex because there are only a few offenses that... in which, most of which this Court has identified in other opinions where the arrest... where the use of a custodial arrest would indeed further enforcement, I mean, I guess one, drunk driving, driving while intoxicated, reckless driving, closer arguably the unlicensed driver, although--"
2000.99-1408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1123.637,1124.114,Speeding.
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,1124.114,1125.412,"--No, Your Honor."
2000.99-1408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1125.412,1126.878,No what.
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,1126.878,1137.199,"No, Your Honor, speeding... it would not be reasonable to arrest a driver for speeding unless the speeding rose to the level of reckless driving."
2000.99-1408,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1140.293,1141.592,What if the state does think that--
2000.99-1408,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1141.592,1142.396,--What if the speeder is from another jurisdiction?
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,1142.396,1143.599,I'm sorry.
2000.99-1408,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1143.599,1146.246,What if the speeder if from another jurisdiction?
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,1146.246,1171.781,"Your Honor, oh, Justice Stevens, again, that returns to the response I believe I gave to Justice O'Connor or Justice Kennedy that in essence respondents seek a prophylactic rule in that we are to cede discretion to arrest to police officers on the chance that people from another jurisdiction are going to run away and not pay their fine."
2000.99-1408,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1171.781,1185.524,I think that's a standard rule for policemen to stop motorists and state if you're from out of the jurisdiction you either pay the fine now or follow me to the courthouse.
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,1185.524,1187.269,But Justice Scalia--
2000.99-1408,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1187.269,1191.319,I'm quite sure that's standard procedure in any number of states.
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,1197.867,1226.585,"--It's... Justice Scalia, I think the reason why it's, I mean if we're looking for a bright line rule, the problem that permitting a custodial arrest in that situation would lead to is, if we say, okay, out of state person, he's not going to come back to Wyoming, high risk, if you allow the arrest, then what that means is the person is potentially held in custody before a probable cause--"
2000.99-1408,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1226.585,1231.306,"I hate to constitutionalize all this thing, everything becomes a constitutional case."
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,1235.571,1237.452,"--Yes, yes, Justice Scalia."
2000.99-1408,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1237.452,1237.857,Is he elected?
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,1237.857,1238.955,Yes.
2000.99-1408,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1238.955,1248.407,Do his constituents think it's a good idea for his officers to arrest women for not having their kids in seat belts.
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,1248.407,1254.315,My understanding is there is a deep divide in the community regarding the issue.
2000.99-1408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1254.315,1270.946,"But he's not in the case anymore and that raises another question, given the division of the judges, it's really interesting, the district court thought your case was frivolous and then five judges on the court of appeals thought it was very serious."
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,1284.69,1287.185,"I have three responses to that, Justice Ginsburg."
2000.99-1408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1308.309,1309.783,But the police chief isn't.
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,1327.775,1353.541,"--My understanding is that the... if it were to be remanded back to the Fifth Circuit, if this Court were to find a Fourth Amendment violation, the Fifth Circuit majority never addressed that... those specific issues, but it would still be live against the city based on the finding of Judge Sparks that there was a policy on the part of the city."
2000.99-1408,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1355.135,1357.406,Which judge made that.
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,1357.406,1368.564,"Judge Sparks, Judge Sparks in the... I guess it would be Appendix... the third Appendix basically stated that it was a... a policy was established."
2000.99-1408,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1373.867,1375.373,This is the judge who thought the claim was frivolous.
2000.99-1408,0,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,1375.373,1379.767,"Yes, but Judge Sparks is a good judge."
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,1640.941,1648.693,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.99-1408,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1782.694,1797.984,"Mr. George, can I just ask sort of a general question, why wouldn't that interest, and obviously you're certainly entitled to arrest somebody who's about to flee the jurisdiction or something like that, but why wouldn't that interest be accommodated by the statement of Justice Weiner, Judge Weiner in his dissent?"
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,1807.377,1822.979,I believe the problem with Judge Weiner's appointment is the problem of being too unclear as to exactly what kind of reasons are good enough reasons.
2000.99-1408,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1822.979,1835.589,"It's about like a Terry stop, that's pretty... if there's a particular articulable reason to suspect there's a problem here you can make a Terry stop, I don't see that it's that different."
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,1836.536,1841.192,It does work in the Terry stop situation and we can--
2000.99-1408,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1841.192,1842.156,Why wouldn't it work here?
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,1842.156,1844.818,--You can argue it was here.
2000.99-1408,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1868.483,1870.931,I'm not asking about this case.
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,1870.931,1871.694,--I understand that.
2000.99-1408,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1871.694,1873.846,I'm asking about an appropriate workable rule.
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,1879.691,1886.917,"I think... well, I think it leads to the same problems that we've had to some extent in this Terry stop rules."
2000.99-1408,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1903.354,1914.568,I'm not sure that a proper articulable rule... do you think that an acceptable articulable reason is that there's a breach of the peace in the more narrow sense?
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,1920.812,1921.497,No.
2000.99-1408,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1921.497,1926.849,Because I mean it seems to me you don't necessarily have to take him in to stop that.
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,1934.399,1936.431,I absolutely agree with that.
2000.99-1408,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1980.471,1982.05,Their suggestion is there be another rule.
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,1982.05,1983.132,--I understand.
2000.99-1408,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1983.132,1985.987,And the other rule would be what Justice O'Connor just said.
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,1998.122,2004.752,"Well, I think that the same reason that there's something wrong with that--"
2000.99-1408,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2004.752,2006.442,"Now, what's wrong with that."
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,2006.442,2018.525,"--Well, it assumes that the officer knows enough facts at the time to make a determination of what the crime will ultimately be charged."
2000.99-1408,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2018.525,2023.596,"Well, as long as the officer has to have, doesn't the officer can arrest him only if he thinks he's breaking the law."
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,2037.114,2042.289,"Well, as this Court decided not to adopt that rule in Berkimer."
2000.99-1408,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2042.289,2044.297,My question is why not.
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,2044.297,2051.706,"The answer is, because for example, much conduct can be both felony and misdemeanor."
2000.99-1408,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2051.706,2058.788,"Well, that's absolutely fine, if the policeman thinks, forget felony/misdemeanor, I agree with you that felony/misdemeanor is not a workable rule."
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,2082.438,2083.761,Because... same reason.
2000.99-1408,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2089.795,2095.308,"Is that your only reason, Mr. George, just that you're willing to argue this out on a case by case basis?"
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,2115.923,2116.894,--Absolutely.
2000.99-1408,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2116.894,2120.13,"Which, if they're abusive, the sheriff won't get reelected."
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,2120.13,2123.304,That's exactly the basis of my argument.
2000.99-1408,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2123.304,2129.404,"Why don't you put that as your first line of defense and then argue on the, you know, on the--"
2000.99-1408,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2129.404,2132.266,--If by chance the first line of defense was breached.
2000.99-1408,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2132.266,2135.199,Mr. George is trying convince of us that that's the reason--
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,2135.199,2136.059,Thank you Justice Scalia.
2000.99-1408,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2171.864,2174.598,"--The answer is, if you don't know, you have no articulable reason."
2000.99-1408,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2178.748,2184.338,"The burden is on the officer to be certain that it is the second offense or the third offense, whatever is necessary."
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,2184.338,2195.424,"Yes, Justice Souter, that... Justice Breyer asked me why... what's wrong with the jail versus fine distinction."
2000.99-1408,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2207.572,2211.998,"I know, but in that instance why can't the officer just radio in?"
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,2216.742,2232.939,--This Court's opinion in Arizona v. Evans in which the communications to the station and the computer system and they called down and they said he has an outstanding warrant but it turned out he didn't have an outstanding warrant.
2000.99-1408,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2246.177,2249.646,"Well, then you're going to have the same problem when he goes before the magistrate in this little town."
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,2251.112,2252.266,--I understand.
2000.99-1408,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2273.236,2286.206,"Yes, but Judge Weiner's rule, it's important to keep in mind, it only kicks in if it's a fine only offense in the first place, but if there is a reason such concern about appearance at trial, bingo, you're protected."
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,2313.035,2323.595,"Well, the discretion of the officer, the answer is no there's not absolute discretion because there's the limits of the equal protection clause, there's other kinds of constitutional limitations."
2000.99-1408,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2331.012,2331.704,Or women with small children.
2000.99-1408,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2331.704,2343.764,"Can they be held for 48 hours as other arrestees can or do they have to be, do you acknowledge that that's part of your rule that he really does have to be brought before a magistrate immediately."
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,2343.764,2345.413,"--Not in Texas, they can't."
2000.99-1408,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2354.187,2356.164,But that wasn't the decision.
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,2364.845,2366.247,--In this case?
2000.99-1408,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2366.247,2366.851,Yes.
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,2366.851,2373.773,"On the basis, we're here on a summary judgment where he has never been deposed and all we have is arrest reports."
2000.99-1408,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2373.773,2374.162,Right.
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,2374.162,2376.539,So the only thing I have is his arrest report.
2000.99-1408,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2385.468,2393.558,Even knowing it was a mother with two small children in a small town and what happens to the children?
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,2397.816,2422.528,"Well, it would be a lot better that the children have to deal with having their mother taken before the magistrate than having to deal with the brain damage if they had... she had stepped on the brake five minutes later, five minutes later, would that 5-year-old standing up in the front seat of a pick up and she steps on the brake, it is a very serious incident, even at 15 miles an hour, assuming that was the actual speed."
2000.99-1408,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2422.528,2426.382,"You don't have to think it's fine to think it's not unconstitutional, do you."
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,2426.382,2428.455,"No, as I understood--"
2000.99-1408,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2428.455,2431.735,There are a lot of really stupid things that aren't unconstitutional.
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,2431.735,2435.339,--Being a jerk is not unconstitutional.
2000.99-1408,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2448.683,2474.178,"It's true, in trying to think this through, and I'm having a difficult time working on this and I'm trying to think it through, and it seemed to me the strongest argument against the Weiner position is that it would lead to writing volume 7 of the treatise on the Fourth Amendment which would have an infinite number of rules in it about when the Terry stop type justification is enough or isn't enough."
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,2495.782,2497.958,"No, there is no real problem."
2000.99-1408,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2497.958,2504.305,"I know you think that, but I wondered if you've come across some things that you could refer me to."
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,2504.305,2505.109,No.
2000.99-1408,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2558.311,2590.377,"Mr. George, one of your arguments is the difficulty of administration argument, and you said earlier that when we're dealing with a level of offense in which it may be difficult to tell on the side of the road whether this would be subject to arrest or not subject to arrest, the... in effect the benefit of the doubt should be given to the officer and we shouldn't come up with a rule that in effect would penalize the officer."
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,2607.473,2615.736,My first response is that probable cause has been the line that's drawn on all crimes in this country since 1791.
2000.99-1408,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2621.342,2622.425,I realize that.
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,2665.566,2676.923,"The answer is, because the difficulty of articulating all the reasons that would be adequate."
2000.99-1408,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2677.807,2679.656,But that's the premise of the question.
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,2707.119,2718.907,"--Truthfully, I see no reason, if you're going to go down the road of trying to carve out some other exception to probable cause, that the burden of proof not remain on the government."
2000.99-1408,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2757.206,2775.848,"There's a point, a procedural point, that I'm curious about, this case was begun by the plaintiffs in the state court, and the police officer, police chief and the city removed it to the Federal court, is there a reason why they did that?"
2000.99-1408,1,39347,roger_j_george_jr,,2775.848,2779.723,I wasn't trial counsel at that time and I do not know the reason.
2000.99-1408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2804.699,2806.029,"Very well, Mr. George."
2000.99-1408,2,17111,andy_taylor,,2806.801,2813.244,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.99-1408,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2847.342,2853.452,"Let me suggest this, again, going back to, as you can guess, I'm rather intrigued with the descending standard."
2000.99-1408,2,17111,andy_taylor,,2873.357,2905.376,"The reason why that premise is incorrect Justice Stevens is this Court's teachings in Gerstein v. Pew and reaffirmed in County of Riverside v. MacLaughlin, once you have probable cause this Court's teachings have been not only can you engage in a full custodial arrest, but likewise you're entitled for a temporary detention for the purpose of administrating the paperwork so that this individual can be booked and then released once a probable cause determination has been made by a magistrate."
2000.99-1408,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2950.811,2958.5,But you're saying there is no standard that constrains the officer's decision on whether or not to give a citation as opposed to make a custodial arrest.
2000.99-1408,2,17111,andy_taylor,,2958.5,2966.053,"There is no constitutional standard, it is a policy judgment Justice Stevens, and the different states have approached it in different ways."
2000.99-1408,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3008.617,3010.793,That's set forth specifically in the seat belt law?
2000.99-1408,2,17111,andy_taylor,,3010.793,3038.17,"The traffic rules of the road is a certain codification of state law that includes seat belt offenses and there is a statute in Texas on the books that says for any offense in this traffic code, full custodial arrest is appropriate, save two exceptions, one is for speeding, and two is for the open container law which were the results of political judgments made in the local jurisdiction."
2000.99-1408,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3145.254,3161.917,"I suppose that misdemeanor violators, traffic violators, seat belt and all that stuff, french fries eaters, unlike felons, they're probably not a discreet and into a minority, are they?"
2000.99-1408,2,17111,andy_taylor,,3161.917,3162.976,--That's correct.
2000.99-1408,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3162.976,3164.219,I mean they're a lot of them out there.
2000.99-1408,2,17111,andy_taylor,,3181.282,3182.588,To my knowledge--
2000.99-1408,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3182.588,3185.458,"When you say he's been dismissed, I assume that means he's been dismissed from the case."
2000.99-1408,2,17111,andy_taylor,,3185.458,3188.99,--I meant the former and not the latter.
2000.99-1408,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3222.426,3231.916,"Mr. Taylor, do you know why local officials took this case out of the hands of Texas courts and put it in the hands of Federal court?"
2000.99-1408,2,17111,andy_taylor,,3231.916,3236.015,"I do not, Your Honor, and the record does not indicate why."
2000.99-1408,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3289.52,3293.349,Well you have that now on the felony/misdemeanor distinction.
2000.99-1408,2,17111,andy_taylor,,3307.035,3315.033,"Justice Souter, no, the fact that you do not draw a line is why it doesn't matter whether they're felonies or misdemeanors or--"
2000.99-1408,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3315.033,3319.459,"You draw a line on the warrant requirement, I assume you accede to that."
2000.99-1408,2,17111,andy_taylor,,3319.459,3320.382,--Yes--
2000.99-1408,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3320.382,3321.194,Sure.
2000.99-1408,2,17111,andy_taylor,,3321.194,3322.851,"--you would have to have a warrant, absent probable cause."
2000.99-1408,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3322.851,3329.757,"So you've got... so you've got a variation from state to state, even under the scheme that you would advocate."
2000.99-1408,2,17111,andy_taylor,,3329.757,3347.833,"Well, even where a warrant may be desired this Court has not stated as a matter of Fourth Amendment principles that a warrant is required in all circumstances, Gerstein says an on the scene assessment by a police officer of probable cause is enough under our constitutional interpretations of the Fourth Amendment."
2000.99-1408,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3349.29,3365.411,"If the officer is not... the point is that when an arrest is made for an offense that is not committed in the officer's presence, then a warrant is going to be required depending on the gravity of the offense, and I presume that is true under the system that you advocate."
2000.99-1408,2,17111,andy_taylor,,3365.411,3370.977,"--Yes, in certain circumstances a warrantless arrest would not be appropriate because there's not probable cause."
2000.99-1408,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3412.207,3413.697,Correct.
2000.99-1408,3,38906,robert_c_de_carli,,3418.774,3421.771,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court--"
2000.99-1408,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3609.067,3612.095,"Thank you, Mr. De Carli, the case is submitted."
