2010.10-76,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.022,"We will hear argument next in Case 10-76, Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations v. Brown."
2010.10-76,0,35816,meir_feder,,10.006,13.391,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-76,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,63.406,68.024,There's one piece of this I don't quite comprehend.
2010.10-76,0,35816,meir_feder,,76.13,77.98,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-76,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,84.653,89.355,So it's -- it's based on consent?
2010.10-76,0,35816,meir_feder,,89.355,91.724,Yes.
2010.10-76,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,112.303,115.672,Do you think there is general jurisdiction over the parent?
2010.10-76,0,35816,meir_feder,,123.695,128.515,I think that that is a hard question.
2010.10-76,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,257.531,261.602,"Again, this is preliminary and it just goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question."
2010.10-76,0,35816,meir_feder,,271.623,275.159,I think that's a fair assumption.
2010.10-76,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,275.159,278.611,"Well, then why isn't it automatically liable for all the acts of its subsidiaries?"
2010.10-76,0,35816,meir_feder,,278.611,280.979,"Well, because I think--"
2010.10-76,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,280.979,287.05,And does that get -- and does that get into what in the Federal practice would be necessary parties?
2010.10-76,0,35816,meir_feder,,287.05,302.56,"--What -- Your Honor, I think that really what it gets into is the difference between a subsidiary and an agent, because a subsidiary is not automatically acting as the agent of the parent company in a way where you would get respondeat superior."
2010.10-76,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,371.037,397.355,"You are met with an argument that it's all one ball of wax, parent and sub, they merge, it's one enterprise; and so if the subs do something anyplace, the parent is -- it's all part of one thing, so I think that was the principal argument made by Respondents."
2010.10-76,0,35816,meir_feder,,397.355,407.043,"Yes, Your Honor, and I would say, again when it comes to liability and Goodyear Tire and Rubber, they will be free to make that argument."
2010.10-76,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,434.861,437.98,"We haven't resolved a whole lot if we leave that question open, have we?"
2010.10-76,0,35816,meir_feder,,463.797,483.276,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that actually in -- if the Court were to write that, it would be left with the important general jurisdiction question that the court below decided incorrectly, and incorrectly in a few ways."
2010.10-76,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,529.489,541.797,I thought you were saying we should not even -- not even -- not even address the situation where there is no special basis for ignoring the separate incorporation.
2010.10-76,0,35816,meir_feder,,554.022,554.522,Oh.
2010.10-76,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,554.522,561.342,"But the simple question of whether when you have a totally owned subsidiary, its actions are your actions."
2010.10-76,0,35816,meir_feder,,561.342,564.044,"That, I think, the Court--"
2010.10-76,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,564.044,565.744,Don't we have to reach that?
2010.10-76,0,35816,meir_feder,,565.744,567.78,"--You certainly do have to reach that, Your Honor."
2010.10-76,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,800.298,809.654,"Perkins is kind of an unusual case, because it was a company that at the time was doing business only in Ohio."
2010.10-76,0,35816,meir_feder,,821.044,828.948,"--That's right, Your Honor, and I guess what I would say about that is that it's unusual."
2010.10-76,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,918.708,919.641,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.10-76,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,934.635,937.218,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-76,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1080.243,1094.42,"Well, suppose it's just a corporation that's registered to do business in North Carolina, and the connection with that registration; it says: I appoint so-and-so my agent to receive process for any and all claims?"
2010.10-76,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1094.42,1109.512,"Well, as -- as Mr. Feder referred -- referred to, there -- there is a division in the lower courts on whether that sort of a consent is effective to permit the State general jurisdiction over -- over the consenting party."
2010.10-76,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1354.07,1359.407,"Mr. Horwich, could I ask you a different kind of question, and I apologize in advanced for taking you a little bit far afield?"
2010.10-76,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1422.131,1444.663,"No, I don't -- I don't believe so, in the sense that I -- I think we were sort of assuming arguendo a concept of purposeful availment that -- that would be willing to attribute those -- those contacts for purposes of a specific jurisdiction -- excuse me -- for purposes of a specific jurisdiction analysis."
2010.10-76,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1447.615,1449.498,"No, I was hoping that the answer would be yes, actually."
2010.10-76,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1450.234,1454.352,"There's at least one other person in the courtroom who was hoping that, too."
2010.10-76,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1455.586,1473.731,"I -- I -- I was wondering why -- why is your interest in this case so much greater than it would be in -- in the other case, and this -- I've been wondering that at the outset, and this sentence that Justice Kagan points out brings that into full focus."
2010.10-76,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1473.731,1474.9,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, let me -- let me put it this way."
2010.10-76,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1529.317,1532.702,"So, why -- why -- I mean, you've heard the argument in the last case."
2010.10-76,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1546.846,1549.648,And briefly.
2010.10-76,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1549.648,1567.692,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.10-76,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1568.727,1572.596,Saved by the bell.
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,1578.267,1581.785,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-76,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1602.648,1613.506,"I think there's something very new about this, because general jurisdiction is all-purpose jurisdiction and for a corporation it's sort of like a residence for an individual."
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,1670.843,1677.497,"--Your Honor, if that's -- if that's the characterization of the case and that's all you had, then there wouldn't be a case."
2010.10-76,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1713.587,1717.324,"Well, then, you don't defend the reasoning of the State supreme court?"
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,1717.324,1728.596,"I think that the -- the State supreme court did a lot of things right, but, as we say in the brief, we think that they took a detour in using inappropriate stream-of-commerce language that isn't there."
2010.10-76,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1794.721,1798.339,You -- you've got -- you have me in suspense.
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,1805.762,1807.112,"--Okay, okay."
2010.10-76,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1807.112,1810.131,Don't leave me dangling like that.
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,1810.131,1821.372,"Your Honor, as far back as -- as Burger King, this Court recognized that commercial activities when they're conducted on behalf of an out-of-State party can sometimes be attributed."
2010.10-76,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1837.298,1837.381,Excuse me.
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,1840.75,1841.333,"No, no, but--"
2010.10-76,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1841.333,1842.533,It's talking about specific jurisdiction.
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,1842.533,1858.543,--But what they're talking about are that there are evidentiary case-specific interactions between the parties that would lead to the conclusion of general jurisdiction and thus subjecting them to suit on -- in dispute-blind -- or dispute-blind jurisdiction.
2010.10-76,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1892.097,1892.514,Okay.
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,1899.786,1901.253,In terms of the--
2010.10-76,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.253,1903.654,"One, two, three, four, which ones are they?"
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,1903.654,1904.204,--Okay.
2010.10-76,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1942.78,1947.616,--we don't have anything in the record about this being a unitary business.
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,1970.049,1972.132,"--I disagree with that, Your Honor."
2010.10-76,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1994.414,1998.783,"Well, the question isn't whether they did that; the question is whether it was right to do that."
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,1998.783,1999.735,--That -- that--
2010.10-76,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1999.735,2003.353,"I mean, you don't make your point by saying that the court of appeals made a mistake."
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,2003.353,2004.003,"--No, no."
2010.10-76,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2054.203,2058.774,"Well, I mean, those arrangements could exist with a lot of distributors."
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,2062.892,2064.343,"Your Honor, I think--"
2010.10-76,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2064.343,2064.827,"I mean, my goodness."
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,2071.731,2072.297,--Your Honor--
2010.10-76,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2072.297,2074.933,--that you are a unitary business with your distributor.
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,2074.933,2077.885,"--Your Honor, I think this goes way beyond coordination."
2010.10-76,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2147.362,2151.016,"--But the ""it"" wasn't the product that caused the injury here."
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,2171.56,2181.285,"The Goodyear Regional RHS tire that was on the bus and that failed was not generally designed for the U.S. market, although it was brought over here under special circumstances."
2010.10-76,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2205.484,2221.945,"But why did -- why should -- Mr. Feder brought up the Helicopteros and he said in that case it was purchase; and in this case it's sales, and in the purchaser case certainly we said no, there's no general jurisdiction."
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,2223.462,2231.699,"I think the distinction between Hall and Perkins is not so much purchases and sales, it's: Which contacts do you count?"
2010.10-76,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2253.731,2257.349,In Perkins it was the home of the corporation.
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,2266.789,2275.728,"Your Honor, I think the facts of that case are -- is that one officer of the corporation came home, and he was -- he maintained--"
2010.10-76,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2275.728,2277.028,He was the president of the corporation?
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,2277.028,2278.013,--He was the president of the corporation.
2010.10-76,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2278.013,2281.465,"And whatever business it was doing, it was doing from that office in Ohio."
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,2281.465,2281.849,Right.
2010.10-76,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2307.199,2317.805,May I ask you about the ramifications of your theory of this general jurisdiction in North Carolina over these three subsidiaries?
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,2352.276,2355.311,"I think it would depend upon a lot of factors, Your Honor."
2010.10-76,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2362.417,2366.702,"No, we're talking about Goodyear and these three subsidiaries."
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,2387.615,2389.734,"I think in theory, they could."
2010.10-76,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2423.872,2427.157,"Well, that's an -- that's an odd way to think about general jurisdiction."
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,2443.167,2463.913,"Your Honor, I think if -- if the limitation -- if the Court's view is basically the Petitioners', that you are limited to principal place of business, State of incorporation, and physical presence, which we don't think is the State of the law, and frankly, if it were the State of the law, then we would have a Hague convention now and it wouldn't have taken 20 years to negotiate."
2010.10-76,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2485.427,2499.754,"Let's assume that you're right, that on some level that some -- that it's not just the place of incorporation or the principal place of business, that it could be created by something more."
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,2538.212,2546.067,"Your Honor, I think what we're talking about is not so much attribution as more of a merger or a joint activity."
2010.10-76,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2554.423,2566.398,"Does good -- do any of these companies, the Goodyear Turkey Company, the others, do any of them sell the tires directly to Goodyear USA for distribution to the United States?"
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,2572.152,2573.852,--That's -- that's not borne out by the record.
2010.10-76,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2611.26,2613.045,Page 265 of the brief?
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,2614.395,2614.945,Excuse me.
2010.10-76,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2617.614,2625.602,This is just a -- this is an I'm-just-curious question: Why do you care?
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,2641.112,2650.885,"Your Honor, North Carolina has particularly Draconian requirements for piercing the corporate veil and alter ego, some of which Petitioners refer to."
2010.10-76,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2663.775,2674.417,"So -- but what you're saying, then, is that North Carolina treats the parent and the subs very differently as a matter of substantive law, but you would want identical treatment as a matter of jurisdiction?"
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,2674.417,2674.9,--Right.
2010.10-76,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2719.696,2728.135,"I'm not sure that that answered -- I understood you to be saying that substantively, they might not be liable for the defect that caused the accident."
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,2728.535,2730.02,Yes.
2010.10-76,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2775.865,2803.302,"Do you have any case law that supports your position, which, I take it -- and correct me if I've got it wrong -- that a subsidiary is subject to jurisdiction wherever the parent is, so long as some products made by the subsidiary are shipped by the parent to the -- to buyers in the foreign State?"
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,2803.302,2805.837,"No, Your Honor, because that's not our position here."
2010.10-76,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2838.106,2851.949,I see nothing in the North Carolina court's opinion that explains that this is the -- this is a corporation where we can obliterate the distinction between parent and sub.
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,2851.949,2859.971,"Your Honor, they do talk repeatedly about the existence of this highly integrated distribution system."
2010.10-76,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2921.26,2929.366,There's -- there's a -- you open your brief saying something to the effect that this case is about outsourcing.
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,2960.837,2967.741,"Your Honor, our -- our position here is that you will incentivize outsourcing if you agree with the Petitioners' view."
2010.10-76,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3021.125,3022.591,Would they rather be sued in China?
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,3022.591,3025.493,--I think they would rather be sued in China.
2010.10-76,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3025.493,3026.529,I wouldn't.
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,3028.362,3029.397,Well--
2010.10-76,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3029.397,3037.135,Don't you think that's a question as to which we ought to have some sensitivity of the views of the United States expressed here by the solicitor general?
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,3039.587,3044.574,"--Your Honor, I think that the -- well, let me answer this in two ways."
2010.10-76,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3066.087,3070.891,I thought your argument about outsourcing sounded an awful lot like a policy argument to me?
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,3070.891,3082.33,"--Well, it is a policy argument, but I think, Your Honor, that in all candor, I think we felt the need to -- to respond to the policy arguments of not just the government but also to the other side."
2010.10-76,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3110.599,3112.468,It's just not unfairness and undue burden.
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,3117.17,3118.053,--That's--
2010.10-76,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3118.053,3131.596,"I mean, it could be perfectly fair if you announce that you're going to assert jurisdiction over anybody who harms an American citizen anywhere in the world, and you give notice to every manufacturer in the world, that would be perfectly fair."
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,3137.417,3153.343,"--And -- and it would be tempered by the -- the -- the burdens test that is articulated in Asahi and elsewhere, but none of that impacts, you know, policy considerations such as trade negotiations, et cetera."
2010.10-76,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3231.961,3236.199,Only if you believe that burden is the only issue.
2010.10-76,2,19784,collyn_peddie,,3240.401,3252.375,"--That's, that's correct, but the -- but at least this Court has said since Pennoyer v. Neff that the power is tempered only by the Due Process Clause, not about policy concerns."
