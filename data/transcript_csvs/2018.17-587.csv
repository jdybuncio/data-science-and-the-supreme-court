2018.17-587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.16,"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-587, the Mount Lemmon Fire District versus Guido. Mr. Rosenkranz."
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,9.16,23.96,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit fixated on two words in a two-sentence definition of ""employer."" It ignored how the second sentence relates back to the first."
2018.17-587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,119.76,160.28,"Mr. Rosenkranz, what you -- what you say about making sense, perhaps Congress should have used the formulation that was used in Title VII, where it's clear, Title VII is absolutely clear, the numerosity requirement goes to private and public employers. But this statute, ADEA, picks up on the language of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which has no numerosity requirement."
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,185.56,189.8,"Well, Your Honor, let me start with the premise and then turn to the ultimate question."
2018.17-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,260.4,263.4,Expansive in only one -- expansive in only one way.
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,275.56,276.32,"No, not at all, Your Honor."
2018.17-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,276.32,277.08,So set that at --
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,277.08,278.84,"No, Justice Sotomayor."
2018.17-587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,314.16,334.56,"Well, but here it's not just persons; it's organized groups of persons, and it's in a list of things that says partnerships, associations, labor organizations, corporations, and organized groups of persons. I just don't think it's a natural reading to say, what, I belong to the City of Bethesda."
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,340.16,342.76,"Well, so two answers to that, Your Honor."
2018.17-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,374.8,407.8,"Counselor, even if it's true in those cases, what's different from those cases and this one is that the original statute made clear that that definition was not going to include states or federal government. So given the sort of private nature of most of the listing and the fact that the statute on its face says it -- no matter what you do, it's not states or government, I would read it in its natural form, and I wouldn't include it unless I'm told to include it otherwise."
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,407.8,410.56,"Your Honor, I beg to differ with how the statute is structured."
2018.17-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,448.8,453.76,"No, it makes no sense to subtract them unless you never intended to include them."
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,453.76,458.08,"Your Honor, that's -- that is certainly not the way this Court has read it."
2018.17-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,461.04,466.0,"You assume an ambiguity, that the statute can be read in two ways."
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,476.4,480.8,"That is correct, Your Honor, but let me put it a slightly different way."
2018.17-587,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,511.2,523.12,"Mr. Rosenkranz, if -- if we disagree with you about the meaning of ""also,"" do you have any other argument available to you, or is that the end of the case? If we -- if we adopt the normal meaning of ""also,"" meaning in addition to, do you lose?"
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,523.12,542.12,"No, Your Honor, but -- but let me just make sure, first, this Court has routinely adopted statutory constructions that defy the best dictionary definition."
2018.17-587,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,542.12,543.2,That wasn't my question.
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,556.52,558.72,"So I think we have another argument, Your Honor."
2018.17-587,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,571.92,573.56,You use those words a lot.
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,600.28,603.08,"Well, Your Honor, let me tell you what the absurd result is."
2018.17-587,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,630.44,630.84,"Well, but that's --"
2018.17-587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,630.84,642.68,"How likely is it that anyone would sue an employee rather than the employer? I mean, Sue an employee, doesn't have much in her pocket."
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,649.92,651.96,"Your Honor, I -- I disagree with you."
2018.17-587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,666.48,672.76,Is it disastrous -- you said under Title VII employees can be sued. Is it disastrous under Title VII?
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,672.76,673.76,"No, sorry, Your Honor."
2018.17-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,690.56,696.68,That point was made by the majority of circuits who ruled in your favor.
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,711.48,714.12,"Your Honor, our meaning most certainly does."
2018.17-587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,747.52,759.76,"There's no -- no agent involved in this case, so why should the Court address that language, that the term ""also means"" an agent of such person?"
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,759.76,773.16,"Well, Your Honor, for the simple meaning that everyone has agreed, and the Respondents have conceded in their brief at page 32, that the phrase ""also means"" has to carry the same meaning with respect to both clauses."
2018.17-587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,780.72,780.96,"Well, I --"
2018.17-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,780.96,781.68,Mr. Rosenkranz --
2018.17-587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,781.68,810.56,"But I think you get -- your argument comes back and bites you, I think, because you just said they have to be treated the same, 1 and 2. Your theory with respect to 2, a state or political subdivision, is that it's already included in the first part of the statute. So that would seem to be an argument you have to make with respect to 1, the agent, that the agent of such a person is already included in the first part. So I don't see how your argument answers the problem that you use to undermine the other side's argument."
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,810.56,819.96,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, it does for the following reason. What does the ""also means"" clause do? It's an avoidance of doubt clause."
2018.17-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,883.32,896.6,"Mr. Rosenkranz, in the term ""also means"" in that sentence, you agree, don't you, that the term is the same term as in the first sentence? In other words, the term is employer, is that correct?"
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,896.6,897.6,The term is?
2018.17-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,897.6,902.04,"Employer, the term employer also means? I mean, here are your two choices --"
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,902.04,903.16,"Yes, the antecedent --"
2018.17-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,903.16,907.64,-- the term employer or the term person.
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,907.64,910.16,I'm sorry? If you could just --
2018.17-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,910.16,912.8,What is the term in the second sentence? Is it an employer?
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,912.8,913.04,Oh.
2018.17-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,915.72,916.2,Okay.
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,946.4,952.52,"No, Your Honor, no. What we are doing is referring back to employer."
2018.17-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,979.32,989.32,"But the clarifying with respect to the subdivisions would not be necessary, except for the fact that there's doubt in the person definition."
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,997.12,999.32,"That is one of the sources of the doubt, yes."
2018.17-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,999.32,1003.72,"I don't -- I don't -- what is the other source of the doubt? It's all the source of the doubt, isn't it?"
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1003.72,1009.76,"Well, no, because there are other -- there are other statutory problems that get created completely apart from that."
2018.17-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1010.68,1034.24,"No, I understand that you say that there are anomalies if done in a different way, but the doubt arises from the ambiguity of the term ""person."" So that's why I'm suggesting that it would be a strange way to resolve that doubt, instead of to just say, by the way, a person includes a subdivision, instead of saying that, to say the term ""employer"" also means a subdivision."
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1034.24,1035.2,"Understood, Your Honor."
2018.17-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1109.08,1128.2,"And you ask -- tell me, if a -- a company, the XYZ Company, has 50 employees and one day they think: I have an idea, what we'll do is we'll set up five subsidiaries and they will hire the employees. Each will hire 10."
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1135.8,1136.84,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2018.17-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1137.24,1137.6,How?
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1137.6,1140.8,XYZ is liable for the acts of their agents.
2018.17-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1143.52,1144.28,But wait.
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1151.12,1152.24,"Your Honor, so you've said --"
2018.17-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1152.24,1168.84,"I said the XYZ Corporation sets up five subsidiaries, each of which has 10 employees, and it's an agent, so, I mean, were they -- yes, it's an agent of -- the XYZ Corporation tells them what to do."
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1168.84,1169.52,"Well, Your Honor --"
2018.17-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1169.52,1173.64,XYZ Corporation has no employees; it just has five subsidiaries.
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1173.64,1173.92,Okay.
2018.17-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1179.12,1182.44,Why? They each have 10 employees.
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1182.44,1183.4,"Oh, I see what you're saying."
2018.17-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1183.4,1183.68,Yeah.
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1183.68,1198.84,"So -- so what -- so what this Court -- I would say Manhart kind of addresses that question, that you cannot avoid liability by turning yourself into subsidiaries who are all your agents."
2018.17-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1198.84,1200.36,Where -- where does it say that?
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1200.36,1201.2,Where does Manhart say it?
2018.17-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1201.2,1201.72,Yeah.
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1224.32,1224.52,"Well, we are going --"
2018.17-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1224.52,1228.52,They don't want you to set up 100 subsidiaries each with one employee and get out of the statute.
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1228.52,1229.8,So -- so let's just be clear --
2018.17-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1229.8,1230.68,Is it possible?
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1230.68,1236.08,-- private entities are always covered under this -- under this statute.
2018.17-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1236.08,1237.16,"No, I'm not talking about public --"
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1237.16,1237.48,Right.
2018.17-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1237.48,1242.64,"Private entities, it says, the term employer is a person -- maybe I've just gotten mixed up."
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1272.92,1278.44,"So, Your Honor, all I can say is there's no reason to believe Congress was ever focused on that --"
2018.17-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1278.44,1279.32,On that problem?
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1279.32,1282.68,-- on that scenario. That was never before Congress.
2018.17-587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1506.64,1508.76,"Thank you, counsel."
2018.17-587,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1508.76,1510.16,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2018.17-587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1510.16,1511.28,Mr. Fisher.
2018.17-587,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1511.28,1521.64,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The plain text of the ADEA makes absolutely clear that it covers political subdivisions regardless of size."
2018.17-587,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1572.08,1572.72,One doesn't.
2018.17-587,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1575.96,1579.92,"I -- if you're -- if you're speaking, Justice Sotomayor, of the consumer statute --"
2018.17-587,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1579.92,1580.32,Uh-huh.
2018.17-587,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1580.32,1600.2,"-- that my friend points to, I think it does use it in an additive manner, because that's a statute where it says ""consumer"" means an individual who does certain things or the person's legal representative. And so that itself -- I'm sorry, also means the person's legal representative."
2018.17-587,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1611.92,1613.2,"Well, you don't really --"
2018.17-587,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1613.2,1614.2,-- where it's additive.
2018.17-587,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1614.2,1622.44,You don't really think that what the statute meant is that the legal representative was giving his or her private information.
2018.17-587,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1635.2,1641.24,"I think that's right, Justice Sotomayor, but it's still talking about a different source than the previous part of the statute."
2018.17-587,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1687.64,1699.72,"Could you deal with this last example, the federal -- the employment agency? It -- it is either superfluous or there's a question whether a state employment agency is still covered or not."
2018.17-587,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1699.72,1703.32,"I think, Justice Sotomayor, the latter might be the case."
2018.17-587,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1703.84,1707.08,"Well, it is superfluous under your reading."
2018.17-587,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1707.08,1707.96,The -- the federal agency?
2018.17-587,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1707.96,1708.44,Yes.
2018.17-587,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1708.44,1708.68,Yes.
2018.17-587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1775.12,1801.72,"But if -- if Congress had enacted the -- the ADEA provision and Title VII at the same time, do you think it's plausible that Congress would have said, you know, when it comes to racial discrimination, we're not going to allow a suit against a government entity with fewer than 25 employees, but when it comes to age discrimination, we're going to include every government agency no matter how small?"
2018.17-587,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1801.72,1813.6,"I think absolutely, Justice Alito, and the reason why goes back to Lorillard versus Pons and the other cases where this Court has described the genesis of the So the word the Court has used is that the ADEA is a hybrid."
2018.17-587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1828.8,1830.84,But that's quite -- that's quite abstract.
2018.17-587,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1846.24,1849.64,I think that's not exactly the way Congress would have thought of it.
2018.17-587,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1912.56,1927.28,"Is this, Mr. Fisher, the only federal statute that you're aware of that imposes an obligation on a small political subdivision but not -- does not impose the corresponding obligation on a small private employer?"
2018.17-587,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1927.28,1928.36,No.
2018.17-587,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1998.44,2004.52,How are -- how are those state statutes raised in comparison to this statute?
2018.17-587,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2004.52,2008.28,"I didn't hear the beginning, Justice Ginsburg."
2018.17-587,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2008.28,2031.32,"The state statutes, you -- you say that most states include political subdivisions without regard to size. And do we have language in what -- the language that most states use? Is it similar to the language that's used in -- in the ADEA or --"
2018.17-587,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2031.32,2036.88,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, these citations are all collected in Footnote 6 on page 29 of our brief."
2018.17-587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2184.92,2214.12,"Would you say something about what your argument means for the ""agent"" clause? If Congress wrote ""also means"" and didn't put ""includes,"" had it written the term ""employer includes any agent of such a person,"" I take it that one could not be an agent without having 25 employees. But what -- where does your understanding of this sentence take us with respect to agents?"
2018.17-587,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2214.12,2227.56,"Justice Alito, let me answer that question, if I may, in two steps. I want to first start with my point of agreement with the other side, which is we agree that the key question is whether ""also means"" adds something even with respect to the agent clause."
2018.17-587,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2266.52,2267.32,But how --
2018.17-587,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2267.32,2289.96,"Where do I look on that? Because I was bothered exactly by the same thing that Justice Alito said, that if we're not going to have numbers with B, we're not going to have numbers with A. And I think your colleague says, well, they didn't want -- they wanted numbers -- all that A does is just make sure it's principles of agency and he cites Burlington."
2018.17-587,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2289.96,2290.52,Uh-huh.
2018.17-587,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2290.52,2300.56,"So where would I look to see, no, they had another idea? They wanted some agents covered who had fewer than 20 or 25 employees?"
2018.17-587,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2300.56,2305.36,"Well, Justice Breyer, I don't think you'll find a sentence to that effect in the legislative history, but let me -- let me make --"
2018.17-587,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2305.36,2305.64,Yeah.
2018.17-587,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2305.64,2320.2,"-- clear on one thing, which is the 20 -- the 20 employee thing is just the very beginning of their problems. The much bigger problem is an agent of any size would not be covered but for that clause that would not be under respondeat superior principles."
2018.17-587,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2365.04,2382.48,"But I guess I wonder, Mr. Fisher, how your reading of the agent clause allows us to make this distinction that both you suggest and the solicitor general suggests between entities and individuals? I mean, it says any agent of such a person, and it doesn't on its face make any such distinction."
2018.17-587,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2386.08,2396.76,"So I think there's two questions you would ask if you had a case dealing with the ""agent"" clause, Justice Kagan. I think this is responsive to Justice Alito as well. The first question you'd ask is whether any agent includes employees."
2018.17-587,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2502.96,2511.92,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bond."
2018.17-587,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2511.92,2521.12,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Age Act expressly covers state and political subdivision employers regardless of their size."
2018.17-587,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2719.6,2741.6,"Well, if we -- if we follow the same plain text theory of interpretation that you advocate with respect to the provision concerning political subdivisions, wouldn't that lead us to the conclusion that an agent of an employer includes the employer's employees? Aren't they agents of the employer?"
2018.17-587,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2741.6,2744.28,"So, Your Honor, again, you don't have to address that here, but no --"
2018.17-587,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2744.28,2754.44,"I know we don't have to address it, but we have to have a theory, an understanding of the statute that makes sense, and you just made an argument based on the ""agent"" clause --"
2018.17-587,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2754.44,2755.52,Sure.
2018.17-587,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2755.52,2756.68,-- did you not?
2018.17-587,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2756.68,2757.16,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-587,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2757.16,2757.48,Okay.
2018.17-587,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2757.48,2803.92,"And the answer to your question is we don't think that it would reach individual liability for the -- because of the two additional questions that Respondents' counsel just identified. And just to -- to highlight those a little bit more, in the meaning of ""agent,"" not only did Congress have no reason to use ""agent"" in its broadest sense, because employees would already trigger respondeat superior liability. In this statute, Congress didn't use language that it has used in other statutes like the FLSA that lower courts and the Department of Labor have read to include individual liability. So if I can point you to one example. The FLSA, Section 203(d) at page 1-A of the appendix to our brief says that an employer includes any person who acts directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer with respect to an employee. The FMLA, the Family Medical Leave Act, uses the same language."
2018.17-587,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2889.12,2908.4,"Well, is that true, Mr. Bond? Because, on -- on Petitioner's theory, which is to say that this is just a reference to respondeat superior liability and basically says that the employer shall have such liability for any agent, wouldn't that include these corporate shells that you're talking about?"
2018.17-587,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2908.4,2909.64,"So a few points on that, Your Honor."
2018.17-587,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2931.44,2934.28,"Independent contractors, is that what you meant? Or --"
2018.17-587,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2934.28,2938.44,"Well, independent agents, so agents that are not employees, non-employee agents, which can include --"
2018.17-587,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2938.44,2939.12,But even in the face --
2018.17-587,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2939.12,2940.08,-- independent contractors.
2018.17-587,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2940.08,2943.84,-- of statutory language that says the agent of such a person?
2018.17-587,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2943.84,2944.12,So --
2018.17-587,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2944.12,2948.6,"I -- I mean, these corporate shells are acting as the agent of such a person."
2018.17-587,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2948.6,2949.84,So let's distinguish two things.
2018.17-587,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2993.72,2998.0,"Well, I'm not -- I'm not sure what's so bad about direct agent liability."
2018.17-587,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,3021.48,3024.44,So we agree that it's not so anomalous as Petitioner suggests.
2018.17-587,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3063.56,3066.64,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rosenkranz, five minutes."
2018.17-587,3,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3066.64,3067.64,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2018.17-587,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3315.88,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
