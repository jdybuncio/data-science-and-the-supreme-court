1961.598,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,35.604,"In the next case, Number 430, counsel apparently been delayed by a late train and they're not yet here so we will go to Number 598, Drake Bakeries, Incorporated, Petitioner, versus Local 50, American Bakery and Confectionary Workers International, AFL-CIO, et al."
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,40.067,43.555,May it please the Court.
1961.598,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,329.308,329.959,If I had the practical --
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,329.959,330.633,The court --
1961.598,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,330.633,338.238,"-- effect I gather of -- nothing stand the District Court's judgment, did it?"
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,338.238,344.77,"Well, that seemed to be a question because the six active judges then took a vote on that."
1961.598,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,365.935,371.6,"So we have and like, we do have a majority vote that what comes to us is the judgment of the District Court."
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,371.6,373.055,That is correct.
1961.598,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,426.025,427.035,Although I gather --
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,427.035,427.501,-- it assumed.
1961.598,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,427.501,434.282,"-- your position -- at least, he didn't say you could rescind the contract by reason of their failure to resort for the (Inaudible)"
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,434.282,438.919,"Well, haven't taken any position with regard to rescission of the contract."
1961.598,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,438.95,441.5,"Well, you do take the position you're entitled to damages --"
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,441.5,442.261,We do take that position.
1961.598,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,442.261,443.865,-- would breach the no-strike clause.
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,443.865,449.71,"Under 301 (a), yes, sir."
1961.598,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,449.71,449.813,(Voice Overlap) --
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,451.118,454.603,By virtue of Section 301 (a).
1961.598,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,454.603,455.635,And the provisions of the contract.
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,455.635,462.653,"And the provisions of the contract, which I will refer to in further detail a little later in my argument."
1961.598,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,462.653,472.394,"You think -- you also take the position that even if the arbitration clause covers arbitrating the breach of the no-strike clauses, its view from doing it because it was (Inaudible)?"
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,472.394,474.798,I think that would be so too.
1961.598,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,475.695,477.812,What does the (Inaudible) mean here?
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,477.812,492.457,"Actually, we haven't reached that because I -- as -- as we say, the arbitration clause by the very wording, excuses the arbitration of a breach of this kind --"
1961.598,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,492.457,492.691,But that is --
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,492.691,493.508,-- of courts.
1961.598,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,493.508,495.147,-- that is breach of the no-strike --
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,495.147,495.503,Breach of the no-strike.
1961.598,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,495.503,498.293,"-- but then it is not itself an arbitrable question, is that it?"
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,498.293,499.008,Sir?
1961.598,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,499.008,500.226,Is not arbitrable?
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,500.226,500.357,It is not arbitrable.
1961.598,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,500.357,502.257,Under the arbitration?
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,502.257,510.212,"But aside from the -- the point that just have been made, the courts themselves had taken the position."
1961.598,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,534.464,539.633,"Well, this isn't to say that the parties couldn't say expressly in so many words as they did."
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,539.633,540.556,I agree with you.
1961.598,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,558.358,562.69,"Well, wasn't the breach also the arbitration clauses (Inaudible)"
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,562.69,563.565,Both.
1961.598,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,569.506,584.568,"Would you say that the (Inaudible) reach the arbitration clause, the (Inaudible) that even if the -- even if the breach (Inaudible) clauses covers the -- the arbitration completely?"
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,584.568,594.405,We would have a right to sue under 301 (a) and I would find support for that in the decisions of some of the other Circuits.
1961.598,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1041.508,1051.475,"But in that case as I remember, the Court construed that collective bargaining agreement to provide for compulsory terminal arbitration."
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,1061.573,1062.171,That's right.
1961.598,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1079.495,1090.119,"So that in this case, a good argument could be made at least that the strike was or at least have better or different argument could be made than -- then was available in Lucas Flour --"
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,1090.119,1090.695,In Lucas --
1961.598,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1090.695,1093.764,-- to say that a strike was not in violation of the collective bargaining agreement.
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,1093.764,1094.433,(Voice Overlap) --
1961.598,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1094.433,1097.581,But that I take it would go to the merits of your lawsuit in the District Court --
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,1097.581,1097.819,That is right.
1961.598,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1097.819,1098.422,-- that's not before us.
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,1098.422,1103.996,Don't forget that in Drake we have both a no-strike clause and an arbitration clause.
1961.598,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1108.468,1109.961,But it was compulsory and binding.
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,1109.961,1114.382,"But it was according to the majority opinion, compulsory and binding."
1961.598,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1114.382,1115.862,Yes and as so construed.
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,1115.862,1117.313,That's right.
1961.598,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1283.145,1292.099,Would you mind repeating the percentage of arbitration and no-strike agreements that there in existence?
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,1292.099,1319.15,I have it -- I have it in my brief exactly and according -- according to a report of the Bureau of National Affairs that appears on page 16 of my brief which they say that 99% of the contracts studied by the Bureau of National Affairs contains some grievance procedure.
1961.598,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1350.452,1350.707,Yes.
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,1350.707,1353.487,"-- question, Mr. Chief Justice?"
1961.598,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1489.422,1490.452,Would the --
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,1490.452,1490.616,Excuse me?
1961.598,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1490.616,1507.142,"As you construe this agreement, would you think that the arbitrator would have power to -- if he thought you were right and the union was wrong that -- to award damages?"
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,1507.142,1509.316,I -- I would so construe it.
1961.598,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1525.353,1528.124,I mean under labor collective bargaining agreements.
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,1528.124,1528.646,"Yes, sir."
1961.598,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1528.646,1529.933,Are those cited in the briefs?
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,1529.933,1533.551,They are cited in -- in Mr. Meyer's briefs.
1961.598,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1614.135,1614.447,But we -- we --
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,1614.447,1616.486,-- I agree that they have the right --
1961.598,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1616.486,1618.327,We can't decide that case here.
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,1618.327,1631.985,"No, no, but I -- while I agree that the union was wrong there, our own experience in -- with this union under this contract has -- has soured us, if I may use that expression on --"
1961.598,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1631.985,1635.596,"I would think -- think that would be an irrelevancy here, too, wouldn't it?"
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,1635.596,1641.145,It is -- it is an irrelevancy but I thought I -- I was trying to answer your question.
1961.598,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1641.145,1643.839,Has the -- had the New York courts gone into this question of the --
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,1643.839,1645.843,"Yes, they had."
1961.598,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1649.523,1650.161,Yes.
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,1650.161,1663.684,"Yes, they have and as the Court of Appeals' decision that they do have the right to award damages but our point being that we don't have to go to arbitration because we have not agreed to go to arbitration."
1961.598,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1911.65,1914.505,"Well, your time has expired now, Mr. --"
1961.598,0,38577,robert_abelow,,1914.505,1917.128,"We would be procuring industrial (Voice Overlap) -- thank you, sir."
1961.598,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1917.128,1919.471,Mr. Meyer.
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,1919.471,1922.201,May it please the Court.
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1967.641,1970.737,"And your strike was clearly in violation of this agreement, is that correct?"
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,1970.737,1971.626,"It was not, sir."
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2018.802,2025.433,But that would be a question for the District Court if the District Court has jurisdiction or for the arbitrator if -- if you're correct.
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2025.433,2025.941,"Well, the arbitrator if --"
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2025.941,2026.658,In any event after the -- after the --
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2026.658,2027.676,-- if I'm correct.
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2027.863,2028.588,That's under the --
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2028.588,2029.062,That's right but --
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2029.062,2033.015,The person who's got to decide the terms and merits of this controversy.
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2033.015,2054.908,"Another broad statement which Mr. Abelow made about the Circuit Court cases involving cognate or related questions is that many cases have held that where there is a strike in violation of the arbitration clause, the company may sue, with the implications that irrespective of the threat of the arbitration clause, it has been so held."
1961.598,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2374.534,2376.557,"Well, did Christmas come on Friday?"
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2376.557,2378.981,But Christmas came on Friday that year.
1961.598,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2381.233,2382.861,"Oh, yes, oh yes, I see."
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2382.861,2399.155,And Mr. Abelow has carefully omitted from his oral argument the fact that there were two controversies which arose simultaneously and through the efforts of the union who was in constant negotiation from the day that we got the notice of the schedule change.
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2418.256,2423.691,"How about the day before Thursday which the company wanted to give them off, did they take that off or did they come in?"
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2423.691,2425.881,I don't recall whether there's anything in the record on it.
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2431.33,2432.536,So they had their five-day week.
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2432.995,2433.167,"Well, the question wasn't the five --"
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2433.167,2434.404,-- they didn't have that three-day weekend.
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2434.404,2434.763,That's right.
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2439.41,2441.809,But the company gave them off -- gave them a day off in the Thursday --
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2441.809,2442.263,We --
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2442.263,2442.314,-- before Christmas (Voice Overlap) --
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2442.314,2450.213,We are not claiming that the company was depriving them of anything except one thing and that is three consecutive days.
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2450.213,2451.965,"Now, this then was a grievance, I suppose, under --"
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2451.965,2452.052,And --
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2452.052,2452.652,-- collective bargaining agreement.
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2452.652,2454.264,-- this then was a grievance.
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2454.264,2454.446,And did the --
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2454.446,2454.551,That's right.
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2454.551,2459.835,Did the -- did the union or the company make every -- any effort at all to proceed under the contract without --
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2459.835,2460.079,We --
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2460.079,2460.845,-- that grievance?
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2460.845,2463.505,We sent them a notice demanding arbitration.
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2468.016,2469.738,"Well, arbitration under the contract that comes --"
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2469.738,2470.091,Our operation --
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2470.091,2472.961,"-- it comes only at the end of -- of a grievance, the prosecuted grievance."
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2472.961,2474.083,"Well, that's right."
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2480.733,2481.845,I know.
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2481.845,2499.295,"A grievance comes up but while the grievance is pending, while we dispute their right to do this, we're sitting down talking to them, as this record will eloquently state even in the affidavit in opposition to our motion for a stay, trying to work out some compromised arrangement."
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2578.004,2591.584,Not -- what I'm really trying to get out was that the union's position that this decision of the company that the employees had to work on Friday was a violation of the collective bargaining agreement or was not because --
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2591.584,2591.921,We --
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2591.921,2595.327,-- decided one point that -- just let me explain to you my doubt and my uncertainty --
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2595.327,2596.212,Right.
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2596.212,2606.602,"-- that I understand this, one point or more than once, you told us that the union prevailed upon the employees to work on the Friday after Christmas, at least 80 out of 174 of them."
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2606.602,2609.091,"Right, right, right."
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2609.091,2615.177,"And at the same time, you told us that the union has taken the position that they had no duty to work on the Friday."
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2615.177,2626.827,"That's right and it was precisely because of that as you will find in the record, that we filed immediately and the record does show, we filed a grievance demanding arbitration of the rate of pay for working on that Saturday --"
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2626.827,2627.418,"Well, that would be of course a (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2627.418,2631.144,-- because it was unprinted -- precedented circumstances in which to work.
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2631.144,2642.019,"The pay rate, I suppose, would be -- if you were negotiating at that level, this -- this implies a concession that there -- that it's not a violation of the agreement that they were concerned."
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2642.019,2642.652,Not at all.
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2642.652,2642.85,Right.
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2642.85,2643.993,What were we to do?

1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2671.587,2672.108,Right.
1961.598,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2872.755,2877.997,"You mean that, specifically, it maybe that this is act or conduct."
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2877.997,2878.947,Exactly.
1961.598,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2883.704,2885.285,Parties have agreed?
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2885.285,2885.748,That's right.

1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2885.96,2890.351,And let me -- let me say this one -- one more point which I should mention in this connection.
1961.598,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2960.375,2972.203,"May I ask you, Mr. Meyer, suppose in fact the -- these employees and through the union spokesman had said, ""Alright, we're going on a strike tomorrow morning on the 2nd."""

1961.598,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2981.844,2983.431,-- arbitrable (Inaudible)?
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2983.431,2985.542,I don't mean to be facetious.
1961.598,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2997.684,2998.134,Yes.
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,2998.134,3010.722,I would still say that on the wording of the Drake contract that we would be entitled to refer to arbitration because that's what we bargained for.
1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3146.918,3154.433,"Well now, these are -- that's interesting and perhaps persuasive -- arguably persuasive as a matter of policy."

1961.598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3187.171,3189.042,-- except to the enforcement of arbitrational orders.
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,3189.042,3193.483,"If Your Honor please, I'm here invoking that of jurisdiction."
1961.598,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3424.003,3435.534,"May I -- I understand this, Mr. Meyer, are you telling us that we should treat your notice of motion at page 5 of the record which is only a motion to stay as I read it?"
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,3447.433,3451.408,That is so stated on page 29 of the record in the moving affidavit.
1961.598,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3590.045,3592.451,"Mr. Meyer, ordinarily, am I correct?"

1961.598,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3626.817,3628.642,-- that kind of situation?
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,3628.642,3633.939,"Usually, the cases are presented in the form or guise of a motion for stay."
1961.598,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3649.54,3662.012,"Well, does anything occur to you that was -- there should be a distinction under 301 whether the one invoking specific performance under that is the one aggrieved or the one that gets to whom the contention is being (Voice Overlap)."
1961.598,1,27653,howard_n_meyer,,3662.012,3665.746,I don't think either of us have considered or briefed that question.
