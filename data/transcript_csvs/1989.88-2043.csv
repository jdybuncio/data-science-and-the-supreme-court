1989.88-2043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.397,"We'll hear argument next in 88-2043, Gerald Baliles v. Virginia Hospital Association."
1989.88-2043,0,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,28.519,32.122,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-2043,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,166.055,174.272,"Ms. Guthrie, do you think that the legislation, as it was written before the Boren Amendment, provided a private cause of action?"
1989.88-2043,0,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,174.272,180.129,"I think, Justice O'Connor, there's a much better argument that could be made there, but we would not concede that point."
1989.88-2043,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,318.31,325.056,"But what about a Federal right to a good-faith determination by the state, and to a good-faith assurance?"
1989.88-2043,0,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,328.628,346.811,"Your Honor, we would argue that in fact the finding... the findings and assurances language requires that the Commonwealth be accountable in making assurances to the Secretary, and certainly the presumption of regularity of administrative and state action would obtain."
1989.88-2043,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,355.107,363.244,"I'm sure you would, but let's assume a state doesn't, and there's all sorts of evidence that this is all tricked up and it's as phony as can be."
1989.88-2043,0,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,363.244,384.627,"Well, I think that what I would hear in that particular question and would submit is the proper argument in that particular case is that what the state has done is arbitrary and capricious, and that might, in fact, state some sort of constitutional plane that possibly could be enforced under Section 1983."
1989.88-2043,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,392.383,408.722,Could you sue the Secretary under the APA if he accepted those assurances when the assurances were obviously insubstantial?
1989.88-2043,0,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,408.722,429.618,"We... we think that there's an argument that could be made that the Administrative Procedure Act would permit someone to sue the Secretary for not living up to his obligations, but we do not believe that argument is persuasive in this case because of the nature of the right arguably created, which is one to findings and assurances."
1989.88-2043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,697.7,705.076,What if a... the state just doesn't set up any standards at all for reimbursement?
1989.88-2043,0,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,705.076,708.347,That's not this case.
1989.88-2043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,726.121,732.143,"Well, I suppose if they didn't have a set of standards they wouldn't have presented anything to the Secretary, would they?"
1989.88-2043,0,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,732.143,734.125,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-2043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,734.125,745.723,"I take it you suggested that if neither the state nor the Secretary was doing its job, somebody could complain in court?"
1989.88-2043,0,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,745.723,756.659,"If the state was not doing its job, if we did not submit satisfactory assurances, if we've made no payments, for example, the Secretary--"
1989.88-2043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,756.659,758.182,So what... who can sue whom for what?
1989.88-2043,0,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,758.182,766.96,"--Well, the Secretary certainly in the first instance can refuse to approve our state plan, can withdraw his approval and can refuse to provide Federal participation--"
1989.88-2043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,766.96,767.951,Can somebody sue?
1989.88-2043,0,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,767.951,769.503,--Yes.
1989.88-2043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,772.916,774.458,Can somebody sue the state?
1989.88-2043,0,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,774.458,783.494,"--If our actions were wholly arbitrary and capricious, I think that we would acknowledge that there would be a constitutional claim to which a 1983 action might attach."
1989.88-2043,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,783.494,783.815,Why?
1989.88-2043,0,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,805.652,806.113,"Well, I think--"
1989.88-2043,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,806.113,809.826,"--And if the Secretary doesn't do the job, then the hospitals can sue him?"
1989.88-2043,0,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,809.826,813.569,--I think that that's certainly a reasonable interpretation.
1989.88-2043,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,832.823,833.354,I see.
1989.88-2043,0,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,833.354,840.479,"--derived from this Federal-state cooperative program that might be independently attacked, you know, as arbitrary and capricious."
1989.88-2043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,840.479,840.76,I understand.
1989.88-2043,0,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,860.386,877.178,"In that circumstance, this statute is one that clearly sets up a scheme that contemplates that the states will be accountable and the Secretary will be charged principally with assuring that the states follow the mandate of Congress."
1989.88-2043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,891.216,895.76,"Well, does the state have a procedure whereby a provider can say look, you aren't paying me enough?"
1989.88-2043,0,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,895.76,896.16,Yes.
1989.88-2043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,896.951,900.654,So the... and is that reviewable in a state court?
1989.88-2043,0,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,900.654,900.904,--Yes.
1989.88-2043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,906.31,907.529,"Very well, Miss Guthrie."
1989.88-2043,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,910.351,914.815,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-2043,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,962.799,968.971,"Mr. Roberts, can I just interrupt to ask you the same question that Justice O'Connor asked earlier of your colleague?"
1989.88-2043,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,975.756,977.278,"I think there may well have been, Your Honor."
1989.88-2043,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,987.296,988.347,"Why, I... I understand that."
1989.88-2043,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,996.465,999.868,"Well, I think it's different than in the implied right-of-action cases."
1989.88-2043,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1036.728,1044.595,Is there some kind of right of action to require the state to include reimbursement provisions in the plan?
1989.88-2043,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1044.595,1051.6,--The statute requires that the state plan have a provision for payment of rates.
1989.88-2043,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1051.6,1056.061,Is there... is there a cause of action to require at least that much?
1989.88-2043,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1056.061,1067.198,"There may well be, if the allegation in the complaint is that the state plan... the state has not made findings that its rates meet this standard, or that the state has not given assurances to the Secretary at all."
1989.88-2043,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1070.812,1075.997,Is there a requirement that the state act rationally in making those findings?
1989.88-2043,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1078.35,1081.683,"I think not, Your Honor."
1989.88-2043,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1106.542,1118.39,"Mr. Roberts, I must say I don't see that line, that you say it's all in the hands of the Secretary and sue him if you have any problems, unless there hasn't been any filing at all."
1989.88-2043,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1128.848,1133.402,"In the first place, Your Honor, I didn't mean to suggest that you should sue the Secretary."
1989.88-2043,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1142.338,1144.911,"Also, the Secretary could... it doesn't matter what the Secretary approves."
1989.88-2043,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1156.1,1159.953,"I think that's right, Your Honor, and I don't think that's an absurd conclusion."
1989.88-2043,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1200.185,1205.2,"No, they just want to haul the Secretary in to be sure that he's doing the job he's supposed to under the statute."
1989.88-2043,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1216.148,1216.859,Because--
1989.88-2043,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1216.859,1218.239,--polar position on this.
1989.88-2043,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1218.239,1231.399,"--Well, in the first place, of course, that question is not presented here, but in the second place, the statutory standard, assurances satisfactory to the Secretary, is one that by its very terms commits that decision to agency discretion."
1989.88-2043,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1235.212,1236.971,"In any case, it's not involved here."
1989.88-2043,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1252.353,1255.897,"--My point is that they do get something, and they get it in two different places."
1989.88-2043,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1299.573,1305.129,It would be an objective fact if somebody brings a suit saying the Secretary is not even looking at these things.
1989.88-2043,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1311.273,1326.153,"Even if you get over that hurdle, Your Honor, the only requirement... that's... that goes to the standard against which the state must make its findings and assurances, but the only mandate in the statute is that findings be made, assurances be given and the Secretary's approval obtained."
1989.88-2043,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1404.018,1406.019,"Well, that isn't quite that absurd, is it?"
1989.88-2043,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1414.125,1418.62,"Well, I think it's unclear what the standard of review would be in court."
1989.88-2043,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1422.283,1429.449,"Well, they allege in this case that somebody who has 95 percent of the hospitals get less than the... their costs out of this, and they say... and that ergo, it's arbitrary."
1989.88-2043,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1431.239,1433.622,"--Well, I think it is, although I don't think it follows."
1989.88-2043,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1471.661,1475.364,And the state can reasonably find that 95 percent of the hospitals in Virginia are inefficient.
1989.88-2043,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1477.236,1482.862,The purpose of the Boren Amendment was to give the states the flexibility to set the rates that must be incurred to provide services.
1989.88-2043,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1493.548,1495.281,"Thank you, Mr. Roberts."
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1496.871,1500.854,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-2043,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1564.63,1572.314,"But they were suing... that was a right to a quite different substance than the right we are talking about here, wasn't it?"
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1572.314,1573.446,--Not at all.
1989.88-2043,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1648.813,1652.727,"This Court never held there was a cause of action under the previous statute, did it?"
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1652.727,1663.466,"This Court never had occasion to hold that there was a cause of action under the previous statute, but the sense of Congress on that point could not be clearer."
1989.88-2043,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1680.481,1684.675,Do you think that was a... the cause of action given by the act?
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1684.675,1686.157,Absolutely.
1989.88-2043,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1686.157,1688.918,Or do you have to get to 1983 or something?
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1688.918,1697.984,"Well, the secured right comes from the Medicaid Act, the cause of action under 1983."
1989.88-2043,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1856.166,1863.442,"Well, Mr. Dellinger, exactly what is the obligation you think the current language imposes on the state?"
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1863.442,1873.386,--The obligation that the current language imposes on the state is to come up with a plan that is not arbitrary and capricious.
1989.88-2043,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1876.619,1883.874,So if there is a cause of action it's only to assure that the action of the state is not arbitrary and capricious?
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1883.874,1887.197,That has not been finally settled in the lower courts that have heard this so far.
1989.88-2043,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1896.967,1906.634,"Well, certainly Congress apparently intended to remove from the Secretary the obligation for any detailed enforcement--"
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1906.634,1908.645,"That's correct, and--"
1989.88-2043,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1908.645,1909.506,--of particular standards.
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1909.506,1914.26,"--That's correct, and that is I think essential to what happened in 1980 and '81."
1989.88-2043,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1927.77,1935.276,But you would have us increase the Federal oversight by virtue of having the Federal courts do what the Secretary cannot do?
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1935.276,1936.886,No.
1989.88-2043,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1948.587,1958.263,Do you think there's a private cause of action to achieve results and have Federal oversight through the courts that could not be obtained by the Secretary?
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1958.263,1981.348,"--Yes, and in fact the access to Federal court is... makes more sense once the Secretary's role has been diminished, that is, prior to 1980 and '81 it was more arguable that the Secretary's function, which was then a review and approval function, provided the remedy that was necessary."
1989.88-2043,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1983.12,1986.252,"Well, it's kind of curious as an end result, though."
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1994.64,2000.774,"There's absolutely no evidence of that in the legislative history, of reducing the role of the courts."
1989.88-2043,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2019.928,2022.319,"What's his function now, Mr. Dellinger?"
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2028.086,2037.252,"That is the position of the Department of Justice, that the Secretary... in its brief, the Solicitor General says, at page 5 of its brief,"
1989.88-2043,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2044.615,2047.958,"Well, it's one thing to say they're not required to submit."
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2063.899,2067.011,I think that is largely correct.
1989.88-2043,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2111.754,2127.014,"Mr. Dellinger, supposing you win here, and then the Arlington Hospital goes into court and sues a year from now saying we incurred $10 million in costs, the Virginia people have only reimbursed us for $8 million."
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2131.388,2146.158,"Well, the fact that they had incurred $10 million in cost and the state had only reimbursed them $8 million would by no means suggest that they were entitled to win."
1989.88-2043,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2146.158,2149.56,"So, but what issues... what issues could the Federal court consider?"
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2149.56,2163.812,"I think if you look at the cases that have gone to judgment in the Courts of Appeal, and we have a number now that have been decided, you can see the process that the Federal court... a Federal court can go through."
1989.88-2043,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2187.767,2197.174,"And if the district judge disagrees with... that the plan is reasonable, he doesn't think it is reasonable, he can set it aside?"
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2197.174,2197.815,--Not at all.
1989.88-2043,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2197.815,2199.695,"Well, what does he do?"
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2199.695,2202.837,"Well, I mean if--"
1989.88-2043,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2202.837,2205.649,"He gives them $2 million, doesn't he?"
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2205.649,2211.021,"--No, he... by disagreeing... I think I now understand, you want to know just what the result is."
1989.88-2043,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2217.056,2219.189,And another plan to the Secretary?
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2219.189,2220.608,To come up with... to come up with another plan.
1989.88-2043,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2220.608,2224.121,"The hospital doesn't get any money judgment, then?"
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2224.121,2226.622,"--Not at all, not from the Federal district court."
1989.88-2043,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2260.898,2263.961,What... is that a de novo standard of review?
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2269.646,2271.687,Yes.
1989.88-2043,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2302.17,2303.662,Before you--
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2303.662,2303.923,Yes.
1989.88-2043,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2303.923,2311.009,--Can you think of any other instances where we have Federal courts passing upon the adequacy of state plans?
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2329.051,2336.407,"Well, there have been, I think, in the history of this provision only 42 actions brought."
1989.88-2043,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2455.101,2457.432,It told them to come up with another number?
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2459.804,2464.726,It told them to come up with... some numbers are... you have a theory.
1989.88-2043,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2480.117,2481.348,"Well, what was the order?"
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2481.348,2501.212,"The order was simply, in that case, to hold that the state plan was... failed to meet the... the state was failing to comply with the statutory requirement that it pay providers in accordance with a plan that is reasonable and adequate to meet the costs that must be incurred, and the state was ordered to--"
1989.88-2043,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2501.212,2504.324,"You couldn't get any money out of the state because of the Eleventh Amendment, is that it?"
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2504.324,2505.785,--That's right.
1989.88-2043,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2524.859,2528.282,"In your view, is there an action against the Secretary under the APA?"
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2528.282,2552.608,"If there is an action against the Secretary under the APA, there would be very little for the court to review because the Secretary's role is so limited and the Department of Justice has taken the position, as it did in Illinois Health Care v. Suiter... the Department of Justice moves to dismiss the Secretary whenever the Secretary is sued now."
1989.88-2043,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2552.608,2555.309,"Well, why is the Secretary so limited?"
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2563.056,2563.817,No.
1989.88-2043,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2582.85,2589.065,"But it says that they have to be satisfactory, to... not just that they have to be filed, but that they have to be satisfactory to the Secretary."
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2596.471,2605.738,"One would think that the Secretary would scrutinize these submissions, but it's... there is a critical point here."
1989.88-2043,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2624.959,2643.522,"--Well, isn't there some... I asked your opponent, is there some administrative scheme whereby you can in... take... get review in the state itself, in its administrative processes?"
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2645.295,2646.697,Absolutely not.
1989.88-2043,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2659.388,2661.228,Didn't your adversary suggest--
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2661.228,2661.499,"--No, she--"
1989.88-2043,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2661.499,2664.109,--You don't... you didn't understand her that way?
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2664.109,2678.729,"--The way the dialogue proceeds on this question... I did not understand her to say that, because the dialogue proceeds as follows: we say, since the Secretary is providing no remedy, and in fact the findings... the annual findings do not have to be submitted to the Secretary."
1989.88-2043,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2684.025,2684.165,"Well, is--"
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2684.165,2685.036,--But on the state side--
1989.88-2043,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2685.036,2692.77,"--Is the only way you can argue with the state is to go to court, or can't you argue in their... don't they have some administrative structure?"
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2692.77,2704.968,"--Here's the state's administrative structure, and they do say this: the Federal statute and the regulations say that a state plan has to provide procedures for prepayment and postpayment claims review"
1989.88-2043,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2760.915,2764.368,"So you just can't go in and say, I didn't get enough?"
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2764.368,2764.648,No.
1989.88-2043,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2766.08,2766.421,"Well, can you or not?"
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2766.421,2766.842,--Not at all.
1989.88-2043,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2766.842,2770.034,"Well, what can you say in an administrative--"
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2770.034,2772.615,You can say they've miscalculated your reimbursement.
1989.88-2043,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2780.892,2782.642,"--Say, you didn't multiply right."
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2782.642,2792.719,"--You can go in and say look, you calculated this at 33 percent and we believe that one third means 33-1/3 percent, and the state plan says one-third."
1989.88-2043,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2792.719,2801.956,"Now, is that clear as a bell in this... is it in the... can we tell that that is so in this record, or from any papers that you can read?"
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2801.956,2824.773,"I think if you look at the Solicitor General's brief, at page 2, the Solicitor General... the Solicitor General says at page 2 that we want to bypass the state administrative procedures, but at page 6 the Solicitor General says,"
1989.88-2043,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2836.069,2850.278,"Well, what if, instead of seeking administrative review of those principles, you went into the Circuit Court of Fairfax County and said the statute requires that the state make these findings, that they will be adequate; the state's findings are inadequate?"
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2858.434,2868.881,"Well, the Virginia APA has a provision that grants of state or Federal funds are exempted from the judicial review provisions."
1989.88-2043,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2894.398,2896.929,"This is not a grant of state or Federal funds, is it?"
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2898.05,2903.114,--This involves a grant of state or Federal funds and--
1989.88-2043,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2903.114,2903.624,The grant includes--
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2903.624,2923.919,"--Conceivably the Virginia Supreme Court would decide differently, but it's important to note that once you're closed out of the state administrative appeals process, because it doesn't allow you to challenge the principles of reimbursement, there's nothing in the Federal Medicaid Act that requires state court judicial review."
1989.88-2043,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3154.697,3171.687,"--Is there been an example where you've utilized the state appeals procedure, administrative procedure, and then gone into court and asked the court to review the principles of reimbursement and have been denied?"
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3171.687,3174.96,"--No, Your Honor."
1989.88-2043,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3184.887,3189.63,"Well, you don't know whether you can get relief in the Virginia court."
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3189.63,3195.553,"--We are quite certain that relief is not available in the state appeals process, because--"
1989.88-2043,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3195.553,3197.116,"Well, in the administrative appeal."
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3203.46,3205.42,--You mean go to state court?
1989.88-2043,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3205.42,3205.76,Yes.
1989.88-2043,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3205.76,3214.788,"Well, we can certainly go to state court under Section 1981 as long as the Virginia courts are open, but there does not appear to be any state appeal otherwise."
1989.88-2043,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3214.788,3216.549,"Thank you, Mr. Dellinger."
1989.88-2043,3,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,3219.571,3220.71,Thank you.
1989.88-2043,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3255.485,3257.385,"Now, you're not just going from 36 to 37?"
1989.88-2043,3,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,3257.385,3269.664,"Right, and it goes through several pages, I think and ultimately focuses the attention of the director and the hospitals on showing what the Medicaid program really is all about."
1989.88-2043,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3298.705,3304.178,Isn't there an express provision that you cannot review the principles of reimbursement?
1989.88-2043,3,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,3304.178,3305.348,--There is an express provision--
1989.88-2043,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3305.348,3305.608,Where is that?
1989.88-2043,3,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,3305.608,3311.704,--There is an express provision that states that you can't... you can't review the principles of reimbursement.
1989.88-2043,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3314.055,3320.12,Does that mean that you can't claim... you can't claim and be permitted to show that reimbursement is not reasonable?
1989.88-2043,3,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,3320.12,3329.786,"Not in the administrative process, but Section 32.1-325.1, which is a specific statute that we point out in our reply brief on page 10--"
1989.88-2043,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3329.786,3331.699,Page 10 of the joint appendix?
1989.88-2043,3,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,3331.699,3334.2,"--Of the reply brief, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.88-2043,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3365.763,3370.064,"But... you can't... you can't do it in the administrative process, but you can in the state court, is that--"
1989.88-2043,3,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,3370.064,3375.857,"Correct, because the agency doesn't want to delegate to an individual hearing officer the right to set aside its Medicaid program."
1989.88-2043,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3375.857,3386.135,"--Well, but surely we shouldn't determine what the Federal statute means on the basis that Virginia happens to provide a state procedure?"
1989.88-2043,3,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,3386.135,3387.067,No.
1989.88-2043,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3387.067,3396.321,"I mean, we're trying to interpret the Federal statute, and I guess we have to assume that a state... other states may not have such procedures--"
1989.88-2043,3,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,3396.321,3396.952,That's correct.
1989.88-2043,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3396.952,3397.763,--Whether Virginia does or not.
1989.88-2043,3,39315,r_claire_guthrie,,3397.763,3405.75,"That's correct, and we did not interject this issue in order to say that it... that this Court is required to defer to those state procedures necessarily."
1989.88-2043,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3516.984,3517.324,"Thank you, Miss Guthrie."
