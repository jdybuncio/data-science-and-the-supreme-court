2009.07-11191,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.138,"We'll hear argument next in Case 07-11191, Briscoe v. Virginia."
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,7.042,18.492,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We ask the Court in this case to take no new ground beyond that established just last term in the Melendez-Diaz case, but the stakes of this case are high."
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,36.234,52.866,The State court has interpreted their provision to give the defendant the choice of subpoenaing the witness or asking the State to bring in the witness.
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,57.912,73.607,"Your Honor, the -- the State courts, since the time of this case -- since the time that these cases were tried, raised the possibility of asking the -- that the defendant could ask the witness to bring -- that the defendant could ask the prosecution to bring in the witness."
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,78.731,81.433,"Well, how is that different from a notice statute?"
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,82.26,82.962,Okay.
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,82.962,87.021,--If we take the statute as the State supreme court has read it--
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,87.021,87.427,Right.
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,87.427,97.531,"--they say: In my mind, it's a notice statute; tell the prosecutor you either want them to call the witness or you subpoena the witness."
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,103.65,104.024,That--
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,104.024,105.557,Let's separate out the two questions.
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,105.557,106.072,"--Okay, fine, fine."
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,136.293,137.135,So that's our first question--
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,137.135,137.728,--That's--
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,137.728,142.634,"--Does the Confrontation Clause require, not just the ability to cross-examine--"
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,142.634,144.026,--That's right.
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,144.026,148.1,--but an affirmative obligation to place the witness on the stand?
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,148.1,148.848,That's correct.
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,148.848,149.878,Could I just ask you one--
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,149.878,149.894,Yes.
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,150.05,159.421,"--Would swearing the witness in and saying to the witness ""Is this your report""?"
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,181.769,182.252,Right.
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,196.103,196.634,"No, no, no."
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,198.322,198.728,--No.
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,209.708,218.549,Do you have anything historically or in any case that would suggest that that is a constitutional requirement?
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,223.201,223.763,--Right.
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,223.763,225.37,--to confront the witness.
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,225.37,225.869,Right.
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,225.869,231.742,But what would require the prosecutor to actually do more than I just suggested?
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,236.663,247.784,"Your Honor, so far as I can tell, it's hardly ever been tried, for the obvious reason that if all the prosecution does is say, ""Is this it"", and not ask a further question of the witness--"
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,247.784,248.798,It's not terribly persuasive.
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,249.89,250.031,--Right.
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,250.28,253.653,"It's a matter of trial tactic, but I'm not talking about trial tactic."
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,253.653,253.735,--Yes.
2009.07-11191,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,262.103,262.977,Bear what risk?
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,262.977,263.476,I'm sorry.
2009.07-11191,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,264.74,263.476,Bear what risk?
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,267.189,275.125,Bear -- bear the risk that the -- that the witness has gotten on the stand and is not even asked to recall.
2009.07-11191,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,278.217,278.451,"Well, he says,"
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,280.698,282.652,"""And do you stand by it? """
2009.07-11191,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,288.727,289.039,"Oh, I see."
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,289.32,290.084,But -- but--
2009.07-11191,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,290.084,290.568,Yes.
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,293.786,293.942,"--But -- no, no."
2009.07-11191,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,295.424,295.845,Right.
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,295.845,296.738,--then that's fine.
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,309.291,310.699,"Well, but -- so what difference?"
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,314.539,314.867,"--Well, no."
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,320.194,320.537,And that was a--
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,320.537,321.099,--Yes.
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,321.099,325.003,--Those were found -- I don't -- were those found as violations of the Confrontation Clause?
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,325.003,326.656,Those are found to be violations of the Confrontation Clause.
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,326.937,327.518,Or due process?
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,327.518,328.906,--Confrontation Clause.
2009.07-11191,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,336.655,338.574,It's not clear to me what your answer to these questions is.
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,358.846,362.095,"And there's -- there's the question,"
2009.07-11191,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,373.232,388.039,"What's the difference between that situation and the situation in which the report is -- is admitted, subject to -- and the analyst is available, and the defense can question the analyst if the defense wishes to?"
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,388.039,392.941,"--Well, I think -- I think the difference is that once you ask the question -- ""Do you stand by it""?"
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,403.407,406.437,"On the past recollection recorded, the witness doesn't stand by the statement."
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,412.185,412.497,--That's right.
2009.07-11191,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,434.361,436.845,I don't understand what you just said.
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,437.906,438.374,--Yes.
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,472.44,502.833,"You are asking us now to state something that you admit is in really no constitutional case or historical case, that says the right to confrontation means that the witness has to tell the story, and the form of telling that story has to be a verbal recitation; it can't be past recorded recollection because you just said they have to tell the story."
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,511.564,512.984,"No, I don't believe so."
2009.07-11191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,538.74,541.13,What is the--
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,541.13,542.554,--I'm not asking the Court to go beyond anything that has previously been said.
2009.07-11191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,542.554,544.114,--What is the theory of this?
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,551.674,551.908,Right.
2009.07-11191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,551.908,555.028,--some of which I may recall and others of which I certainly don't.
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,555.203,555.858,Right.
2009.07-11191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,555.858,560.764,"But the -- the Confrontation Clause, I would have thought, would have picked out the heart of that."
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,573.226,574.287,"Well, if--"
2009.07-11191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,574.287,575.067,Bring in the witnesses.
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,585.358,607.056,"--I want to emphasize that the Confrontation Clause is about a lot more -- there were nearly 200 years of history between Walter Raleigh and the Confrontation Clause, and what was established is that in an Anglo-American trial witnesses give their testimony live, face to face, and Melendez-Diaz emphasized last term you can't prove the case via an affidavit."
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,625.452,633.919,"Why -- and -- I trust the trial process, and much of your brief was talking about that process--"
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,633.919,634.137,Right.
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,634.137,645.758,--and the fact that it's much more effective when the witness tells their story and you get a chance to cross-examine than if you have to start from the platform of cross-examination.
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,658.064,658.22,I--
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,658.22,677.227,"And if he does or doesn't, why shouldn't we leave it to the normal trial strategy and practice to leave to that prosecutor the burden of non-persuasion, which is what confrontation was about?"
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,677.227,677.368,--Right.
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,677.539,677.976,Which is--
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,677.976,687.128,"If -- if the prosecutor is certain that the defendant is going to put the witness on the stand, then -- then the prosecutor has some reason to -- to put the witness on first."
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,696.764,699.794,"--Well -- well, I was starting from a different proposition than you did--"
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,699.794,699.919,--Right.
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,700.044,702.808,--because I think that's a question for your adversaries: How could you have known--
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,702.808,703.541,--Right.
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,703.541,708.619,--that you should have asked the State to bring that witness in?
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,711.287,712.116,But--
2009.07-11191,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,712.116,714.522,--assume we are reading it the way the Court has now.
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,714.522,715.1,--Right.
2009.07-11191,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,757.144,769.154,"Mr. Friedman, one of the problems that has been brought up is that this is an inordinate expense, and you're wasting the time of the analyst."
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,799.47,809.171,"That -- that is a -- certainly a possibility, at least on consent of the defendant, and some States, including my own State of Michigan, has been experimenting with that."
2009.07-11191,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,861.833,864.38,How can you say that?
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,870.877,872.378,"Yes, I--"
2009.07-11191,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,872.378,902.069,"They say that there is a very substantial category of cases in which defendants really have no interest whatsoever in contesting either the nature or the quantity of drugs involved, but they will refuse to stipulate to those things simply for the purpose of putting a financial burden on the prosecution, because they know, if they do that, it may be helpful for them in getting a better plea bargain, plus there is a certain risk that the analyst will not show up, and they will get the benefit of that."
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,902.069,916.735,"--So, Your Honor, I think that what the -- the States' amicus brief shows is that there are -- there are a lot of drug prosecutions, and there are a lot of drug analyses, and then there is this speculation about the type of gamesmanship that you have mentioned."
2009.07-11191,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,934.599,939.988,"If this is not a burden on these 26 States plus the District of Columbia, why are they bothering to make this argument?"
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,942.219,943.716,I'm sure not for amusement.
2009.07-11191,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,989.852,992.586,But I assume you've picked the best example for you.
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,996.43,1001.286,"Your Honor, I -- I'm just little old me, and I just picked what I could get."
2009.07-11191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1018.622,1023.154,You could have -- you could have hearsay that is not prepared for testimony.
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1030.149,1030.399,Right.
2009.07-11191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1030.399,1040.615,"--And how often will you say: I understand it's admissible, but I would like as well to call the witness who prepared it."
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1057.683,1060.823,We are talking about non-testimonial hearsay?
2009.07-11191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1060.823,1062.512,"I'm trying to think of something that's hearsay, and--"
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1062.512,1062.87,But--
2009.07-11191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1062.87,1064.824,--and what I'm trying to figure out--
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1064.824,1065.089,--Yes.
2009.07-11191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1065.089,1084.848,"--is will defense attorneys, if they have the right under the Constitution to insist that a lab technician be present, in cases where they happen to know that lab technician has left the job and is married and is reliving in a distant State, say okay, let's call her."
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1094.371,1094.496,Right.
2009.07-11191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1094.496,1102.042,"--but I don't see quite how to deal with it, how much of a problem it is, and the impact on this particular situation."
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1102.042,1106.819,"I -- I don't think it's a significant problem, and I do want to say -- I didn't -- I didn't select data."
2009.07-11191,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1112.083,1117.097,"Mr. Friedman, aren't there States that have been proceeding this way even before we came down with our opinion?"
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1117.097,1118.766,"--Absolutely, absolutely, including my own State."
2009.07-11191,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1118.766,1119.503,And which States are they?
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1119.503,1123.968,"They -- well, they include my own State of Michigan; they include the State of New York--"
2009.07-11191,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1123.968,1125.392,"And they are not under water, are they?"
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1125.392,1133.167,"--The problems of the State of Michigan are not attributable to the use of this procedure, no."
2009.07-11191,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1133.639,1138.432,"Your answer to Justice Breyer has to be, of course, you would insist that the person be called."
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1140.074,1146.431,"It -- it is -- yes, but it's not a significant problem, and one reason it's not a significant problem is that the possibility of a deposition is always--"
2009.07-11191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1146.431,1152.662,"I don't know except anecdotally, but Massachusetts seems to be having huge problems, reported anecdotally, with the--"
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1152.662,1162.188,"--Not -- not according to -- not according to the chief of the -- chief trial counsel, Suffolk -- the Suffolk district attorney's office--"

2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1162.702,1163.124,--Excuse me.
2009.07-11191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1163.124,1164.687,"--The woman, Barbara -- Barbara Rouse?"

2009.07-11191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1172.12,1173.917,"And then there are conflicting reports in the newspapers, but I don't know."

2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1214.449,1218.259,"No, I don't believe you have to call all those people."
2009.07-11191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1218.259,1218.634,Why not?
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1219.086,1219.242,I do believe that there has to be--
2009.07-11191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1219.242,1221.711,--Each of them looked at a special part.
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1222.99,1223.286,--Right.
2009.07-11191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1223.286,1227.708,"--that it was this or that, and in respect to each of those statements, it's this or that."
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1228.582,1229.034,Right.
2009.07-11191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1233.471,1238.326,"No, no, it's no confrontation because in this instance the hearsay prevents the confrontation."
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1238.326,1238.716,--Right.
2009.07-11191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1260.004,1272.092,"Your answer to my question is, if a laboratory is so organized so that six or seven people perform different steps of the operation, if it is organized in that way, all of them must be brought?"
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1272.092,1273.684,I -- I don't believe so.
2009.07-11191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1274.016,1278.388,"You don't believe so, but you gave me an answer saying they did have to, so -- because you said they could organize differently."
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1280.435,1288.492,"--But even if -- even if they are organized in that way, for instance, if one person observes all the -- all the procedures, that's sufficient."
2009.07-11191,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1297.783,1299.644,Suppose one person doesn't observe all the procedures.
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1305.969,1306.487,--Yes.
2009.07-11191,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1314.98,1315.823,"No, no, no."

2009.07-11191,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1355.745,1356.354,I'm sorry.
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1357.04,1357.664,--Orthogonal.
2009.07-11191,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1359.692,1360.004,Oh.
2009.07-11191,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1360.004,1361.552,What was that adjective?
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1362.082,1362.971,Orthogonal.
2009.07-11191,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1362.971,1364.235,Orthogonal?
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1364.235,1365.015,"Right, right."
2009.07-11191,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1365.015,1365.44,Ooh.
2009.07-11191,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1367.686,1369.936,I knew this case presented us a problem.
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1370.123,1372.888,I should have -- I probably should have said--
2009.07-11191,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1372.888,1374.09,I think we should use that in the opinion.
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1374.589,1376.604,--I thought -- I thought I had seen it before.
2009.07-11191,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1376.604,1377.275,Or the dissent.
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1378.102,1381.366,"That's a bit of -- a bit of professorship creeping in, I suppose."
2009.07-11191,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1389.988,1402.108,"But, in your view, it wouldn't satisfy the Confrontation Clause if, say, the supervisor shows up and said that this is -- this is the way the analysts operate and describes the procedures."
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1402.108,1406.417,"--In my view, it wouldn't, but if I'm wrong, it doesn't change this case whatsoever."
2009.07-11191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1417.865,1425.505,"Well, the reason that I ask is because floating in the back of my mind is -- is if -- (a) does the Confrontation Clause apply?"
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1425.505,1426.488,--Right.
2009.07-11191,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1426.488,1440.059,"And if the answer to (a) is yes, then are there different kinds of implementation rules in different areas where there are other signs of security, where there are other reasons for thinking it's not bad testimony?"
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1446.87,1447.119,Yes.
2009.07-11191,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1479.857,1481.214,"Well, does that square with where we started out?"
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1505.893,1506.283,Right.
2009.07-11191,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1506.283,1508.533,--But the defense can then cross-examine the analyst.
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1508.533,1509.672,I wouldn't call that cross-exam--
2009.07-11191,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1509.672,1512.141,There's such a slight difference between those two situations.
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1517.14,1523.246,"--It's fundamental transformation because the prosecution can present a stack of affidavits, and they wouldn't even have to be affidavits."
2009.07-11191,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1534.535,1534.773,No.
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1553.109,1556.124,--I think there's an enormous difference in -- in impact.
2009.07-11191,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1586.574,1586.98,"Thank you, Mr. Friedman."
2009.07-11191,0,39224,richard_d_friedman,,1586.98,1595.536,Thank you.
2009.07-11191,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1595.536,1596.815,Mr. McCullough.
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,1596.815,1606.966,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think an appropriate place to start would be how the Supreme Court of Virginia construed the statute and get past that and into the confrontation issue."
2009.07-11191,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1632.316,1636.501,It goes -- that goes to the waiver question.
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,1636.501,1638.345,--Right.
2009.07-11191,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1638.345,1644.67,How did they know at trial that they were supposed to say to you: I don't want a subpoena; you bring them in.
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,1644.67,1649.654,I think the -- the way the Supreme Court of Virginia construed the statute is perfectly sensible.
2009.07-11191,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1708.048,1709.97,But you're -- you're still begging the question.
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,1733.055,1734.116,Right.
2009.07-11191,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1734.116,1735.505,And so did the court on appeal.
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,1741.705,1749.937,I think it was incumbent on counsel to raise the issue exactly like counsel for the defendant did in the Grant case.
2009.07-11191,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1776.519,1818.658,"Could I ask you: If we were to -- how do we articulate a rule, or do we need to, that would take care of the fears of your adversary that trials would become trials by affidavit, that the -- that prosecutors will choose to put all witnesses on -- by videotape, by affidavit, by deposition, whatever mode they choose except bringing them into court -- and forcing defendants then to call the witnesses and do a what's -- what I call a cold-cross?"
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,1823.563,1824.593,I think--
2009.07-11191,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1824.593,1836.697,--that would avoid -- what constitutional construction of the Confrontation Clause would we issue that would protect against that?
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,1836.697,1842.959,"--I think there are several constitutional, legal, and practical considerations that make this--"
2009.07-11191,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1842.959,1843.286,"No, no."
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,1846.566,1847.178,--Right.
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1889.721,1890.517,They're trial witnesses.
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,1891.359,1900.419,"--Another is the fact that under the Confrontation Clause, the cross-examination has to be effective."
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1915.291,1916.29,"No, just one or two."
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,1924.704,1925.391,"I think, under the--"
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1925.391,1927.329,"We'd have a whole European-type trial, right?"
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,1928.514,1928.998,--Right.
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1965.794,1967.623,It does more than that.
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,1987.782,1992.684,"--We agree that we have to produce the witness for court, but we see little constitutional--"
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1992.684,1993.686,"No, you don't agree with that."
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,1999.743,2009.66,"--Well, we agree that if the defendant does provide the notice, as with the noticeand -- demand statute, that it -- that it's our burden to make sure that witness is there."
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2027.242,2028.619,How is that clear from the statute?
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2028.619,2029.82,I'm sorry.
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2029.82,2031.367,How is that clear from the statute?
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2035.864,2037.084,Right.
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2051.141,2055.841,"A strict construction of statutes in general, or a strict construction of this provision?"
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2055.841,2057.729,This particular -- this particular statutory scheme.
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2074.676,2080.377,I'm talking about the specific issue of the person subpoenaed not appearing.
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2080.985,2082.924,"No, I don't have a case--"
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2082.924,2083.922,So we don't really know.
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2083.922,2086.53,--but I -- but I think the answer follows inexorably--
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2086.53,2105.209,"I don't know how -- how strict construction gets you to the -- to the result that when it is the defendant who has to take the initiative to get the person brought in, if the person doesn't show up, it's -- it doesn't fall on the defendant; it falls on the prosecution."
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2107.393,2117.345,"--The -- the Grant case, for example, which our Court of Appeals of Virginia said was simply was an application of the holding in the Magruder decision."
2009.07-11191,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2151.798,2156.968,"Well, I think that underlying this is a fairly simple problem, conceptually."
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2195.355,2200.369,I think your question goes to the very heart of why we have the Confrontation Clause.
2009.07-11191,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2229.858,2233.309,"As I read this statute, it does let in that piece of paper."
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2233.309,2234.265,--It does.
2009.07-11191,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2234.795,2238.309,"And so why then, by analogy, isn't the statute bad?"
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2238.309,2239.743,"--Well, because--"
2009.07-11191,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2239.743,2251.769,"If -- unless you -- unless you have some special kind -- I mean, you'd have to some special -- specially reliable evidence that sort of fell within the Confrontation Clause but not totally."
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2256.156,2256.889,--I think there are--
2009.07-11191,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2256.889,2257.751,So -- so--
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2257.751,2287.237,"--There are characteristics, of course, to this particular type of evidence that were debated in this Court's Melendez-Diaz opinion that make this procedure certainly more appropriate, and one of those is, these -- what -- functionally what you are doing when you have this witness on the stand is either past recollection recorded or past recollection refreshed, because they are doing approximately 900 of these certificates a year."
2009.07-11191,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2298.168,2320.722,"--Well, to put my chips on the table, which you probably understand, I thought the reliability of this evidence in the mine run of cases was such, and the distance from Sir Walter Raleigh was sufficiently great, that it fell outside the scope of the Confrontation Clause for those two reasons, but mine was a dissenting opinion."
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2320.722,2321.034,--Right.
2009.07-11191,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2321.377,2323.374,"So, therefore, what do I do?"
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2327.824,2340.631,"--Well, I think, though, even -- even going back to the very heart -- the historical heart of this clause, the problems for these colonists was anonymous accusers and absentee witnesses."
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2374.505,2378.393,"Well, the problem you describe, the hearsay rule would have solved that alone, wouldn't it?"
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2378.393,2381.314,"--Well, that's one of the practical--"
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2381.314,2385.175,So -- so what's left for the Confrontation Clause to do?
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2385.175,2399.541,"--Well, the Confrontation Clause is designed to ensure -- the core of it -- and we agree with this -- is what this Court has said for a long time, a face-to-face encounter with a witness who is cross-examined face to face, under oath."
2009.07-11191,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2399.541,2404.852,But it doesn't have to happen in the prosecutor's case.
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2428.107,2429.121,Right.
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2483.675,2492.298,"And it's still not clear -- not clear under the statute that if the witness doesn't show up, it's the prosecution that bears the burden."
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2492.298,2493.424,"No, I think that's very clear."
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2493.424,2495.109,Why is that clear?
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2495.109,2499.578,Under both the plain language of the statute and the way it's been construed adversely to the Commonwealth.
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2518.927,2521.361,It doesn't say what the consequence of his not appearing is.
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2529.234,2548.038,"The consequence emerges from this line of cases, Justice Scalia, that if the -- the statute requires the witness to appear, and if the Commonwealth doesn't do exactly what the statute requires, a live witness -- or excuse me, the certificate does not come in without the live witness."
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2553.707,2556.55,"No, the prosecutor issues the subpoena."
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2556.55,2556.94,Right.
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2558.017,2559.514,The witness does not show up.
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2559.514,2560.126,--Right.
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2560.126,2563.218,I'm not talking about fault on the part of the prosecutor.
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2569.965,2572.742,But I think the language answers that.
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2580.6,2582.397,"Of course, he is required to appear."
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2585.177,2590.578,"--I'm sorry, but we seem to be going in -- in circles."
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2590.89,2592.106,"No, we're not going in circles at all."
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2608.832,2616.376,"If he doesn't appear, the Commonwealth has failed to do what the statute requires, which is to make sure the witness appears."
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2625.279,2627.635,"Well, I don't see the statute requiring that."
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2631.476,2639.314,"And -- I mean, to the extent there's -- there's any question about that, I don't think it's a matter that this Court should resolve in the first instance."
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2690.261,2691.153,How new is the new one?
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2691.153,2694.931,"It went into effect August 21, 2009."
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2694.931,2695.056,Okay.
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2714.14,2718.917,"The spike has plateaued somewhat in Virginia, but we are still seeing extensive gamesmanship."
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2719.323,2728.225,What is peculiar about Virginia that -- or what is peculiar about Michigan or the other States that have this system and somehow are able to live with it?
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2728.225,2730.445,"--Well, I think--"
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2730.445,2732.195,Virginia criminals are nastier; is that it?
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2733.115,2741.175,"--No, I -- I think -- I -- I don't know that -- that there's anything particularly different about Virginia criminals."
2009.07-11191,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2755.857,2756.434,Right.
2009.07-11191,1,41757,stephen_r_mccullough,,2756.434,2773.772,"Well, a cross-examinationfocused statute like this one more blatantly exposes that type of gamesmanship and, therefore, may have a better deterrent value, as opposed to a garden variety statute."
2009.07-11191,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2804.382,2805.412,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2819.61,2836.401,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A State adequately safeguards the confrontation right recognized in Melendez-Diaz when it guarantees that it will, on the defendant's request, bring the analyst into court for face-to-face confrontation and cross-examination at trial."
2009.07-11191,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2836.401,2840.149,"That's not what we said in Melendez-Diaz, unfortunately."
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2840.149,2841.132,"Well, Melendez-Diaz--"
2009.07-11191,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2841.132,2841.791,We said the following:
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2870.105,2870.947,"--No, Justice Scalia, not at all."
2009.07-11191,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2883.987,2886.019,"He's present only if the defendant asks for him, right?"
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2886.019,2887.878,"--That's right, and that's -- that's because--"
2009.07-11191,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2887.878,2889.048,And that's exactly what this addressed.
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2899.234,2909.056,"--This Court has recognized that the confrontation right is designed to achieve a particular purpose, and that is to ensure that the government's evidence is subject to adversarial testing at trial."
2009.07-11191,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2922.377,2922.798,That may be.
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2927.014,2931.027,--I think it would be surprising to discover that Melendez-Diaz went quite so far.
2009.07-11191,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2951.112,2951.284,All right.
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2960.936,2977.707,"I think the statement is it requires only that the Court reaffirm what it already said in Crawford, in the context of the lab analyst testimony at issue in this case, which is, again, when the analyst is available for cross-examination at trial, the government has complied with what the Confrontation Clause demands."
2009.07-11191,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2984.597,2986.298,"And it just doesn't -- doesn't apply just to analysts, right?"
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2991.593,2998.339,"--Well, our principal submission is that the Confrontation Clause provides, in every case, an opportunity for effective cross-examination."
2009.07-11191,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2998.339,2998.905,Okay.
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2998.905,3012.039,And there may be independent constraints on the manner in which the prosecution presents its evidence under the laws of evidence in the jurisdiction because of the government's need to satisfy its burden of proof and ensure a fundamentally fair trial under the Due Process Clause.
2009.07-11191,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3013.258,3015.099,I don't understand what -- is that a yes or a no?
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3015.099,3020.067,"--Well, it is to say that Confrontation Clause is not what prohibits that practice."
2009.07-11191,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3023.14,3023.197,Okay.
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3028.436,3051.551,"--I think that that's right, but even if the Court were to disagree with that submission, this Court could rely on the kinds of distinctions that it has drawn in other cases, like Inadi or like White v. Illinois, which recognized that there is a class of hearsay evidence that's not simply a weaker substitute for live testimony at trial, that has independent, probative significance that makes it somewhat irrelevant whether or not the court--"
2009.07-11191,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3051.551,3054.14,Indicia of reliability -- you want us to go back to that?
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3054.628,3056.828,"--No, it's not a question of the reliability."
2009.07-11191,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3081.569,3096.142,"What if it doesn't quite work, that the Confrontation Clause seems to be expanding, just with the opportunity for cross-examination creating all kinds of incursions into areas where it's not necessary for fairness purposes?"
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3119.585,3120.334,But--
2009.07-11191,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3120.334,3123.739,"Now, there we are, accepting the warnings of the dissenters in Crawford."
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3124.659,3131.393,--I don't think that the touchstone of this Court's analysis need return to the now discredited Ohio v. Roberts regime.
2009.07-11191,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3149.215,3163.798,"Well, what about Raleigh's witnesses -- you know, the hypothetical I gave you, for the heart of the matter, the heart of the matter, and they stick it in their affidavits, and you say, oh, don't worry, don't worry, you can cross-examine them later in the trial."
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3163.798,3184.634,"I think, to the extent that the Court were otherwise inclined to invent a new body of Confrontation Clause jurisprudence to govern the manner in which the prosecution puts on its witnesses and questions them, this isn't the appropriate case to do it because, as we have seen from Petitioners' submission earlier this morning, there is no substantive difference from a defendant's perspective--"
2009.07-11191,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3184.634,3194.805,Could you -- are you suggesting or are you saying even a trial by affidavit is okay under the Confrontation Clause?
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3196.618,3205.722,"--Our principal submission is that the Confrontation Clause allows the government to rely on affidavits, so long as it bring the affiants into court, so that the defendant can ask whatever questions--"
2009.07-11191,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3205.722,3212.609,"So you are absolutely saying that, under the Confrontation Clause, trial by affidavit of any witness would be okay."
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3212.609,3213.795,--That is our principal--
2009.07-11191,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3213.795,3222.744,"So are you -- are you then saying that there is some other constitutional limit to that choice, outside of the Confrontation Clause?"
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3226.184,3230.884,"--We do think that there are constitutional limits in the Due Process Clause, and it's guaranteeing the right to--"
2009.07-11191,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3230.884,3237.863,"Well, how many hundreds of cases will it take to identify those limits under that very clear Due Process Clause?"
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3238.803,3245.284,"--Well, it's -- it's somewhat of a difficult question to answer because this is not a question that arises particularly frequently."
2009.07-11191,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3252.155,3254.608,Don't we want clear rules for the presentation?
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3260.309,3271.742,--I think that it's difficult to imagine that a new-found constitutional rule that would require the prosecution to present its evidence in a certain way in every case would lead to that sort of clarity.
2009.07-11191,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3272.896,3274.71,"Ms. Kruger, can I just ask this question?"
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3285.285,3293.497,"--We think that you could, so long as the defendant has an adequate opportunity to cross-examine that eye witness about the testimonial statement."
2009.07-11191,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3340.557,3343.213,Why -- why do we have to say anything in this case?
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3347.334,3348.305,I think that--
2009.07-11191,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3348.305,3351.32,"This Virginia statute no longer exists, does it?"
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3360.893,3367.939,"--That's true, and I think that that's because Virginia was unwilling to stake the validity of however many convictions in the interim on the outcome of a case."
2009.07-11191,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3368.344,3371.686,I'm not criticizing Virginia; I'm criticizing us for taking the case.
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3372.513,3383.868,"--I think that this -- this case presents, I think, an important opportunity for the Court to provide guidance to States that are currently grappling with how to respond to the practical problems that have been presented in the wake of Melendez-Diaz."
2009.07-11191,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3383.868,3396.457,"So do we say to them, contrary to what Melendez-Diaz is, that subpoena statutes -- when you read the statute, it says the defendant has to subpoena the witness."
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3403.441,3409.453,"I don't mean to quibble, Justice Sotomayor, but the statute does not in fact on its face say the defendant must subpoena."
2009.07-11191,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3424.197,3427.102,"That question of prior State law, right?"
2009.07-11191,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3427.102,3429.302,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2009.07-11191,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3429.302,3430.366,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.07-11191,3,39224,richard_d_friedman,,3433.1,3435.378,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.07-11191,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3467.568,3470.052,"Well, the -- just the first one, the no-notice problem, that's kind of silly, isn't it?"
2009.07-11191,3,39224,richard_d_friedman,,3475.721,3478.455,"--That's likely, of course."
2009.07-11191,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3575.244,3576.539,But I take it your position is it wouldn't matter.
2009.07-11191,3,39224,richard_d_friedman,,3583.099,3585.551,"That would -- that would not be enough, no."
2009.07-11191,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3587.006,3588.457,So we have to assume that that's the case.
2009.07-11191,3,39224,richard_d_friedman,,3588.457,3592.317,"--Well, that's -- that's one problem."
2009.07-11191,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3593.846,3594.688,"Well, would you like us--"
2009.07-11191,3,39224,richard_d_friedman,,3594.688,3594.844,--but there are two -- they are both problems.
2009.07-11191,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3594.844,3601.575,"--Would you like us to grant, vacate, and remand in this case and say because it's unclear who has the risk of a no-show?"
2009.07-11191,3,39224,richard_d_friedman,,3601.575,3602.838,"No, no, no, Your--"
2009.07-11191,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3602.838,3610.899,And then Supreme Court of Virginia on remand could decide whether in fact the -- the prosecution bore that risk?
2009.07-11191,3,39224,richard_d_friedman,,3610.899,3620.083,"--No, Your Honor, because it's sufficient that the statute is very clear and the Commonwealth doesn't deny that it's the defendant's burden under the statute to call the witness to the stand."
2009.07-11191,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3637.606,3641.198,Do you think Melendez-Diaz addressed the question of the order of proof?
2009.07-11191,3,39224,richard_d_friedman,,3642.446,3645.086,--I don't think this is a question of order of proof.
2009.07-11191,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3655.334,3661.597,"So is the proper solution to grant, vacate, and remand in light of Melendez-Diaz?"
2009.07-11191,3,39224,richard_d_friedman,,3661.597,3663.924,May -- may I respond to that?
2009.07-11191,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3663.924,3665.031,Yes.
2009.07-11191,3,39224,richard_d_friedman,,3665.031,3665.982,Thank you.
2009.07-11191,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3701.531,3702.514,"Thank you, counsel."
