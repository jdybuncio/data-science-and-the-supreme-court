1977.76-39,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,46.861,"We will hear arguments next in 76-39, Memphis Light & Gas against Craft."
1977.76-39,0,24015,frierson_m_graves_jr,,49.443,66.104,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, my name is Frierson Graves and I represent the Memphis Light, Gas & Water Division which is a part of the City of Memphis, a municipal utility which has both electric, gas and water operations."
1977.76-39,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,246.108,256.732,I suppose a fair quarreler of what you have just suggested is that the paying customer should not be required to subsidize the non-paying customers?
1977.76-39,0,24015,frierson_m_graves_jr,,256.732,299.761,"Your Honor I think that goes back to sort of the general common law rules about a utility that you should not give free service because just as you must provide service to a customer, if a reasonable service to him so that every person can have the service, likewise you should not give the service to a customer who is not paying for that because you are discriminating against your ratepayer in that way and of course they say that reason both is for reasonable room for free service plus the fact that you are avoiding numerous small petty suits because utility services is merely a credit transaction."
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,1774.876,1778.948,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-39,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1897.619,1902.974,You have a small claims -- you have a small claims court system in Tennessee?
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,1902.974,1917.953,"We have what is called a general session’s court Your Honor, but it is not a small claims court in the sense that no lawyers are allowed to appear such as we have in some states."
1977.76-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1917.953,1943.009,"Suppose the notice said that you have not paid your bill, if you have any complaints about it come and see Mr. so and so at room so and so between the hours of so and so; bring any information you have, bring your lawyer if you want to and we will hear your side of the story to see if we have made a mistake and would that be enough to satisfy you before there is a cut off?"
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,1943.009,1946.676,I think a notice of that sort is the type that we are asking.
1977.76-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1946.676,1949.282,"So, your answer is yes?"
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,1949.282,1954.685,It is hard to say yes to a specific notice without seeing it in print and going over it --
1977.76-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1954.685,1964.137,"But you do not, you do not for example claim that before there is cut off there has to be some independent hearing examiner or a full adversary trial?"
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,1964.137,1993.821,"Well, your question was directed to the notice, but as I think what we are asking for is the type of notice that you just mentioned to give the person opportunity for some type of hearing that that would only have to be at the first stage, an informal conference with a responsible official at Memphis Light, Gas & Water Division and then if it is not resolved at that stage, I think there should be an informal hearing before an impartial hearing."
1977.76-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1993.821,1997.12,You mean before the termination of service?
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,1997.12,1997.973,"Yes, Your Honor."
1977.76-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1997.973,2000.312,"Now, what authority did you have for that in your case?"
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2000.312,2012.706,"Well, I think in numerous cases it is decided by this Court such as Goldberg v. Kelly, I think before the termination of welfare service in that case."
1977.76-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2012.706,2014.288,What kind of the hearing was that?
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2014.288,2020.655,That was an informal hearing before an independent hearing examiner prior to the termination.
1977.76-39,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2022.469,2033.757,"But when you are say an independent hearing examiner, did not Goldberg against Kelly simply say that it must be within the organization, the granting organization but a different person --"
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2033.757,2053.585,"That is correct and I want to point out we are not necessarily asking for someone outside the company so long, even if it is an employee of the company, so long as that person has the independence to look at the case fairly and to make a decision in favor of the consumer, we feel that would be adequate."
1977.76-39,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2053.585,2066.516,But do not you think that the natural urge of a utility just sell as much of its product as possible or gives them a certain amount of independence in that respect?
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2066.516,2089.411,"I suppose it does, but the record in this case indicates that they also have some problems in resolving disputes that developed between customers and one of the problems that Mrs. Craft had was that the persons that she was communicating were lower level employees who really did not have the authority to resolve any dispute that might have developed."
1977.76-39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2098.838,2104.016,"Mr. Daniel there is a reason for that, it is probably the utility or that is the state?"
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2104.016,2109.705,I think it is because it is a state in this case.
1977.76-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2109.705,2113.678,You would not have any plan unless the defendant is a state?
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2113.678,2114.946,That is correct under the Jackson --
1977.76-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2114.946,2116.873,The state within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment?
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2116.873,2117.579,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1977.76-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2117.579,2121.98,And what about the other offices?
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2121.98,2122.342,I am not sure.
1977.76-39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2122.342,2123.832,Their Commissioners?
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2123.832,2125.468,"Well, the --"
1977.76-39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2125.468,2126.899,Their state offices?
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2126.899,2137.834,"Well, they are employees of the city, at least in so far as they are officials of the Memphis Light, Gas & Water Division, they are state officers, yes."
1977.76-39,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2137.834,2139.735,"Well, their President, Vice-President, are they --"
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2139.735,2140.943,Yes.
1977.76-39,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2140.943,2149.476,"So, so far you have largely in response to question, you have quite addressed yourself to the due process aspect of the case Mr. Daniel."
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2160.885,2164.934,"No, I do not think their analysis is as full as it should be."
1977.76-39,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2203.08,2212.654,"And you did not appeal or seek to assert from that portion of the Sixth Circuit’s opinion which held that where the bill is undisputed, judgment goes for the defendant in the case?"
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2212.654,2213.362,That is correct.
1977.76-39,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2234.258,2249.668,But I want to be clear that you are not asking that the fact finder to resolve this dispute must be independent and neutral apart from the utility?
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2249.668,2250.394,That is correct.
1977.76-39,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2250.394,2252.694,It cannot be an employee of the utility.
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2256.499,2261.237,"A responsible company official, I think that would be adequate."
1977.76-39,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2261.237,2262.748,I am not sure what official means.
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2262.748,2278.014,"Well, I think there was a distinction made in the Palmer case of the Sixth Circuit in that an official or an officer of the company would have more freedom to rule in favor of the customer than a lower level employee."
1977.76-39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2278.771,2281.656,"Mr. Graves suggested you go to the credit department, will that be okay?"
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2281.656,2293.712,"Well, no I do not think that would be okay because the problem as the record in this case indicates is that the employees in the credit department our concerned primarily with getting people to pay their bills."
1977.76-39,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2317.474,2320.5,Mr. Daniel may I ask you a question please?
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2350.359,2351.089,That is correct.
1977.76-39,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2351.089,2366.277,"Now, is there any precedent that you know of under the Fourteenth Amendment for holding that a notice must do more than tell the person to be harmed about the prospective harm, but must go further and in effect give them legal advice as to what his possible remedies must be?"
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2366.277,2400.455,"Well, I think the holdings of this Court indicate that the question of notice and hearing is always are variable according to the circumstances of a particular case and I cannot cite any specific holding that would require that, but I think that under recent decisions of this Court, the type of notice that has been required in certain cases such as Morrissey v. Brewer was a very specific notice and it informed the person of more than just the action that was about to be taken."
1977.76-39,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2431.479,2439.972,"Often I suppose the -- in a serious matter that one citizen gets a notice that something is about to happen, one thing he can do is ask a lawyer for help."
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2444.678,2449.544,"Well, I am not even sure that it would have been straightened out in a hurry because there was no dispute whether --"
1977.76-39,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2449.544,2456.241,"They would leverage the president of the company, so you terminate this service you are going to be get sued for three million dollars or something like that, might not have got an action?"
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2456.241,2462.511,"That is possible, but my only point is there is no dispute resolution process within Memphis Light, Gas & Water."
1977.76-39,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2463.251,2469.64,Does the record tells us how often there are disputes about the amount of the bill as opposed to the questions of credit and things like that.
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2469.64,2484.397,"The only indication in the record as far as numbers is that during the year 1973, I believe when this case was being litigated there were something like 33000 hard deal complaints."
1977.76-39,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2521.257,2523.69,That is right as required by State regulation.
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2523.69,2524.749,That is correct.
1977.76-39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2554.631,2558.173,"The Court would not have to supervise this, would they not?"
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2558.173,2559.63,No I do not think so Your Honor.
1977.76-39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2559.63,2560.942,That is what worries me?
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2560.942,2569.988,"I think all we are asking the Court do to is to set up and order Memphis Light, Gas & Water Division to setup a dispute resolution process."
1977.76-39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2577.162,2578.776,Why not?
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2578.776,2595.789,"Well, I think if they -- there would be no right of action in Federal Court to resolve the dispute, the claim here is that the Fourteenth Amendment is violated because due process is not being provided."
1977.76-39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2595.789,2601.089,"Well, I mean due process is a -- it is about like that, is it not?"
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2604.71,2605.646,"Well, I think we are asking --"
1977.76-39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2605.646,2611.641,"I mean, if you put it, you said somebody cursed over to phone."
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2616.774,2617.858,I suppose not Your Honor.
1977.76-39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2617.858,2619.788,"Well, what would help?"
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2619.788,2638.599,"Well, I think what would help is as we have discussed previously, to have a hearing examiner who has the responsibility to hear disputes, that develop between consumers and Memphis Light, Gas & Water Division who has the authority to render a decision --"
1977.76-39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2638.599,2640.122,And to enforce it?
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2640.122,2641.817,And to enforce that decision.
1977.76-39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2641.817,2645.127,How can you do that in a public utility?
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2645.127,2645.761,Well I would --
1977.76-39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2645.761,2653.61,You mean he could enforce and say call the Chairman of the Board or was it the counsel or whatever these things called?
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2653.61,2655.376,The commissioners of the utility --
1977.76-39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2655.376,2659.363,So he would be over them?
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2659.363,2661.813,MI do not think he would necessarily be over them.
1977.76-39,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2683.82,2687.505,"Now, that is the first time you have used the used term hearing examiner."
1977.76-39,1,42597,thomas_m_daniel,,2706.313,2716.857,"Well, if there is any confusion there, I was using the terms interchangeably, that the person who is hearing the case could be a responsible company official."
1977.76-39,2,24015,frierson_m_graves_jr,,3513.596,3515.343,I have one sentence.
1977.76-39,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3566.516,3582.961,"That does not solve the problem which seems to be hanging in air, whether their due process right such as the Sixth Circuit has outlined it, is satisfied if they do not get the answer they like?"
1977.76-39,2,24015,frierson_m_graves_jr,,3582.961,3604.73,"Your Honor, I do not think they can -- that everybody gets the answer they right about utility bills in this because I think a utility could not compromise and give away the utilities just on the basis of selling it, that they would have to attempt the charge what was reasonably said by the meter to the purpose."
1977.76-39,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3604.73,3605.431,Thank you gentlemen.
