1997.96-8732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.316,"We'll hear argument this afternoon in Number 96-8732, Vincent Edwards, et al., v. United States."
1997.96-8732,0,42091,steven_shobat,,11.968,13.04,Yes.
1997.96-8732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,13.04,14.332,Thank you.
1997.96-8732,0,42091,steven_shobat,,14.332,19.575,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1997.96-8732,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,100.288,112.664,"Mr. Shobat, does your argument depend on finding that both the type and the quantity of drugs are elements of the section 846 conspiracy?"
1997.96-8732,0,42091,steven_shobat,,112.664,114.847,"No, Your Honor, it does not."
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1560.024,1572.58,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1599.398,1600.99,"Under the guidelines, or under the statute?"
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1600.99,1602.009,Under the guidelines.
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1602.86,1607.963,How can the guidelines control what statutory maximum is available?
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1608.895,1627.377,"--In our view they don't control that at all, but three of the courts of appeals have held that even if you're talking about a case where the statutory maximum and minimum are clear, that in terms of applying the guidelines the district court at sentencing must apply... must take into account only the drug that will produce the lower guidelines sentence."
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1627.377,1633.121,"But the statutory maximum and minimum cannot be clear if you don't know what the substance is, can they?"
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1633.121,1649.881,"I'm not sure that's true now, because you could have a couple of possibilities, both of which would put you into, say, the minimum category, the zero to 20 category, but one of which would put you at 19 years under the guidelines, and one of which would put you at 5 years, so it can make quite a difference."
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1649.881,1658.056,"But they wouldn't be similarly inconsequential as far as the guidelines are concerned, they're only inconsequential as to the statutory grades?"
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1658.056,1661.739,"Well, my only point is--"
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1661.739,1665.822,"I mean, would the guidelines treat differently two substances that are treated the same in the statute?"
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1665.822,1684.836,"--The guidelines are much more specific about what... how you do the quantity calculations and how you take things into account, but my point is only that even in cases where there is no controversy about what the statutory range is, the guidelines range can differ quite a bit, depending on whether you take into account some crack or don't take into account some crack."
1997.96-8732,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1735.326,1738.529,"The commission could deal with that as it wishes, couldn't it?"
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1763.927,1765.397,--Well--
1997.96-8732,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1765.397,1767.958,"And if they don't like the way the judges are doing it, they can write the opposite guideline."
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1767.958,1777.535,--I think there may be some question about whether the commission would have power to do anything that would seem to trench on what this Court said in Watts and required by--
1997.96-8732,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1777.535,1789.513,"But if the courts that find the way you think is wrong are finding that way because they think the guidelines require them to do so, then the answer would be that the commission could make clear that that isn't--"
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1789.513,1789.823,--Oh--
1997.96-8732,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1789.823,1790.802,--what the guidelines require.
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1790.802,1791.493,"--Yes, absolutely."
1997.96-8732,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1792.695,1793.955,So there's nothing for us to decide--
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1793.955,1795.707,--If the courts feel they are being bound by the guidelines.
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1927.602,1939.16,"--Well, it can't define the offense if, indeed, as you just read, you are to be punished with the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense."
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1949.657,1949.908,--Well--
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1949.908,1951.338,--referred to in 846.
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1951.338,1954.921,"--Well, with respect, we would obviously disagree with that."
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1965.878,1966.128,Right.
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1966.128,1968.119,--with intent to distribute controlled substances.
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1968.119,1970.85,"Right, and if all I had before me was 841, I would agree."
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1988.343,1988.842,Well--
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1988.842,1991.633,I can read you 841(a) and you can't tell me what penalty is prescribed for that.
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1991.633,1992.874,"--Well, with respect--"
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1992.874,1993.966,You have to go down to (b) to figure it out.
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1993.966,1999.199,"--With respect, I can, because what I'll say is, you look down to (b), which prescribes the penalties for the offense defined in (a)."
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1999.199,1999.53,Fine.
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2002.832,2004.643,We disagree about that.
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2004.643,2004.843,That's fine.
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2004.843,2025.096,"We disagree about that, obviously, and our analysis is that 841(a) defines an offense which is complete once the jury finds that you have distributed or manufactured or possessed with the intent a controlled substance, and it's true they... in a substantive count, then in the nature of things they will have to find a controlled substance involved."
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2052.625,2052.916,You apply the minimum.
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2064.574,2067.585,--That's a potential answer to that question.
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2067.585,2068.434,It seems to me it's the only answer.
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2073.248,2078.981,"Well, for present purposes my point would be, we would establish that at sentencing to the judge, and the conviction would be valid."
1997.96-8732,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2098.193,2110.161,"And if you commit the offense of conspiracy you perhaps under one view would simply be subject to the risk of being sentenced based on what the conspiracy turned up and the judge says, it's 5 grams, or 10 grams, or whatever."
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2110.161,2126.283,"That's absolutely right, and our point here is, when you move into the realm of conspiracy... now, 846 obviously covers a wide range of different target statutes and so on, and in this particular case we're dealing with 846, referring to 841 as the object statute."
1997.96-8732,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2145.785,2162.037,"May I interrupt with just one question to be sure... what if, in this case, instead of a general verdict you have a special verdict and the jury... a whole stream of different alternatives, and the jury found not guilty as to 9 out of the 10, but on one they said he was guilty of conspiring to distribute 5 grams of powder, and that's all."
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2178.426,2179.197,--Well--
1997.96-8732,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2179.197,2180.737,With specific findings.
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2180.737,2203.994,"--I would say particularly in the conspiracy context... in the conspiracy context, the answer is clearly yes, because as long as the conviction is valid, everything else is a sentencing factor and, as the court pointed out in Watts, the difference in standard of proof makes a huge difference there, because all the jury has said by declining to convict on the other counts is they weren't convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, but there's a big range there between that and preponderance of the evidence where the court can operate."
1997.96-8732,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2244.47,2245.662,"That's not the Government's view, is it?"
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2245.662,2255.576,"We haven't taken a position in this Court on that question, and I hesitate to concede it in this case because it's not presented, but it would certainly be a plausible... a plausible statutory outcome."
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2283.385,2291.039,It's your position that as with the guidelines those sentencing factors only require judgment by a preponderance of the evidence--
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2291.039,2292.111,That's right.
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2292.111,2309.231,"--by the judge, so the judge makes the decision that it's more likely than not, by a hair, that this was crack rather than powdered, and therefore you get 40 more years, or 20 more years, by a preponderance."
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2310.623,2315.045,"Well, subject to statutory minimum and maximum that might supervene, and--"
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2315.045,2329.734,"--No, I'm talking about the maximum, that the statutory maximum I could have given you if it was one, you know, if it was powdered, is, say, 20, and the statutory maximum I can give you if it was crack is 40, or 60."
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2345.576,2359.905,"--Well, if we're talking about the simple distribution offense, and we're... if the question is, under 841(b), are all of those always just at the decision of the judge, I think that is a difficult question, and we will certainly address it in the cases it arises in--"
1997.96-8732,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2401.682,2404.804,"Well, what if it did make a difference, that's the point."
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2407.676,2408.427,It did make a difference.
1997.96-8732,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2451.865,2458.721,"--And if it's not a conspiracy case and it makes a huge difference, you want to say you're not going to say."
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2458.721,2468.155,"Our position for purposes of argument in this case is that the judge has the authority to decide that, but I acknowledge that it's a very difficult--"
1997.96-8732,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2468.155,2470.559,"There are several... I mean, are you talking... which question?"
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2487.238,2488.039,--That's correct.
1997.96-8732,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2488.039,2489.649,A separate question is who has to decide.
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2496.354,2497.105,There are--
1997.96-8732,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2497.105,2498.636,What do we have to decide here?
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2498.636,2506.883,"--There are any number of questions that you don't have to decide here, and we would urge the Court to stick generally to the facts of this case, because I think that's useful and I think the facts of this case are typical."
1997.96-8732,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2563.588,2564.76,Would you refresh my recollection on--
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2564.76,2566.359,--other conduct that was sought to be taken into account.
1997.96-8732,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2566.359,2566.91,--on one minor point.
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2578.988,2580.458,I don't think this Court has said--
1997.96-8732,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2580.458,2581.94,"But your position is, it's permissible?"
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2581.94,2584.051,--I think that under the statutes--
1997.96-8732,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2584.051,2588.505,Because that's your example you happened to pick to explain what the judge could see that the jury might not see.
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2588.505,2593.268,"--It's another question that's not presented, but yes, I think under the statutes that say that anything can come under sentencing--"
1997.96-8732,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2593.268,2595.058,So he can... he only has to do it by a preponderance.
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2605.515,2607.095,--In Watts.
1997.96-8732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2607.095,2607.596,In Watts.
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2607.957,2609.188,"Yes, absolutely."
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2609.188,2626.27,"Mr. DuMont, would you explain again, because I don't understand it, how it's possible that you can come out with one response to Justice O'Connor's question, where it's a conspiracy charge but a different response where you're being prosecuted for simple distribution?"
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2639.958,2642.041,"Well, it's not a constitutional question."
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2643.18,2643.39,Yes.
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2643.39,2645.411,"The point is, the statutory analysis proceeds as follows."
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2657.688,2658.169,Right.
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2658.169,2663.532,"Then the form of the following phrase is, in the case of a violation of subsection (a) involving."
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2663.532,2663.933,Right.
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2663.933,2686.269,"Now, it's always been the Government's position, as my colleague points out, that for distribution, simple distribution, each possession or distribution of each drug is a separate offense, and it is consistent with that to say that if you're convicted of only one substantive count, then when you get to (b) what you have to look at is, what is involved in that substantive count."
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2732.078,2735.641,"Well, I guess what I'm saying, I don't see how that's rational."
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2757.734,2758.966,"You understand our position, and I--"
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2758.966,2759.266,Let's... yes.
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2759.266,2763.909,--And I would point out that the Court reviewed in Chapman the history of the drug statute.
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2763.909,2764.199,Yes.
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2764.199,2778.117,"And one thing I would point out about that is, when Congress enacted the current form of 841(b) in 1986, what it had in mind was setting three broad categories, which were king pin distributors, serious street level distributors, and then regular distributors."
1997.96-8732,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2824.459,2834.304,"May I ask first if you agree with Judge Easterbrook that it would be sufficient if the indictment simply alleged controlled substance, without any identification?"
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2834.304,2839.429,"--For the purposes we are centrally controlled with here, yes, it would be sufficient."
1997.96-8732,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2848.786,2850.508,But the defendant has to know enough about the case to defend--
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2850.508,2851.247,--But... of course.
1997.96-8732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2925.656,2930.36,--The object of the conspiracy was either to distribute or to possess with intent to distribute?
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2930.36,2938.976,"--That's correct, and we know from Griffin that if there was sufficient evidence to convict on either one of those, and there clearly was, they conceded there was, the convictions are perfectly valid."
1997.96-8732,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2953.555,2953.966,Excuse me.
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2980.653,2991.399,"--Under his view of the world I think that's right, and there would be... there would be more serious problems than figuring out the sentence, frankly, because I think there would be problems with convictions, although they've never stood up to the plate on that one."
1997.96-8732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3029.574,3030.966,Do they still have bills of particulars?
1997.96-8732,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3030.966,3032.786,"--They absolutely do, Your Honor."
1997.96-8732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3070.29,3071.452,"Thank you, Mr. DuMont."
1997.96-8732,2,42091,steven_shobat,,3073.572,3082.078,"Mr. Chief Justice, the issue that is not before the Court is the guideline issue."
1997.96-8732,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3102.641,3108.547,"Well, were all these sentences within the range of the powered cocaine range?"
1997.96-8732,2,42091,steven_shobat,,3108.547,3110.117,--The answer to that question is no.
