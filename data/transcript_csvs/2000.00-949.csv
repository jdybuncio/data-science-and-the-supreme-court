2000.00-949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,19.743,"We'll hear argument now on number 00-949, George W. Bush and Richard Cheney, versus Albert Gore, et al. Before we begin the arguments, the Court wishes to commend all of the parties to this case on their exemplary briefing under very trying circumstances."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,22.195,25.303,"Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and may it please the Court--"
2000.00-949,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,85.123,86.137,Mr. Olson--
2000.00-949,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,86.137,91.339,"--Can you begin by telling us our federal jurisdiction, where is the federal question here?"
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,91.339,106.146,"The federal question arises out of the fact that the Florida Supreme Court was violating Article II, section 1 of the Constitution, and it was conducting itself in violation of section 5 of Title III of federal law."
2000.00-949,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,106.146,142.381,"On the first, it seems to me essential to the republican theory of government that the constitutions of the United States and the states are the basic charter, and to say that the legislature of the state is unmoored from its own constitution and it can't use its courts, and it can't use its executive agency, even you, your side, concedes it can use the state agencies, it seems to me a holding which has grave implications for our republican theory of government."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,142.381,151.36,"Justice Kennedy, the Constitution specifically vested the authority to determine the manner of the appointment of the electors in state legislatures."
2000.00-949,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,159.858,161.607,Then why didn't it do that here?
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,161.607,166.981,It did not do that here because it did not specify... it did use the executive branch.
2000.00-949,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,205.559,210.854,"Oh, but you think then there is no appellate review in the Supreme Court of what a circuit court does?"
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,210.854,214.978,Certainly the legislature did not have to provide appellate review.
2000.00-949,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,214.978,225.8,"Well, but it seemed apparently to just include selection of electors in the general election law provisions."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,231.626,240.076,"Well, there are... there is a breakout with respect to various aspects of Florida statute and Florida election law."
2000.00-949,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,250.947,251.415,I think that's right.
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,251.415,262.161,"Because notwithstanding, notwithstanding... well, the fact is that the Constitution may have been invoked."
2000.00-949,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,262.161,271.251,"Well, this is serious business because it indicates how unmoored, untethered the legislature is from the constitution of its own state, and it makes every state law issue a federal question."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,284.464,305.284,"No, I would say this with respect... it would have been a perfectly logical, and if you read the statutes, a perfectly logical, especially in the context of a presidential election, to stop this process at the circuit court, and not provide layers of appeal because given the time deadline, especially in the context of this election, the way it's played out, there is not time for an appellate court."
2000.00-949,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,305.284,348.032,"I have the same problem Justice Kennedy does, apparently, which is, I would have thought you could say that Article II certainly creates a presumption that the scheme the legislature has set out will be followed even by judicial review in election matters, and that 3 U.S. code section 5 likewise suggests that it may inform the reading of statutes crafted by the legislature so as to avoid having the law changed after the election."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,362.433,370.79,"I think that I don't disagree with that except to the extent that I think that the argument we presented and amplified on in our briefs is a good argument, it's a solid argument."
2000.00-949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,377.787,378.693,"Well, it's pretty close."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,393.046,407.493,"No, I think that it is particularly in this case where there's been two wholesale revisions, major restructuring of the Florida Election Code, we don't even get close to that question at all."
2000.00-949,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,427.409,447.228,"Mr. Olson, as I understand your argument, you rely on Leser v. Garnett and Hawke v. Smith, and is it critical to your Article II argument that we read the word legislature as narrowly, I mean the power granted the legislature as similar to that granted in Article V of the Constitution, as those cases dealt with?"
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,447.228,449.087,"No, I don't think it's necessary."
2000.00-949,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,449.087,451.836,So your reliance on... you really are not relying on those cases.
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,451.836,453.882,"Well, I think those cases support the argument, but as we said...."
2000.00-949,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,453.882,457.521,But if you've got to choose one version of the word legislature or the other....
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,457.521,478.685,"I think in a different context, it's not necessarily the case, and certainly it is true that legislatures can employ the legislative process that might include vetoes by a state chief executive, or a referendum, when the state deliberately chooses to choose a legislative method to articulate a code."
2000.00-949,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,480.855,485.666,But is it the choice of the legislature or was it constitutionally limited to this provision?
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,501.004,506.065,"No, Article II... we do not contend that Article II would prohibit them from fulfilling that process."
2000.00-949,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,506.065,508.609,"Of course Article V would have, and under Leser against Garnett and those cases, but you...."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,508.609,535.662,"In the context of this case we're saying that they can include the judicial branch when they wish to do so, but under no circumstances is it consistent with the concept of the plan in the Constitution for the state, sub silentio, the state legislature sub silentio to turn over to the judiciary the power to completely reverse, revise, and change the election code in all of the major respects...."
2000.00-949,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,535.662,547.751,"Mr. Olson, with respect to the role of judicial review, you rely very much on the McPherson case, and two things strike me about that case."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,570.555,593.078,"That's entirely possible that that might be the case, Justice Ginsburg, but the entire text of the McPherson decision and its recitation of the legislative history or the history of legislation and acts by state legislatures to comply with it make it quite clear that the power is vested in the legislature itself."
2000.00-949,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,593.078,599.48,"But there was a decision by the court reviewing, which we affirmed."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,618.472,660.347,"I think the context of that case is different, and that it's entirely possible for the Court to have come to the conclusion it did in that case and we believe that case is compelling for the principle that we are arguing in this case, that there is no, the entire structure of what Florida did, its election code, in its effort to comply not only with Article II, but with Section 5 of Title 3, is such that it did not intend in any way to divest itself of the power to determine how the appointment of electors would be determined in a federal presidential election and most importantly, the resolution of cases and controversies, and disputes, with respect to the appointments...."
2000.00-949,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,660.347,674.419,"Three times, at least as I counted in McPherson itself, it refers to what is done by the legislative power under state constitutions as they exist."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,687.085,688.397,And I think that that's important.
2000.00-949,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,743.156,747.484,"Mr. Olson, isn't that one of the issues in the case as to whether it was a major revision?"
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,755.714,760.18,"Well, I think that the dissenting opinion and the two dissenting opinions are very informative."
2000.00-949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,829.95,835.261,"Well, on ad hoc judicially created procedures, the point of subsection 8 of 168."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,853.55,861.532,"Well, to read that, to read that provision and it's written quite broadly, but to read that, one has to read that in the context of the entire statutory framework."
2000.00-949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,889.833,891.645,What's the timetable in 168?
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,891.645,893.112,There is no timetable.
2000.00-949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,893.112,893.659,That's right.
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,902.077,917.4,"But that's only if you untether 168 entirely from the statute and the steam by which the protest phase takes place over a period of seven to 10 days in the context of this election, and the contest phase occurs over the next four weeks."
2000.00-949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,917.4,935.111,"It may well be and I'll grant you for the sake of argument that there would be a sound interpretive theory that in effect would coordinate these two statutes, 166 and 168, in a way that the Florida Supreme Court has not done."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,966.145,972.095,"Well, I am hoping to convince you that they passed far beyond the normal limits of statutory construction."
2000.00-949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,973.408,982.311,"You have convinced us certainly that there is a disagreement about how it should be construed, and that disagreement is articulated by the dissents in the most recent case."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,994.54,999.117,"It is, it is, we submit an utter revision of the timetables, the allocation."
2000.00-949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,999.117,1004.677,"But Mr. Olson, we're back to the... there is no timetable in 166."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1004.677,1005.021,That's correct.
2000.00-949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1005.021,1027.06,"And what your argument boils down to, I think, is that they have insufficiently considered 168, I'm sorry, that they have insufficiently considered 166 in construing 168, and you may be right, but you have no textual hook in 168 to say untethered timetables imply in effect a nonjudicial act."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1027.06,1029.464,We are not just saying timetables.
2000.00-949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1051.955,1052.439,"Yes, you are."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1062.045,1078.163,"Well, I believe that the Supreme Court of Florida certainly thought that it was construing, it certainly said so this time, that it was construing the applicability of Section 5 and it was expressing the hope that what it was doing was not risking or jeopardizing the conclusive effect...."
2000.00-949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1078.163,1082.271,And it took that into consideration in fashioning its orders under subsection 8.
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1082.271,1105.918,"And we submit that it incorrectly interpreted and construed federal law in doing that because what they have inevitably done is provide a process whereby it is virtually impossible, if not completely impossible, and I think it is completely impossible, to have these issues resolved and the controversies resolved in time for that federal statutory deadline."
2000.00-949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1110.151,1116.038,"Well, if your concern was with impossibility, why didn't you let the process run instead of asking for a stay?"
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1116.038,1117.007,"Well, because we said...."
2000.00-949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1117.007,1118.178,We'd find out.
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1118.178,1127.456,"Because we argued, and I believe that there is a very firm basis for saying that that process already had violated Article II of the Constitution."
2000.00-949,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1138.232,1144.684,"Oh, and I thought your point was that the process is being conducted in violation of the Equal Protection Clause and it is standardless."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1144.684,1150.447,"And the Due Process Clause, and what we know is now the new system that was set forth and articulated last...."
2000.00-949,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1150.447,1151.182,In respect to that....
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1151.182,1151.901,Pardon me?
2000.00-949,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1151.901,1167.254,"In respect to that, if it were to start up again, if it were totally hypothetically, and you were counting just undercounts, I understand that you think that the system that's set up now is very unfair because it's different standards in different places."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1175.719,1185.169,"Well, one fair standard, and I don't know the complete answer to that, is that there would be a uniform way of evaluating the manner in which... there was Palm Beach, for example...."
2000.00-949,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1185.169,1186.575,"All right, a uniform way of evaluating."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1190.588,1191.15,"Well, the standard...."
2000.00-949,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1191.15,1193.009,You say the intent of the voter is not good enough.
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1194.54,1194.946,We want....
2000.00-949,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1194.946,1204.645,"And what in your opinion would be the most commonly used in the 33 states or whatever, or in your opinion, the fairest uniform substandard?"
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1204.645,1210.784,"Well, certainly at minimum, Justice Breyer, the penetration of the ballot card would be required."
2000.00-949,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1220.544,1222.294,"You're looking at, then, basically Indiana."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1228.745,1231.806,"It's certainly a starting point, and the...."
2000.00-949,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1231.806,1238.819,"Well, would the starting point be what the Secretary of State decreed for uniformity?"
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1239.771,1240.474,That is correct.
2000.00-949,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1240.474,1242.131,--Under the Florida legislative scheme?
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1242.131,1244.411,"I would agree with that, Justice O'Connor."
2000.00-949,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1244.411,1248.629,And what standard did the Secretary of State set?
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1248.629,1262.232,"She had not set one, and that's one of the objections that we had with respect to the process that... the selective process that existed and that we discussed in conjunction with the December... the November 21st position."
2000.00-949,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1271.025,1280.022,I understand that she has the expertise and let's assume that under Florida state law she's the one with the presumptive competence to set the standard.
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1284.676,1286.628,I don't think there is.
2000.00-949,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1290.534,1291.892,Even in the contest period?
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1291.892,1293.345,I don't... I think that that's correct.
2000.00-949,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1301.451,1302.107,"No, if there's...."
2000.00-949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1302.107,1303.576,If this were remanded....
2000.00-949,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1303.576,1303.998,Go ahead.
2000.00-949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1303.998,1304.81,I'm sorry.
2000.00-949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1304.81,1322.567,"If this were remanded to the Leon County Circuit Court and the judge of that court addressed the Secretary of State, who arguably either is or could be made a party, and said please tell us what the standard ought to be, we will be advised by your opinion, that would be feasible, wouldn't it?"
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1322.567,1323.551,I think it would be feasible.
2000.00-949,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1341.825,1344.777,But I would still like to get your view as to what would be the fair standard.
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1344.777,1348.807,"Well, certainly one that would... I don't... I haven't crafted it entirely out."
2000.00-949,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1350.635,1353.415,I would still like to get your opinion insofar as you could give it.
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1353.415,1357.069,I think part of that standard is it would have to be applied uniformly.
2000.00-949,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1369.658,1373.812,"Mr. Olson, was the Palm Beach standard that you referred in your brief applied statewide and uniformly?"
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1381.387,1383.137,"I believe it was not, Justice Stevens."
2000.00-949,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1383.137,1392.556,And can we possibly infer from the failure of the Secretary of State to promulgate a statewide standard that she might have inferred that the intent of the voter is an adequate standard?
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1392.556,1395.507,"No, I don't think it's a fair inference either way."
2000.00-949,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1412.953,1423.932,"Mr. Olson, you have said the intent of the voters simply won't do, it's too vague, it's too subjective, but at least, at least those words, intent of the voter, come from the legislature."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1442.192,1455.607,"Well, I think we have to distinguish between whether we're talking about a prospective uniform standard as opposed to something that changes the process in the middle of the counting and evaluating of disputes."
2000.00-949,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1456.654,1465.572,"But if we're talking about the contest period, and the statute, as Justice Souter pointed out, speaks with amazing breadth."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1489.609,1493.624,But we submit in the context of the entire election code itself.
2000.00-949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1506.073,1513.46,"Okay, but we have... there's no question that the closest we can come now under Florida law is an intent of the voter standard."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1539.418,1545.931,"I don't think it would be a violation of Article II provided that... I mean, if the first part of your question...."
2000.00-949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1545.931,1546.369,"All right, so...."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1546.369,1559.411,"If we went from the standard that existed before, the dimpled chads, that that had not been a standard anywhere in Florida, if that change was made, we would strongly urge that that would be a violation of Article II."
2000.00-949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1559.411,1560.191,Mr. Olson....
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1560.191,1560.957,It would be a complete change.
2000.00-949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1560.957,1580.778,"It is also part of your case, is it not, that insofar as that language just quoted is concerned, the power of the circuit judge to prevent or correct any alleged wrong, it's part of your submission, I think, that there is no wrong when a machine does not count those ballots that it's not supposed to count?"
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1580.778,1582.635,"That's absolutely correct, Justice Scalia."
2000.00-949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1582.635,1592.662,"The voters are instructed to detach the chads entirely, and the machine, as predicted, does not count those chads where those instructions are not followed, there isn't any wrong."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1592.662,1599.457,"That's correct, they've been euphemistically... this has been euphemistically referred to as legal votes that haven't been counted."
2000.00-949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1636.473,1647.594,"But as to the undervotes, and as to the undervotes in which there is arguably some expression of intent on the ballot that the machine didn't pick up, the majority of the Florida Supreme Court says you're wrong."
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1666.696,1669.709,"Yes, that is our contention, and that has to be done."
2000.00-949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1678.268,1683.752,"What is it in the contest provision that supports the theory that that was a rogue, illegal judicial act?"
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1683.752,1688.077,"Because there is no reference to them, even though that process is referred to...."
2000.00-949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1688.077,1688.952,There's no definition.
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1692.608,1705.132,"In the context, in the context of the statute as a whole, manual recounts are treated quite extensively as a last resort for tabulation error at the discretion of canvassing officials."
2000.00-949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1705.132,1708.162,At the protest stage?
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1708.162,1708.553,That's correct.
2000.00-949,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1708.553,1709.053,Mr. Olson....
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1709.053,1711.177,We submit... and I would like to reserve the balance of my time.
2000.00-949,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1711.177,1718.721,"Mr. Olson, is it critical to your position that the Florida Supreme Court erred in its resolution of the shall/may controversy in its first opinion?"
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1718.721,1720.877,"I'm sorry, I missed...."
2000.00-949,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1720.877,1732.325,"Is it critical to your position, because you're tying the two cases together, that the Florida Supreme Court made that kind of error in its resolution of the conflict between shall and may in the disparate statute?"
2000.00-949,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1732.325,1733.247,I don't think it's critical.
2000.00-949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1746.834,1748.084,"Very well, Mr. Olson."
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,1750.973,1762.562,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.00-949,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1789.317,1797.673,"Which is federal, not state, and occurs in the safe harbor statute, or as a result of the safe harbor statute."
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,1797.673,1809.653,"Yes, Your Honor, but this Court in its opinion that it handed down in the initial Harris case pointed out that it was clear that there was a desire in which by the legislature to preserve the safe harbor."
2000.00-949,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1809.653,1810.715,"Oh, there is no...."
2000.00-949,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1810.715,1815.604,"I thought the Florida court accepted that, too, in its current opinion."
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,1815.604,1817.837,"--They did say that exactly, Your Honor."
2000.00-949,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1817.837,1820.868,"Mr. Klock, will you... you refer to the first Harris case."
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,1825.662,1826.536,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.00-949,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1826.536,1844.858,"Mr. Klock, will you address Justice Breyer's question of a moment ago, if there were to be a uniform standard laid down, I suppose at this point by the Leon County Circuit Court or in any other valid way in your judgment, what should the substantive standard be?"
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,1844.858,1846.637,I'll try to answer that question.
2000.00-949,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1895.603,1896.697,"No, we're asking, I think...."
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,1896.697,1897.242,No.
2000.00-949,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1897.242,1911.55,"Not what the Florida election law is at this point in your opinion, but rather if under the Equal Protection Clause, and I'm drawing on your experience as a person familiar with elections across the country."
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,1912.314,1913.08,"Yes, sir."
2000.00-949,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1913.08,1928.605,"What would be a fair subsidiary standard applied uniformly, were it to be applied uniformly across all the counties of Florida, including Broward, a fair uniform standard for undervotes."
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,1947.175,1952.922,"Without being disrespectful, Your Honor, I think you have answered the question in terms of phrasing the question."
2000.00-949,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1966.808,1976.008,"But in your opinion, if you were looking for a basically fair standard, to take one out of a hat, Indiana, or Palm Beach 1990, in your opinion would be a basically fair one?"
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,1976.008,1984.63,"If I were to take one out of a hat, Your Honor, if I was a legislature, what I would do is I would hold that you have to punch the chad through on a ballot."
2000.00-949,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1996.561,1997.061,Okay.
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,1998.826,1999.138,"Yes, sir."
2000.00-949,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1999.138,2002.075,"And the question on Florida law is simply this, what the statute is."
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2018.193,2018.709,Yes.
2000.00-949,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2019.615,2027.97,So why would it be illegal under Florida law to have a recount just to investigate whether this allegation is or is not so?
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2027.97,2031.516,The Justice's question assumes that they are legal votes.
2000.00-949,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2031.516,2034.999,There might be some in there that are legal under anybody's standard.
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2034.999,2040.544,"Your Honor, if they are not properly, if the ballot is not properly executed, it's not a legal vote."
2000.00-949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2144.798,2145.641,Let me just ask this question.
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2161.369,2162.446,"I don't think so, sir."
2000.00-949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2162.446,2165.243,"What standard would you use in the situation I propose, then?"
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2165.243,2168.211,"Well, Justice Brennan, the difficulty is that under... I'm sorry."
2000.00-949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2182.08,2186.406,"I understand, but my question is if you don't use that standard, what standard would you use for my hypothetical?"
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2186.406,2189.186,"The legislature would have to create one, sir."
2000.00-949,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2190.296,2194.263,You are saying that they can't interpret a statute in which there is no explicit definition.
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2194.263,2196.121,What I'm saying is....
2000.00-949,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2196.121,2196.902,They have to throw their hands up?
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2196.902,2197.386,No.
2000.00-949,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2198.885,2201.072,I'm Justice Souter... you'd better cut that out.
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2201.072,2203.431,I will now give up.
2000.00-949,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2216.644,2240.025,"But you go to the opposite extreme and say, it seems to me, that they cannot look, as Justice Stevens suggested, to a statute which deals with, and certainly a closely analogous subject at a near stage, and it seems to me that you in effect go to the opposite extreme that you are excoriating the Florida Supreme Court for and say they can't interpret at all."
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2240.025,2249.037,I think what the Florida Supreme Court should do in that instance is note the very tight restrictions that exist under the protest phase.
2000.00-949,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2265.609,2268.483,But that means the court apparently cannot define legal vote.
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2268.483,2269.545,That's correct.
2000.00-949,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2269.545,2272.011,Mr. Klock... I'm Scalia.
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2272.011,2272.574,"Yes, sir."
2000.00-949,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2276.338,2281.101,Correct me.
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2281.101,2282.351,It will be hard to forget.
2000.00-949,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2282.351,2312.215,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I had thought that although you don't take into account improperly marked ballots for purposes of determining whether there will be a manual recount, I had thought that when there is a manual recount for some other reason, and you come across ballots of this sort that you can count them, that for that purpose you can decide oh, look at, there is a hanging chad."
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2317.306,2317.728,Yes.
2000.00-949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2320.68,2323.772,It's correct if you use the intent of the voter standard in that situation?
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2323.772,2324.849,"Pardon me, sir?"
2000.00-949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2324.849,2329.52,"It's correct that you use the intent of the voter situation, standard in that situation?"
2000.00-949,1,31335,joseph_p_klock,,2331.254,2332.692,It is correct that that statute provides that.
2000.00-949,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2372.581,2373.565,"Thank you, Mr. Klock."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,2376.064,2380.282,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
2000.00-949,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2387.357,2390.777,"Could we begin with jurisdiction, first?"
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,2390.777,2391.214,Yes.
2000.00-949,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2391.214,2402.584,"The Supreme Court of Florida said that it took, that it was cognizant, and the legislature was cognizant of 3 U.S.C. Section 5."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,2429.996,2452.736,"I think, Your Honor, and obviously this Court and the Florida Supreme Court is the best interpreter of that opinion, but I think a reasonable interpretation of that opinion is to say that what the Florida Supreme Court meant by cognizant is that it was taking into account the desire to get the election over in time so that everyone would have the advantage of the safe harbor."
2000.00-949,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2455.407,2463.311,"Well, the language used in 3 USC section 5 is garden variety language so far as the courts are concerned."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,2472.229,2473.821,"Yes, I think it is, Your Honor."
2000.00-949,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2473.821,2474.243,All right.
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,2497.656,2518.803,"Except, Your Honor, what the Florida Supreme Court did I think in its opinion is to say that in terms of looking at how to remedy the situation, it needed to be cognizant of the fact that there was this federal deadline out there that was going to affect Florida's electors if that deadline was not met."
2000.00-949,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2518.803,2522.083,"Well, of course the deadline is meaningless if there's a new law involved."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,2524.332,2543.56,"Yes, but what I would say is that whether or not there is a new law, that is whether there's a change in the enactment in the language of the statute or the constitution, is something that has to be decided in the initial instance by the Florida Supreme Court interpreting Florida law."
2000.00-949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2543.56,2549.853,"There really... Mr. Boies, there are really two parts to that sentence of section 5 we're talking about."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,2566.862,2583.652,"I don't know exactly what was in the Florida Supreme Court's mind, but I think that in general what the Florida Supreme Court made quite clear is that the thing that was constraining it was the desire to fit its remedy within the safe harbor provision."
2000.00-949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2583.652,2588.229,So that's the finally determined portion of section 5?
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,2588.229,2589.213,"Yes, Your Honor, yes, I think that's right."
2000.00-949,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2600.113,2614.358,"Let me ask, could the legislature of the State of Florida, after this election, have enacted a statute to change the contest period by truncating it by 19 days?"
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,2614.358,2616.061,You mean by shortening it?
2000.00-949,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2616.061,2623.792,Without contravening the section which says that there should be no new law for the safe harbor?
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,2628.994,2631.727,I think that it would be unusual.
2000.00-949,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2635.74,2639.379,"Consistently, because that would be a new law under section 5, wouldn't it?"
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,2639.379,2644.47,"Yes, because it would be a legislative enactment as opposed to a judicial interpretation of an existing law."
2000.00-949,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2645.314,2648.906,"And in fact it would be a new law under our preclearance jurisprudence, wouldn't it?"
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,2648.906,2665.088,"I think not, Your Honor, because if you go back to the State against Chappell in 1988, where the Florida Supreme Court faced the very question of whether or not that sevenday period was an iron curtain that came down, the Florida Supreme Court said it was not."
2000.00-949,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2680.363,2692.467,"But if we assume the legislature would run contrary to the new law prohibition in the statute, wouldn't the Supreme Court do it if it does exactly the same thing?"
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,2692.467,2698.277,"Except what I'm saying, Your Honor, is that it wasn't doing exactly the same thing because it wasn't passing a new law."
2000.00-949,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2703.885,2710.695,"I'm not sure why... if the legislature does it it's a new law and when the supreme court does it, it isn't."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,2716.521,2728.765,"What I'm saying, Your Honor, is that if the supreme court had rewritten the law the way you hypothesized the legislature rewrote the law, it might very well be a difference."
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2771.2,2782.525,"Well, it was quite a different... I mean, there, indeed, telephone notification had been given within the deadline, and the actual written material was not submitted until a few days after."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,2819.9,2833.894,"I think the way I would put it, Your Honor, is that if you conclude that the Florida Supreme Court's interpretation of Florida law is either a sham or it is so misguided that it is simply untenable in any sense...."
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2833.894,2834.144,Right.
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,2834.144,2847.295,"I think at that point then you can conclude that what it has done is it has changed the law, but I think the standard is the standard this Court has generally applied in giving deference to state supreme court decisions."
2000.00-949,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2847.295,2849.934,But is it in light of Article II?
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,2886.278,2903.039,"I think, Your Honor, that if the Florida Supreme Court in interpreting the Florida law, I think the Court needs to take into account the fact that the legislature does have this plenary power."
2000.00-949,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2917.346,2925.669,You are responding as though there were no special burden to show some deference to legislative choices.
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,2939.726,2946.708,"I think there is in a sense, Your Honor, and I think the Florida Supreme Court was grappling with that."
2000.00-949,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2946.708,2949.192,And you think it did it properly?
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,2949.192,2951.191,I think it did do it properly.
2000.00-949,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2951.191,2965.451,"That's, I think, a concern that we have, and I did not find really a response by the Florida Supreme Court to this Court's remand in the case a week ago."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,2975.541,2991.456,"Your Honor, if I could, one of the things that was argued from the beginning by Governor Bush's counsel and accepted by the Florida Supreme Court was that the protest statute and the contest statute were very separate procedures."
2000.00-949,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3018.804,3037.656,"But I thought, and maybe I'm mistaken, but I thought it directed that certain votes that had been tabulated after the expiration of the original certification date were to be included now without reference to the point at all that their opinion had been vacated."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3039.578,3043.264,"--Well, there are three different groups of votes, okay?"
2000.00-949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3076.625,3077.203,This was a....
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3077.203,3079.015,Once you know they are valid votes....
2000.00-949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3079.015,3082.232,"This was a trial, Mr. Boies, in the circuit court of MiamiDade?"
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3082.232,3082.825,Yes.
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3143.269,3143.941,It not only said....
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3143.941,3144.643,--It's a part of the certification process.
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3144.643,3145.315,It not only said that.
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3148.017,3150.252,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3150.252,3158.826,"It said that those votes had to be certified, which certainly contravenes our vacating of their prior order."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3158.826,3165.353,"I think not, Your Honor, because when you look at the contest statute, it is a contest of the certification."
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3172.319,3180.941,"I understand, but this, but what the Florida Supreme Court said is that there shall be added to the certification these additional numbers."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3180.941,3182.253,But that's true in any contest.
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3184.159,3185.847,It's not added to the certification.
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3185.847,3187.017,"Yes, of course it is, Your Honor."
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3187.017,3195.107,"You may do review of the ballots and add more numbers, but as I read the Florida Supreme Court opinion, it said the Secretary of State will certify these additional...."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3195.107,3195.482,Yes.
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3215.989,3228.204,"The certification as rendered by the Secretary of State did not include those additional ballots for your client, and the Supreme Court directed that the certification would be changed to include those."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3228.204,3233.623,"But, but Your Honor, that is what happens every time there is a successful contest."
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3239.513,3239.732,It doesn't make any sense to me.
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3243.854,3244.448,Right.
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3244.448,3248.134,And here the certification was directed to be changed.
2000.00-949,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3248.603,3261.206,"By the way, does it matter if they said in Palm Beach and, Palm Beach and MiamiDade, the ones that the court said you must certify, if they were thrown into the other, said recount them."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3264.268,3265.862,I think you get to exactly the same place.
2000.00-949,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3265.862,3266.127,So it doesn't really matter.
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3266.127,3267.517,I think it doesn't really matter what they said.
2000.00-949,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3267.517,3267.97,But Broward might?
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3267.97,3270.25,But Broward might.
2000.00-949,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3270.25,3272.906,Would you object if they have a different standard to recounting those?
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3272.906,3273.936,Broward is a different situation.
2000.00-949,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3273.936,3274.202,Yes.
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3274.202,3305.034,"With respect to Broward, what you have is you have these votes that have been counted, and were included in the certification, and if were you to assume that that certification that came in on November 26th is somehow void, then those ballots would have to be considered just like the Dade and Palm Beach ballots, so I think there is a distinction between Broward and...."
2000.00-949,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3305.034,3313.592,"Do you think that in the contest phase, there must be a uniform standard for counting the ballots?"
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3313.592,3315.357,"I do, Your Honor."
2000.00-949,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3333.397,3333.647,That's very general.
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3367.46,3369.023,I think....
2000.00-949,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3369.023,3370.538,Could that vary from county to county?
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3370.538,3373.942,I think it can vary from individual to individual.
2000.00-949,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3376.754,3381.613,"So that, so that even in one county can vary from table to table on counting these ballots?"
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3381.613,3393.45,"I think on the margin, on the margin, Your Honor, whenever you are interpreting intent, whether it is in the criminal law, an administrative practice, whether it is in local government, whenever somebody is coming to government...."
2000.00-949,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3393.45,3394.996,But here you have something objective.
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3415.567,3437.011,"With respect, it is susceptible of a more specific standard, and some states, like Texas, have given a statutory definition, although even in Texas, there is a catchall that says anything else that clearly specifies the intent of the voter."
2000.00-949,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3447.897,3501.814,"But they have ended up with a catchall provision because I assume there may be cases in which the general rule would otherwise operate in which there is an affirmative counter indication to what the general rule would provide, but I think what's bothering Justice Kennedy and it's bothering a lot of us here is we seem to have a situation here in which there is a subcategory of ballots in which we are assuming for the sake of argument since we know no better that there is no genuinely subjective indication beyond what can be viewed as either a dimple or a hanging chad, and there is a general rule being applied in a given county that an objective intent or an intent on an objective standard will be inferred, and that objective rule varies, we are told, from county to county."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3509.232,3511.466,Let me answer both questions.
2000.00-949,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3521.212,3521.524,All right.
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3543.078,3545.373,I don't think so.
2000.00-949,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3556.12,3565.211,"Yes, but in jury to jury cases, we assume that there is not an overall objective standard that answers all questions definitively."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3600.868,3610.8,"I don't think, I don't think so, Your Honor, because... and maybe I am quarreling with a premise that says there are these objective criteria."
2000.00-949,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3630.62,3632.355,"All right, we're going to assume that we do have that."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3654.142,3661.499,"Well, I think that's a very hard question."
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3661.499,3663.326,You would tell them to count every vote.
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3666.044,3667.434,I would tell them to count every vote.
2000.00-949,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3667.434,3673.698,"Let me ask you, before you answer that question, Mr. Boies...."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3673.698,3691.44,"I think, I think I would say that if you're looking for a standard, and I say that not because of the particular aspects of this election... the Texas standard, if you wanted to specify something that was specific, gives you a pretty good standard."
2000.00-949,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3691.44,3693.126,"Let me ask you this question, Mr. Boies."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3704.122,3717.976,"Yes, that's what I was going to say, Your Honor, that what you have here is you have a series of decisions that people get a right to object to is all going through a process, the people are there."
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3722.177,3722.865,"Well, all right."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3784.933,3792.368,"Your Honor, I think what the court held was not include both Broward and Palm Beach."
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3821.73,3822.87,What do you mean?
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3827.042,3832.837,"I believe what he meant, it was discerning the clear intent of the voter, which is what they were both attempting to do."
2000.00-949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3832.837,3834.586,Was this the trial before Judge Sauls?
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3834.586,3835.024,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.00-949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3835.024,3841.084,"I thought he ruled against the contestants, said they took nothing."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3841.084,3852.281,"Yes, that is, that is right, but he did so based on what the Florida Supreme Court held, and what six justices of the Florida Supreme Court held were two errors of law."
2000.00-949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3864.793,3874.929,But the factfinding phase of that trial would be from... you say these were found as a fact in some... did he make findings of fact?
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3874.929,3875.413,"Yes, he did."
2000.00-949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3875.413,3877.802,What did he say with respect to this?
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3877.802,3883.333,With respect to this he said... he said it separately with respect to MiamiDade and Palm Beach.
2000.00-949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3900.981,3902.683,As opposed to just intent of the voter?
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3902.683,3903.292,"Yes, just intent."
2000.00-949,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3941.23,3945.962,"Were those dimpled or hanging chads, so to speak?"
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3945.962,3967.219,"Well, what he testified is that you looked at the entire ballot, that if you found something that was punched through all the way in many races, but just indented in one race, you didn't count that indentation, because you saw that the voter could punch it through when the voter wanted to."
2000.00-949,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3973.404,3974.685,With no holes punched?
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3974.685,3978.652,"With no holes punched, but, but where it was indented in every way."
2000.00-949,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3978.652,3980.371,That was counted as proper in....
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3980.371,3980.996,In Palm Beach.
2000.00-949,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3980.996,3981.449,Palm Beach.
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,3981.449,4001.253,"Another, another thing that they counted was he said they discerned what voters sometimes did was instead of properly putting the ballot in where it was supposed to be, they laid it on top, and then what you would do is you would find the punches went not through the socalled chad, but through the number."
2000.00-949,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4001.253,4007.75,"Well, why isn't the standard the one that voters are instructed to follow, for goodness sakes?"
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4012.828,4032.335,"Well, Your Honor, because in Florida law, since 1917, Darby against State, the Florida Supreme Court has held that where a voter's intent can be discerned, even if they don't do what they're told, that's supposed to be counted, and the thing I wanted to say about the Beckstrom case is that was a case that used optical ballots."
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4067.18,4071.678,"Mr. Boies, can I come back to this discrepancy between Palm Beach and Broward County?"
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4097.434,4097.872,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4097.872,4102.54,And those statewide certifications the Supreme Court ordered to be accepted.
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4121.737,4132.247,"Your Honor, the de novo review is in the contest phase, and neither Volusia County nor Broward County was a contest filed."
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4145.43,4155.768,But the determination that the circuit court has to make about whether it's necessary to have a recount is based upon the certifications.
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4155.768,4156.893,No.
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4158.564,4159.955,Which he then accepts--
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4159.955,4160.283,--No.
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4174.481,4176.526,"--You have to know how close the state election was, don't you?"
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4176.526,4177.745,Yes.
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4178.167,4180.041,For which purpose you'll accept the certifications.
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4180.041,4180.401,--Yes.
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4181.386,4182.198,And here--
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4182.198,4183.214,And you had a certification.
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4183.214,4187.399,"--And here you are telling him to accept it not de novo, but deferring to Broward County."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4187.399,4191.585,I think what the Supreme Court is saying is you have got a certification.
2000.00-949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4257.541,4265.493,"Mr. Boies, one of the dissenting justices in the Supreme Court of Florida said that meant 177,000 ballots."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4267.398,4268.554,No.
2000.00-949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4294.371,4301.884,"So if you disagree that 177,000 ballots will be involved in this recount, how many do you think there are?"
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4301.884,4303.884,"It's approximately 60,000, I think, Your Honor."
2000.00-949,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4317.082,4317.613,"Mr. Boies, can I ask, ask you this question."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4320.221,4321.861,That's right.
2000.00-949,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4321.861,4331.077,"And if that's the case, what is your response to the Chief Justice of Florida's concern that the recount relates only to undervotes and not overvotes?"
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4331.077,4345.617,"Well first, nobody asked for a contest of the overvotes, and the contest statute begins with a party saying that there is either a rejection of legal votes or an acceptance of illegal votes."
2000.00-949,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4345.617,4368.796,"But as a matter of remedy it's ordered a statewide recount in counties where the ballots were not contested, and that's where I'm having some difficulty, and it goes back to, in part to your answer that you gave to Justice Stevens... Justice Scalia about Broward County, and in part to the answer you are giving to Justice Stevens now."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4383.476,4387.882,Two parts to the answer.
2000.00-949,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4445.249,4447.311,They gave an example.
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4468.567,4471.879,There is nothing in the record that suggests that there are such votes.
2000.00-949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4484.639,4504.819,"I gathered from the opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida that the Vice President did not ask for as broad a recount as the Supreme Court granted, but that it thought that to do just what he wanted would be unfair and therefore out of fairness, they granted the wider recount, am I correct in that?"
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4504.819,4505.444,I think that's right.
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4507.958,4514.689,"Mr. Boies, I have one other perplexity about the scheme that's been set up here."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4559.406,4560.686,It's not meaningless.
2000.00-949,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4593.907,4646.246,"My concern is that the contest period as we have been talking about requires the setting of standards, judicial review, and by reason of what I take it to be your earlier position in the litigation, this period has been truncated by 19 days, causing the time frame of which we are all so conscious, making it difficult for appellate review, and it seems to me, and we are getting back to the beginning of this, that the legislature could not have done that by a statute without it being under law, and that neither can the Supreme Court without it being a new law, a new scheme, a new system for recounting at this late date."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4647.293,4665.738,"But, Your Honor, at this... leaving aside the prior case about the extension of the time for certification, which I think at this stage you have to leave aside because at the contest stage, what you are doing is you are contesting specific ballots whether or not they were included in the certification."
2000.00-949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4690.197,4693.819,"Including appeals to the Supreme Court of Florida, and another petition to this Court?"
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4693.819,4695.366,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
2000.00-949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4695.366,4708.565,"I said after the circuit judge says that the contest comes out this way, surely there is going to be an appeal to the Supreme Court of Florida and likely another petition to this Court."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4713.875,4722.089,"Your Honor, I think, I think the appeal to the Florida Supreme Court could have and indeed the schedule that was set up would have made that quite possible."
2000.00-949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4740.113,4741.066,"Just a minute, Mr. Boies."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4748.657,4761.184,"Yes, Your Honor, but as we did in this Court, we have done in the Florida Supreme Court a number of times and that is to do the briefs and have the argument the next day and a decision within 24 hours."
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4761.184,4769.602,"After the counts are conducted in the individual counties, wouldn't the Leon County circuit judge have to review those counts?"
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4773.475,4778.115,To the extent that there are contested or disputed ballots....
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4778.115,4778.379,Right.
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4778.379,4780.285,"--I think that may be so, Your Honor."
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4780.285,4783.3,"Well, wouldn't that take a fair amount of time and is that delegable?"
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4784.83,4788.11,We believe that it could be done in the time available.
2000.00-949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4822.658,4827.485,The supreme court said you had to do it all in the interest of fairness.
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4827.485,4829.124,I think that what....
2000.00-949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4829.124,4831.343,I thought you agreed with me on that a moment ago.
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4831.343,4832.514,"I did, Your Honor."
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4849.492,4854.505,"Mr. Boies, would you explain to me again how the protest and the contest fits in."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4867.97,4868.407,Right.
2000.00-949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4868.407,4872.391,Why would I ever bring that in a protest proceeding?
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4889.071,4896.957,"If you've identified the ballots, you could presumably wait and do it at the contest phase."
2000.00-949,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4900.19,4924.463,"I thought the advantage might be as described in the Florida case, Boardman v. Esteva, saying that the certified election returns which occur after the protest period are presumptively correct, and they must be upheld unless clearly outside legal requirements."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4925.946,4927.196,Your Honor....
2000.00-949,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4927.196,4929.897,Which would make it important to have a protest.
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4929.897,4930.866,I think that's right.
2000.00-949,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4934.316,4939.033,I think the Florida court has sort of ignored that old Boardman case.
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,4939.033,4949.249,"Your Honor, I think the Boardman case relates not to the counting of votes, it has nothing to do with the standard in terms of the intent of the voter."
2000.00-949,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,5014.112,5015.315,"All right, let's assume...."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,5015.315,5017.079,There's a sense where that may be an Article II issue.
2000.00-949,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,5017.079,5032.136,"Mr. Boies, let's assume that at end of the day the Leon County, Florida judge, gets a series of counts from different counties, and they heard those counties have used different standards in making their counts."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,5049.723,5050.879,Yes.
2000.00-949,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,5068.856,5077.618,"Then the fact that there is a single judge at the end of the process, in your judgment, really is not an answer to the concern that we have raised."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,5077.618,5079.178,"No, I think it is an answer."
2000.00-949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5159.974,5160.755,"Thank you, Mr. Boies."
2000.00-949,2,20629,david_boies,,5160.755,5161.38,Thank you very much.
2000.00-949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5161.38,5164.238,"Mr. Olson, you have five minutes 13 remaining."
2000.00-949,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,5164.238,5166.019,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2000.00-949,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5209.626,5216.998,"And there are different ballots from county to county too, Mr. Olson, and that's part of the argument that I don't understand."
2000.00-949,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,5231.867,5240.738,Certainly the standard should be that similarly situated voters and similarly situated ballots ought to be evaluated by comparable standards.
2000.00-949,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5240.738,5244.69,"Then you would have to have several standards, county by county?"
2000.00-949,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,5244.69,5250.72,You're certainly going to have to look at a ballot that you mark in one way different than these punch card ballots.
2000.00-949,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5355.164,5380.184,"Mr. Olson, do I understand that your argument on the equal protection branch would render academic what was your main argument that's troublesome, that is that we must say that the Florida Supreme Court was so misguided in its application of its own law that we reject that, and we, the Supreme Court of the United States, decide what the Florida law is?"
2000.00-949,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,5380.184,5384.543,"I'm not sure I know the answer to that question, whether that would render academic the challenge."
2000.00-949,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5396.771,5416.827,"But the Florida Supreme Court told us that it hasn't been changed and just looking at one of the cases that you cite frequently, the O'Brien against Skinner case, this court said, well, maybe we would have decided the New York law differently but the highest court of the state has concluded otherwise."
2000.00-949,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,5424.869,5442.253,"The only thing I can say in response to that is that what this Court said one week ago today, that as a general rule the court defers to a state court's interpretation of a state statute, but not where the legislature is acting under authority granted to it by the Constitution of the United States."
2000.00-949,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5482.783,5494.216,"If you start with the premise, a clear intent of a vote should count, where there's a clear intent on the ballot, it should count as a vote, can't you reasonably get the majority's conclusion?"
2000.00-949,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,5494.216,5500.416,"I don't believe so because we know different standards were being applied to get to that point, and they were having different results."
2000.00-949,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5500.416,5501.276,"Thank you, Mr. Olson."
