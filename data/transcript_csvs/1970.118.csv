1970.118,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,31.907,"We'll hear arguments next in number 118, the Ocala Star-Banner Company against Damron."
1970.118,0,28303,harold_b_wahl,,33.488,37.291,"Mr. Chief Justice, gentlemen of the Court."
1970.118,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,275.011,278.602,What's the significance of your position there?
1970.118,0,28303,harold_b_wahl,,282.686,290.45,"Malice in a libel suit, yes sir, certainly, under New York Times, you'd have to allege malice."
1970.118,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,369.592,376.68,"Mr. Wahl, the salary of the office to which your -- to which this gentleman was an aspirant was $9,000.00 a year."
1970.118,0,28303,harold_b_wahl,,376.68,385.929,"And our understanding and it's pure hearsay, is that the jury verdict was made of two-year salary, $18,000 and the extra was a little bonus, that's where the verdict came from."
1970.118,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,385.929,389.755,"Well, he also lost his bid for re-election as mayor."
1970.118,0,28303,harold_b_wahl,,389.755,390.872,"Well, he didn't get paid in that."
1970.118,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,390.872,391.706,That was a non-paying job.
1970.118,0,28303,harold_b_wahl,,391.706,393.188,That was a non-paying job.
1970.118,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,393.188,393.543,Sure --
1970.118,0,28303,harold_b_wahl,,393.543,402.096,"But the whole thrust of the case, Mr. Justice Stewart was that this article was published right in the middle of the election campaign, when it was too late for me to do anything about it."
1970.118,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,410.783,418.525,Would you think a jury could reasonably find that he lost the election because of the article?
1970.118,0,28303,harold_b_wahl,,418.525,419.104,"Well, it's all that he did --"
1970.118,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,419.104,420.642,Setting aside all of the factors?
1970.118,0,28303,harold_b_wahl,,420.642,422.804,"Yes, because there isn't any question that we made a mistake."
1970.118,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,422.804,424.224,Could they reasonably find it?
1970.118,0,28303,harold_b_wahl,,424.224,441.052,"Yes, I don't think there's -- that was his whole theory and if you erroneously accuse a man of being indicted for perjury under civil rights case, under rule of Florida in 1966, well he's goner, short of being elected to public office, there isn't any question about that."
1970.118,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,441.052,447.842,Was there any evidence of injury to him in addition to or except for this public office?
1970.118,0,28303,harold_b_wahl,,447.842,448.65,"Oh, yes."
1970.118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,625.06,629.576,"Well, didn't somebody in the paper know that this was false?"
1970.118,0,28303,harold_b_wahl,,629.576,631.333,"Well, the reporter who called it in --"
1970.118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,631.333,632.862,Knew it was false?
1970.118,0,28303,harold_b_wahl,,632.862,633.147,That the report --
1970.118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,633.147,635.4,Everybody else on the newspaper knew it was false?
1970.118,0,28303,harold_b_wahl,,635.4,637.136,"That's right, everybody."
1970.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,646.765,648.922,At what stage was the campaign was at --
1970.118,0,28303,harold_b_wahl,,648.922,650.12,Right the middle of it.
1970.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,650.12,650.651,What?
1970.118,0,28303,harold_b_wahl,,650.651,652.696,"Right in the middle, two or three weeks before the election."
1970.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,652.696,653.813,Two or three weeks?
1970.118,0,28303,harold_b_wahl,,653.813,661.261,"As I understand it, right square in the middle of it and I agree with you that the man who wrote this story was in error."
1970.118,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,670.938,673.585,"What did they do about it, if anything?"
1970.118,0,28303,harold_b_wahl,,673.585,678.173,"The next day, the newspaper ran a retraction and said, “We're sorry."
1970.118,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,738.48,741.668,"You mean he is bound by New York Times, that's what you mean?"
1970.118,0,28303,harold_b_wahl,,741.668,743.533,That's right.
1970.118,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,743.533,746.376,He has put himself in the news -- New York Times case?
1970.118,0,28303,harold_b_wahl,,746.376,749.107,"He's gotten in bad with the New York Times doctrines, yes sir, he can't get out --"
1970.118,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,749.107,752.481,You don't think -- you're not suggesting he waived any of his rights by doing that?
1970.118,0,28303,harold_b_wahl,,752.481,753.013,"Oh, no."
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1028.141,1033.174,"Mr. Chief Justice Burger, members of the Court."
1970.118,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1036.587,1038.113,Would you raise your voice a little counsel?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1038.113,1039.34,"Yes, sir."
1970.118,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1073.407,1087.084,"When the judge directed a verdict, to use the term that your friend used, he was directing that in effect pursuant to concession of liability?"
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1087.084,1090.099,"Yes, this is quite correct."
1970.118,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1090.54,1092.658,Where is it here in the record?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1092.658,1093.259,Sir?
1970.118,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1093.259,1098.898,"Where is that in the record that he admitted it, it's not in the record, liability?"
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1098.898,1110.786,"The fact -- the only place in the record that you can -- that has a direct reference to it, sir, is the comment of the judge at the time he directed the verdict."
1970.118,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1111.788,1114.832,"Where do we find that in the appendix, I don't have it my --"
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1114.832,1118.435,"It's on page 80 of the appendix, at the bottom of the page."
1970.118,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1118.435,1119.252,Page 80.
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1119.252,1122.871,"Yes, sir."
1970.118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1688.723,1695.767,Didn't your District Court of Appeal affirm this judgment only on the basis of New York Times that was --
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1695.767,1696.488,What happened on the --
1970.118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1696.488,1699.817,-- it was not applied -- was it not to be applied?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1699.817,1705.01,It affirmed on that basis because that was the point presented by the appellant at that time.
1970.118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1705.01,1708.153,And there was no further review in the Florida Court?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1708.153,1710.989,The Florida case was appealed to the Florida Supreme Court.
1970.118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1714.506,1727.647,"And so that we have it coming here as judgment in the Florida Court saying that on these facts, New York Times -- the New York Times rule is inapplicable?"
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1727.647,1729.682,"That is correct, yes sir --"
1970.118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1729.682,1730.427,And --
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1730.427,1731.01,-- based on the --
1970.118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1731.01,1736.159,"-- you're arguing here that it is applicable, but it was satisfied?"
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1736.159,1738.11,I'm saying three things Your Honor.
1970.118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1753.837,1755.2,They admitted their liability?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1755.2,1756.592,"Yes, sir."
1970.118,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1756.592,1758.458,But only for compensatory damages?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1758.458,1760.893,"Yes, sir."
1970.118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1778.885,1787.217,It's the only evidence of admitting liability and not relying on New York Times that material which you pointed out to us --
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1787.217,1787.439,"Yes, sir."
1970.118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1787.439,1788.558,-- In the appendix?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1788.558,1789.669,"That's the only matter of record, yes."
1970.118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1789.669,1796.82,There never was a request for any objection to judges instructing the jury on liability?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1796.82,1799.214,No sir.
1970.118,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1804.07,1824.043,"Can you enlighten us on page 80 whether the omissions of the bottom of the page after the judge's statement, “Well, I think liability as to compensatory damages is admitted in this case, what dialogue, what colloquy took place after that?”"
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1824.043,1828.49,We neither went into a discussion of the type of damages to be awarded.
1970.118,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1828.49,1846.702,Well then I should think that's quite relevant to the question that you have pressed on us that liability for compensatory damages was admitted and perhaps you want to supply that permission from the record.
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1848.186,1851.501,We have it right here and I'll be very happy to supplement it Your Honor.
1970.118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1851.501,1872.37,"Well, it may be that you're quite right that he should have been -- that the newspaper should have been precluded from raising this issue which they haven't raised at trial, but the Florida Courts under the Florida procedure doesn't seem to -- don't seem to have a taken that course."
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1877.102,1880.203,That's what I was trying to explain sir.
1970.118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1887.636,1888.482,"Well, I know but if the --"
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1888.482,1899.629,"And the argument at that point was that the libel complained of was a perjury charge unconnected with any office sought or held, that it was not within the purview official conduct."
1970.118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1899.629,1910.093,"But if the New York Times issue was out of the case because they admitted, they had admitted their liability, now why would they -- why would the Florida Court even deal with the issue?"
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1915.563,1928.981,"Your Honor, I mean Mr. Justice White, I'm sorry I cannot read into the minds of why the judge wrote that opinion they did, but it's obvious because the way in which they went over the directed verdict aspect of it, they didn't even get consideration --"
1970.118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1928.981,1944.876,"If the justice knew that we shouldn't reach this New York Times issue because the newspaper admitted that it didn't apply and yet the case comes here from the Florida courts on the assumption, on a wholly different assumption?"
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1944.876,1949.747,I brought this point up in my reply for the petition of certiorari.
1970.118,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1949.747,1960.679,How long was it exactly after this article was published before the election took place?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1960.679,1962.153,15 days.
1970.118,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1962.153,1962.986,15 days.
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1962.986,1963.853,"Yes, sir."
1970.118,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1963.853,1972.567,"Now, which is it, which office was it he claimed that he was defeated on account of that article?"
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1972.567,1977.777,"The evidence that went into the trial and I might point out this point, all the several -- there was two offices."
1970.118,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1984.639,1985.537,In the county?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1985.537,1986.858,"In the county, yes sir."
1970.118,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1986.858,1989.604,How many voters are there?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1989.604,1993.795,"I believe the ballot as returned somewhere in the neighborhood is 12,000 as I recall."
1970.118,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1993.795,1996.032,"How big, I mean --"
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1996.032,1996.675,And he ran for a third --
1970.118,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1996.675,1998.655,How big is the neighbor area?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,1998.655,2001.619,The area of Citrus County?
1970.118,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2001.619,2004.57,"Of the county, his running in."
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2022.534,2027.882,He ran a very poor third because the circulation of the retraction was so poor.
1970.118,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2032.995,2036.52,"Well, that seems a serious thing to me down in Florida?"
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2036.52,2043.111,"Well, in this particular county politics gets really hot down there in that particular county, Mr. Justice and --"
1970.118,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2043.111,2045.648,Didn't the judge have any civil rights case?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2045.648,2054.96,Civil rights case is passé in this thing and the only reference to civil rights we had in this thing was the original case that the brother James Damron was a witness in.
1970.118,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2059.083,2070.266,"Well, I know a little bit campaigns and I just couldn't imagine how a man would ever a think like that said about him and prove it wasn't true and then went overwhelming it?"
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2070.266,2071.315,It would seem so.
1970.118,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2075.397,2079.985,But a candidate can get things out very quickly if he has to by searching for anything.
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2079.985,2081.643,The record didn't show this.
1970.118,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2081.643,2081.962,What?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2081.962,2083.164,The record did not show this.
1970.118,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2092.96,2097.488,"But you would read later too if it was read the first time, why wouldn't it be read --"
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2097.488,2103.193,"The record shows that the retraction was printed in the lower right hand corner, a very small headline."
1970.118,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2111.648,2120.693,"When he published it in the lower right hand corner, the smaller headline, why didn't they go them and complain again, and insist he publish it differently."
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2120.693,2123.61,"They did, he tried everything he could."
1970.118,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2124.863,2127.382,Did he publish -- how many times did he published?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2127.382,2130.213,There was a retraction published the following day.
1970.118,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2146.583,2157.534,"Well, I don't know that that governs but I have just seen those things kick back on people so often when they make charges that are not true?"
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2157.534,2158.209,This is true sir.
1970.118,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2158.209,2161.064,It seems strange to me that it didn't help him instead of hurting him?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2161.064,2170.1,"Not only did he lose this but he also lost his manorial job which more or less an honorary position, but he lost it in the next election which was held on an that basis."
1970.118,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2170.1,2172.953,How many times has he been elected as mayor before?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2172.953,2174.493,"Four times, I believe sir."
1970.118,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2174.493,2181.077,Maybe -- I don't see how they could attribute [Attempt to Laughter] that to the article?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2181.077,2186.814,I can only go for the record and the indication was that it was very detrimental to him.
1970.118,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2186.814,2187.108,I suppose that --
1970.118,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2187.108,2188.998,But he got beaten?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2188.998,2190.658,He sure did.[Attempt to Laughter]
1970.118,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2190.658,2200.932,"I suppose at this stage, the posture of the case is that the jury thought that he had lost these jobs because of the defamatory statements?"
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2200.932,2204.742,It's not in the record and I don't like to go outside the record but I will – I will say this --
1970.118,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2204.742,2206.49,"But you don't have to go outside the record, do you?"
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2208.73,2227.873,"The jury's verdict does speak for itself but for one of my opponents closing argument, we both used the analogy to the jury, you can't look in a crystal ball until whether this man would ever won this election and we both argued this point of the jury and I think the jury did not."
1970.118,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2240.325,2244.292,"Mr. Dunn, may I just look again at pages 80 and 81 with you?"
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2244.292,2245.405,Yes sir.
1970.118,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2245.405,2250.704,"I gather, in your argument that there was an admission of liability?"
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2261.393,2262.274,"Yes, sir."
1970.118,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2262.274,2264.946,"Well, now what -- Mr. Aires was your adversary?"
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2264.946,2265.986,"Yes, sir."
1970.118,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2265.986,2280.236,"What does this mean over at 81? I notice there's a lot of omissions but by the Court that's right, and whether or not the plaintiffs suffered any damage by reason of it is a matter for them to decide."
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2280.236,2280.84,Right.
1970.118,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2280.84,2295.357,"Mr. Aires in other words, I don't take it that your ruling comprehends an instruction by you to the jury that they must return a verdict for the plaintiff because of the publication standing alone without more?"
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2295.357,2296.403,That is correct sir.
1970.118,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2296.403,2306.179,"Well, doesn't that imply that there's no concession of liability or not?"
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2306.179,2316.672,The format of the art -- of discussion with the Court at this particular point was whether the Court was going to tell the jury and I believe this is what Mr. Aires was after.
1970.118,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2329.45,2335.948,"Well, now where and what follows, Mr. Dunn that 81 to 83, I notice there are omissions."
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2341.555,2347.568,He told the jury that he had directed a verdict for the plaintiff.
1970.118,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2347.568,2350.512,Would you point that out to me?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2350.512,2352.965,It's not in the instructions.
1970.118,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2354.708,2373.491,"I think that you will find it if I may suggest it in your brief in opposition to petition for the writ in the first place on page five, in that colloquy even though it's not complete Mr. Aires, your opposing counsel said, he still has to prove his damages."
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2386.489,2388.505,"Yes, sir."
1970.118,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2388.505,2396.134,You argue I take it that this is consistent with your position that he had waived any claims about liability.
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2396.134,2397.744,That is correct sir.
1970.118,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2397.744,2400.826,"Well, do you think we can rely on the complete record when we see in this."
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2400.826,2402.178,Yes sir.
1970.118,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2407.735,2408.875,Do you know whether it's here?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2408.875,2409.769,I have copy here.
1970.118,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2410.812,2415.05,It should be left with the clerk if it isn't already on file.
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2415.05,2416.125,Alright sir.
1970.118,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2416.125,2418.063,The original record is lodged with the clerk?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2418.063,2419.197,Yes sir.
1970.118,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2419.197,2421.493,Unless our rules have not been followed in this case?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2421.493,2427.851,Yes sir.
1970.118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2428.751,2436.673,I still am being puzzled by the acts of the Florida Court of Appeals.
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2475.449,2476.751,"Well, I cannot answer the question."
1970.118,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2476.751,2482.978,"Well, on that same statute Mr. Dunn [Attempt to Laughter] did you oppose on the appeal to the part of Florida Court of Appeals?"
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2482.978,2483.227,"Yes, sir."
1970.118,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2484.289,2491.397,And did you -- was one of your arguments that why they can't have an appeal because they conceded liability?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2491.397,2493.085,"No, sir. It was not."
1970.118,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2493.085,2494.042,You did not make that argument?
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2494.042,2495.747,"Yes, sir, I did not."
1970.118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2495.747,2511.686,Because the Florida Court of Appeals starts right out and says it's contented here that --
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2511.686,2512.538,It's correct.
1970.118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2512.538,2517.296,-- the New York Times rule requires the proof of malice and there wasn't any --
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2517.296,2517.827,"Yes, it's correct."
1970.118,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2517.827,2527.383,"You want to answer this question, don't Mr. Dunn, but why didn't you take the position in the New York -- in the Florida Court of Appeals that they conceded liability?"
1970.118,1,44484,wallace_dunn,,2527.383,2553.072,"The reason the position wasn't taken, we went out in the left field of a ball park about that time and got off on New York Times versus Sullivan and it was at foreign language to me at that time and I was taking the position at that time that he was trying to say, yes, maybe we admitted liability, but we feel that these are the keys as governs, that's attack it to him."
1970.118,2,28303,harold_b_wahl,,2553.072,2554.253,May it please the Court.
1970.118,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2565.721,2576.499,"What do you say that Mr. Aires meant when he said at page 5 of the opposition to cert, he still has to prove his damages?"
1970.118,2,28303,harold_b_wahl,,2576.499,2578.92,That's because the Court had ruled against us.
1970.118,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2580.903,2590.393,"Did he say, when the Court -- when the Court announced, I think liability is admitted in this case, did he say anything?"
1970.118,2,28303,harold_b_wahl,,2590.393,2591.562,I don't know what he said.
1970.118,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2624.79,2633.159,"Well, are you suggesting that the Florida -- an appellate court in Florida would have taken some testimony on the subject at that stage of proceeding?"
1970.118,2,28303,harold_b_wahl,,2633.159,2634.693,"Well, it wasn't raised."
1970.118,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2635.77,2638.29,Wouldn't the Court rely on the record?
1970.118,2,28303,harold_b_wahl,,2638.29,2651.071,"And that nobody ever suggested to the District Court of Appeals that this point had been raised and it haven't been raised, I mean, it had not been waived as the record itself would show."
