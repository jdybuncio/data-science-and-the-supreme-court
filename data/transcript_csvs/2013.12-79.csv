2013.12-79,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.889,"We will hear argument next this morning in Case 12-79, Chadbourne & Parke v. Troice in the consolidated cases."
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,11.656,14.574,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-79,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,49.264,55.501,"I -- I think there's some problem with whether or not this was covered securities, but I also think that's not in the case anymore."
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,58.453,67.559,"Well, I certainly agree with you in the latter assumption, Your Honor, which is both lower courts decided this on the case that the complaint specifically -- referred to covered securities specifically enough."
2013.12-79,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,111.319,123.995,"So if -- if I'm trying to get a home loan and they ask you what assets you have and I list a couple of stocks and, in fact, it's fraudulent, I don't own them, that's a covered transaction, that's a 10(b)(5) violation?"
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,123.995,125.528,"--Well, I don't know, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-79,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,136.803,141.69,"Well, suppose you say you're going to pay off the loan by selling some stockholdings eventually."
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,141.69,145.842,"--Yeah, I think that probably would be covered, Your Honor."
2013.12-79,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,163.385,165.154,"If they were covered securities, right?"
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,171.74,173.075,"Well, that's right."
2013.12-79,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,197.291,197.891,My goodness.
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,244.386,249.424,"Well, with -- with respect, I don't think in most of these cases anything is going to particularly turn on that."
2013.12-79,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,251.026,254.228,"I know that's what you think, but I need to know why you think it."
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,258.362,266.118,--Because there are lots of cases where whether you can prosecute a fraud or securities fraud is not going to make much difference.
2013.12-79,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,270.92,285.263,Tell me a case where the SEC has ever -- there may be such cases -- but what is done is somebody has simply tried to get a loan and he put on that sheet of paper listing assets a covered security.
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,303.743,306.961,"--Your Honor, I don't know that there are cases directly on point."
2013.12-79,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,348.205,361.613,"What if people reach a prenuptial agreement and as part of the prenuptial agreement they agree that in a year, one party to the marriage is going to sell as many shares of Google stock and buy a home with it."
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,364.982,368.266,I would think probably not at the end of the day.
2013.12-79,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,373.17,374.103,"Well, how is it removed from that?"
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,391.882,395.586,"--With respect, Your Honor, I think this Court has already crossed the bridge."
2013.12-79,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,414.48,424.938,"In all of our cases, there's been something to say when somebody can ask the question: How has this affected a potential purchaser or seller in the market for the relevant securities?"
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,426.738,427.89,"With respect, I disagree with the premise."
2013.12-79,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,428.74,435.31,"Somebody, not necessarily the victim of the fraud, but somebody has to have had some transaction in the market."
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,443.233,449.236,"--Well, the only way in which there isn't that kind of transaction here is because the fraud was bigger."
2013.12-79,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,479.587,480.089,"Well, what is the case?"
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,495.531,501.768,"I don't think there's a particularly close case, because A, I think the SEC has better things to do."
2013.12-79,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,501.768,502.535,Try--
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,502.535,503.135,And I think privately--
2013.12-79,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,503.135,506.839,"--is the SEC's closest case, but they may be better at answering this."
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,511.541,517.295,"--Well, I -- I think probably I would start with the Richard Line case, which is cited on page 21 of their brief."
2013.12-79,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,552.466,564.106,"Well, in Justice -- Justice Kagan's hypothetical and in some of the others, it seems that it's really irrelevant in whether the assets in question are securities or some other asset."
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,589.639,593.957,"I think that -- I would agree with that, Justice Alito, but for a slightly different reason than you may be imagining."
2013.12-79,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,639.238,648.627,"Does it matter that there -- apparently, that there is not an allegation that there actually were any purchases or sales of covered securities?"
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,660.351,681.665,"It doesn't matter, Your Honor, for the reason I indicated earlier, which is you don't want to draw a line that basically says, look, if you buy different securities than you were supposed to or you sell fewer than you were supposed to, that's covered, but if you're a Madoff and you go all the way and simply lie about the whole thing and there never were any securities purchases at all, that that's somehow better."
2013.12-79,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,681.665,682.766,What's your best case on that?
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,682.766,694.908,"Well, I think, again, if you want to start with SEC adjudications, again on page 21 there is the Jett adjudication where again there was a broker/dealer in that case, and they just made up the trades."
2013.12-79,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,737.418,746.957,"Mr. Clement, there are -- Zandford said that “ in connection with ” doesn't include ever common law fraud that happens to involve covered securities."
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,758.682,760.284,Sure.
2013.12-79,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,833.665,845.806,I had assumed that the purpose of the securities laws was to protect the purchasers and sellers of the covered securities.
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,853.143,854.078,"Well, there--"
2013.12-79,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,854.078,860.732,"It's -- it's a purchaser of not-covered securities who is being defrauded, if anyone."
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,865.62,867.37,"--A couple things, Your Honor."
2013.12-79,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,891.601,894.636,"It doesn't have to be the plaintiff's, but it has to be somebody's."
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,894.636,897.838,"Well, and here there are purchases of covered securities."
2013.12-79,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,902.24,903.659,"Nonexistent purchases, right?"
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,903.659,908.627,"--Well, as I said, I don't think anything turns on it, but there actually were some purchases."
2013.12-79,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,908.627,912.514,The only element of fraud in there was by the bank itself.
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,920.151,921.47,"Right, but--"
2013.12-79,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,921.47,922.32,--make any claim on that basis.
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,922.32,923.586,"--Right, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-79,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,936.694,939.946,"But somebody else -- somebody else was, right?"
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,939.946,943.583,"--Sure, and -- and the plaintiffs were clearly affected by this fraud."
2013.12-79,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,943.583,946.285,"Not by the purchase or sale, right?"
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,957.324,959.176,"And, again, that's true in so many cases."
2013.12-79,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,967.615,971.067,"Your white light is on, but what is the simplest formulation of your test."
2013.12-79,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,975.721,990.062,"The simplest, narrowest way to decide this case is to say that when there is a misrepresentation and a false promise to purchase covered securities for the benefit of the plaintiffs, then the “ in connection with ” standard is required."
2013.12-79,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,991.114,991.847,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-79,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1011.061,1014.163,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-79,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1033.724,1036.426,So how broad is the word “ benefit ”?
2013.12-79,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1039.378,1040.73,"--Well, I think--"
2013.12-79,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1040.73,1050.019,"Assuming we accepted your narrow test, which wouldn't address every situation that the other circuits have talked about, but let's -- let's--"
2013.12-79,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1050.019,1057.523,--I think it's clear that “ benefit ” isn't restricted merely to ownership of the securities themselves.
2013.12-79,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1061.477,1065.113,"--Well, that was the Madoff situation, which was different from this one."
2013.12-79,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1065.113,1069.83,"--Well, I don't think the Madoff situation is particularly different from this one."
2013.12-79,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1092.78,1105.088,"But the -- the case that he says -- I'm quite interested in your reaction to which cases that you've ever brought this would, if you lose here would prevent you from bringing, and Line was the one that because mentioned."
2013.12-79,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1105.088,1105.672,Yes.
2013.12-79,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1105.672,1113.609,"In Line, there is a broker who says to a client: Give me some money and I will buy some securities on the exchange for you."
2013.12-79,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1128.536,1130.052,I actually--
2013.12-79,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1130.052,1132.488,I don't think that that's this case.
2013.12-79,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1132.488,1152.917,"--Well, I actually think that the Line case is much more analogous to this case than Your Honor is suggesting, because what was happening in Line is the -- what the broker said to the victims was: You have children who are going to college, you don't want to have this money around because you want to be able to get financial aid, so give the money to me, and in several years I will give that money back to you with--"
2013.12-79,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1152.917,1155.45,He didn't say: I will buy them for you.
2013.12-79,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1155.45,1155.869,--Well--
2013.12-79,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1155.869,1166.575,And I can understand how a promise to buy securities for you is a promise to a person or a statement that would lead a person to take a position.
2013.12-79,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1194.844,1212.222,"--Your Honor, just to return to Line for a moment, and then I'd like to address sort of how the purposes of the securities laws are implicated in a situation like this, in Line, what the victims were told was that they were going to be given the money back after four years had passed with interest calculated above market rate."
2013.12-79,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1228.831,1230.933,"Anyway, Line's not a case of ours, is it?"
2013.12-79,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1230.933,1232.183,"--No, it's not, Your Honor."
2013.12-79,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1232.183,1233.302,"It's not a case of any court, is it?"
2013.12-79,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1233.302,1234.452,It is an SEC--
2013.12-79,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1234.452,1235.219,It's one of your cases.
2013.12-79,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1235.219,1235.654,--Yes.
2013.12-79,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1235.654,1236.221,Right.
2013.12-79,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1238.939,1247.293,"Certainly not, although we do think that the SEC's expert view in a formal adjudication may warrant some deference."
2013.12-79,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1247.962,1259.269,"Ms. Goldenberg, suppose I think that the correct test is something along the lines of what Justice Breyer just said, is -- is this the kind of representation that could affect somebody?"
2013.12-79,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1270.492,1272.094,"--Yes, I think so."
2013.12-79,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1317.989,1322.11,"Well, I mean if you went to church and heard a sermon that there are lots of people that are evil, maybe then you wouldn't invest."
2013.12-79,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1322.11,1327.747,"--Well, but this is much more particular, again, to the mechanism by which the securities markets operate."
2013.12-79,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1349.441,1356.097,"Well, but nobody is suggesting that the SEC can't take action with respect to the noncovered securities."
2013.12-79,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1367.535,1373.323,"Well, I think it's true that the SEC would continue to have tools, but I do think--"
2013.12-79,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1373.323,1381.995,"I mean, in fact, this -- it would inspire confidence to the extent that lawyers can bring these actions as opposed to having them precluded, which is what you're arguing for."
2013.12-79,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1383.931,1385.314,"--No, that's fine."
2013.12-79,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1457.045,1460.08,Can I take you back to the test that you think we should apply here?
2013.12-79,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1460.08,1460.397,Sure.
2013.12-79,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1460.397,1477.223,"The test that Mr. Clement articulated and that you agreed with seems to amount to -- to saying, when exactly what is alleged here is alleged, that that's within 10b or 10b-5, that's not that helpful as a precedent going forward."
2013.12-79,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1517.35,1529.841,"Well, I -- I think it's for the reasons that I gave earlier, which is that this goes to the purchase/sale mechanism, and that we know that people have to have confidence in that order -- in order for the securities markets to work."
2013.12-79,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1540.199,1549.488,"What troubles me, Ms. Goldenberg, is not the problem of our figuring out these economic consequences, but the text of the statute, which says,"
2013.12-79,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1555.042,1555.742,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-79,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1555.742,1557.76,There has been no purchase or sale here.
2013.12-79,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1557.76,1559.194,"Well, there's been a purported purchase."
2013.12-79,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1559.194,1563.647,It can't be in connection with a purchase or sale that has never occurred.
2013.12-79,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1582.209,1585.428,"That's true, Your Honor, but it also doesn't say the consummated purchase or sale."
2013.12-79,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1623.953,1625.203,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1628.923,1632.659,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-79,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1739.078,1741.28,I don't understand what the first textual flaw is.
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1741.28,1741.996,--Okay.
2013.12-79,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1742.363,1744.215,What is the jumping off point for this flaw?
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1744.215,1748.2,--The jumping off point is that there -- is the defined term “ covered security ”.
2013.12-79,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1748.2,1748.784,Right.
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1748.784,1755.872,So SLUSA only applies if there was a material misrepresentation in the -- in the purchase or sale of a covered security.
2013.12-79,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1755.872,1761.593,"Well, everybody -- the case proceeds on the assumption that the -- that the CDs were not covered securities."
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1777.869,1790.177,"Because Congress asked you or told the courts to focus on the question of what the product is that there was a misrepresentation in the course of the transaction, in the course of the purchase or sale, and that is only a covered security."
2013.12-79,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1796.18,1799.049,It doesn't say a misrepresentation about the covered security.
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1802.084,1814.578,"That's actually, I think, Your Honor, a really good point for us because the other side's argument up till the brief -- excuse me -- up until the oral argument is that it was a misrepresentation about covered securities that would trigger SLUSA."
2013.12-79,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1875.366,1877.151,Can you -- can you just give me the page for that?
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1877.151,1877.801,"--Yes, sir."
2013.12-79,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1885.49,1886.024,"Oh, no."
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1886.607,1890.476,"--It's in the cert pages at about page 12, I think, but we'll -- I will have it for you in just a moment, please."
2013.12-79,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1902.334,1903.036,"Well, wait."
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1907.171,1907.938,"--No, I do not."
2013.12-79,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1907.938,1908.571,All right.
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1910.023,1911.723,"Well, it -- it is a concession."
2013.12-79,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1931.452,1932.869,And you really don't agree with that anyway.
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1932.869,1936.438,"--I think that that is their best hope, and I don't think they can satisfy it."
2013.12-79,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1938.29,1940.992,"What is your position if the broker says,"
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1947.812,1955.401,"That is securities fraud, in our view, according to the SEC's administrative position."
2013.12-79,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1973.729,1976.065,"Well, I don't see how this case is that much different."
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1986.104,1986.637,--Okay.
2013.12-79,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2091.94,2099.694,"Mr. Goldstein, I take it from what you said up to now that you are not defending the Fifth Circuit's test."
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2107.465,2110.501,We -- we do defend that rule.
2013.12-79,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2175.592,2183.714,"But that's the Line case where, I am told by the government, you were trying to -- I know that Justice Scalia doesn't think it's important, but I do."
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2205.31,2205.827,--Okay.
2013.12-79,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2225.824,2227.14,Let's assume they were.
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2227.14,2227.524,Okay.
2013.12-79,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2270.0,2278.604,"That's true, but suppose Jay Fisk gets into his horse and carriage, drives up and down Wall Street, and says:"
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2293.03,2293.58,--Yes.
2013.12-79,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2294.547,2300.618,"So -- so now, here, what we have is Mr. Stanford, I guess, saying to people:"
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2306.021,2306.571,Yes.
2013.12-79,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2306.571,2307.189,Just like Jay Fisk.
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2307.189,2307.689,Sure.
2013.12-79,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2307.689,2308.156,Okay.
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2310.408,2313.86,Because the first completely messes up the stock market and the second one has nothing to do with it.
2013.12-79,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2314.56,2326.935,"In other words, if they had done exactly the same thing but with an intent or -- or maybe and the affect of a purchaser of stock or a seller of stock reacting to the statement, then it affects it?"
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2326.935,2328.801,"--Absolutely, because that's the sine qua non--"
2013.12-79,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2328.801,2329.185,Okay.
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2330.868,2331.468,--That's right.
2013.12-79,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2331.468,2331.818,Okay.
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2331.818,2332.303,And it's not.
2013.12-79,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2332.303,2333.77,Could -- could you go back to the Madoff case--
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2333.77,2334.17,Yes.
2013.12-79,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2334.17,2344.878,"--because you portrayed it as investors joining into funds that directly held stock, and I thought that it was more complicated than that."
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2344.878,2345.178,Okay.
2013.12-79,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2450.228,2450.578,I'm sorry.
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2450.911,2451.478,--Yeah.
2013.12-79,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2451.478,2452.496,--about 30 seconds behind you.
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2456.548,2457.314,Correct.
2013.12-79,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2457.314,2463.302,I thought there was an allegation that you were purchasing and selling covered assets.
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2466.504,2467.404,"No, sir."
2013.12-79,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2488.517,2489.269,By SIB.
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2489.269,2490.452,"--Yes, yes, sir."
2013.12-79,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2552.026,2556.078,That's exactly what I would like you to think about for a second.
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2615.699,2618.165,"If he does, it'll be the first time."
2013.12-79,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2646.569,2652.806,"Aren't those rather academic, because SLUSA wouldn't be a bar to them anyway?"
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2654.506,2669.249,"My point -- my point, Justice Ginsburg, I apologize, is not that those are affected by -- that those -- that rule affects SLUSA, it affects the SEC's ability to bring a felony prosecution, despite the rule of lenity on the basis that that's securities fraud."
2013.12-79,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2738.928,2743.83,"Well, all that's in the text of the statute is “ in connection with ”, which is open-ended."
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2746.182,2751.903,"Well, I do think that this was not in connection with the purchase or sale."
2013.12-79,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2784.14,2794.33,You're not contesting at this point -- I think both courts below assumed that the assets included stocks that would be traded on the exchange.
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2804.804,2805.521,--We are not.
2013.12-79,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2832.888,2838.892,Can I just be clear on your -- your position on the issue of whether there has to be an actual purchase or sale?
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2838.892,2839.294,Yes.
2013.12-79,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2839.294,2840.777,What is your answer?
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2843.163,2845.531,It is not essential to our position.
2013.12-79,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2862.34,2864.526,You don't want us to decide the case on that basis?
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2864.526,2864.976,No.
2013.12-79,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2864.976,2869.48,"You don't want us to issue an opinion that says there has to be a purchase or sale, and therefore, affirm."
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2869.48,2872.615,That is not the ground on which we have pressed the case in front of you.
2013.12-79,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2929.535,2932.654,"Well, if we decided the case on that basis, it really would be a one-off."
2013.12-79,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2954.936,2955.186,"No, sir."
2013.12-79,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3036.088,3037.504,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-79,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3040.723,3041.808,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2013.12-79,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3058.084,3062.053,Zandford is a case like that.
2013.12-79,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3062.053,3065.071,Zandford is a case from this Court that essentially says that as well.
2013.12-79,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3065.071,3069.308,"Would you -- among all the circuit courts, which test would you adopt?"
2013.12-79,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3069.308,3079.347,"I don't know that I would adopt any of them, Your Honor, because I think a lot of them make the same mistake, which is they get materiality, and they sneak it into the “ in connection with ” requirements."
2013.12-79,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3079.697,3081.866,Except Judge Sutton in the Sixth Circuit.
2013.12-79,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3081.866,3087.103,"--Yes, and I think if you were going to accept one test, I would accept -- I would ask you to have the Siegel test from Judge Sutton."
2013.12-79,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3218.438,3226.192,"Even if you're right about that, Mr. Clement, they also said there was a representation that this is insured by Lloyds."
2013.12-79,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3267.335,3269.021,--If I can answer.
2013.12-79,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3306.593,3307.16,"Thank you, counsel."
