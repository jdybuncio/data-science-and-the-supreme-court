2008.07-1410,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.737,"We will hear argument first today in Case 07-1410, United States v. Navajo Nation."
2008.07-1410,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,7.87,24.948,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Six years ago this Court rejected the Navajo Nation's claim for damages in connection with the same action that is before the Court here, the Secretary's approval of amendments to the tribe's mineral lease in the mid-1980s."
2008.07-1410,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,78.083,84.987,"Well, it said ""pertinent or relevant"", but surely that's limited to the statutory provisions that we examined in the case."
2008.07-1410,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,84.987,102.381,"But I think the way to look at it is what the Court said, that it found no warrant in any relevant statute or regulation, and it discussed not just IMLA but several other statutes which -- which did have to do with the economic -- excuse me -- the economic terms of leases, but--"
2008.07-1410,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,102.381,103.414,But the question--
2008.07-1410,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,103.414,103.898,--didn't govern.
2008.07-1410,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,103.898,111.135,"--But the question presented, General Kneedler, was limited to IMLA, to the Mineral Leasing Act."
2008.07-1410,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,111.135,111.602,Well--
2008.07-1410,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,111.602,114.72,--That was the government's question presented.
2008.07-1410,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,114.72,115.954,Two things about that.
2008.07-1410,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,325.907,339.981,Are there cases in the courts of appeals where Indian tribes litigate with the Secretary and claim an abuse of discretion for the way in which the Secretary performs the duties with respect to Indian lands?
2008.07-1410,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,339.981,346.135,"Under the Administrative Procedure Act, there could be -- there could be claims brought, but those would not be for money damages."
2008.07-1410,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,346.736,359.794,"--I -- I recognize that, but I want to know, is there a body of law in the Federal Circuit that generally recognizes that the -- that the Secretary has a fiduciary obligation that's enforceable as a matter of administrative law?"
2008.07-1410,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,359.794,365.114,"Not in the Federal Circuit, to my knowledge, because -- because the Administrative Procedure Act--"
2008.07-1410,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,365.114,366.53,--I meant all of the circuits.
2008.07-1410,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,366.53,366.93,Yes.
2008.07-1410,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,382.04,388.877,"--Well, what I was asking was whether there's some doctrine that the -- that the trustee -- that the Secretary acts in a capacity, a fiduciary capacity as a trustee."
2008.07-1410,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,399.833,401.619,"No, not -- not in the way you put it."
2008.07-1410,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,479.785,484.587,"--I -- this may be a purely academic distinction, but you talked in terms of liability."
2008.07-1410,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,493.693,496.143,I think it's really both.
2008.07-1410,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,560.151,565.139,"Under both IMLA and the Rehabilitation Act, leases have to be approved by the Secretary."
2008.07-1410,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,567.741,584.851,"Well, what the Court said in -- in Navajo specifically with respect to IMLA, the Secretary, yes, does have to approve it, but the Court specifically rejected the proposition that there was any basis for liability stemming from the Secretary's approval of the lease."
2008.07-1410,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,584.851,590.136,"Well, under the Rehabilitation Act, if it applied to this lease, what would the Secretary's duty be?"
2008.07-1410,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,590.136,597.842,It would be -- section 5 of the Rehabilitation Act for approval of leases is essentially the same as IMLA.
2008.07-1410,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,636.284,639.502,"The Secretary has to apply some standard, presumably."
2008.07-1410,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,640.502,651.393,"What -- what the Secretary has adopted -- has done is by regulation, is to say that -- that there is a minimum that the tribe cannot go below."
2008.07-1410,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,735.961,740.079,Is that in IMLA or is that in the Rehabilitation Act?
2008.07-1410,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,740.079,740.513,That's in IMLA.
2008.07-1410,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,962.407,971.512,The other side says that certain standard provisions in the IMLA leases did not exist in this lease.
2008.07-1410,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,973.095,974.345,No.
2008.07-1410,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,983.736,984.819,--With the forms?
2008.07-1410,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,984.819,986.938,The form on which the lease is used.
2008.07-1410,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1141.188,1150.96,"General Kneedler, the last time -- the last time around, we remanded for further proceedings consistent with our opinion."
2008.07-1410,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1156.762,1157.98,Yes.
2008.07-1410,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1253.473,1254.258,"Thank you, General."
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1260.578,1272.053,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think I would like to start with Justice Alito's question because he said: Doesn't section 5 of the Rehabilitation Act specifically require the Secretary to approve this lease?"
2008.07-1410,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1314.63,1319.2,"But, Mr. Phillips, I'm looking at the last paragraph in the opinion."
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1334.293,1336.343,"Oh, I would -- I would never assume that, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.07-1410,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1364.312,1365.679,I don't understand your answer.
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1370.299,1375.787,"--Not relevant to the question presented, which is the proper interpretation of the -- the Indian Mineral Leasing Act."
2008.07-1410,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1400.068,1407.406,"In the Rehabilitation Act, is the requirements for approval of lease, is -- is that applicable to mineral leases?"
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1407.406,1409.691,--Is that applicable to mineral leases?
2008.07-1410,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1409.691,1410.058,Yes.
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1410.058,1412.126,"Absolutely, it's applicable to mineral leases."
2008.07-1410,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1423.768,1424.218,I'm sorry.
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1428.922,1429.455,Mineral resources.
2008.07-1410,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1429.455,1432.207,"I mean, it says ""resources""."
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1433.89,1434.24,"Yes,"
2008.07-1410,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1439.794,1441.646,"That's a big difference, don't you think?"
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1441.646,1442.463,I'm sorry.
2008.07-1410,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1516.027,1533.073,Is it your position -- is it your position that it would be -- that it -- it is not lawful for coal on the Navajo Reservation to be leased under IMLA; a lease would have to be solely under section 5 of the Rehabilitation Act.
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1533.073,1533.773,"--No, I don't think it has to be solely under it."
2008.07-1410,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1569.912,1576.582,But the lease -- the lease doesn't follow the -- the requirements of section 5 of the Rehabilitation Act in -- in respect to its term.
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1595.146,1598.115,--I think the Secretary has to approve it under both of those provisions.
2008.07-1410,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1603.769,1610.406,What do you do about the fact that the term of this lease would -- would not be permitted under the Rehabilitation Act?
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1610.406,1620.011,I think it would be permitted under the Rehabilitation Act because the last sentence of section 5 specifically says that this is not meant to limit any other authority provided under any other statute.
2008.07-1410,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1630.152,1631.002,Okay.
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1678.567,1679.067,Yes.
2008.07-1410,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1703.784,1710.354,"But it's a special protection and special duty that applies to every one of the mineral leases, including this one, that the Navajo may be involved in."
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1710.354,1711.071,Correct.
2008.07-1410,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1711.071,1721.746,"So I -- what -- maybe -- maybe I missed the point, but would you go back to justice Scalia's question: How is it that there is not a conflict here between this lease and the Rehab Act?"
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1721.746,1731.935,"Because the last section of section 5 says that, notwithstanding anything else, this provision doesn't preclude -- doesn't -- doesn't limit authority that would otherwise exist."
2008.07-1410,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1731.935,1739.373,"But that, in effect -- but that, in effect, is saying this -- this provision will never apply to a mineral lease with the Navajo or the Hopi."
2008.07-1410,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1744.841,1748.729,Which is all that the Rehabilitation Act--
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1748.729,1749.145,"Oh, no."
2008.07-1410,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1755.549,1760.702,With respect -- my point is with respect to every mineral lease of the Hopi and the Navajo--
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1760.702,1761.002,Right.
2008.07-1410,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1761.002,1764.321,--you are saying the term provision never applies.
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1766.19,1766.69,"No, I understand."
2008.07-1410,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1776.379,1778.498,--But it only applies to those two tribes.
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1798.995,1806.415,But -- but -- but the important distinction -- and I hope I can articulate this -- is that section 5 applies beyond mineral leases.
2008.07-1410,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1806.415,1807.065,I realize that.
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1807.065,1822.443,"So that all -- so the time limitation of 10 years and 10 years, if you bring a barber shop, you want to build a barber shop on those lands, you want to lease the space in order to do that, you would be subject to the section 5 time limitations, unless for some reason there is another authorization somewhere."
2008.07-1410,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1822.443,1822.86,Okay.
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1831.466,1832.399,I need a haircut.
2008.07-1410,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1832.399,1842.69,"--on -- on trivial contracts, trivial lease contracts, there are term limits, but on the ones that really count, where the real money is, it doesn't apply at all."
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1842.69,1843.206,There is a--
2008.07-1410,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1843.206,1844.973,That's pretty strange.
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1844.973,1852.796,"--Raytheon has an entire defense plant on the Navajo tribe -- on the Navajo Reservation right now, that would obviously be subject to precisely these same limitations."
2008.07-1410,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1898.341,1902.729,"Let's assume that, and I -- I -- I think your argument is well taken."
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1920.774,1921.174,Right.
2008.07-1410,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1924.058,1925.142,What's not an authority?
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1925.142,1936.116,"--The notion that the Navajo tribe would be in a position to better -- to better -- to -- I'm sorry, to achieve self-sufficiency."
2008.07-1410,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1936.116,1936.433,Okay.
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1950.043,1950.693,"To be sure, there isn't--"
2008.07-1410,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1950.693,1952.443,--and this Court recognized that.
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1952.443,1952.912,--Right.
2008.07-1410,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1958.816,1960.699,With respect to that--
2008.07-1410,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1960.699,1961.132,--It expired--
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1961.132,1963.368,I'm sorry?
2008.07-1410,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1963.368,1977.527,"--the opinion in the last time around not only contained the statement that I read before, that is, ""any relevant statute"", but in the very beginning it says,"
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2011.95,2018.354,"Obviously, Justice Ginsburg, you are in a much better position to judge what was intended here."
2008.07-1410,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2057.062,2082.445,"--Mr. Phillips, the government says that by the time this lease was executed the Rehabilitation Act was a dead letter, that it was meant to stimulate economic activity on the Navajo Reservation, and there were funds appropriated for that purpose, and that had all been played out by the time this lease was -- was entered into."
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2083.88,2085.748,"Yeah, the government's wrong about that."
2008.07-1410,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2203.557,2210.229,So you are saying that 635(a) creates an inference that 635(c) creates the fiduciary duty?
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2210.229,2213.514,"--No, 635(a) creates the fiduciary duties."
2008.07-1410,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2239.665,2242.451,That's the part I'm not getting.
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2250.387,2251.056,--Right.
2008.07-1410,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2251.056,2256.008,"--the Indians can, among other things, for business purposes lease the land."
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2257.926,2258.526,Right.
2008.07-1410,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2259.093,2263.78,"And that doesn't seem much different from the IMLA, to tell you the truth, to me."
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2269.701,2270.168,--Right.
2008.07-1410,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2270.168,2283.426,"So I look at (b) and (c) and it says, well, when you lease something under (b) and (c), which is not (a) -- it's (b) and (c) -- you have to have all this supervision and so forth, or it has to be at a fair value, something like that; is that right?"
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2283.426,2285.111,"Well, it doesn't -- it doesn't--"
2008.07-1410,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2285.111,2295.066,"(B) and (c) say that land is owned in fee but, let's see -- what is -- sorry, I don't want to delay you on this."
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2302.655,2310.178,"--No, just to read (b), which unfortunately isn't reproduced I don't think in any of the papers, but it says:"
2008.07-1410,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2331.174,2337.162,So why does that -- why does that mean that this act creates a trust relationship?
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2337.162,2343.982,"No, that -- the -- the trust relationship doesn't come out of the (b) and (c)."
2008.07-1410,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2374.685,2380.505,"Well, give me an -- and incidentally, the statute is in opposition brief, or the orange brief, at page 5."
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2393.599,2414.162,"Well, that's for the sale of fee simple lands, so it's dealing with a very different set of -- of circumstances, which is talking about -- it's aimed clearly at a different set of properties that are being held and therefore they said, when you engage in leases for that kind of property there is no liability."
2008.07-1410,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2414.162,2422.149,"But your -- your argument is that simply because there isn't that kind of an exclusion in (a), there must have been an intent to permit liability."
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2422.149,2424.518,A fair inference I think is all that I have to demonstrate.
2008.07-1410,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2424.518,2435.576,"Thank you, but now what of course is at the back of my mind is I'm trying to see, is this -- is this statute stronger for you than the statute we already considered?"
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2443.43,2444.682,I wasn't here the last time.
2008.07-1410,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2444.682,2448.717,"So somebody thought maybe it was a weaker statute, so -- but I will put that suspicion aside."
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2448.717,2449.35,Can I answer--
2008.07-1410,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2449.35,2452.602,So that's the fundamental question in my mind.
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2458.589,2459.056,--Right.
2008.07-1410,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2476.248,2476.534,"So did you, Mr. Phillips."
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2488.592,2490.208,I don't know if those were from the brief.
2008.07-1410,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2516.592,2519.444,"Well, you are really saying that you were wrong in make that concession."
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2519.444,2520.896,"That was an overstatement, there's no question."
2008.07-1410,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2525.215,2526.215,In -- IMLA--
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2526.215,2526.883,"--is it's not IMLA, anyway."
2008.07-1410,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2526.883,2535.905,"--But it is the statute that seems most closely on point, because it's the only one that talks about mineral leases exclusively."
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2535.905,2546.844,"Yes, but this is the only one that deals specifically with the Navajo Reservation and deals with leasing for business purposes for the development of resources."
2008.07-1410,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2563.204,2563.421,But you knew all of that.
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2566.823,2571.858,"Well, we -- we obtained additional information, certainly, you know."
2008.07-1410,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2582.499,2586.035,And that affidavit was before or after our decision the first time around?
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2586.035,2589.569,It was after the first time around.
2008.07-1410,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2620.041,2628.979,I don't know that you can bring in Federal officials to -- to testify years after the fact as to on what basis they acted earlier.
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2636.883,2639.269,--Obviously--
2008.07-1410,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2639.269,2640.871,"If there was some statement at the time, I could understand it."
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2646.858,2648.858,"--He has a good memory, Justice Scalia."
2008.07-1410,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2677.544,2692.07,"--I thought that your argument earlier was that all leases of mineral rights on the Navajo-Hopi land are governed by the Rehabilitation Act, and it's not a factual question as to which statute anybody chose at the time of the negotiation of the lease."
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2701.26,2703.112,"--Well, I don't know that it's a factual question."
2008.07-1410,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2747.974,2756.162,"But that isn't really my question, because I've tried to erase from my mind any suspicion about why you did or didn't argue it last time."
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2775.208,2775.658,Right.
2008.07-1410,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2775.658,2776.008,Okay.
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2802.891,2804.96,I'm not sure I understand the last part about--
2008.07-1410,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2804.96,2806.945,"Well the regs you didn't emphasize, so forget them."
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2815.285,2815.785,--Right.
2008.07-1410,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2815.785,2818.403,"--and there you are, so I want you to add something to explain--"
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2818.403,2826.843,"Well, I would go back to Justice Alito's first question to Mr. Kneedler, which was, this provision has a duty, doesn't it, because it has an approval requirement?"
2008.07-1410,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2844.804,2845.387,--Okay.
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2845.387,2858.028,"And my answer to that is no, there is nothing in it; and contrary to the overall intent of IMLA, which was to guarantee self-sufficiency, the overall intent of this statute was to allow the Navajo to come somewhere in the area of the standards."
2008.07-1410,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2870.52,2880.81,"Even if you are right about the duty-creating aspect, what -- talk a little about the money-mandating aspect, the second stage of the analysis under Navajo 1."
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2880.81,2884.362,"Well, I -- I think the key to that is -- is sort of two-fold."
2008.07-1410,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2908.561,2918.268,"Before we find a waiver of sovereign immunity opening up the Treasury of the United States, we usually insist on something a little more specific than general trust principles."
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2918.268,2929.208,"And then the second -- I mean, if you are not prepared to accept the general trust principles, although again they go through the context of a specific imposed duty that -- that 635(a) has in the first instance."
2008.07-1410,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2951.074,2954.525,"Well, that's not how the Secretary reads 635."
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2956.727,2961.695,"Well, unless you are saying that -- I don't know in what context, Mr. Chief Justice, you're talking about."
2008.07-1410,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2993.984,2996.452,What did Secretary Udall think about this?
2008.07-1410,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2996.452,2998.47,"--He's totally on board with us, Justice Scalia."
2008.07-1410,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3058.943,3060.061,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
2008.07-1410,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3062.178,3074.638,"First, Mr. Chief Justice, with respect to the text of section 5, it doesn't -- it doesn't by any means suggest that it covers mineral leases."
2008.07-1410,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3112.228,3113.011,"Well, that--"
2008.07-1410,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3113.011,3113.611,But--
2008.07-1410,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3113.611,3114.328,--But it says
2008.07-1410,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3117.178,3119.63,"""In connection with operations under such leases. """
2008.07-1410,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3131.288,3136.656,"--Well, why isn't it a public purpose to develop Indian minerals?"
2008.07-1410,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3140.791,3144.226,"Well, it says ""business"" purposes, ""and as such""--"
2008.07-1410,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3144.226,3145.392,"--No, it says ""public""."
2008.07-1410,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3145.392,3153.248,"""For public, religious"" -- ""public"" would be like for a school, if a State was going to put a school on or something."
2008.07-1410,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3163.788,3165.889,And why did business purpose--
2008.07-1410,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3165.889,3168.257,"Well, even if -- if I may have just one minute, Justice Souter."
2008.07-1410,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3177.411,3179.28,The -- the example would be--
2008.07-1410,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3179.28,3182.915,--I just -- I just think you give too cramped a reading to section 5.
2008.07-1410,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3182.915,3194.206,"Well, the example would be, if you -- for example, if you were going to use water -- this is a Navajo reservation -- if you needed water for a business and sink a well, you would be utilizing or developing the natural resources in connection with a surface lease."
2008.07-1410,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3206.68,3209.882,--May I just supplement Justice Kennedy's question?
2008.07-1410,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3216.119,3218.419,Well--
2008.07-1410,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3218.419,3220.285,"--I mean, business purposes are included."
2008.07-1410,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3220.285,3231.743,"I -- I suppose they could, but in -- in the terminology, mineral leasing, as we explain in our brief -- that the categories of leasing that are -- have always been handled differently."
2008.07-1410,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3250.538,3254.258,Do the regs specifically address the scope of business purposes?
2008.07-1410,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3254.258,3269.768,"They -- they -- not beyond basically repeating them, but the -- but they, for example, talk about rental value, which is not the way you describe mineral leases, which are -- which are royalties, not rental value."
2008.07-1410,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3435.926,3437.076,General Kneedler -- GEN.
2008.07-1410,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3437.076,3439.443,--what governs the United States elsewhere to decide whether there is liability.
2008.07-1410,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3439.443,3440.562,Can I ask one question?
2008.07-1410,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3454.636,3455.419,"No, no."
2008.07-1410,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3522.863,3525.565,I'm not sure that's responsive to Justice Stevens's question.
2008.07-1410,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3528.517,3534.152,"Well, what the -- what the Court of Federal Claims said along those lines was a legal conclusion, not a factual conclusion."
2008.07-1410,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3608.635,3609.718,"--Thank you, General."
