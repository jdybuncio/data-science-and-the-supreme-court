1983.83-321,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.904,We will hear arguments next in Waller v. Georgia.
1983.83-321,0,28130,herbert_shafer,,50.266,54.551,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.83-321,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,161.504,172.062,"Does your argument extend to the suppression hearings conducted previous to the impaneling of the jury, as well as to a suppression hearing conducted after the jury was impaneled?"
1983.83-321,0,28130,herbert_shafer,,172.062,177.782,"Justice Rehnquist, we would not rest on so technical a ground."
1983.83-321,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,237.07,245.926,"Mr. Shafer, supposing that you had a suppression motion well in advance of trial, but it's closed by the court."
1983.83-321,0,28130,herbert_shafer,,265.554,299.394,"--The remedy for that violation, because it is such an egregious affront to the Sixth Amendment right to open proceedings during the entire course of criminal proceedings, and to the First Amendment, that there can be only one remedy without trivializing the significance of both of these amendments, and that would be to send it back for a new trial in its entirety."
1983.83-321,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,299.394,300.994,Nothing short of that?
1983.83-321,0,28130,herbert_shafer,,300.994,302.429,"Nothing short of that, no, sir."
1983.83-321,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,302.429,304.863,Are you positive about that?
1983.83-321,0,28130,herbert_shafer,,304.863,317.938,"To treat it as a mere procedural quirk, without cloaking it with all the grandeur of these two amendments, is to demean it."
1983.83-321,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,325.526,332.865,"Well, I took the Justice's hypothetical to say there was nothing wrong with the trial, the trial was open all the way."
1983.83-321,0,28130,herbert_shafer,,338.936,341.388,"--I'm sorry, I don't understand."
1983.83-321,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,341.388,353.445,"I understood that the hypothetical given by Justice Rehnquist was to the effect that the trial was perfectly open, the trial itself."
1983.83-321,0,28130,herbert_shafer,,364.003,369.705,"Justice Blackmun, we respectfully suggest not."
1983.83-321,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,420.59,423.625,"Mr. Shafer, may I throw this out at you on that very point."
1983.83-321,0,28130,herbert_shafer,,436.949,446.657,I don't think you can escape the fundamental affront for the closure.
1983.83-321,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,446.657,448.707,"In other words, your answer is you'd say the same result?"
1983.83-321,0,28130,herbert_shafer,,448.707,450.942,I would say irrespective of what the result is.
1983.83-321,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,469.237,482.996,"If you carry your argument to its logical conclusion based on the affront to the system, then even if your client were acquitted you must be pressing for a new trial to vindicate the affront to the system."
1983.83-321,0,28130,herbert_shafer,,482.996,487.115,"The problem is I couldn't get here if he were acquitted, Justice Burger."
1983.83-321,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,487.115,491.233,"You might if he waived the double jeopardy, you might."
1983.83-321,0,28130,herbert_shafer,,491.233,500.106,"Conceivably I might, but realistically, Mr. Chief Justice, it seems--"
1983.83-321,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,500.106,503.308,"Well, realistically you wouldn't want a new trial then, would you?"
1983.83-321,0,28130,herbert_shafer,,503.308,507.26,--If he were acquitted?
1983.83-321,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,519.669,526.323,Will you please tell me what provision of the Constitution gives you remedies for your discomfiture?
1983.83-321,0,28130,herbert_shafer,,526.323,528.34,"I know of none, Your Honor."
1983.83-321,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,839.977,845.064,"Mr. Shafer, I'm not sure that the question on the statute is properly here."
1983.83-321,0,28130,herbert_shafer,,859.474,864.093,--We did everything in our power to raise this question--
1983.83-321,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,864.093,864.61,"Now, yes or no?"
1983.83-321,0,28130,herbert_shafer,,877.02,888.577,"--We're unable to say, Justice O'Connor, what was suppressed and what wasn't suppressed and whether it was within the four corners of the warrant."
1983.83-321,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,952.318,956.103,"Well, don't we know what property was suppressed and what wasn't?"
1983.83-321,0,28130,herbert_shafer,,956.103,961.673,But we don't know whether it was authorized to be seized.
1983.83-321,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1005.618,1012.772,"Well, that's your last argument, but I'm trying to see whether this statutory question is even properly here."
1983.83-321,0,28130,herbert_shafer,,1012.772,1018.926,"Well, Justice O'Connor, all I can say in response to that is this."
1983.83-321,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1081.601,1083.819,What county in Georgia was this tried?
1983.83-321,0,28130,herbert_shafer,,1083.819,1084.885,Fulton County.
1983.83-321,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1084.885,1085.987,Right in Atlanta.
1983.83-321,0,28130,herbert_shafer,,1085.987,1086.887,Sir?
1983.83-321,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1086.887,1088.189,"Right in Atlanta, then?"
1983.83-321,0,28130,herbert_shafer,,1088.189,1089.072,Right in Atlanta.
1983.83-321,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1140.872,1148.311,"Well, if it's not properly before the Court then it simply means that you haven't preserved it to bring it to our attention."
1983.83-321,0,28130,herbert_shafer,,1151.88,1171.093,"Well, Justice Rehnquist, this issue has troubled me a great deal, but I have given the Court the very best answer that I can and I have to live and die with it."
1983.83-321,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1385.048,1398.023,"Well, do you think there's something inherently wrong with trying to search and seize in 200 or 500 or 1,000 places at once if they have the information?"
1983.83-321,0,28130,herbert_shafer,,1400.658,1402.76,"--No, sir, no."
1983.83-321,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1450.491,1452.36,"But some of it was suppressed, was it not?"
1983.83-321,0,28130,herbert_shafer,,1452.36,1456.744,"--Yes, it was suppressed because it was irrelevant."
1983.83-321,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1595.135,1597.771,Very well.
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1604.158,1608.979,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1983.83-321,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1715.098,1717.866,"Ms. Westmoreland, would you refresh my recollection."
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1722.335,1725.687,"The suppression hearing was closed for the entire hearing, Your Honor."
1983.83-321,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1725.687,1727.156,How long was that?
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1727.156,1729.608,"About seven days, Your Honor."
1983.83-321,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1729.608,1730.258,Seven days.
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1740.28,1746.617,"Your Honor, what the record reflects... and I don't believe it's broken down precisely in time increments."
1983.83-321,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1769.499,1771.251,Would it be hours or days?
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1771.251,1773.62,"--It would be hours, Your Honor."
1983.83-321,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1773.62,1774.303,Hours?
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1774.303,1775.02,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-321,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1779.607,1786.777,Does the state contend it should have remained closed during periods when that type of evidence was not being introduced?
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1786.777,1800.87,"Your Honor, what we submit is that the initial basis for the request for the motion was justified based on the fact that not only were the tapes being played, but other evidence was being presented throughout the entire hearing."
1983.83-321,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1857.107,1858.741,There was no renewal of the request?
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1858.741,1861.026,"Not that I recall on the record, Your Honor."
1983.83-321,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1861.026,1865.296,"At the end of the seven days, the judge did release some of it, didn't he?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1865.296,1876.937,"Your Honor, there was a discussion conducted as to the transcript at that point I believe it was made available to counsel, and I think the transcript has been made available at this time."
1983.83-321,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1879.806,1884.108,By the time it reached the Georgia Supreme Court it was public?
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1884.108,1884.958,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-321,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1891.245,1893.578,Open for the court or for the public generally?
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1893.578,1896.13,"For the public, Your Honor, to my knowledge."
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1896.13,1898.999,"Well, the tapes were played at the trial, weren't they?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1898.999,1900.601,"Yes, Your Honor, the tapes were played at the trial."
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1900.601,1904.386,"So it's all going to be made public there, regardless of their impact on other people."
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1904.386,1905.536,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1934.338,1945.896,"Well, the state's interest in closing it, it sounds to me like it would only be to protect privacy in the event you lost your motion."
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1963.757,1965.043,"--Yes, sir."
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1965.043,1967.726,--so you don't plan to protect anybody's privacy.
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1967.726,1969.545,"Your Honor, I think the state's interest--"
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1969.545,1972.03,"Well, what's the state's interest in closing the suppression hearing?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1972.03,1990.991,"--The state's interest focuses on not only the fact... there are persons who were not being tried at that point, who were not indicted, who subsequently I think were tried or were considered for trial, and the state was seeking to protect their rights, at least to the fullest extent possible, recognizing they could not--"
1983.83-321,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1990.991,1992.71,We'll resume there at 1:00 o'clock.
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2016.059,2018.844,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1983.83-321,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2071.745,2079.899,"Is it your position that if anyone else is involved or affected, that that is sufficient in itself to close the hearing?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2079.899,2103.867,"Yes, Your Honor, we would submit that... not just necessarily one individual, but in this circumstance we have the potential of so many individuals being affected and so many individuals' privacy rights being affected by the very nature of the crime that was involved, by the very scope of the gambling operation that took place, and I think that was one of the factors that was--"
1983.83-321,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2103.867,2107.068,So it isn't enough if just one person's rights are affected?
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2107.068,2109.601,"--That could be enough in a given case, Your Honor."
1983.83-321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2126.463,2133.719,"Well, Ms. Westmoreland, was there any reason that the proceeding could not have been open after the tapes were played?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2133.719,2141.64,"Your Honor, the obvious response is that there was still the potential for other evidence coming out, as I have noted previously."
1983.83-321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2141.64,2142.742,What kind of evidence?
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2142.742,2162.303,"For instance, other individuals' telephone numbers, names, and that type of information, which, while not necessarily within the restrictions of the statute providing for the publication, referring to the publication of wiretap evidence, still affects privacy rights of these individuals."
1983.83-321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2162.303,2166.523,Was any suggestion made during the proceeding that it should be opened at some later stage?
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2166.523,2168.373,"Not to my recollect, Your Honor."
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2179.665,2187.521,"Well, isn't this mostly speculation, though, about what invasions of privacy might occur?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2195.524,2199.828,There were no factual findings made on the record at the time of the closure.
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2199.828,2203.28,"Well, or off the record, based on an off the record hearing?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2203.28,2211.886,"No, Your Honor, although I think there was the opportunity there for a hearing should anyone wished to present any additional evidence."
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2218.706,2229.264,"Well, I take it part of your submission, then, is that these kinds of findings are not essential to close?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2229.264,2243.107,"A specific factual finding on the record we would submit is not essential to the closure of the hearing under the circumstances in this case, when it is important... when it is obvious from the record that the trial court did balance the rights."
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2243.107,2257.081,"Well, what would you say if at any suppression hearing the prosecution just got up and said, Your Honor, we'd like to close this hearing, and he said fine?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2257.081,2263.419,I would submit that in that circumstance the prosecution would have to go further than just merely requesting closure.
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2263.419,2264.187,"Well, why?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2265.687,2274.292,"In the instance that Your Honor suggests, the court has no way of knowing what right is available which should take precedence."
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2274.292,2279.446,"Well, I know, but you mean there would be some federal constitutional obligation to keep the hearing open?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2279.446,2285.517,"Your Honor, well, it would depend on what type of proceeding we're referring to."
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2285.517,2292.004,"Well, this is just a suppression hearing, and the prosecution says: Your Honor, we think it'd be better to close this hearing."
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2292.004,2296.122,"Your Honor, under those circumstances that--"
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2296.122,2300.174,"That infringes the defendant's right to a public trial, doesn't it?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2300.174,2302.876,--That's not necessarily the circumstance in which we would--
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2302.876,2308.514,"Well, I know, but would that violate the defendant's rights, without some kind of findings?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2308.514,2315.017,--We would submit that a suppression hearing is not such a proceeding to which a public trial guarantee necessarily attaches.
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2315.017,2320.171,"Well, why don't you just take that position, then, and forget this privacy business?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2320.171,2328.26,"That is one of the positions that we would take in this Court, Your Honor, and also obviously noting that the privacy right is--"
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2328.26,2330.243,"Well, suppose you lost on that, though."
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2359.196,2361.064,--Your Honor--
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2361.064,2373.206,Wouldn't the prosecution have to... perhaps you could have an in camera hearing and the judge could be told what was really involved in this suppression hearing.
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2373.206,2374.658,--There's a possibility--
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2374.658,2375.574,"You didn't have that here, did you?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2375.574,2377.693,"--No, Your Honor, there was no such hearing conducted."
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2389.668,2392.536,Although you don't think even that kind of a consideration was necessary?
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2392.536,2394.17,"No, Your Honor, we do not."
1983.83-321,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2419.937,2425.257,"Of course, here the jury had been impaneled and perhaps it was a part of the trial."
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2425.257,2443.235,"The jury had been impaneled, Your Honor, but we would submit that that is simply a procedural technicality that had taken place and does not necessarily make the suppression hearing any more a part of the trial than it would have if the suppression hearing had taken place two months prior to the actual trial itself."
1983.83-321,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2458.645,2462.947,Does that follow?
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2482.527,2489.331,"Your Honor, as noted previously, under some circumstances that could be sufficient, it might be."
1983.83-321,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2499.472,2503.341,Is the transcript available of what actually happened at this hearing?
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2505.626,2513.38,"Yes, Your Honor, there is a transcript of the motion to suppress hearing and what took place regarding the closure is transcribed."
1983.83-321,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2513.38,2516.332,The entire transcript of the suppression hearing is before us?
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2516.332,2517.582,"Yes, Your Honor, it is."
1983.83-321,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2517.582,2525.271,"How soon after the close of the suppression hearing was that transcript available to the public, to the press, for example?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2525.271,2529.473,"Your Honor, I am not certain as to how soon afterwards it was actually made available to the public."
1983.83-321,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2531.342,2534.976,"It became available at some point, did it not?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2534.976,2536.476,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe it did."
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2538.245,2543.332,"Well, why did it ever become available before you actually but the evidence, played the tapes at the trial?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2554.338,2555.223,"--No, Your Honor."
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2562.111,2562.927,"Well, who opened it?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2562.927,2565.163,And I don't know at what stage it became opened.
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2577.054,2579.154,"Well, you mean... I thought it was opened before trial, wasn't it?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2580.589,2583.291,"It was made available to counsel, I believe, at some point, Your Honor."
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2585.992,2590.461,But you don't think it was made public before the actual playing of the tapes at trial?
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2590.461,2593.913,"Your Honor, I simply don't know."
1983.83-321,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2598.65,2608.74,"Once the tapes were available and played in the courtroom, there'd be certainly no reason to withhold the transcript, would there?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2608.74,2611.108,"I can perceive none, Your Honor."
1983.83-321,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2613.358,2615.56,The cat was out of the bag by that time.
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2615.56,2621.564,"Whether through the suppression hearing transcripts or through the trial itself, the evidence was available, yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2621.564,2642.043,"Well, if the jury had been impaneled and this trial was going to go on just instantaneously after the suppression hearing, and you knew you were going to play the tapes, I don't know what interest the prosecution really had in closing the hearing."
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2644.745,2651.399,"Assuming that the prosecution prevailed at the hearing on the motion to suppress, that's a definite consideration."
1983.83-321,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2676.55,2681.602,Suppose you lose on this argument.
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2684.037,2684.62,Your Honor--
1983.83-321,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2684.62,2689.858,Can we just have... can the state just conduct a new suppression hearing and open it up?
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2689.858,2699.749,"--Your Honor, we would submit that the only remedy that would be appropriate or necessary assuming that we were to lose on this argument would be a new suppression hearing."
1983.83-321,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2704.451,2721.579,"But that's really ludicrous in a way, to say that you conduct a new suppression hearing where there's no suggestion that the absence of the public influenced a decision, which is purely a question of law, as to whether evidence should be suppressed or not."
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2732.803,2741.576,"Well, Your Honor, that would be true and would fall in line with our argument that there is simply no need for any such remedy in this case."
1983.83-321,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2748.797,2751.615,"Well, would we have to determine what the remedy is?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2756.668,2764.774,"--Your Honor, we would submit that perhaps the Court would probably give direction to the Georgia court as to what their remedy would be in this case."
1983.83-321,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2764.774,2766.591,I'm still a little troubled.
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2783.57,2786.938,That they can prevail under certain circumstances.
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2800.614,2820.159,"Well, I thought one of the interests you were asserting was the interest of the state, wholly aside from third parties, to protect your law enforcement function, other prosecutions and things like that, isn't it?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2820.159,2820.945,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2834.169,2839.739,You might want to protect some informers who might be revealed or surfaced in these things.
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2839.739,2842.274,That is also a compelling interest the state may have.
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2842.274,2844.108,In which event I doubt that you would play the tapes at the trial.
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2844.108,2845.843,"That's probably correct, Your Honor."
1983.83-321,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2845.843,2859.486,"But I still don't understand how you have a hearing, a suppression hearing, and reveal what has already been revealed."
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2871.544,2874.162,"Yes, Your Honor, at this point it is."
1983.83-321,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2877.114,2882.768,"But I still, like Justice Rehnquist, I don't see actually what anybody gets out of this."
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2882.768,2894.826,"Your Honor, that would be our submission as well, is that either a new suppression hearing would serve no purpose and a new trial is simply not warranted under the facts of the case."
1983.83-321,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2910.603,2923.91,"Well, what effect does that... was it Jackson or something against New York, where this Court said you should hold a confession hearing, Jackson against Denno?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2928.297,2931.016,"--Your Honor, I'm not sure I understand the question."
1983.83-321,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2931.016,2942.307,"Jackson and Denno says, where there was a charge that the confession was illegally admitted into evidence... despite the conviction, this Court sent it back to have a hearing on it--"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2942.307,2943.19,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-321,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2943.19,2947.794,--as to whether the confession was admissible or not.
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2947.794,2948.444,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-321,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2948.444,2957.983,"Well, on the basis of that could you send this case hack for a hearing as to whether the suppressed evidence should not have been suppressed?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2957.983,2976.111,"A new suppression hearing could be a potential remedy, and we would again submit that it's simply not a necessity, but that would be the most extreme remedy that would be warranted under the facts of this case."
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2976.111,2980.932,"Of course, there's a lot of thought behind the public trial."
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,3006.297,3012.368,"Your Honor, there is a speculation that it might very well be true."
1983.83-321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3034.167,3047.057,"Public trials, also sometimes people read about them, see about them; all of a sudden somebody shows up, I'm the unknown, as a witness, that completely refutes the state's case."
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,3047.057,3048.409,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1983.83-321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3054.563,3069.657,"Ms. Westmoreland, I gather that before the closure was ordered there was no proceeding to identify any state interest, compelling or otherwise, and any weighing proceeding of any kind by the judge."
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,3071.59,3076.894,"There was a... if you wish to categorize it, it was not really a hearing."
1983.83-321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3086.784,3102.211,"Is that consistent with what we said, at least in the context of that case, in Globe Newspaper about the necessity before closure of a proceeding of this kind, in which the state interest is identified and the judge can weigh it and all that?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,3102.211,3105.496,It seems to me that this circumstance is somewhat different from that.
1983.83-321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3105.496,3107.615,Because it's a pre-trial question or what?
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,3109.984,3116.888,"Your Honor, we would submit that it is actually, although the jury was impaneled, it still is actually a pre-trial type of proceeding."
1983.83-321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3126.259,3129.778,I know this is primarily a Sixth Amendment case.
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,3129.778,3130.813,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3130.813,3133.599,"But there's also a First Amendment argument here, I think, isn't it?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,3133.599,3138.901,"There is a First Amendment argument, I think, that has been somewhat asserted by the Petitioners."
1983.83-321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3148.942,3158.881,"Well, if it had been phrased, framed as a First Amendment issue, would you have a different position than the one you are advocating today?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,3158.881,3160.166,"--No, Your Honor, we would not."
1983.83-321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3160.166,3160.932,That's my point.
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,3164.384,3165.384,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3165.384,3167.82,A true First Amendment case.
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,3167.82,3169.105,"Yes, Your Honor, it was."
1983.83-321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3169.105,3173.474,And why shouldn't what we said there apply equally here?
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,3173.474,3177.692,"I think the circumstances are somewhat different, Your Honor, in the instant case."
1983.83-321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3177.692,3182.913,"Well, they are different in the sense that this is a motion to suppress and that was the testimony of the witness."
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,3182.913,3183.865,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3187.734,3200.792,"But the underlying reasons for requiring access and open trials, don't they apply to both, both to the context of the witness that we had in Globe and the suppression hearing?"
1983.83-321,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,3201.875,3204.993,"They apply, but not to the same extent, Your Honor, in this case."
1983.83-321,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3536.673,3538.125,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Shafer?"
1983.83-321,2,28130,herbert_shafer,,3538.125,3539.359,If the Court please.
1983.83-321,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3565.509,3574.282,What would you do after your new hearing on suppression?
1983.83-321,2,28130,herbert_shafer,,3576.417,3580.519,We would hope to.
1983.83-321,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3601.349,3603.234,"Well, it might be the hearing might be before another judge."
1983.83-321,2,28130,herbert_shafer,,3603.234,3609.538,"That is not before another jury, though, which would be insulated as--"
1983.83-321,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3609.538,3611.99,"Well, the suppression hearing isn't going to be before a jury."
1983.83-321,2,28130,herbert_shafer,,3613.44,3631.403,"--But the analogy I'm trying to draw, Justice White, is Jackson v. Denno was sent back for a new hearing on the question of the voluntariness of the confession, but that was a jury that was completely insulated from the events that had happened previously."
1983.83-321,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3633.736,3638.74,In Jackson against Denno the hearing that was going to take place on remand wasn't before a jury.
1983.83-321,2,28130,herbert_shafer,,3664.207,3672.295,I'm confused on that.
1983.83-321,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3809.686,3812.721,"Thank you, counsel."
