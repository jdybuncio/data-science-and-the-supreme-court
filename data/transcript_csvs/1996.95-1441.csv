1996.95-1441,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.226,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-1441, Linda J. Blessing v. Cathy Freestone."
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,11.149,13.601,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.95-1441,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,78.623,88.009,"Well, what was sought here in the complaint was something based on the substantial compliance requirement, was it not, in the complaint?"
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,89.429,91.961,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1996.95-1441,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,91.961,98.796,"There are, however, some provisions in the statute here that are very specific."
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,130.545,146.516,"Justice O'Connor, that is an important difference here in this case, and that is, once the State actually receives the money, then the individuals would have a right, a property interest in getting that money if the State is wrongfully withholding it, but that is not a statutory right."
1996.95-1441,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,150.17,152.411,"Well, it might also be a statutory right."
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,160.966,164.429,"--No, ma'am, not through the title IV-D itself."
1996.95-1441,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,184.511,198.6,"I would think some of the specific provisions might well fall within cases that we have decided previously giving individuals some rights, but this complaint was not based on any such specific request, was it?"
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,198.6,199.371,No.
1996.95-1441,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,200.453,218.453,"Now, in Arizona's brief here you seem to want us to address some other issues like the overruling of Maine v. Thiboutot, and some Eleventh Amendment arguments that were not raised in the cert petition."
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,219.024,220.536,--We have raised those--
1996.95-1441,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,220.536,221.766,Why should we get into those?
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,225.648,231.582,"--We did not specifically, but we think that they are subsumed within the question presented, and--"
1996.95-1441,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,231.582,238.548,"Fairly subsumed, so that people all around the country would understand you were going to be here arguing the overruling of Maine v. Thiboutot."
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,238.548,252.916,"--Yes, ma'am, and indeed the respondents, when they opposed our cert petition, said that we were doing just that, and that our petition loudly echoed that type of activity, and they have fully briefed the case."
1996.95-1441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,272.6,277.863,"But Mr. Delaney, that hasn't been the approach when 1983 is there."
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,305.853,311.115,--We believe that there would be a claim under either State law grounds or constitutional grounds in the property interest.
1996.95-1441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,311.115,325.604,"But what about a case where the parent was located, the noncustodial parent, and had a job, and the State simply refused to do anything about a wage implementation order?"
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,331.148,350.559,"No, ma'am, it would not be enforceable under title IV-D, because title IV-D again is a funding mechanism, and it's a funding relationship, and in order for the court... or in order for the parents to come in and say that they have an enforceable right, we need to make sure that they have one."
1996.95-1441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,353.193,363.509,"So your view is it's either all or nothing, so that there's no claim possible under IV-D no matter how specific?"
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,363.509,383.262,"And... correct, and in terms of the substantial compliance standard that Congress has laid out in title IV-D, again that gets back to the funding mechanism, when you have this funding relationship and Congress says in order to continue getting funds you have to perform at a substantial compliance standard on a system-wide basis."
1996.95-1441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,406.696,432.054,"Well, it notified the States that it wouldn't take its enforcement measures such as reducing, what is it, the IV-A money or whatever, as a result of something less than a failure, or substantial compliance, but it doesn't follow from that that there is no individual right if in a particular case there is individual crime."
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,432.054,441.311,"Well, in fact we think that it does follow that way, Your Honor, because Congress has developed a very comprehensive scheme in title IV-D."
1996.95-1441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,472.72,481.395,"I thought your point is it wasn't the deal, that the States when they went in thought that all they had to do was make a good faith effort and achieve substantial compliance."
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,481.395,482.817,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1996.95-1441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,483.716,492.192,"And if they have to achieve total compliance, at least insofar as being liable to individual suits is concerned, it's quite a different program they're buying."
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,492.192,498.376,"--It would radically change, Your Honor... just as you are suggesting it was radically change the agreement that we had entered into with the Federal Government."
1996.95-1441,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,543.286,550.092,"Well, the Federal Government has not yet suspended Arizona from the benefits."
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,550.092,555.254,"Your Honor, in fact the Secretary has found that Arizona is in substantial compliance."
1996.95-1441,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,557.345,565.862,"That's a surprising finding, in light of Arizona's recalcitrance in carrying out its program and its apparent inability to handle these matters."
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,573.686,574.507,--Correct.
1996.95-1441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,584.724,586.236,Has the Federal Government... excuse me.
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,586.236,601.713,"--In terms of Justice O'Connor's statement Arizona has done an abysmal job, as the complaint lays out, in 1988 Maricopa County, with no notice to the State, bailed out of the title IV-D program, and it dumped over two-thirds of all of the cases in title IV-D upon the State."
1996.95-1441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,646.483,649.825,Did the Federal Government intervene in the district court action?
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,649.825,651.596,"--No, sir, not in this case."
1996.95-1441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,651.596,660.873,There was a letter that said in 1992 Arizona was found in substantial compliance.
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,667.077,676.483,"Your Honor, that was actually a letter in 1994 based on the latest audit, that Arizona is in substantial compliance."
1996.95-1441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,676.483,678.984,"But it was as of 1992, was it not, or--"
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,678.984,682.948,"It was based on a 1992 audit, and no, there is not a subsequent audit that has taken place."
1996.95-1441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,682.948,711.486,"--Do I assume correctly that you would agree that if the agreement between the National Government and the State of Arizona, it had a clause in it providing that Maine v. Thiboutot would be applicable in the relationship between Arizona and the welfare recipients, that then the agreement would be sufficiently unambiguous and they would have the private rights of action to compel your enforcement, is that correct?"
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,711.486,720.381,"If it was that specific in the statute, yes, but it is not in this particular statute, and there are all sorts of mechanisms that I've already identified showing that it is not."
1996.95-1441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,720.381,745.971,"Do you also take the position that, regardless of how clear the general law might be... for example, Maine v. Thiboutot law... indicating that the welfare recipients would have an action for enforcement, that still there would be no action cognizable unless the agreement between the Federal Government and the States expressly referred to that unambiguous law?"
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,745.971,757.236,"We believe that that is what is required under this Court's decisions in Suter, and in Pennhurst, that in the Spending Clause context the States have to be put on notice what the consequences of their agreement or--"
1996.95-1441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,757.236,760.408,"Right, but the notice must be within the four corners of the agreement."
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,769.004,769.673,"--Yes, sir."
1996.95-1441,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,803.356,813.033,"But isn't... I haven't looked at Pennhurst recently, but wasn't it the problem in Pennhurst that the State didn't know for sure what its obligation was, not... the question wasn't whether there was a remedy if there were a clear obligation."
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,813.033,819.167,They... the problem there was that the States were not on notice what was required.
1996.95-1441,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,819.167,819.978,That's right.
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,819.978,820.136,Right.
1996.95-1441,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,820.136,821.819,But here you're on notice about what's required.
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,821.819,822.53,No.
1996.95-1441,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,825.912,829.573,By that you mean you're not on notice as to whether or not somebody can sue you if you fail to do what's required.
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,829.573,847.355,"--Yes, sir, and we believe that is a very significant difference, because if we're being told that we're going to be penalized by the Secretary and the Secretary alone, then we can deal with that, but to then have 18 million different individuals who can then walk in and demand enforcement is something completely different."
1996.95-1441,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,850.186,856.561,It seems to me that you're... even under your acknowledgement you're potentially liable to 18 million individuals if you don't give them the money that's coming to them.
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,863.135,864.856,"If I did, Your Honor, I misspoke."
1996.95-1441,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,871.431,876.623,I thought in answer to Justice O'Connor you said that if money was owing to a particular individual they could sue for it.
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,876.623,878.296,But that's different.
1996.95-1441,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,882.788,885.599,Aren't there 18 million people for whom that could happen?
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,885.599,895.607,"--If we are able to collect, but again, Nation-wide the collection rate is only 18 percent because of the significant problems in child support enforcement."
1996.95-1441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,895.607,900.91,What apart from... let's leave aside the question of the collection activity that we're talking about.
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,913.99,916.771,"We don't believe they could under title IV-D, no, sir."
1996.95-1441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,916.771,918.701,How would they do it?
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,918.701,923.654,If Arizona withheld the... if we collected the moneys?
1996.95-1441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,923.654,924.155,No.
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,943.038,943.997,"No, sir."
1996.95-1441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,947.12,949.383,"No, I... under the prior AFDC scheme."
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,949.383,955.766,"--Under the prior AFDC scheme I believe so, under Thiboutot, but that is different than our scheme, where we have this agreement."
1996.95-1441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,960.249,987.688,"No, but what is there... I'm sorry, but what is there in the AFDC law or in the agreement between the State and the National Government with respect to the administration of the AFDC scheme that gives them, or perhaps in your terms puts the State on clear notice that the individual recipients could bring an individual claim for the money in the case that I posit, which is not present with respect to the action before us here?"
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,989.889,1000.086,"--Justice Souter, I'm not as familiar with the AFDC case law or statute, just as you are not, but the significant difference is that--"
1996.95-1441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1000.086,1001.114,We're evenly matched.
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,1001.114,1005.969,--We're evenly matched.
1996.95-1441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1053.058,1065.297,"Well, that might very well go to the question whether you had fulfilled your obligation in an individual instance to try to collect, but I don't know that it would support a distinction in principle between the two cases."
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,1105.003,1114.0,"--And a lot of that falls back, Your Honor, to the issue of what the States were told, and we were told that we would have to substantially comply in order to get our funds, and--"
1996.95-1441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1114.0,1129.831,"So I think you're saying... I'm sorry, but may I interrupt you with this question: I think you're saying not so much that you weren't put on notice that you would have this obligation, but that the substantial compliance requirement in effect puts you on notice that you didn't have it."
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,1146.291,1158.74,"--Yes, Your Honor, that is a way of looking at us, at our argument, which is we were told that we wouldn't have to do it on a comprehensive system, and we were told not only in... with... in terms of substantial compliance."
1996.95-1441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1170.357,1190.362,"Mr. Delaney, in comparing the two, the direct benefit to the IV-A money, isn't there something like for social security benefits that there's an administrative route that you have to go first, and then if you're turned down, then you have further judicial review?"
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,1192.423,1195.875,There is nothing in IV-D that--
1996.95-1441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1195.875,1210.084,"--And in IV-A... I'm trying to get back to Justice Souter's question, when he said well, what if you were entitled to AFDC benefits and the State didn't pay them, under the old regime."
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,1210.084,1213.927,"--Again, that's different than what we--"
1996.95-1441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1213.927,1222.372,"And it seems to me that most benefit systems like that you have to make an application, get turned down, go through the administrative mill, and then end up in court."
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,1222.372,1226.013,"--Right, and again the key phrase there is a benefit program."
1996.95-1441,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1260.988,1261.566,What about the payments?
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,1350.395,1363.134,"--Your Honor, if we have actually received the moneys and we're holding the moneys and we don't distribute, then yes, we could be sued if we're wrongfully withholding it, but we could be sued not under title--"
1996.95-1441,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1363.134,1369.348,"Well, I would be amazed if the Constitution says you have to pay within 2 business days, as this statute does."
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,1397.225,1403.81,"--Your Honor, in terms... getting back to substantial compliance, or whether we have been in substantial compliance, we don't know yet--"
1996.95-1441,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1403.81,1405.843,"I'm not talking about substantial compliance, you realize."
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,1420.84,1422.232,"--At first glance, yes."
1996.95-1441,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1453.425,1455.204,Could I follow up on that for a minute?
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,1474.949,1475.948,"--No, Your Honor."
1996.95-1441,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1480.692,1486.446,"Well then, why is substantial compliance a defense to a Federal cause of action if it's not a defense to a State cause of action?"
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,1486.446,1501.476,"--The chief concern we have... and again, this whole line of questions has gone off on the issue of actually holding the moneys, and we think that that's a different situation because we actually have property that we are holding of someone else's."
1996.95-1441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1504.588,1510.933,The complaint would not argue that there's been a violation of any obligation under the act.
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,1517.536,1519.028,"Exactly, and--"
1996.95-1441,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1519.028,1521.639,When did title to that money pass to the individual?
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,1529.794,1536.279,"--Well, actually, it's done pursuant to a court order, and the court order tells the individual that they have to pay."
1996.95-1441,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1545.044,1548.277,What relief was prayed for here by the plaintiff?
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,1548.277,1558.682,"Sweeping relief, in that they asked for an order that Arizona be ordered to achieve as well as sustain substantial compliance."
1996.95-1441,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1561.634,1566.79,"So it wasn't just a request that money held by you be turned over to individual plaintiffs, then."
1996.95-1441,0,18777,c_tim_delaney,,1566.79,1567.949,No.
1996.95-1441,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1585.319,1587.162,"Very well, Mr. Delaney."
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1589.623,1602.683,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1441,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1643.94,1644.879,But the--
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1647.06,1649.333,The relief that was requested was double.
1996.95-1441,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1670.765,1672.668,"--Well, it didn't say that at all."
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1679.601,1680.122,--That's correct.

1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1695.283,1696.184,"That's right, but--"
1996.95-1441,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1696.184,1698.915,Your answer really wasn't very careful.
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1698.915,1700.444,--I was about to get to that.
1996.95-1441,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1701.426,1702.187,I hope you will.
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1702.187,1707.32,"--I certainly will, and what I was going to say about... I said it was double, and I was getting to the double part."
1996.95-1441,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1731.696,1732.676,What is your--
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1732.676,1737.791,"--injunction is proper is one that the Court could determine at that point, or the Court could determine now that isn't proper, but--"
1996.95-1441,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1737.791,1738.63,--What is your best--
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1738.63,1740.052,--that is not the substance or the core of this case.
1996.95-1441,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1740.052,1753.399,"--What is your best authority for the proposition that this suit, which in effect asks for an ongoing regulatory scheme to be implemented by the State of Arizona is not barred by Ex parte Young?"
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1753.399,1756.253,The best authority is Edelman v. Jordan.
1996.95-1441,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1756.253,1756.712,Pardon me?
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1756.712,1758.064,Edelman v. Jordan.
1996.95-1441,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1762.536,1765.517,"Well, Edelman v. Jordan required that a notice be sent out."
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1771.802,1775.705,--I did not understand that Edelman v. Jordan required that a notice went out.
1996.95-1441,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1779.228,1781.228,"Oh, yes, Edelman was--"
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1781.228,1782.29,--Edelman was--
1996.95-1441,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1782.29,1783.449,--Was for retroactive--
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1783.449,1786.3,--At that time was assuming that the statute was still in effect.
1996.95-1441,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1808.827,1840.427,"--Well, this case looks to me very much, frankly, as though the respondents were just asking the Federal court to step into the shoes of the Secretary at the Federal level and compel substantial compliance with the act, just as the Secretary's obligation would be, and to have the Federal court take over the entire administration of this IV-D act, and I never read that act as contemplating such a broad role for the Federal court--"
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1868.454,1883.016,"--At this juncture the issue in this case, as I understand it, is simply whether there are any enforceable rights of the particular kinds that are alleged here, and I commend again section 143, which really spells out what they are under 1983."
1996.95-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1886.767,1891.902,"Ms. Berzon, I'm happy to talk about the individual rights rather than the whole program."
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1922.811,1925.963,"I don't think he would, and I don't think that this bears any resemblance to that."
1996.95-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1926.974,1927.533,"Now, wait."
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1943.765,1945.355,--This Court's cases make that quite clear.
1996.95-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1945.355,1951.268,"--So we ask the question here, when 1983 was enacted, would these people be deemed to have rights?"
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1997.1,2008.787,"First of all, this Court has really crossed that bridge a long time ago, beginning with King v. Smith, Rosado v. Wyman, Edelman v. Jordan, Thiboutot itself, Wilder, Wright and so on."
1996.95-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2036.326,2037.305,Was this argument made in those cases?
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,2037.305,2037.836,--I'm sorry.
1996.95-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2037.836,2039.876,Was this argument made and rejected in those cases?
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,2039.876,2056.168,"I don't know whether the third party beneficiary argument was made, but certainly the argument that the only enforcement mechanism available is that within the statute and not the one that specifically expressly provided by 1983 was made, but I would also--"
1996.95-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2056.168,2056.869,Was there not some consideration--
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,2056.869,2057.568,--I'm sorry.
1996.95-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2057.568,2061.831,--Was there not some consideration coming from the third party beneficiary in some of those casess?
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,2061.831,2077.632,"I would say that there was probably a lot less than there is here, and here we have a situation in which the individuals have cognizable rights to the support, and what the statute is doing is assisting them providing services in obtaining the support, and I'd like to say in comment to--"
1996.95-1441,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2077.632,2087.938,"Ms. Berzon, there's an anomaly, isn't there, in that at least the Government is insisting that substantial compliance is none of the business of the beneficiaries."
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,2125.933,2129.045,"--Actually, it isn't true that that's all the Secretary can insist upon."
1996.95-1441,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2184.822,2192.687,So then what was the letter following the audit that says you are now in substantial compliance not with everything in the world but with IV-D?
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,2192.687,2202.503,"--The letter that... first of all, I believe, and perhaps the Solicitor General can clarify this, that it was not universal in any event."
1996.95-1441,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2220.185,2234.813,"I don't unfortunately have that particular brief with me, but I'm fairly certain that there was a broad statement that Arizona... we are pleased to tell you that Arizona is in substantial compliance with the program."
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,2234.813,2258.61,"But in any event, what I was going to go on to say is that the statute as read against Bell v. New Jersey, which has very similar provisions with regard to funding, would permit the Secretary to, for example, recoup misspent money and the regulations... with regard to IV-D money now, on a full compliance level."
1996.95-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2304.201,2308.054,Why do you think that's more draconian than the relief you ask for in this complaint?
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,2327.936,2332.208,"Again, I would like to suggest that the case at this juncture is not about relief."
1996.95-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2335.5,2344.396,"I understand that, but I'm just questioning your assertion that the substantial compliance provision only applies to some draconian relief."
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,2356.994,2381.241,"My argument was simply that the statute in terms makes it only available... only applicable to the relief, and that Bennett v. Kentucky Department of Education makes clear that when that's the case it applies to what it applies to and not to other provisions that do not in terms speak in other than mandatory, specific, and universal terms which the various provisions here do, and I'd like to say--"
1996.95-1441,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2381.241,2383.932,How could I find out which provisions you're talking about?
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,2425.17,2432.873,"--The... again, the complaint is quite specific about what provisions it's complaining about."
1996.95-1441,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2432.873,2434.736,It mostly said regulations.
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,2436.867,2437.858,"It mostly cites regulations, but those--"
1996.95-1441,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2437.858,2441.648,--So which... where do I find out which provisions of the statute you're talking about?
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,2441.648,2482.607,"--Primarily the provisions of the statute that we're talking about are the ones that derive from 654(4), which is the provision that says that each child is to be provided services with regard to location, paternity, establishment of child support orders, modification, and collection, and then there are various provisions in this statute and in the regulations that spin out exactly what that means, as well as provisions in the statute which spell out the fact that the regulations are binding on the States, and that the Secretary is to issue these very specific timing regulations, which he did do."
1996.95-1441,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2496.286,2512.896,"Well, can you give us at least an example of, if you're right that there is a claim that there is a private right, of relief that would be beyond question within the ordinary judicial realm?"
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,2512.896,2520.802,"I think the relief, and I... we say this in our brief, given the very specificity of the statute and the implementing regulations, it's really not difficult."
1996.95-1441,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2524.164,2524.604,Then how does a judge--
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,2524.604,2540.145,"As to the particular... I mean, obviously the person has to have standing as to whatever they're complaining about, and therefore, for example, Ms. Freestone's problem was that they were not withholding wages from her husband in the way that the statute requires, and the relief--"
1996.95-1441,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2540.145,2543.266,"--So the direction would then be, go after her husband, and that would be the relief."
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,2543.266,2547.679,"--Yes, and this case was pled as a class action and has been certified--"
1996.95-1441,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2547.679,2554.654,"But what about, as there are many people similarly situated and we can't identify them all because we don't have the records, go after all defaulting parents?"
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,2554.654,2567.373,"--If there was a properly certified class action and if it were proven that there was an overall pattern of not doing so after a trial, then ordinary equitable principles would apply."
1996.95-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2568.982,2571.714,"You said, Ms. Berzon, as the statute requires."
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,2582.843,2586.404,"--That's true, but the State has, and this Court has--"
1996.95-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2586.404,2597.113,"The State has agreed, so the issue is whether the State's breaking its word with the Federal Government gives the right to people who are not parties to that contract to come in and complain about it."
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,2597.113,2611.29,"--Once again, this Court, starting with Rosado v. Wyman, has dealt with this problem and in Rosado and a series of later cases has suggested the nature of relief which might be available here would be conditioned on the State continuing to take the money."
1996.95-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2622.779,2623.72,I don't agree that it's been--
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,2626.051,2628.432,--I believe Rosado was a class action.
1996.95-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2628.432,2652.849,"Isn't... you spoke of general equitable principles of relief applying, and I guess it's not clear to me that they necessarily would, at least I think in the way you intended, because in the usual class action case I think the assumption that we make going into court is that there is no one in effect who is going to act on behalf of the class except these particular plaintiffs who are suing on behalf of the class."
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,2697.497,2700.13,"Again, this Court's cases have never drawn that distinction."
1996.95-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2701.111,2702.42,Why shouldn't we draw the distinction?
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,2702.42,2703.512,--under the Social Security Act have been class actions.
1996.95-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2703.512,2705.412,Why shouldn't we draw the distinction?
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,2730.86,2738.624,I guess because it would be difficult to find... certainly it would be difficult to find any exception in 1983 which would preclude--
1996.95-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2738.624,2742.157,"--Well, 1983 doesn't say anything one way or the other."
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,2764.541,2776.549,"--I guess because the individuals in question who are class representatives, if they can prove a classwide relief, are simply doing what a class action proposes."
1996.95-1441,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2778.922,2780.703,"I think you've answered the question, Ms. Berzon."
1996.95-1441,1,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,2780.703,2781.294,--Thank you very much.
1996.95-1441,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2781.294,2781.794,Your time has expired.
1996.95-1441,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2784.596,2799.646,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1441,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2825.993,2826.804,"Where are you reading from, Ms. Millett?"
1996.95-1441,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2826.804,2827.095,--I'm sorry.
1996.95-1441,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2832.869,2834.311,Reply by whom?
1996.95-1441,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2834.311,2836.562,--The reply by Arizona.
1996.95-1441,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2836.562,2836.982,Whose reply?
1996.95-1441,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2836.982,2838.191,Their cert petition reply.
1996.95-1441,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2838.191,2838.562,Arizona's?
1996.95-1441,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2838.562,2838.842,Yes.
1996.95-1441,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2875.507,2882.521,"Ms. Millett, as to the criterion, the Government's brief said something about three different kinds of provisions."
1996.95-1441,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2918.054,2923.009,I think you have to look at the plain language of the statute and the regulations.
1996.95-1441,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2924.058,2924.9,"Well, you've looked at them."
1996.95-1441,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2924.9,2925.32,--Right.
1996.95-1441,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2925.32,2925.901,So can you give--
1996.95-1441,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2925.901,2926.6,Yes.
1996.95-1441,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2926.6,2929.233,"--Since you set out those categories, can you fill them for us?"
1996.95-1441,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2929.233,2929.731,Certainly.
1996.95-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2985.818,2986.679,Congress hasn't said that.
1996.95-1441,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2997.957,2999.429,--Your--
1996.95-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2999.429,3003.072,It's too misleading to refer to it casually as a right.
1996.95-1441,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3019.25,3020.011,"--Well, some--"
1996.95-1441,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3020.011,3030.317,"Then you have a 1983 right, and it's easy to talk cavalierly about rights, but every time you say right, I... you know, I think that's really what's at issue here."
1996.95-1441,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3030.317,3042.315,"--Sometimes Congress creates things that are recognized as rights outside the contract context, such as a Clean Water Act, a Clean Air Act, that don't apply to States until they choose to enter into an activity that is covered."
1996.95-1441,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3089.316,3118.504,"Yes, but there may be very few socalled privately enforceable rights here because the statutory scheme is one that essentially wants the States to be involved in a program to substantially carry out the Federal vision, and to be involved in substantially trying to help people collect child support, but clearly it's not going to be effective in every case."
1996.95-1441,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3158.062,3160.022,"Your Honor, we would disagree."
1996.95-1441,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3176.393,3183.258,"Does the Secretary have authority to do anything other than those draconian things, either suspend payment or dock payments?"
1996.95-1441,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3188.292,3195.906,We think that the Secretary and the United States generally has the same right under a contract as any other party to seek specific performance--
1996.95-1441,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3195.906,3197.758,And how about the Secretary herself?
1996.95-1441,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3232.669,3250.221,"--I think that you would have... a plaintiff would have serious standing problems that sound a lot like Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, where they were trying to sue the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to change a rule which would then require... supposedly require hospitals to change their conduct which then might result in benefits to the plaintiffs."
1996.95-1441,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3252.813,3257.446,"I don't see that, because here the Secretary can take away they money."
1996.95-1441,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3260.598,3262.94,We could take away the money.
1996.95-1441,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3272.767,3280.712,So your answer is that there would be... there is standing against the State Department of Welfare but there would be no standing against the Secretary?
1996.95-1441,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3280.712,3286.756,"--Right, because the person that... because what they want is services, and we don't deliver the services, and this was the same problem again in Simon."
