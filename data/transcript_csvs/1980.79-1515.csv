1980.79-1515,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.169,We will hear arguments next in United States v. Swank.
1980.79-1515,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,67.957,68.582,Thank you.
1980.79-1515,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,120.733,124.512,"But there are some differences, aren't there, Mr. Smith?"
1980.79-1515,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,124.512,137.352,"--There are some differences, Mr. Justice Blackmun, for the purposes, I think, that the case has come here... I think neither party thinks the differences are germane, but, you're right, there are some minor differences."
1980.79-1515,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,160.576,163.653,Could I interrupt you at that point?
1980.79-1515,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,163.653,163.997,Surely.
1980.79-1515,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,163.997,174.4,There is talk in one of the briefs... I think it's Swank... that the county agreed not to terminate the lease.
1980.79-1515,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,178.961,206.027,"No, we don't concede that point, Mr. Justice Blackmun, and we think it's a little late in the day for the Respondent Swank to be raising it, because while... may I refer the Court to pages 54a and 55a of the Appendix, which discusses this problem and specifically paragraph (c) on page 55a which says:"
1980.79-1515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,258.865,261.958,And it's only if they did that the issue is here at all.
1980.79-1515,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,261.958,262.614,Exactly.
1980.79-1515,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,262.614,266.034,And you wouldn't be here if they had... if you accepted--
1980.79-1515,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,266.034,279.935,"We wouldn't be here on that... because if the lease were terminated for cause... and in fact, there were other provisions of these leases that were terminable, because, for example, if the respondents didn't pay their rent or their royalties, the leases were terminable."
1980.79-1515,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,315.984,321.169,"--Mr. Smith, what would be your view if it was cancellable on one year's notice?"
1980.79-1515,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,321.169,332.914,"Well, the Internal Revenue Service's position, and it is our position, that one year is the line."
1980.79-1515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,341.879,344.987,It's not a matter of whether or not it's all right or whether it violates something.
1980.79-1515,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,345.299,352.172,"--No, no; essentially, it does deprive the lessee of the economic interest in the coal in place, because--"
1980.79-1515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,352.172,355.28,--Whether or not he can take the deduction.
1980.79-1515,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,355.28,355.858,--Exactly.
1980.79-1515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,355.858,360.373,"And is that a one-year, on the basis of a regulation?"
1980.79-1515,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,360.373,369.15,"That is on the basis, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, of a long-standing published position of the Internal Revenue Service, so-called GCM."
1980.79-1515,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,369.15,372.009,"Well, it's an announced--"
1980.79-1515,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,372.009,374.367,"Yes, it's an announced position which is 30 years--"
1980.79-1515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,374.367,380.333,"--Well, I've heard of ID's and Treasury Regionations, but GCM?"
1980.79-1515,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,380.333,384.395,--A GCM is an old form of ruling called General Counsel's Memorandum.
1980.79-1515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,384.395,384.69,GCMs.
1980.79-1515,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,384.69,407.167,"And this is a classic statement in the depletion area because what it did was, to permit lessees like an operator in this situation, but announced that if the lease... the lease had to be for more than a nominal period."
1980.79-1515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,446.791,447.322,Are they in the Appendix?
1980.79-1515,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,447.322,448.4,They are not.
1980.79-1515,1,34703,leroy_katz,,1606.868,1608.384,"Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Court:"
1980.79-1515,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1649.257,1657.77,"Well, isn't that designed to let him recover his capital in a?"
1980.79-1515,1,34703,leroy_katz,,1657.77,1658.332,"Yes, Your Honor--"
1980.79-1515,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1658.332,1659.645,Isn't it?
1980.79-1515,1,34703,leroy_katz,,1659.645,1660.456,--Yes.
1980.79-1515,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1660.456,1666.829,"And that was the conventional purpose, to take the place of depletion?"
1980.79-1515,1,34703,leroy_katz,,1666.829,1667.22,To take the place of depletion; that's right.
1980.79-1515,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1669.032,1684.508,"And so, to the extent that someone else gets depletion, well, at least I wouldn't suppose that people ought to get depletion on the same assets?"
1980.79-1515,1,34703,leroy_katz,,1684.508,1690.365,"--Absolutely... on the same asset, but not on the same... not get the same depletion--"
1980.79-1515,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1690.365,1691.006,On the same interest?
1980.79-1515,1,34703,leroy_katz,,1691.006,1691.209,"--Yes, sir, on the same interest."
1980.79-1515,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2836.294,2839.996,I just have a couple of points.
1980.79-1515,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2893.287,2900.939,"And then, in your view, the fact that they did stay there and mine the coal until it was exhausted in two out of these three cases has nothing to do with it?"
1980.79-1515,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2900.939,2902.471,Is absolutely irrelevant.
1980.79-1515,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2908.686,2909.389,"Thank you, gentlemen."
