1970.712,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,38.182,"We will hear arguments in the number 712, Triangle Improvement Council against Ritchie and others."
1970.712,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,40.734,43.681,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.712,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,93.955,97.502,How many have not yet been relocated?
1970.712,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,97.502,100.363,There are perhaps just the handful there at this moment.
1970.712,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,100.363,101.517,A handful of being what?
1970.712,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,101.517,103.787,Half a dozen.
1970.712,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,104.27,106.204,And what was in that time when the case got here?
1970.712,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,106.204,108.703,"How many were there at the time when the case is filed, approximately 300."
1970.712,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,108.703,109.768,300.
1970.712,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,109.768,123.034,Our position is that the changes in the facts and the changes in law determined only the form of the remedy and that the Court of Equity has the historic flexibility that equity had demonstrated to adapt relief to the circumstances.
1970.712,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,215.973,217.696,Would you say that under appeal?
1970.712,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,217.696,227.02,That has just been repealed by the Uniform Relocation Act which is set forth at length in our supplemental brief and it’s discussed in that brief Mr. Justice Brennan.
1970.712,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,403.763,407.495,"Well anyway, that expressly saves all rights under the old statute?"
1970.712,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,407.495,408.664,That’s right and that express the --
1970.712,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,408.664,412.297,So that for the new statute has no relevancy --
1970.712,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,412.297,416.243,"Well, it has relevancy as to the persons who had not yet moved."
1970.712,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,418.905,419.922,You mean the half dozen?
1970.712,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,419.922,420.366,Yes.
1970.712,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,424.093,429.401,"I know, but I mean the -- I suppose, there are some differences between the Uniform Act and the 68 Act, does it?"
1970.712,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,429.401,435.358,"Well, I think there is a matter of fact as we would argue it, they really not very material differences."
1970.712,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,446.028,451.944,"But why really getting at Mr. Greenberg, we don’t have to be concern on deciding this case with the provisions of the Uniform Act --"
1970.712,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,451.944,452.458,No.
1970.712,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,633.428,651.558,"One of the findings with respect to discrimination right at the outset here Mr. Greenberg, discrimination in the sale or rental housing, isn’t that a staggering point from which we got to build a case?"
1970.712,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,651.558,663.408,"Well, I would say, No, Mr. Chief Justice because the trial court should have had an administrative record before it and it should have appraised that administrative record."
1970.712,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,682.286,692.007,"Well, am I to understand then that you do not make a claim if this record shows pattern of discrimination in housing?"
1970.712,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,692.007,702.91,"Yes, we do make such a claim and we could sustain that if it were necessary to do that upon a de novo record, and indeed, there’s a considerable argument in our brief as to how the facts --"
1970.712,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,702.91,705.0,"The findings are the contrary, are they not?"
1970.712,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,705.0,726.36,"The findings of the trial judge are to the contrary, but those findings we think, are first of all, clearly erroneous and this were an ordinary kind of trial but clearly irrelevant and improper because they were not made upon administrative record such as this Court is indicated would be required in the Overton Park case."
1970.712,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1241.409,1244.126,"Thank you, Mr. Greenberg."
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1246.269,1249.51,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.712,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1341.718,1349.167,Would you agree that the very new statute is basically irrelevant to this case or inapplicable?
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1349.167,1351.267,"Your Honor, I would --"
1970.712,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1351.267,1352.846,The 71 statute?
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1352.846,1357.818,"Except with respect to our argument as to mootness, I would."
1970.712,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1368.092,1378.823,"Well, tell me Mr. Reynolds, are there other projects as to which the interpretation of the Section mentioned becomes important?"
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1379.303,1379.455,Yes.
1970.712,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1379.455,1382.631,"In other words, other projects of people not yet relocated?"
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1382.631,1395.638,"Your Honor, I believe there are other projects of the 9,000 miles of interstate highway that were fully -- not fully constructed or were under construction on date of enactment."
1970.712,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1418.198,1420.863,Is there any idea how many people happened to beinvolved?
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1420.863,1422.516,I don’t have any information as to how much --
1970.712,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1422.516,1423.786,"So, how about a few --"
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1423.786,1426.911,I assume that it would be quite a few on the --
1970.712,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1426.911,1431.056,So that the one fact that we have only seven involved on this particular project.
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1431.056,1431.498,"Oh, I'm sure."
1970.712,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1433.644,1433.832,No.
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1443.265,1444.28,Section 502.
1970.712,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1452.791,1454.833,There are more people --
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1454.833,1456.4,There on --
1970.712,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1456.4,1461.826,"Whose relocation and turns on the answer to this question, than just a seven we have involved here, so --"
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1461.826,1472.663,"Well, that might turn on -- I don’t know as to that again, as to that number how many -- what status is of the projects in that 500 miles."
1970.712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1472.663,1479.091,"Within the 500 miles, are there projects which have done so far as the two hearings?"
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1479.091,1480.742,Which not gone so far as --
1970.712,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1480.742,1488.191,As the two hearings or haven’t gone so far that the project would not be covered by the '68 Act?
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1488.191,1490.586,think that is correct.
1970.712,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1520.584,1531.912,"It wouldn’t do us any good then, would it, to say, well, what's the use in our deciding this question here, only seven or five or six, seven people are involved because the issue only will be back again in some other case, isn’t it?"
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1531.912,1535.438,"It, it, wait Your Honor, it might be back in some other case and --"
1970.712,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1535.438,1538.612,"Well, we might just well go ahead and decide it, can we?"
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1538.612,1544.447,"Well, I don’t believe that it is any longer an issue in this case."
1970.712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1559.143,1566.639,I suppose you have any objection to our reaching an issue as long as they decided the way you want us to?
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1566.639,1569.239,"No, Your Honor, none at all."
1970.712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1569.239,1576.648,"And what would that do for you, in terms of the projects still to be completed?"
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1583.111,1584.713,"Your Honor, that’s correct."
1970.712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1590.376,1594.734,"And I take it, there are any projects that are any less far along?"
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1594.734,1602.598,"Well, as of today, in enactment, there were projects within 8,500 of the 9,000 miles that were less far along."
1970.712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1606.719,1613.408,"Well, within that 8,500 miles then have there been projects or are their still projects for which plans will be submitted?"
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1613.408,1614.025,That is correct.
1970.712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1618.968,1619.633,I see.
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1619.633,1621.254,That are in a similar status --
1970.712,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1621.254,1622.597,"Now, they will be submitted what?"
1970.712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1626.73,1628.292,Under the 68 Act?
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1628.292,1632.777,"Under the 68 Act, they would be required to be submitted for formal assurance --"
1970.712,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1632.777,1634.598,For the new regulations?
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1634.598,1639.029,And the regulations would by the same slogan require the former relocation plan.
1970.712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1639.029,1645.214,But not the 1971 statute that would not be involved.
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1645.214,1648.622,I don’t believe that that statute would be involved --
1970.712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1648.622,1656.038,"Because the 71 statute says, that if there's anything not determined under the 68 statute, the 68 statute stays, isn’t it?"
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1656.038,1659.619,That’s correct in that respect.
1970.712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1662.074,1669.661,That would say --
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1669.661,1688.003,"I do think on that Uniform Relocation Act, the language in the provision Section 210 which would be the similar provision to the one we’re dealing with here is dissimilar and an interpretation of this statute would not be controlling on the new statute."
1970.712,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1703.883,1709.991,"Were these highway projects put down for any kind of a hearing, public hearing?"
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1709.991,1714.543,They had the public hearing required by statute in connection with the route in this Your Honor and --
1970.712,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1714.543,1716.871,"Well, what kind of a hearing was that?"
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1716.871,1719.577,That was the hearing required in Section 128 of the Act.
1970.712,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1719.577,1722.055,"I know, but what kind was it?"
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1726.713,1735.837,It was a hearing for the -- it was a hearing held for the people who lived in the community to come in and discuss the routing with the federal and state officials.
1970.712,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1742.421,1749.428,This was a hearing prior to the formulation of the land by the Secretary?
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1749.428,1752.76,There was no plan here.
1970.712,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1756.871,1758.83,"Yes, but other route?"
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1758.83,1759.565,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.712,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1761.842,1764.749,"In there any place, I can find a copy that hearing?"
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1764.749,1773.636,"Yes, Your Honor it’s in the record -- the hearing is in the record."
1970.712,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2450.763,2454.694,"Well, who approved that out in the state?"
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2454.694,2456.168,Who approved?
1970.712,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2456.168,2458.944,The relocation plan?
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2458.944,2462.235,There was no relocation plan submitted.
1970.712,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2462.235,2466.496,"Well, who approved that all of these nine men in the office can spend six days and --"
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2466.496,2467.088,That was this --
1970.712,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2467.088,2469.47,Five times as much as you needed now?
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2469.47,2475.02,That was the State Road Commission that did provide the relocation program.
1970.712,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2475.02,2477.811,And what did the Federal Government do as to that?
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2477.811,2490.439,I would -- if I may just now get to that in just one second that -- I just want to wind up my point here that there was compliance with substantive provisions and that there was a relocation program.
1970.712,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2490.439,2493.301,Why didn’t you agree?
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2493.301,2522.488,"Well, it will only take two seconds The only additional point is that the formal assurances and the formal relocation plan in a regulations were a procedure which Congress deemed appropriate to ensure that the states complied with the substantive requirement that a Relocation Assistance Program was afforded by the states."
1970.712,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2557.8,2561.163,How was this review done?
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2561.163,2563.62,"Well, that is what I'm explaining."
1970.712,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2598.868,2601.42,Where is the project?
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2601.42,2603.584,"Well, there was --"
1970.712,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2603.584,2603.68,There wasn’t?
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2603.68,2607.561,"There was no plan as such, that’s correct."
1970.712,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2622.324,2631.545,"I was wondering, did the Federal Government “reviewed” (Inaudible) “approved?”"
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2631.545,2634.571,They “reviewed” this.
1970.712,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2634.571,2635.68,Where it is that in?
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2635.68,2653.247,"That is in the record in a number of pages most of which are referred to in our brief as appendix references, where the Federal authorities went in and scrutinized, what was going on in these two projects?"
1970.712,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2694.252,2700.903,"And then all shall agree with you, do I have to assume that this was reported to the Secretary?"
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2700.903,2701.217,"No, Your Honor."
1970.712,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2701.217,2702.255,Just day-by-day?
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2702.255,2702.718,"No, Your Honor."
1970.712,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2702.718,2703.323,Alright.
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2703.323,2711.763,"We do not because as we argue the case, the Secretary was not required in this case to give the approval."
1970.712,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2747.418,2753.309,"Did he approve within the meaning of Section 504, the payment of Federal funds?"
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2753.309,2756.148,"Your Honor, the Federal funds were approved."
1970.712,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2764.172,2768.938,"I understand, but I mean he had to approve in part but not all you were saying."
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2768.938,2771.999,He did not give an approval under 502.
1970.712,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2771.999,2774.812,"Yes, that’s why our question is whether he should have?"
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2774.812,2776.154,Correct but he did.
1970.712,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2776.154,2776.285,Yes.
1970.712,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2776.285,2777.261,He did approve the fact --
1970.712,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2777.261,2778.8,He did approve under 504?
