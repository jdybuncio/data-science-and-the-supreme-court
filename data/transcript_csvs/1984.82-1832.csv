1984.82-1832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.258,We'll hear argument next in Town of Hallie v. City of Eau Claire.
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,14.151,24.377,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this action arises from the complaint filed by four Towns who are adjacent to the City of Eau Claire."
1984.82-1832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,165.02,166.59,"Mr. Covelli, you say"
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,173.114,176.167,"No, I do not, Your Honor."
1984.82-1832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,208.758,226.399,"No, I didn't mean that the Supreme Court of Wisconsin's decision on whether the Parker v. Brown exemption applies would be at all conclusive in this litigation, but as to whether there is a State policy, could not one look as well to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin's decisions construing statutes, as well as to the statutes themselves?"
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,226.399,246.284,"I think that if the State of Wisconsin through its court declared that we find that the State of Wisconsin has clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed its particular policy, the one in question, that may be of some guidance to this Court, but it is not bound by that decision."
1984.82-1832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,246.284,258.202,"But supposing the State court decision didn't arise in an antitrust context, but in some other context, so the State court wouldn't have any occasion to use the language of the City of Boulder case."
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,264.126,279.015,"Well, I think it is very unlikely that the State court would ever address the issue of the displacement of competition and replacing it with monopoly service or regulation other than in an antitrust situation."
1984.82-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,438.239,440.68,"But surely it was authorized to do so, wasn't it?"
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,442.833,448.837,"--Your Honor, you have to look at the complaint and what is the actionable conduct here."
1984.82-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,506.394,512.858,"Well, here's what the Court of Appeals said: Our conclusion that the State policy authorizes the City to do so and so."
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,514.23,515.74,"Yes, Your Honor, and--"
1984.82-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,515.74,520.442,"Well, doesn't that depend on a reading of the State statutes?"
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,520.442,523.484,"--Yes, it did."
1984.82-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,525.277,531.362,Should we try to second-guess the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on how the State statute should be read?
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,531.362,547.251,"--Well, Your Honor, when you look at the tests that the Seventh Circuit applied, the Seventh Circuit did not determine from reading the statutes that the State of Wisconsin, through its legislature, ever contemplated this displacement of competition."
1984.82-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,547.251,549.862,"Well, I know, but that isn't what I asked you."
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,569.266,584.466,"And this, I think, was a mistake for this reason: The City has consistently attempted to characterize our complaint as complaining against the City's refusal to provide sewage services in these unincorporated areas."
1984.82-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,658.986,671.174,"Suppose we disagree with you on this particular point, and what if we agreed with the Court of Appeals that the State has authorized the Cities to do that?"
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,676.727,685.092,"Well, if you're saying... the Court of Appeals said the City was authorized to refuse to provide service."
1984.82-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,695.03,704.697,"I know, but the City was also authorized, certainly, to provide the service if they annexed the property."
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,704.697,705.816,This is true.
1984.82-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,720.435,722.128,"Well, did you make this argument in the Court of Appeals?"
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,722.128,723.938,"Yes, I did."
1984.82-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,723.938,725.72,Why didn't they address it?
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,725.72,734.186,Because they took the City's construction of our complaint and decided that our claim was something that we said it wasn't.
1984.82-1832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,734.186,745.022,"Well, Mr. Covelli, let me read you the first five lines of the Court of Appeals' opinion, which I think purports... it's in the Appendix to the Petition."
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,764.256,764.473,"Yes, it is."
1984.82-1832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,764.473,767.065,So the Court of Appeals at least understood the nature of your complaint.
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,767.065,767.676,"Yes, they did."
1984.82-1832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,788.801,791.061,That's right.
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,791.061,791.472,And I say that that--
1984.82-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,791.472,797.345,You say the State must express an affirmative policy that it wants followed.
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,797.345,798.357,--That's correct.
1984.82-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,798.357,805.51,"So you really think the municipality has to be, in effect, ordered to institute this policy."
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,805.51,806.031,No.
1984.82-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,840.154,848.3,"Well, you just... you not only disagree with your opponent, but with the Solicitor General in this regard."
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,848.3,849.111,This is true.
1984.82-1832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,849.111,853.222,"May I ask a question, because this is sort of an unusual case."
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,864.021,865.1,That's correct.
1984.82-1832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,865.1,871.415,"Now, would you tell me who the competitors are in that market and what the nature of the competition is that's been displaced?"
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,871.415,872.046,"Yes, I will."
1984.82-1832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,882.671,887.205,"Well, I'm not interested in comparisons; I'm interested in who are the competitors in this market."
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,887.205,902.466,"--The competitors here for the provision of collection and transportation services... and by that, I mean putting the pipe in the ground and receiving the sewage from the ultimate users... are the City and the Towns within their respective unincorporated territories."
1984.82-1832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,902.466,906.317,Is the City seeking to get that business in your Towns?
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,906.317,906.718,Yes.
1984.82-1832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,907.789,908.838,Are they refusing to do it?
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,908.838,927.981,"--We have alleged that they are monopolizing it; that they have, through their use of monopoly power, have foreclosed the Towns from providing sewage collection services in the Towns while they are offering to provide those same services to the people located in these unincorporated areas."
1984.82-1832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,927.981,931.594,Are they only offering to do that if they would be annexed to the City?
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,931.594,933.665,But my point is that that's a by-product.
1984.82-1832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,945.994,948.645,Is it not correct that the Towns are just potential competitors?
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,950.816,952.088,--Yes.
1984.82-1832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,960.442,961.654,From this supplier?
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,961.654,962.783,That's correct.
1984.82-1832,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1078.31,1090.858,"What would happen if we rule with you, and then the following month, the legislature of Wisconsin said we meant to give a monopoly, and if we didn't, we are doing it now."
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,1090.858,1093.149,"--Then I would be done, Your Honor."
1984.82-1832,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1095.05,1095.661,You would be done in.
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,1095.661,1096.432,--I would.
1984.82-1832,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1099.183,1104.516,That's the only thing this case is about is whether Wisconsin meant to do it or not.
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,1104.516,1105.678,--That's right.
1984.82-1832,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1105.678,1107.609,That's all we are interested in this case.
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,1107.609,1113.833,The question is simply this: Has the State of Wisconsin made the decision to displace competition?
1984.82-1832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1126.121,1130.492,"Am I correct, Mr. Covelli, that in effect they have defined the market to include their own taxpayers?"
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,1130.492,1131.684,--No.
1984.82-1832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1134.156,1140.39,They won't serve anybody unless he's a resident of the municipality; isn't that what it boils down to?
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,1140.39,1141.682,"Well, that is--"
1984.82-1832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1141.682,1143.906,Because they've got to become annexed in order to get the service.
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,1143.906,1146.286,"--Well, as I've indicated, that isn't factually true."
1984.82-1832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1160.716,1165.647,"It seems to me they're monopolizing the business, providing fire and police services as well."
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,1167.119,1169.41,We haven't alleged that.
1984.82-1832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1169.41,1171.782,"But you see, logically it's the same sort of thing, isn't it?"
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,1171.782,1172.603,"No, it isn't."
1984.82-1832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1204.414,1207.485,"Yes, but there you have a public agency regulating the price."
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,1211.579,1212.728,--Not in this instance.
1984.82-1832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1212.728,1216.321,"What if they said we'll hook you up, but we'll charge you $1,000 a gallon or something?"
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,1218.254,1224.746,"Well, then our argument would be that they have to sell a service at a fair and non-discriminatory price; otherwise, they're violating the antitrust laws."
1984.82-1832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1224.746,1228.919,"--In other words, the antitrust law are sort of a price regulation statute?"
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,1228.919,1229.821,No.
1984.82-1832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1495.146,1503.752,"Mr. Covelli, the Seventh Circuit described the policy it thought the State of Wisconsin had articulated in Appendix XIV of the petition."
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,1519.972,1521.474,No.
1984.82-1832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1545.17,1554.406,"Well, the Seventh Circuit, after having quoted the language in the Chippewa Falls case, which refers to 14407, says here is how we read it."
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,1561.511,1570.157,"I think what the Seventh Circuit... when you boil it down, what the Seventh Circuit said is that the City's conduct is not prohibited by Wisconsin law, its law."
1984.82-1832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1570.157,1575.289,"Well, I don't read that as... that language I just quoted doesn't say anything like that."
1984.82-1832,0,18614,claude_j_covelli,,1575.289,1585.087,"Well, if you look at the test when they apply it, they say, number one, we assume the State contemplated it; number two, we infer that they condone it."
1984.82-1832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1670.903,1680.55,"Mr. Fischer, you may raise the lectern if you'd like."
1984.82-1832,1,23918,frederick_w_fischer,,1680.55,1697.37,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, of all the problems faced by Cities today, one of the greatest is the question of antitrust exposure."
1984.82-1832,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1743.559,1748.373,Has the recent congressional legislation relieved your worries any?
1984.82-1832,1,23918,frederick_w_fischer,,1748.373,1751.747,"It has, to a certain extent, Your Honor."
1984.82-1832,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1757.31,1759.782,Because all you have here is injunctive relief.
1984.82-1832,1,23918,frederick_w_fischer,,1759.782,1760.272,That's true.
1984.82-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1803.109,1808.682,You claim you want us to settle this problem for you.
1984.82-1832,1,23918,frederick_w_fischer,,1812.475,1813.936,We would hope that--
1984.82-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1813.936,1815.198,In your legislature?
1984.82-1832,1,23918,frederick_w_fischer,,1815.198,1818.959,--We would hope that we would not have to seek legislative--
1984.82-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1818.959,1819.831,"But you could, couldn't you?"
1984.82-1832,1,23918,frederick_w_fischer,,1819.831,1821.851,"--I suppose, theoretically, that would be possible, Your Honor."
1984.82-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1821.851,1823.251,Theoretically?
1984.82-1832,1,23918,frederick_w_fischer,,1831.078,1832.357,"No, there is not."
1984.82-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1833.068,1837.58,So it could be done without bothering us with it.
1984.82-1832,1,23918,frederick_w_fischer,,1837.58,1839.303,This is true.
1984.82-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1854.644,1857.656,"The State could get to that, too, couldn't they?"
1984.82-1832,1,23918,frederick_w_fischer,,1857.656,1858.107,They could.
1984.82-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1865.389,1870.281,And then we'll have the States jumping on us for legislating.
1984.82-1832,1,23918,frederick_w_fischer,,1870.281,1872.803,I guess that could be one possible result.
1984.82-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1873.304,1877.437,"Well, I assume there's no way out for us."
1984.82-1832,1,23918,frederick_w_fischer,,1878.249,1889.686,--We submit that to require the Cities to seek legislation in all possible instances would be a burden which Cities should not bear.
1984.82-1832,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2023.344,2038.276,"Well, Mr. Fischer, I think your opponent says that even if the Wisconsin legislature passed laws saying that Cities may monopolize, that's not enough, because Chippewa Falls might be pro-competitive and Eau Claire might be monopolistic."
1984.82-1832,1,23918,frederick_w_fischer,,2042.418,2043.42,Yes.
1984.82-1832,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2098.486,2104.91,"Well, how does your test then differ from just blanket Home Rule which was held inadequate in Boulder?"
1984.82-1832,1,23918,frederick_w_fischer,,2104.91,2112.264,"Well, the answer to that is that in Boulder, the legislature had not acted specifically."
1984.82-1832,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2384.163,2389.546,Does the annexation have to be contiguous?
1984.82-1832,1,23918,frederick_w_fischer,,2395.099,2395.62,No.
1984.82-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3261.496,3262.527,Very well.
1984.82-1832,2,18614,claude_j_covelli,,3264.138,3266.659,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.82-1832,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3371.027,3381.053,"Well, what if in listing the powers it had said a Home Rule City may, if it wants to... but it doesn't have to... monopolize sewer services?"
1984.82-1832,2,18614,claude_j_covelli,,3381.053,3396.464,"--Well, I think under those circumstances, unless it laid out some criteria for the City to decide when it will and will not monopolize, I think that is simply saying to the Cities, we hereby authorize you to violate the antitrust laws."
1984.82-1832,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3406.792,3413.694,We say there's no real difference between municipalities and non-governmental units.
1984.82-1832,2,18614,claude_j_covelli,,3413.694,3414.105,Yes.
1984.82-1832,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3427.235,3428.647,Very well.
