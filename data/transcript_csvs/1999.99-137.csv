1999.99-137,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.711,"We'll hear argument next in No. 99-137, J. Wayne Garner v. Robert Jones."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,18.447,21.995,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-137,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,67.674,75.932,"Well that's... that's fine for Fourteenth Amendment purposes, but that's not the test under... under the Ex Post Facto Clause."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,75.932,76.89,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-137,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,76.89,77.295,All right.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,77.295,98.974,"However, this Court in Morales reviewed the... what... what has been later called the procedural safeguards inherent in California's system to determine if that system, which does create an expectation of parole, changing the parole reconsideration dates had the effect of increasing the measure of punishment."
1999.99-137,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,99.593,109.178,"Well, isn't the... the test is whether... whether there is a so called sufficient risk that sentences will, in fact, be increased in duration by the change."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,110.824,111.648,"--Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1999.99-137,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,113.475,132.675,"Well, as I understand it... you correct me on the facts if I'm wrong, but as I understand it, before the statutory change here, the average sentence served by someone under a life sentence was something in the neighborhood of 12 years, 12 years and some months."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,132.675,135.534,"Your Honor, I... I take issue with that statistic."
1999.99-137,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,151.416,152.189,Okay.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,210.859,211.434,"--No, Your Honor."
1999.99-137,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,227.368,228.65,"Well, I don't... I don't think... I don't think that matters one way or the other."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,240.739,241.272,"Well, Your Honor--"
1999.99-137,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,241.272,261.367,"Regardless of what the board can do, what in fact is going to happen is that if those who will be released on... following a first reconsideration, 70 percent of those are... are, in fact, going to wait for 15 years as against a... a prior scheme in which there was an average of 12 years."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,271.2,285.243,"--But, Your Honor, that again presumes that the board does not have the ability nor the knowledge to determine which inmates it's going to release because these statistics are merely an accumulation of individualized determinations by the board."
1999.99-137,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,292.235,301.38,But how does that... how does that affect the fact that there is a... a demonstration of some increased risk or... or some risk of an increased sentence?
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,301.38,302.98,"--Your Honor, I don't believe there is--"
1999.99-137,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,302.98,305.463,"Regardless... I mean, the board... sure, the board might act differently."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,315.27,323.272,"--But, Your Honor, that assumes that those inmates would have gotten out during that interim, but it's the board that makes the determination when they deny parole and set it off."
1999.99-137,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,323.272,323.818,It assumes... it assumes... yes.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,328.561,330.138,"But that average is fallacious, Your Honor."
1999.99-137,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,330.138,331.339,And the... no.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,339.542,345.15,"But, Your Honor, with all due respect, I believe that the average only applies to inmates that are actually released."
1999.99-137,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,349.817,361.562,"And what the numbers... and what the new numbers show is that of those who are released on reconsideration, there is a 70 percent chance that they will be released only after 15 years."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,361.562,379.218,"--Well, Your Honor, and also that ignores the fact that... that in fact the board does have the ability to... to extraordinarily reconsider inmates and the lodged documents, the first set of lodged documents, demonstrates that, in fact, the board is exercising their discretion to review inmates extraordinarily."
1999.99-137,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,379.218,384.065,"It... it may well do so, and in point of fact, it may do a very good job of it."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,393.832,398.492,"Well, Your Honor, again I think that assumes that the inmates would have gotten out and that the parole board doesn't know--"
1999.99-137,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,398.492,410.923,"No, it doesn't assume... it... it assumes necessarily, from the fact that there was an average release date of 12-some-odd years for those who are released, that... that, of course, some will have gotten out."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,413.166,419.312,"--Your Honor, again that average is only of the inmates that were released and not of the inmates that were denied parole."
1999.99-137,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,463.824,467.198,Have you... have you given us... has the State given us any of those numbers that you feel we should look at?
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,467.198,476.05,"--Your Honor, I believe that the numbers ultimately do not matter, and the reason is because again this is an accumulation of individualized determinations by the board."
1999.99-137,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,478.302,483.958,"Well, that's true... that's true of... of every application of the Ex Post Facto Clause to a parole eligibility scheme."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,490.145,503.5,"Well, Your Honor, I believe that in... in Morales this Court looked at the system that was in place in... in California and determined whether there was a sufficient likelihood that it would have the impact of increasing the sentences."
1999.99-137,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,514.142,519.056,"But in any case, with respect to the numbers, your position is the numbers are really irrelevant."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,519.056,521.061,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-137,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,536.716,542.159,But we... we have... but we have a... we have an ex post facto standard that relies upon risk of increased sentence.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,545.145,561.355,"--Your Honor, my position is that there... there are no numbers that can give rise to... under this system because the board retains the ultimate discretion to determine whether the inmate gets out, that any accumulation of numbers is fallacious because--"
1999.99-137,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,561.355,563.103,"Mr. Brasher, let... let me try it another way."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,577.238,579.655,"--Well, Your Honor, I take issue with that, first of all."
1999.99-137,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,593.234,595.719,But let's just take it with people who... it does cover people who get life sentences.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,596.112,597.326,"It... it... yes, the... the--"
1999.99-137,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,597.326,600.416,And... and that is a much broader class than people who commit double murders.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,600.416,601.255,--Correct.
1999.99-137,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,601.255,601.924,And--
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,601.924,604.705,It includes life sentenced inmates who have been denied parole.
1999.99-137,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,604.705,610.494,--It... we're dealing with a much larger population and a much longer interval.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,619.799,631.407,"No, Your Honor, because the... the idea of the 8-year rule that's been... that's been advanced by respondents is again fallacious because the rule is only what it is to each individual inmate."
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,672.003,673.925,May I ask just one question on your view?
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,691.25,697.358,"No, Your Honor, because that would foreclose the exercise of the board's discretion, and ultimately that's--"
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,697.358,702.827,"No more hearings unless the board decides to... of its own motion, no... no more routine hearings."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,702.827,705.05,"--Your Honor, I believe that the... that the board--"
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,705.05,705.747,That's my... my example.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,706.454,712.958,"--Well, Your Honor, I believe that the board could extend the reconsideration time table as long as it wants to because--"
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,712.958,713.824,"No, not... not the board."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,724.765,727.407,"--Well, Your Honor, I said the board because this is the board's rule."
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,729.513,729.83,Right.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,729.83,732.702,"Yes, I believe that's... I believe that's perfectly appropriate."
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,750.406,755.451,"Well, under that view, since it's a board imposed rule, they could simply say, we'll give you one hearing and that's the end of the ball game."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,755.451,762.805,"--No, Your Honor, I don't believe that's so because, again, that would foreclose the board's opportunity to exercise its discretion."
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,762.805,765.249,They could always change their mind and adopt a new rule.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,765.249,769.59,"Your Honor, I... I'm not saying that the... that the rule doesn't have the force and effect of law."
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,781.685,784.153,"Well, what was accomplished by the change to 8 years then?"
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,785.111,785.86,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,801.05,803.069,Why couldn't they do that... why couldn't they do that under my hypothetical?
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,808.292,817.031,"Your Honor, I do believe that's correct, but I... I understood... I understood Your Honor to amend the hypothetical to say that they wouldn't review, and that would foreclose discretion."
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,821.357,827.734,"No, it would never foreclose discretion because if you... you've explained... the very heart of your argument I think is that the board has ultimate discretion."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,831.231,837.105,"Yes, Your Honor, it could but if it foreclosed discretion, it... it could only apply that prospectively."
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,882.977,885.979,Are you relying on the policy statement that was issued in 1996?
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,885.979,891.766,"--Your Honor, that policy statement was, in fact, issued at the time that the board began to apply those retroactively."
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,892.285,893.427,First answer my question.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,895.261,895.644,"--Yes, I am."
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,895.644,900.259,"Now, my second question is, was it in effect at the time he had his first parole hearing?"
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,900.259,901.035,"Yes, it was."
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,903.501,906.944,"So, the... the respondent has misrepresented the facts on page 2 and 3 of his brief."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,906.944,911.425,"--Your Honor, the... the fact of the matter is that that policy was in place."
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,914.336,914.969,"Well, wait a minute."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,914.969,916.625,--had a date on it of 1996.
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,916.625,917.602,You're going pretty fast and I'm kind of slow.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,917.602,917.746,I'm sorry.
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,917.746,920.821,The 1996 policy didn't change anything?
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,920.821,921.928,Correct.
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,956.418,960.154,Why did they issue the 1996 statement if it didn't change anything?
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,960.154,975.851,"Your Honor, I... I don't know why they... why they... perhaps it changed some irrelevant verbiage in... in the policy, but the fact of the matter is that the policy regarding the ability and the availability of reconsideration, extraordinary reconsideration, was in effect at that time."
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,975.851,978.368,And what is that policy of extraordinary reconsideration?
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,982.355,982.764,No.
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,991.81,994.354,"Well, what triggers... what triggers that kind of a decision by the board?"
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,998.073,1003.566,"--Well, it can be... it can be triggered by an application of the inmate, but perhaps... perhaps I haven't made myself clear."
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1003.566,1004.191,You haven't.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1004.191,1014.74,The... the fact of the matter is that the board makes the determination whether the inmate has demonstrated the... the kind of... of change in circumstances particular to that inmate.
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1014.74,1015.622,But does it do it on its own initiative?
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1018.81,1020.76,"Certainly, it could do that as well based on--"
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1020.76,1021.699,--Does it in fact do that?
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1022.553,1033.939,"--Yes, it does, because the... because the board has parole officers at many of the prisons throughout the State, in addition to the fact that the... that the parole board constantly receives information from the Department of Corrections."
1999.99-137,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1033.939,1044.257,"Well, does the board... under the procedure you describe, does it on its own motion bring up cases and say, well, the... we'll move this guy ahead or we'll hold this guy back?"
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1044.257,1048.24,"Yes, Your Honor, based upon information that they might receive from someone other than... than the inmate."
1999.99-137,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1058.323,1064.715,"I don't know if I'd want to wait too long, if I were the inmate, for... for the guard to tell them that my circumstances had changed."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1064.715,1077.93,"--Well, Your Honor, I believe that that ignores the fact that... that the inmate is always free to bring to the... bring to the board's attention any change in circumstances which he or she feels are sufficient to warrant reconsideration."
1999.99-137,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1077.93,1081.767,"So, the... the inmate on his own can make an application."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1081.767,1082.855,"Yes, most assuredly, Your Honor."
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1088.37,1095.676,Is there anything in the record to show that any inmate has been released at one of these intermediate inmate requested hearings?
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1095.676,1096.268,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-137,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1112.874,1114.278,On the prisoner's petition?
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1114.278,1117.059,"1999, which was after the decision of the court of appeals... the court of appeals?"
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1117.059,1118.071,"--Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1118.071,1121.566,"In 1999, after the decision of the court of appeals, that happened?"
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1121.566,1126.301,"Your Honor, I believe that the decision of the court of appeals was rendered in January of '99 and--"
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1126.301,1129.601,Later on they... there are some of these.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1141.145,1141.977,"--No, Your Honor."
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1154.25,1158.152,"Did that prevent you from putting in such evidence, if it existed?"
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1158.152,1167.603,"No, Your Honor, it did not because as the court... as the district court below found and as the Eleventh Circuit below found that the case could be decided as a matter of law."
1999.99-137,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1204.188,1204.728,"Just a minute, Mr. Brasher."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1204.728,1205.333,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-137,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1205.333,1218.827,To what extent are we dealing here with information that has been supplied in briefs by the... either your side or the other side that wasn't before the district court or the court of appeals?
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1218.827,1224.732,"Well, Your Honor, I think that there... there is information that's before this Court that wasn't before the court of appeals or the district court."
1999.99-137,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1241.62,1254.716,"Just... as to the material that you say is before us what wasn't before the district court or the court of appeals, is there disagreement between you and your opponent as to any of the facts in... in that material?"
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1254.716,1259.659,"Your Honor, that issue hasn't specifically been addressed, but I would assume that--"
1999.99-137,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1259.659,1261.363,"But so, you--"
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1261.363,1261.668,--Yes--
1999.99-137,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1261.668,1263.492,--I take it you're familiar with your brief.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1263.492,1264.28,"--Yes, I am."
1999.99-137,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1264.28,1265.969,And you're familiar with your opponent's brief--
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1265.969,1266.641,"I am, Your Honor."
1999.99-137,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1266.641,1267.276,--and all the filings.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1267.276,1267.801,Yes.
1999.99-137,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1267.801,1274.31,Is there any disagreement between you and your opponent as to any factual matters that are in that classification?
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1274.31,1281.352,"I do not disagree with the facts included in the 12-year average, for instance."
1999.99-137,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1309.893,1311.725,You disagree with the inferences to be drawn from the facts.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1311.725,1311.923,Correct.
1999.99-137,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1356.431,1377.341,"Did I understand you to say a second ago that those who are... the figures from which the 12-year average was computed showed that only 1 percent of the total prison population is... of the total life sentence prison population is, in fact, released before the expiration of their lives?"
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1377.341,1380.359,Before the expiration of... of what--
1999.99-137,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1380.359,1380.771,Their lives.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1380.771,1381.154,--Their lives?
1999.99-137,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1381.813,1382.882,You referred to 1 percent.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1384.38,1389.477,"Your Honor, the... the numbers... the number that has been put in respondent's brief, the 12-year average number--"
1999.99-137,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1389.477,1389.628,Yes.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1389.628,1395.763,--Less than 50 inmates were paroled in 1992 where these numbers came from.
1999.99-137,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1408.362,1408.613,During that year.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1408.613,1409.371,During that year.
1999.99-137,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1409.371,1409.697,During that one year.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1409.697,1410.35,That particular year.
1999.99-137,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1412.875,1419.558,You've stressed... it's really the core of your argument... that the board has discretion.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1419.558,1420.518,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-137,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1420.518,1433.445,"When you look at this case, initially you think, well, of course, the inmate is better off if the board must exercise its discretion every 3 years than every 8."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1442.804,1443.597,In addition--
1999.99-137,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1443.597,1443.766,And--
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1443.766,1444.81,"--Sorry, Your Honor."
1999.99-137,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1444.81,1448.822,--But... but then you tell us that statistics are unimportant.
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1465.285,1477.355,"Well, Your Honor, I think that... that the... the key issue here is that it's the board's discretion exercised on an individual basis that leads to the determinations made by the board."
1999.99-137,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1478.022,1481.856,"But under the old rule, that discretion had to be exercised every 3 years."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1481.856,1483.112,--But doesn't that reduce--
1999.99-137,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1483.112,1488.287,"And then your... but... and so the... the way you get out of that is to say, well, it's not going to make any difference."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1489.454,1516.843,"--But, Your Honor, doesn't that reduce parole reconsideration to a war of attrition and assume that the board is... board's will is going to be overborne merely by having to reconsider someone more frequently when they themselves had made the determination that that inmate is not going to get out and doesn't have a legitimate expectation of parole at any time during the set off period, whether that set off period is 2 years, 7 years, or as in Mr. Jones' case, 8 years?"
1999.99-137,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1526.76,1538.95,"No, but the way we know what the board is going to do is to see how... A, how it exercises its discretion or, B, the statistical risk of its not granting parole during the extended period."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1542.225,1549.276,"--Well, Your Honor, again that trivializes the fact that the board makes individualized determinations."
1999.99-137,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1549.583,1573.848,"I am really... I'm getting impatient with hearing that response, individualized... it seems to me, you know, the science of statistics is based upon the proposition that you could look at a series of individualized determinations and draw a... a general conclusion from the agglomeration of those individualized determinations."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1575.907,1576.992,"--I do not, Your Honor, but--"
1999.99-137,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1576.992,1581.767,"Well, then it... then it does no good to keep responding these are all individualized determinations."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1606.806,1613.843,"--But, Your Honor, because of the individualized determination, there is no way to know that it was the change that had anything to do with that."
1999.99-137,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1613.843,1620.772,"But there were individualized determinations in Morales too, and we paid attention to the statistics there I think."
1999.99-137,0,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,1620.772,1638.528,"Well, Your Honor, I think that... I don't recall the particular statistics that this Court paid attention to except that the... the key in Morales was that the burden was placed on the inmate to demonstrate that there had been an increase in the measure of punishment."
1999.99-137,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1725.689,1727.143,"Very well, Mr. Brasher."
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,1729.258,1736.445,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-137,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1805.393,1809.639,"But the board surely has a good deal of discretion in making that judgment too, does it not?"
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,1809.639,1819.139,"--Mr. Chief Justice, you're correct that they do have discretion over the number of years, but that discretion is limited by the maximum number of years that they can defer the decision."
1999.99-137,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1831.139,1832.201,You said they have discretion.
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,1833.8,1836.433,"--Your Honor, the board created the rules."
1999.99-137,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1836.433,1836.962,"The board itself, right?"
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,1836.962,1837.636,That's correct.
1999.99-137,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1837.636,1844.738,"So, this is unlike a system in which you have a board that's operating under a... under a prescribed rule that's established by the legislature."
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,1868.027,1870.564,I believe so if that's applied retroactively--
1999.99-137,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1870.564,1870.757,Really.
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,1870.757,1871.762,--as opposed to prospectively.
1999.99-137,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1871.762,1873.787,"So, I mean, who appoints the board?"
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,1875.265,1879.313,The board... I believe the... the Governor appoints the board members to serve 7-year terms.
1999.99-137,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1879.313,1887.331,"Suppose the Governor... you have a law and order Governor, and he says, we have a board of paroles under my predecessor that was just letting... it was just... you know, the jail... the jail gates were open for life termers to get out."
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,1895.825,1904.568,"No, not to appoint a tough parole board, but to change the policies retroactively in a way that would pose an increased risk of confinement--"
1999.99-137,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1904.568,1905.336,It isn't retroactively.
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,1915.705,1917.255,"--There is a distinction, Your Honor."
1999.99-137,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1924.278,1924.752,No.
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,1955.536,1967.371,"Well, Your Honor, I think there is a distinction, and the distinction is in this case the board is depriving the inmates of the ability to present their case to the board altogether, and that's a very different situation."
1999.99-137,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1967.371,1968.277,"Well, but that's... that's not true."
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,1976.169,1983.221,I think there's... I don't believe that that's a meaningful process that's an adequate substitute for an automatic consideration.
1999.99-137,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1993.694,1994.121,"Well, so what."
1999.99-137,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1994.121,1995.896,What difference... what difference does it make?
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,1995.896,1998.307,The Eleventh Circuit found that it made a very significant--
1999.99-137,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1998.307,1999.67,But I'm not asking the Eleventh Circuit.
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2000.37,2001.475,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-137,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2014.066,2014.818,What has that to do with us?
1999.99-137,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2014.818,2015.443,What difference does it make?
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2015.443,2020.555,"I... I think it makes a significant difference because, first of all, inmates can enforce the rules."
1999.99-137,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2035.12,2037.924,"Well, does... does bear on the ex post facto claim?"
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2037.924,2043.812,--I think it does because the petitioners have relied so heavily on this as a substitute for automatic consideration.
1999.99-137,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2063.264,2064.149,"Well, no."
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2079.744,2088.675,--I... I think it's important because I think we need to consider whether or not that inmates will be able to take meaningful advantage of this process.
1999.99-137,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2088.675,2092.987,Where do we find in our ex post facto jurisprudence any statement like that?
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2092.987,2095.905,"Well, I'm not sure the Court has specifically addressed anything like--"
1999.99-137,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2095.905,2096.661,I'm quite sure it hasn't.
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2096.661,2100.15,"--Well, I still think it's relevant to the determination."
1999.99-137,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2112.416,2117.146,Is... is it a risk or is it an opportunity of... of grace?
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2122.21,2123.754,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-137,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2123.754,2127.276,And it has entire discretion to pardon or to parole.
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2128.828,2129.335,That's correct.
1999.99-137,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2129.335,2136.334,"Now, when your client committed a crime, he knew he was going to get life, that... that that was, you know, the... the sentence for it."
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2173.252,2176.657,"Your Honor, again, I... I think that that's a very different question--"
1999.99-137,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2176.657,2177.301,Why is it different?
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2187.813,2188.822,"--Well, it's true--"
1999.99-137,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2188.822,2189.957,What is your client entitled to?
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2190.929,2193.806,--My client... my client is entitled to be considered.
1999.99-137,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2207.198,2210.294,--May I... may I interrupt you there and just follow up on that?
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2216.976,2224.745,"--Your Honor, I... I think the source of that entitlement is because my client's sentence carries with it the right to be considered for parole."
1999.99-137,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2225.16,2225.513,How?
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2225.513,2233.384,"--Well, we can start from the proposition that there's a very big difference between a life sentence and a life sentence without possibility of parole."
1999.99-137,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2240.326,2248.476,What do... what do the statutes of Georgia say about entitlement to consideration for parole if one has a life sentence subject to parole?
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2248.476,2258.363,--That the inmate is entitled to have his first consideration after 7 years and is entitled to automatic reconsiderations thereafter at a period of time that the board shall define.
1999.99-137,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2258.363,2259.232,Okay.
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2259.232,2263.313,The board defined it prior to 1985 as 3 years.
1999.99-137,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2265.609,2282.46,"So, in... in effect, the legislature sets a kind of minimal scheme and... and then it... I guess it's fair to say, it mandates that the board set the terms of the scheme beyond that 7... beyond the period of that first 7-year consideration."
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2282.46,2283.284,That's correct.
1999.99-137,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2291.574,2314.692,"So, then I think Mr. Brasher was not correct in saying that under the legislation the board can simply say we won't... our rule is that after the initial 7 years, which we must do by legislation, then the rest is up to us and we can have a rule that says no automatic periods."
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2316.806,2317.703,That's correct.
1999.99-137,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2322.902,2332.804,"So, it's a kind of delegation to fill in the detail to the... which is quite different from saying, board, you have discretion to either have intervals or not have intervals."
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2332.804,2333.887,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-137,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2343.051,2349.558,"Well, they also have determination, I take it from your answer to Justice Ginsburg, to decide the intervals after the 7 years."
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2349.558,2349.923,--Right.
1999.99-137,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2364.114,2382.099,"Why is that element of discretion any more subject to control by the prisoner than is the more significant element of discretion, namely, whether to be lenient or strict in the substantive decision of parole or not?"
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2402.503,2403.84,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-137,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2403.84,2409.135,"And because that's within the discretion of the board, the substantive decision whether to release or not."
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2421.25,2423.485,"I... I think it's very significant, Your Honor."
1999.99-137,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2442.153,2442.23,But--
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2454.699,2456.028,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-137,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2456.028,2458.897,"I mean, that... that's what I was sort of getting at by my earlier question."
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2476.565,2477.288,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-137,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2484.541,2491.416,"Well, that being so, I mean, I... I didn't understand the Eleventh Circuit at all, that part of their opinion dealing with the rule."
1999.99-137,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2491.416,2500.869,I didn't understand it because I've never heard of a constitutional principle that says that it's unconstitutional to have a constitutional rule because maybe you'd change it.
1999.99-137,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2545.302,2549.08,"And number one, you say maybe the person won't know about it."
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2581.242,2581.684,Certainly.
1999.99-137,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2581.684,2586.417,"--you know, they're... they're going to make a conscious determination to... so, I want to get your other points."
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2586.417,2586.662,All right.
1999.99-137,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2610.793,2626.491,"If there's no statistical evidence, I think that would be the end of it for your client for the reason that common sense suggests it doesn't make that much difference whether you get a hearing every 3 or 8 years as long as there's a clear determination that a hearing wouldn't do you any good."
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2626.491,2636.823,"--Well, I think... I think we have got some very good and... and concrete evidence of why these determinations are important, and I'd like to draw the Court's attention to the case of Gary Newberry."
1999.99-137,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2650.397,2653.591,"Where... where is this information coming from, Ms. Kertscher?"
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2653.591,2657.418,--It's... it's attached to the petitioner's reply brief at appendix page 4.
1999.99-137,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2662.166,2663.024,Is this record information or is this--
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2663.024,2665.017,It's not in the record below.
1999.99-137,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2726.461,2731.718,--The Eleventh Circuit in this case reversed the judgment of... of the district court.
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2751.008,2751.89,That's correct.
1999.99-137,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2751.89,2756.511,"So, what were the... what was the purpose of the remand rather than entry of judgment outright?"
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2756.511,2760.123,My client had also brought damages claims.
1999.99-137,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2760.123,2760.399,Ah.
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2760.399,2764.219,"And I believe that was the purpose of the remand, to determine whether or not those were appropriate."
1999.99-137,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2764.219,2773.755,I... I take it then that the court of appeals thought it could decide the ex post facto question without any more statistics than it had.
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2775.525,2777.837,"That's correct, that it did not have statistics."
1999.99-137,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2813.885,2833.766,"Well, there's going to be risk... what's actually bothering me that I haven't worked out is that if I agreed with you on this and if the only reason would be because instead of you getting it automatically, they say... they say, look, we're only not going to give it to people we'll never let out, and we have this system where we get new information."
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2867.231,2867.757,--I think the Court--
1999.99-137,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2867.757,2868.313,I'd like you to address it.
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2868.313,2885.795,"--addressed that when it decided the Morales case, and it said there are a lot of... of little rules that we could invalidate under the same theory if we agree with the respondent in that case who was trying to... to advocate the Court to say that... that there was... that any conceivable risk, no matter how attenuated, would be an ex post facto violation."
1999.99-137,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2935.32,2940.701,May I ask you one question about the... you called our attention to the material at the appendix to their reply brief.
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2959.064,2961.783,"Your Honor, I don't know the answer to that question."
1999.99-137,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2961.783,2966.087,Do you know if there are any reconsiderations comparable to these before January 1999?
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,2966.087,2977.494,I don't know the answer to that question because we were never able to conduct discovery to try to look and... and see whether or not any reconsiderations were... were being given prior to the Eleventh Circuit's opinion in this case.
1999.99-137,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3020.982,3027.629,"Was that what was... was that procedure different when it was a 3-year... I mean, did the inmate get counsel then?"
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,3027.629,3028.206,"--No, Your Honor."
1999.99-137,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3028.732,3030.175,"So, that hasn't changed."
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,3030.175,3057.332,"That has not changed, but it's still important because when you consider what the board is trying to do here, it's trying to predict basically an inmate's future, and the longer the period of time that the... the board has to do this over, you know, the... when you're talking about a period of time as long as 8 years, then I think it's a harder question and I think that the board might have to do a little bit more in order to accurately predict the consequences to an inmate over an 8-year period of time."
1999.99-137,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3057.332,3064.731,"Suppose they say, which is also true, time is limited, resources are limited, there are a lot of prisoners, and we want to allocate our time better."
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,3071.141,3078.143,"Well, Your Honor, there... the Court has considered and rejected a number of attempts to do the same thing under other scenarios."
1999.99-137,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3089.441,3094.6,"Well, I'm not... I'm not sure that meets the gravamen of the question, which also concerns me."
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,3126.277,3132.176,"--Your Honor, that is sensible, and that's why it's appropriate for the board to do this on a prospective basis."
1999.99-137,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3139.011,3141.059,"No, but the argument is that it's not sacrificing them."
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,3174.861,3179.21,"--Well, Your Honor, and again prospectively I think that might very well make sense."
1999.99-137,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3220.211,3231.309,"But the policy does say that in the event of a change in circumstance, the information can be given to the board and they say they consider it."
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,3231.309,3233.596,--The policy does say that they'll consider it.
1999.99-137,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3244.244,3247.472,Was that policy statement in effect at the time of the decision in this case?
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,3247.472,3248.579,Your Honor--
1999.99-137,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3248.579,3249.852,The decision concerning this... this inmate.
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,3249.852,3253.132,--The date of that policy is 1996.
1999.99-137,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3263.189,3272.374,"Before the... you heard your opponent argue today, were you aware of the fact that there was a... the 1996 policy statement was... really repeated something that had been long in effect?"
1999.99-137,1,22579,elizabeth_s_kertscher,,3272.374,3279.076,"--No, Your Honor, and although counsel for petitioners said that came up at the Eleventh Circuit, that... that never was addressed at the Eleventh Circuit level."
1999.99-137,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3436.458,3437.777,"Thank you, Ms. Kertscher."
1999.99-137,2,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,3440.423,3441.896,"Your Honor, very briefly."
1999.99-137,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3449.897,3459.88,"Mr. Brasher, may I ask you... I wasn't clear on your argument whether you were making a distinction between a statute... say, a statutory change from 3 years to 8 years and the rule change."
1999.99-137,2,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,3459.88,3461.135,"I was not, Your Honor."
1999.99-137,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3480.731,3481.878,Do we have the text of the statute someplace?
1999.99-137,2,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,3481.878,3482.373,--Pardon?
1999.99-137,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3482.373,3484.598,Do we have the text of the statute someplace?
1999.99-137,2,18454,christopher_s_brasher,,3484.598,3492.313,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe so, but I believe that the... that the citation is Official Code of Georgia Annotated, 42-9-42 I believe."
1999.99-137,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3510.224,3511.737,"Thank you, Mr. Brasher."
