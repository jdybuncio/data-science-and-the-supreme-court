1995.94-7427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,8.347,"We'll hear argument in Number 94-7427, Libretti v. United States."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,9.079,12.06,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-7427,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,88.041,92.675,"Excuse me, but the court of appeals said it included legitimately acquired property?"
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,92.675,98.06,The court of appeals said it included all of petitioner's property of every kind--
1995.94-7427,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,98.06,102.164,"Right, but it didn't say that it included legitimately acquired property."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,109.059,111.751,"--Oh, I think that's not correct, Your Honor."
1995.94-7427,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,121.607,124.98,By which you mean not properly forfeitable?
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,124.98,126.09,--No.
1995.94-7427,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,140.452,141.113,"Ah, I see."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,141.113,142.303,"All right, and so--"
1995.94-7427,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,142.303,145.435,You mean legitimately acquired with the proceeds.
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,145.435,148.247,--I mean legitimately acquired.
1995.94-7427,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,184.064,187.067,"And the court of appeals conceded this, said this."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,187.067,189.538,It's accepted by all parties.
1995.94-7427,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,192.72,192.92,But that's what you said.
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,206.691,207.512,--That's correct.
1995.94-7427,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,207.512,208.862,Where does it say that?
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,221.7,224.983,"That's correct, and... I mean, that would be another proper reading."
1995.94-7427,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,225.273,232.019,Does their reading... is there an indication that their reading was that the legitimately acquired property was also nonforfeitable?
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,232.019,235.281,"--Well, I believe that gets to the nub of the point."
1995.94-7427,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,235.281,235.962,"You make that claim, but--"
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,235.962,236.232,It's not a question--
1995.94-7427,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,236.232,238.364,--has anyone made that express assumption?
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,242.995,247.82,--I think the point is that property... property gets--
1995.94-7427,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,247.82,249.059,"No, but what's the answer to my question?"
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,251.232,254.194,--I don't think you'll find that sentence as such.
1995.94-7427,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,254.995,263.54,"Okay, and the district court was in fact holding hearings that would have been relevant to that determination, but they were the hearings without jurisdiction, so we can't depend on that."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,263.54,265.252,--That is correct.
1995.94-7427,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,293.974,294.622,Mm-hmm.
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,294.622,317.838,"Right, so there was no finding, for example, that that property in the district court level or at the court of appeals level, that it was forfeitable because it was proc... because it was not legitimately acquired, and so the point merely is that it would take some factual... set of factual assumptions to show that legitimately acquired property is, in fact, subject to forfeiture."
1995.94-7427,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,360.316,376.079,"Suppose the district judge had told Libretti how it would play out if he stood trial, exactly what would have to be proved, so he knew all that when he entered his plea."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,418.865,424.269,"Well, there are really two requirements that we're talking about, and it's important for me to distinguish those."
1995.94-7427,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,475.253,475.603,--So--
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,475.603,489.504,"In that instance there would be both a requirement that the defendant waive his right to a jury trial, and also a requirement that a factual basis be shown for his plea to the bank robbery offense."
1995.94-7427,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,489.874,499.571,"--Your answer to my question is... your answer is no, it would not have been enough to tell him exactly how this would play out if he stood trial."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,506.476,519.355,"--That's correct, and the reason for that is that it's exactly parallel to the requirements for a plea of guilty on the offenses that are charged."
1995.94-7427,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,535.017,539.35,"Well, suppose that not all of the property had yet been identified."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,552.907,555.82,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, that the situation is--"
1995.94-7427,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,555.82,556.17,"Pardon me, not take the plea."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,556.17,569.538,"--I think the situation is just parallel to that, where... that the Government doesn't have its proof in order yet on some of the... have proof in order on some counts, for example, in the indictment, and not others."
1995.94-7427,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,579.298,582.259,"Well, under your view the court couldn't even take the plea."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,582.259,588.715,--That's correct to the extent that it's a dependent part of that plea.
1995.94-7427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,653.064,663.03,"Ms. Beale, can I ask you a question about the relief that's prompted by Justice Kennedy's question and your answer that if there are two counts, there was no factual basis for one, a guilty plea might stand as to one count, I guess?"
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,676.441,678.571,"Well, in this case."
1995.94-7427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,681.662,682.483,"Well, first in general, and then in this case."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,682.483,682.674,--All right.
1995.94-7427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,712.935,718.771,Could the court then enter a judgment of conviction on the guilty plea of the charge and reserve for further hearings what to do--
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,718.771,719.91,"That's correct, in the same way."
1995.94-7427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,728.025,728.686,--I see.
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,728.686,742.908,"And you would literally plead to count 2 and not 3, 4, 5, and so forth, and I think that would be certainly possible that the parties would agree to resolve it that way and the court would be willing to accept the guilty plea under those circumstances."
1995.94-7427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,743.058,743.368,All right.
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,745.411,745.551,--Exactly.
1995.94-7427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,745.551,746.601,--if we should agree with you?
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,746.601,746.912,"Well, exactly."
1995.94-7427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,788.251,795.935,"Can I have one other question, then I'll be covered everything I had at the back of my mind."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,821.864,833.153,"--It depends, so that if the factual basis showing was that in fact, let's say, substitute assets would reach even with legitimately acquired property--"
1995.94-7427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,833.153,837.365,"No, some of the property that he agreed to forfeit, the Government would have no valid claim to."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,837.365,864.173,"--We think it's clear that the court cannot accept a plea on that basis and enter a sentence any more than it could accept petitioner's agreement to serve a 30-year sentence if the statutory maximum were 20 years, even if he was willing to agree to that, even if he might, for example, be willing to agree to that to avoid the prosecution of his wife, or his child, or to preserve a uniquely valuable asset."
1995.94-7427,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,876.482,884.569,Does the case depend... does your argument depend on whether we characterize this as sentencing enhancement or an element of the offense?
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,884.569,885.569,--Well--
1995.94-7427,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,885.569,888.56,Is that a pivotal point in the analysis?
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,888.56,895.083,--I think that the characterization of the criminal forfeiture itself is exactly the pivotal point.
1995.94-7427,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,897.586,903.559,"If it's enhancement of the offense, then what happens to your case, if it's an enhancement of punishment?"
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,903.559,917.731,"--We concede that forfeiture operates as a penalty, so in that sense, sentencing enhancement would be one way of describing that penalty, that there's a period of imprisonment plus this enhanced penalty of forfeiture."
1995.94-7427,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,967.898,968.389,Let me--
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,977.485,987.752,"Well, I think that the characterization is just a shorthand way of summing up those attributes, so I'm not so sure that it matters what--"
1995.94-7427,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,987.752,993.084,"Well, but it's a shorthand way, in effect, of obfuscating this hybrid character."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,993.084,994.016,--Well--
1995.94-7427,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,994.016,996.117,Let me make this suggestion to you.
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1030.143,1034.114,--We could certainly argue that.
1995.94-7427,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1035.486,1045.694,"And you'd argue that, and you'd say well that argument is sound or not regardless of whether you characterize this as element, or whether you characterize this as penalty enhancement."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1045.694,1046.835,"--Well, I think that's right."
1995.94-7427,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1048.277,1050.749,Then why don't you make some such argument here?
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1082.854,1088.387,"--We mean to be making that argument Your Honor, and if we haven't made it clearly, let me endorse that now."
1995.94-7427,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1088.387,1094.323,"But if you're making that argument, you don't have to make the characterization on an either-or basis, do you?"
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1094.323,1100.007,"I was using the characterization only as a way to draw attention to those features, so that's right."
1995.94-7427,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1107.081,1126.556,"If you make those arguments, then you're saying not only that what I put to you initially wouldn't be good enough, to tell the defendant exactly how it would play out if he didn't enter the plea, but you are also saying that what this district judge tried to do at the end was also not enough."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1152.604,1158.619,"Well, the link-up, the factual basis can come from either the defendant or the Government."
1995.94-7427,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1168.667,1179.416,"But if the Government has to make a showing, then how can it be enough for the district judge to say, here's this big pot of everything you have."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1196.266,1196.446,--Right.
1995.94-7427,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1248.628,1250.84,I don't think the Government came forward with anything.
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1275.67,1277.059,There are two points in time.
1995.94-7427,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1306.712,1309.423,"Yes, but I'm asking you what the Rule 11 requires."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1309.423,1313.076,And Rule 11 does not put the burden specifically on the Government.
1995.94-7427,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1327.266,1332.732,"Well, why don't you tell me what you think are the marching orders for the district judge."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1332.732,1352.096,"--The district judge needs to... without regard to which party it comes from, he needs to identify a proffer of facts that would link up specific pieces of property or categories of property with a factual reason why those pieces of property are forfeited under Federal law."
1995.94-7427,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1352.096,1353.809,"Ms. Beale, do you get that from Rule 11(f)?"
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1368.079,1369.609,"That's correct, and we believe the defendant--"
1995.94-7427,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1369.609,1373.363,"Not an agreement to forfeiture, but a plea of guilty of the offense, presumably."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1382.88,1383.982,"--That's correct, and--"
1995.94-7427,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1383.982,1385.311,"Presumably, the plea of guilty."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1385.311,1386.883,"--That's right, and we believe--"
1995.94-7427,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1386.883,1387.544,"And the court did that here, didn't it?"
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1387.544,1399.024,"--That's correct, and we believe that the plea of guilty... that there are two pleas of guilty, in essence, if you charge it in, as they ordinarily do, in a separate count of the indictment to resolve the charge of forfeiture."
1995.94-7427,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1399.024,1400.193,You're guilty of forfeiture?
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1400.193,1400.443,That's right.
1995.94-7427,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1402.917,1406.587,"You're not guilty of forfeiture, you're punished with forfeiture for being guilty of the crime."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1406.587,1411.551,"--Well, with all respect, Your Honor, that's not the way the rules are set up."
1995.94-7427,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1427.353,1436.388,"As a condition of imposing that penalty the Government must do that, but that does not make that a plea of guilty."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1442.254,1457.892,"--Well, with all respect, Your Honor, we believe that that's not the logical consequence of the combined change wrought by the statutory revival of forfeiture and the implementation of that forfeiture requirement in the Federal Rules."
1995.94-7427,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1457.892,1458.133,Ah.
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1458.133,1461.956,"Treating it as a charge, and indeed, incorporating it... notice there has to be a judgment."
1995.94-7427,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1486.194,1488.875,Why do you want to rely on 6(f)?
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1597.12,1603.334,"Well, we were not in a position to... given the grant of cert to argue--"
1995.94-7427,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1603.334,1605.695,"No, I'm not interested particularly in your reasons."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1607.518,1612.048,--I believe the Court should hold that a factual basis is required under 11(f).
1995.94-7427,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1616.262,1619.905,"And if not, if I don't think the language or anything else really fits, then what?"
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1622.888,1648.126,"--Well, I think that one could conclude that in parallel with the general requirements of sentencing, and in parallel with the requirement of 11(f) as to the substantive offense, that the appropriate disposition of a plea would require the showing of a factual basis, whether it falls--"
1995.94-7427,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1648.126,1649.117,What do you rely on besides the test of 11(f)?
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1654.962,1666.422,"--Well, I believe Justice Breyer is correct in saying that the whole scheme of the sentencing guidelines, the statutes that underlie that, require a factual basis for the determination--"
1995.94-7427,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1666.422,1669.872,"--But not under 11(f), and if you do... can I--"
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1669.872,1670.052,--No.
1995.94-7427,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1670.052,1676.547,"--The only difference I can see is if you choose 11(f) and you win this case, there has to be a new trial."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1688.395,1698.292,"Well, I believe, Your Honor, that the remedy sought... that it's not so clear as you imagine, that in this case the result will be that there's a trial."
1995.94-7427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1725.645,1727.346,"Ms. Beale, I think you've given an answer that differs from one you gave me earlier."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1743.53,1748.202,"--Well, we did discuss both the in general and the in this case."
1995.94-7427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1748.202,1748.372,Right.
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1748.372,1755.898,"And in this case, if we find a factual basis on remand, then presumably there is no difficulty."
1995.94-7427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1755.898,1760.731,"Well, supposing we find a factual basis for the offense, but no factual basis for the forfeiture."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1761.803,1767.235,"Then in this case I do believe it's interwoven, and at that point the parties have some choice."
1995.94-7427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1780.534,1780.735,Right.
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1780.735,1784.928,"--was not subject to forfeiture, it may restrict the nature of its claim."
1995.94-7427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1784.928,1792.695,"But does that require... I'm still trying to find out, do you go back to status quo ante and set aside the guilty plea, or do you merely modify the judgment insofar as it affects forfeiture."
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1794.635,1796.638,"Well, when I said status quo ante, I meant--"
1995.94-7427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1796.638,1797.727,Forget what you said before.
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1798.478,1809.654,"--I believe you go back in the first instance... in the first instance to the very moment of the Rule 11 colloquy itself, and so you determine whether there is a factual basis for the plea."
1995.94-7427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1809.654,1815.448,"I still don't know which is the right... which are you saying they must do, set aside the entire plea, or just the part that relates to forfeiture?"
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1815.448,1822.303,"If they find no Rule... no factual basis, then petitioner is perfectly prepared to accept the possibility--"
1995.94-7427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1822.303,1822.454,I'm not--
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1822.454,1823.044,--the plea falls apart.
1995.94-7427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1826.657,1830.0,--I'm trying to find out from you what you think the district court must do.
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1836.994,1841.207,"--He should ordinarily reject the plea, if there's no factual basis--"
1995.94-7427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1841.207,1842.016,He should set aside the entire plea.
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1842.016,1844.619,"--In this case, where it's a single interrelated plea, that's correct."
1995.94-7427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1844.619,1845.839,Thank you.
1995.94-7427,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,1845.839,1853.945,"Now, it's possible, again, that the parties would resubmit a more narrowly tailored agreement that would reflect on a factual basis."
1995.94-7427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1853.945,1854.735,Thank you.
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1860.097,1865.822,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1898.067,1900.668,Can I ask you a preliminary question to kind of narrow the issue?
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1917.349,1917.659,--No.
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1920.921,1921.723,At least he couldn't do it.
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1921.723,1922.534,--He couldn't do it.
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1922.534,1939.075,"And secondly, supposing there is clear... that there's no factual basis for a forfeiture, but there's an agreement by the defendant, I'll forfeit $10 million because I'm going to get a 5-year sentence, but there's no statutory legal basis for a forfeiture, could that agreement be enforced?"
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1939.075,1939.276,No.
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1944.321,1944.452,No.
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1949.113,1952.245,"--If everybody agrees to that, then the sentence would be an illegal one."
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1954.088,1957.4,"And what if that is shown after the judgment is entered, then what happens?"
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1957.4,1969.238,"--Well, typically the responsibility of the judge would be to determine in one way or the other that he was satisfied that the sentence was a lawful one under the applicable statute, and we're not saying--"
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1969.238,1977.915,"Is it sufficient satisfaction to say that I've got an agreement in front of me in which the defendant says, I agree to forfeit X dollars?"
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1977.915,1987.941,"--If the defendant has conceded that the property is forfeitable, and if there is no record evidence that casts doubt upon that proposition, and if that agreement is--"
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1987.941,1993.206,"Does he have to concede particular assets are forfeitable, or just that a certain amount of money is forfeitable."
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1993.206,1993.357,--No.
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2000.603,2010.08,"If one doesn't read the agreement that way, one merely reads it as an agreement to forfeit everything I own, which one could read it, would the judge be permitted to enter this judgment?"
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2010.08,2016.504,"--I think the judge would have to, again to satisfy himself that this was a lawful sentence, and if the judge--"
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2016.504,2018.787,He'd have to satisfy himself there was a factual basis for it.
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2018.787,2029.946,"--Well, he would have to satisfy himself that there were facts supporting it, but one of the bits of evidence he could look to, and I think one of the primary pieces of evidence, would be the parties' agreement--"
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2029.946,2030.086,Sure.
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2030.086,2036.181,"--that it was so, and I think one highly relevant portion of the colloquy at the sentencing hearing--"
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2036.181,2041.887,"In other words, he has to find in the agreement a factual basis for concluding the assets are forfeitable."
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2041.887,2054.735,"--He has to find... he has to be satisfied that the property is forfeitable under the statute, and typically one of the ways that judges resolve potential factual disputes is by agreement or stipulation of the parties."
1995.94-7427,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2054.735,2059.748,"Right, so you're saying he does not have to satisfy himself personally of the factual basis."
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2065.712,2066.202,That is corr... he--
1995.94-7427,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2066.202,2071.317,"But if no concession that a factual basis exists is there, then he may have to conduct some other inquiry."
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2071.317,2072.027,--That is correct.
1995.94-7427,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2072.027,2073.73,But I think you're going beyond that.
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2090.302,2093.464,"I think that's correct, and I think in McCarthy v. United--"
1995.94-7427,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2093.464,2096.857,"It's correct that that's what you said, or it's correct that that would not be enough."
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2096.857,2097.838,"--Both, and--"
1995.94-7427,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2097.838,2097.969,Okay.
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2101.432,2102.293,--That's correct.
1995.94-7427,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2103.475,2107.616,But you were suggesting that there was an independent obligation on the part of the judge.
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2107.616,2116.902,--I'm suggesting in the context of guilty pleas under Rule 11(f) that in essence the plea of guilty cannot form its own factual basis.
1995.94-7427,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2116.902,2117.172,All right.
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2129.511,2130.182,Yes.
1995.94-7427,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2133.214,2134.426,"Now, why the difference?"
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2140.3,2140.491,--I--
1995.94-7427,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2140.491,2144.906,Is it the fact that the rule applies on guilt or innocence and the rule doesn't apply on forfeiture?
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2144.906,2146.087,"--That is correct, and I think--"
1995.94-7427,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2146.087,2151.312,But you have said... I apologize in a way for keeping cutting you off like this.
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2169.744,2170.856,"--That's correct, and ord--"
1995.94-7427,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2170.856,2172.846,What's the source of that obligation?
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2172.846,2193.28,"--The courts have recognized through the years that the judge has an independent obligation to impose a sentence that is authorized by law and indeed, the plea agreement in this case contained a term stating that the judge was not bound by the parties' agreement but would impose the sentence that he deemed--"
1995.94-7427,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2193.28,2196.701,"Does that get you to the equivalent of Rule 11, then?"
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2196.701,2201.265,"--I don't believe so, and let me explain by reference to McCarthy v. United States."
1995.94-7427,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2272.238,2283.464,Where in this plea agreement did the defendant acknowledge the factual basis for his giving up his title to all his property?
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2283.464,2290.129,The plea agreement contained only a term stating that the defendant agrees to transfer title to all his assets.
1995.94-7427,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2290.129,2299.817,"I think your case would be a lot stronger if you said the defendant agrees that all of these assets are properly forfeitable at law, and he agrees to transfer them all to the Government."
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2309.404,2339.234,"I think the strongest indication that this was the interpretation the parties placed upon the agreement is on page 149 of the Joint Appendix, which is the colloquy at the sentencing hearing, and petitioner's counsel... petitioner's then-counsel is addressing the court, and counsel states... the second, the first full paragraph, second paragraph... your Honor, of course--"
1995.94-7427,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2339.234,2339.674,On what page?
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2339.674,2342.078,--Page 149 of the Joint Appendix.
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2389.797,2392.129,That paragraph doesn't say all his property is covered by it.
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2392.129,2393.01,--He says--
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2393.01,2395.951,It says it may be some regular money and some illegal money.
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2395.951,2401.295,"--He says, regular money and illegal money under the substitute assets."
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2401.756,2405.037,It doesn't say that the substitute assets would eat up his entire estate.
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2405.037,2409.622,"--Well, he says both the CCE law and the forfeiture law is a harsh law."
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2410.092,2410.533,"Well, it is."
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2410.533,2412.403,--pill dealt by Congress.
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2412.403,2419.409,"But it's still not the same as saying he gets 100 percent of his estate, even if the forfeitable assets plus the substitute assets don't equal the total."
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2420.46,2445.047,"Well, at the hearing itself the Government made a motion for forfeiture that listed all the assets that were subsequently encompassed in the district court's order forfeiture, and defense counsel made no objection to that motion, and this is the portion of the colloquy that most directly addresses the issue of forfeiture, and it seems to us not to be an acknowledgement not simply that all of the property would be forfeited pursuant to the agreement--"
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2445.047,2445.918,But that all of it was forfeitable.
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2445.918,2446.108,--Exactly.
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2446.108,2449.011,But I don't think the court of appeals read it that way.
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2459.349,2475.26,"If you look at page 324 of the court of appeals, at the very bottom of the page, the fifth line from the bottom, the court of appeals states, he intended to forfeit all of his property without requiring the Government to prove the assets were forfeitable."
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2509.898,2526.57,"Well, is it irrelevant... what if the agreement made it perfectly clear that half of his assets were forfeitable properly, but the agreement nevertheless provided for forfeiture of all of his assets, so there was a clear, factual basis for saying that everything covered by the agreement is not authorized to be forfeited."
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2527.812,2542.72,"Well, if the agreement were clear on its face that the other half of the assets were not forfeitable under the statute but the parties were nevertheless agreeing to forfeit them, I think the district court's obligation would be to reject that aspect of the agreement--"
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2542.72,2542.87,Because--
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2542.87,2551.515,--just as if the Government and the defendant had agreed that the defendant would consent to a prison sentence in excess of that authorized by law.
1995.94-7427,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2551.515,2553.478,--And what if the plea agreement says nothing at all--
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2561.482,2569.277,I think probably the obligation of... probably the better practice on the part of the district court would be to inquire as to--
1995.94-7427,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2569.277,2569.768,I'm not talking about--
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2575.15,2577.003,--No.
1995.94-7427,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2583.408,2584.319,Never mind that.
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2608.064,2618.6,"--I think that the... precisely because the parties cannot stipulate to an illegal sentence, the judge could construe that as a concession that all of the property was forfeitable."
1995.94-7427,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2618.6,2619.371,He could.
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2619.371,2619.742,Yes.
1995.94-7427,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2619.742,2621.625,So he would not have to make any further inquiry?
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2621.625,2621.952,He would not.
1995.94-7427,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2623.655,2642.067,"Well, suppose that's not a reasonable way to construe the agreement, but that after the plea is accepted, he then holds a complete forfeiture hearing, is the plea still invalid?"
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2657.929,2658.309,--No.
1995.94-7427,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2666.726,2671.719,"But the plea stands, and then the question is just the adequacy of the post plea procedures."
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2673.149,2674.621,"--That's correct, but for--"
1995.94-7427,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2674.621,2675.242,Under your view of the case.
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2675.242,2687.96,"--That's correct, but pursuant to the agreement, if the parties... if the defendant had stipulated that all the assets were forfeitable, the judge would be perfectly justified in... and that agreement was plausible on its face--"
1995.94-7427,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2687.96,2689.342,This... sorry.
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2689.342,2704.952,"--The judge would be justified in ordering forfeiture on that basis alone without conducting additional proceedings, and certainly the point, from the Government's perspective of entering into this agreement, was precisely to obviate the need for an elaborate hearing on the question of forfeitability."
1995.94-7427,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2704.952,2708.795,What is the right form of words in your opinion?
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2769.194,2786.045,"Oh, I think the Government's view would be that, again, leaving aside for the question... for the moment the question of interpretation of the agreement, if it were clear that the agreement was a concession that certain assets were forfeitable under the statute, I think the ordinary principles governing--"
1995.94-7427,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2786.045,2787.046,"Yes, right."

1995.94-7427,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2830.587,2844.698,The correct form of words to describe the duty of a sentencing judge in the Federal system independently to determine the extent to which a fact relevant to sentencing is true--
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2844.698,2845.887,--I think--
1995.94-7427,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2845.887,2848.428,--given that there is a stipulation.
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2855.603,2856.355,--There--
1995.94-7427,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2856.355,2857.957,Maybe you have to ask some questions.
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2861.319,2876.55,"--I think as a general matter the district court's... the district court could enter an order of forfeiture in accordance with the agreement if the agreement was plausible on its face, and if it were not squarely contradicted by other record evidence."
1995.94-7427,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2876.75,2890.631,"And that also would hold for stipulations as to how much drugs there were, stipulations as to the proper guideline level, stipulations as to the amount of the fine, stipulations as to... you know."
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2893.824,2904.591,"--Well, at least as between the things are mentioned, some are purely factual determinations, some are purely legal determinations, and some are mixed questions of fact and law."
1995.94-7427,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2912.356,2918.571,But is it correct that that issue has to be reached by this Court when we write the case?
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2925.166,2925.987,Certainly--
1995.94-7427,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2925.987,2928.919,"I mean, those are the questions as I read them."
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2928.919,2939.678,--Certainly it isn't necessary to resolve this question to decide whether Rule 11(f) imposes upon the district court an obligation to find a factual basis for the plea.
1995.94-7427,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2939.678,2954.007,"Can you or do you take the position that if the judge takes appropriate action to determine forfeitability after the entry of the plea, that the plea is valid?"
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2954.007,2955.937,"Oh, that's correct, and in general--"
1995.94-7427,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2955.937,2957.679,"All right, and that's the first question."
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2976.172,2979.411,--That is somewhat unclear.
1995.94-7427,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3000.338,3001.359,But Mr. Stewart--
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3012.278,3013.429,"I mean, typically--"
1995.94-7427,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3013.429,3017.193,"You know the cases better than I do, but I'm surprised at your answer."
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3017.193,3041.657,"--As far as Department of Justice practice goes, typically if we were going to enter in... you're right that often when a case is tried to a jury there will be elaborate, difficult issues of forfeitability remaining, but when the Government enters into a plea agreement, typically there is an insistence upon obtaining stipulations or concessions as to forfeiture as well so that we don't essentially have to try the case despite the entry of the plea agreement."
1995.94-7427,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3051.194,3069.846,"Mr. Stewart, let me go back to the question I asked Ms. Beale, that this defendant was not told by the district judge going in about this most unusual kind of a jury determination that he would be entitled to if he didn't plead guilty."
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3090.483,3097.376,"We agree, but we don't believe that the knowing relinquishment standard of Johnson v. Zerbst would apply."
1995.94-7427,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3105.714,3110.264,"But under Rule 11 he's told about those rights, or many of them."
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3112.736,3117.47,--He's told about a small set of fundamental constitutional rights.
1995.94-7427,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3177.943,3180.224,I'm not asking you anything abstract.
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3193.834,3195.434,Yes.
1995.94-7427,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3204.991,3210.547,"I... the notion of an unknowing, unconscious waiver is disturbing."
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3216.222,3217.032,"--Well, in--"
1995.94-7427,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3217.032,3219.814,How can you waive something that you don't know you have a right to?
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3219.814,3235.815,"--Well, the Court has recognized in a variety of circumstances that as a general matter a defendant's rights, even constitutional rights, can be waived simply by the failure to assert them at the proper time, so it can often happen during the course of a criminal trial--"
1995.94-7427,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3235.815,3261.041,"Well, yes, but here, if we make the assumption for the sake of argument that this particular right, the jury determination with respect to forfeiture, is of constitutional dimension, then it would be very odd to say that the same guilty plea which waives the right to a trial on guilt and innocence should be treated differently from the guilty plea insofar as it waives the jury determination with respect to the forfeiture."
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3282.537,3291.576,"--Well, I think in fashioning Rule 11 the drafters didn't state that the defendant had to be advised of all the constitutional rights that--"
1995.94-7427,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3291.576,3295.67,"No, but just why... just... my question is, why would you want to draw that distinction?"
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3298.641,3319.246,"--Well, my answer may sound as though it's questioning your premise that this falls within the Sixth Amendment, but the fact is that the procedural protections available at a criminal trial as a prerequisite to a determination of guilt or innocence have always been given a higher status than procedural protections available at sentencing."
1995.94-7427,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3319.246,3321.279,That does sound as though you're rejecting my premise.
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3328.123,3337.65,"I guess we would say, first we would draw that distinction because we think that the drafters of Rule 11 drew that distinction."
1995.94-7427,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3357.716,3374.898,"Well, he was told that, and yet in the colloquy which is in... which has been already adverted to, the judge as part of that colloquy then went on to say, now, if you plead guilty, that's going to be the end of it and so on, and he says, the jury is not going to decide whether you're guilty or not."
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3413.233,3423.942,"Well, certainly that statement... I think the judge was primarily focusing on the right to jury trial on guilt or innocence, because that's the thing that's generally at issue."
1995.94-7427,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3423.942,3434.448,"So if you were standing there listening, wouldn't you draw the conclusion that you had a jury trial right on guilt and innocence, and likewise conclude that you didn't have a jury trial right on anything else?"
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3434.448,3437.831,"I think that's probably the most likely inference, and our position has never been--"
1995.94-7427,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3437.831,3446.467,"But normally you don't have a jury trial on the sentence, so what I don't understand is that here is a hybrid, as Ms. Beale called it."
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3473.144,3480.88,"--I mean, in... the Rule 11 really encompasses two categories of information that have to be conveyed to the defendant."
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3555.971,3560.414,"--Mr. Stewart, can I ask you... your time is about to expire... two questions about this particular case?"
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3566.607,3567.359,--That's correct.
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3567.359,3581.578,"And secondly, is it your reading of the court of appeals opinion that the post plea proceedings on forfeiture that the district judge was conducting cannot be conducted under the holding of the court of appeals?"
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3581.578,3592.357,"The court of appeals said that the district court retained jurisdiction to adjudicate third party claims to the property, but that the district court did not retain jurisdiction to entertain the petition."
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3592.357,3594.087,The defendant could not make any further claims.
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3594.087,3599.881,"That's correct, and the court of appeals essentially treated that aspect of the post judgment proceedings as a nullity."
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3599.881,3600.863,"Okay, thank you."
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3602.663,3604.145,There was a presentence report.
1995.94-7427,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3604.145,3606.275,And did the presentence report go into any of these facts?
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3606.275,3622.166,The presentence report contains information regarding the legitimate income that petitioner had earned over the years which would be relevant in determining the plausibility of the Government's claim that assets would be forfeitable under the substitute assets provision.
1995.94-7427,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3628.27,3637.987,"My point is, is there anything in that that would add to the quantum of information that the sentencing judge had if the obligation is on the sentencing judge to determine whether there is a basis for the forfeiture that he ordered?"
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3637.987,3642.499,--To the extent that the presentence report discusses petitioner's legitimate--
1995.94-7427,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3642.499,3643.491,"Does it help, or doesn't it help?"
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3643.491,3644.192,--It does help.
1995.94-7427,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3644.192,3644.93,Do we have it here?
1995.94-7427,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3645.401,3646.643,Okay.
1995.94-7427,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3663.133,3664.785,Okay.
1995.94-7427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3664.785,3666.775,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
