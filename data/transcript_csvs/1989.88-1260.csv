1989.88-1260,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1280.639,1290.407,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1260,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1366.228,1370.169,"How do... first of all, how do you know this, Mr. Merrill, and second, how do we know it?"
1989.88-1260,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1373.341,1376.734,"Yes, there was testimony in the district court about the significance of the routing instructions."
1989.88-1260,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1383.128,1391.676,"And so, what you are telling us now about what everybody knows is based on the testimony of expert witnesses before the trial court?"
1989.88-1260,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1391.676,1393.637,"It is not a question of fact, Your Honor."
1989.88-1260,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1394.728,1400.9,"Well, you... you're telling us that certain transactions have always been assumed to be just like this or just like that."
1989.88-1260,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1403.214,1408.056,"--Well, it is not a question of fact because the district court found the facts in this case."
1989.88-1260,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1432.825,1439.41,"So, are... is what you are telling us, were telling us a moment ago that everybody knows, is that based on findings of the district court?"
1989.88-1260,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1439.41,1445.104,We think that the court of appeals ruled as a matter of law that this is an obligation in New York.
1989.88-1260,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1447.658,1458.134,"Well, but your... your opening remarks, Mr. Merrill, were to the effect that there are a lot of things that people have been taking for granted for a long time, and this is how the cow ate the cabbage, so to speak."
1989.88-1260,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1463.187,1465.24,"Well, two things basically."
1989.88-1260,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1481.794,1484.495,"Well, but those cases aren't binding on us."
1989.88-1260,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1484.495,1495.922,"No, those are cases construing as a matter of law that the type... those types of routing obligations don't constitute a contract."
1989.88-1260,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1501.197,1504.25,"Well, how can you say then the court of appeals didn't disagree with any of the findings of the district court?"
1989.88-1260,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1504.25,1507.111,Because the court of appeals accepted the findings that--
1989.88-1260,2,21572,darryl_snider,,1924.332,1935.191,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2115.005,2115.925,"Well, is that quite correct?"
1989.88-1260,2,21572,darryl_snider,,2125.192,2126.955,"--Justice Stevens, if--"
1989.88-1260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2126.955,2133.188,"--and that that was in the nature of a contractual defense, that under the terms of the regulation if such restrictions are imposed they don't have to pay."
1989.88-1260,2,21572,darryl_snider,,2133.188,2147.988,"--In the answer that they filed, one of the affirmative defenses they pled, although they did not use the specific word MAAB 47 and the action taken by the Philippine government."
1989.88-1260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2147.988,2153.061,"But you do agree, do you not, that MAAB 47 was a restriction on withdrawals?"
1989.88-1260,2,21572,darryl_snider,,2153.061,2155.152,"No, I disagree, Justice Stevens."
1989.88-1260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2228.704,2231.077,"Well, that would be true with any freeze order, wouldn't it?"
1989.88-1260,2,21572,darryl_snider,,2233.839,2234.719,That's the point.
1989.88-1260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2247.911,2263.851,"Well, but I suppose that with any freeze order, if say France freezes money, I'm sure that France would be quite happy to say well, you can substitute one deposit for another so long as you keep the amount in deposit as of the time of our freeze order."
1989.88-1260,2,21572,darryl_snider,,2263.851,2266.903,"--Justice Kennedy, let me see if I can distinguish two things."
