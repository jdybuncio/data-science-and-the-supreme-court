1991.91-372,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.779,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 91-372, Georgia v. Thomas McCollum."
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,10.077,14.05,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1991.91-372,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,149.549,152.731,"That's in every criminal case, you get that number of peremptories in charges?"
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,152.731,162.558,"Your Honor, in all felonies where the punishment is greater than 3 years, which includes almost every felony in Georgia, it is 20 and 10."
1991.91-372,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,241.379,247.583,So under Georgia law the attorneys can each voir dire each one of the jurors.
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,247.583,248.494,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-372,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,324.774,334.351,Mr. Kohler what do you do about our holding in Polk County v. Dodson that public defenders do not act under color of State law--
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,334.351,335.182,Your Honor--
1991.91-372,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,335.182,337.373,--When they're representing a criminal defendant?
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,337.373,356.427,"--Justice O'Connor, my reading of Polk County v. Dodson was that in the filing, or in that case the not filing of the notice of appeal the public defender was not acting under color of State law because he was performing a private act on behalf of the defendant."
1991.91-372,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,383.412,389.297,"Well, that results in a rather peculiar distinction, don't you think?"
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,389.297,401.434,"Your Honor, I would... no, because I believe that what the State is asserting in this case is consistent with what the majority opinion in Edmondson."
1991.91-372,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,411.192,414.514,"Well, of course, that wasn't my view, but I recognize that's the holding of the Court."
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,414.514,421.7,"--Yes, ma'am, and we believe that the majority opinion does support the State of Georgia's position in this case."
1991.91-372,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,421.7,438.08,Do you think if counsel in a criminal case excused a juror and the allegation was excusal was on the basis of race that there'd be a 1983 suit that could be brought against the counsel by the excluded jurors?
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,438.08,440.6,"Justice Kennedy, in theory, yes."
1991.91-372,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,455.341,459.204,Absent the creation of some sort of privilege or immunity.
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,459.204,467.769,"Correct, if there were within the four corners of the courtroom that the defense counsel are immune from any damages, of course, in that case, that would prohibit it."
1991.91-372,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,488.983,506.154,"If counsel strikes... if you win this case, counsel who is striking a black juror is going to have to give a reason."
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,506.154,507.444,Yes.
1991.91-372,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,507.444,509.917,And it's either going to be accepted or not.
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,509.917,510.667,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-372,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,510.667,514.279,"And if it's not accepted, the juror's going to sit."
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,514.279,517.602,"Well, that's certainly one of the options that this Court--"
1991.91-372,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,517.602,518.844,"Well, he's going to sit."
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,529.559,536.444,"--Well, Your Honor, I certainly wasn't arguing for the practicality of it, and the obstacles might be daunting."
1991.91-372,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,563.781,567.073,"This trial here hasn't taken place, has it?"
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,567.073,567.894,"No, Your Honor, it has not."
1991.91-372,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,567.894,588.097,"So that if you win the trial court when it does try the case would, as Justice White suggests I suppose, require that any challenge of a black juror by a defendant just as by the State be supported by a reason if the Batson test is met."
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,588.097,602.576,"Yes, Your Honor, that is our position exactly, that... and again, the State has operated under the principles of Batson since 1986, and it has not prevented the State from empaneling impartial juries."
1991.91-372,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,641.782,648.818,Is there some feeling by prosecutors that Batson has generally hurt the prosecution--
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,648.818,649.667,"--Your Honor, I--"
1991.91-372,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,649.667,650.598,--Or do you know?
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,650.598,652.699,--I can't speak for myself.
1991.91-372,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,689.895,696.68,Do you get any substantial number of reversals on appeal because of claimed Batson violations?
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,696.68,702.093,"No, Your Honor, I can think of one case early."
1991.91-372,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,744.319,760.712,"Mr. Kohler, would you have any idea of how frequently there are appeals on the basis of disagreement with the reasons given and accepted by the court for... under the Batson inquiry?"
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,760.712,765.637,"There certainly... it's not unusual, and there certainly are appeals on that issue."
1991.91-372,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,808.503,809.304,Before you do that--
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,809.304,809.825,--I'm sorry.
1991.91-372,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,809.825,815.688,--It seems to me you've been asked whether the State finds it oppressive.
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,824.875,825.815,Your Honor--
1991.91-372,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,825.815,831.61,"--Especially... not just in an interracial crime, but where the crime is alleged to have been racially motivated."
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,852.343,857.346,"--Your Honor, I would disagree with the Court, and may I explain."
1991.91-372,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,875.229,876.538,I'm not talking about bias.
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,925.662,942.253,"--Your Honor, I would simply respectfully disagree, that the State of Georgia's position that simply striking a juror under the assumption that because a juror is of a particular race, whether white or black, that that is not sufficient, that if there's a prima facie case of racial discrimination, neutral reasons should have to be given."
1991.91-372,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,942.253,945.935,"Do you favor peremptories generally, or--"
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,945.935,947.226,Your Honor--
1991.91-372,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,947.226,950.72,"--I mean, I would think that that position leads to the position that you shouldn't have peremptories."
1991.91-372,0,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,950.72,955.511,"--Your Honor, I believe a small number of peremptories are desirable."
1991.91-372,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1000.552,1001.861,"Thank you, Mr. Kohler."
1991.91-372,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1003.664,1010.586,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1047.301,1048.604,But sex is all right--
1991.91-372,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1048.604,1051.576,"Justice Scalia, the Government has taken--"
1991.91-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1051.576,1054.597,"--Or age is all right, or employment is all right."
1991.91-372,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1061.79,1064.192,--In the Government's view that is not a problem.
1991.91-372,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1128.925,1137.251,"Mr. Dreeben, you would not extend that same inquiry to peremptories exercised on the basis of gender, then?"
1991.91-372,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1137.251,1139.261,"We would not, Justice O'Connor."
1991.91-372,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1140.551,1154.603,"I think that's rather hard to defend if the Court has, of course, under the very same provisions that protect against racial discrimination applied a form of heightened scrutiny to gender-based discrimination."
1991.91-372,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1156.834,1162.437,"--Well, the Court has applied a higher level of equal protection and scrutiny to race than it has to gender."
1991.91-372,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1166.899,1179.307,"Well, you don't think that the cases from this Court dealing with Batson and Edmondson have resorted to reliance on that difference in the level of scrutiny, do you?"
1991.91-372,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1179.307,1180.058,--No.
1991.91-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1223.706,1231.833,"Well, Mr. Dreeben, you characterize this as not being... the defendant doesn't have the right to strike somebody out of bias or prejudice."
1991.91-372,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1244.43,1245.262,"Well, the claim is--"
1991.91-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1245.262,1246.924,The same thing with striking... a racial strike.
1991.91-372,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1255.339,1261.793,"--Well, the assumption is that a black juror cannot possibly be fair when a racial crime is involved."
1991.91-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1261.793,1263.392,That's not the assumption at all.
1991.91-372,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1282.437,1289.441,"Well, I don't think it represents a prediction based on anything that can be identified, and therefore it is attributable to what is characterized as bias."
1991.91-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1321.841,1323.383,"Well, I don't think you ought to be able to slander postmen that way either."
1991.91-372,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1327.825,1337.882,"Well, I don't think it's a slander of postmen in any sense comparable to the invidious connotations that this Court has assigned to race-based classifications."
1991.91-372,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1337.882,1351.373,"On the gender question you're not of course suggesting, I take it, that the stereotypical judgment based on sex has any more validity than the stereotypic judgment based on race."
1991.91-372,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1351.373,1352.692,"No, Justice Kennedy."
1991.91-372,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1392.188,1407.209,"Well, of course, we're just in the process of seeing many causes of action created to protect women, and I assume that you would have a number of cases in which an all-male or an all-female jury would be of advantage to one side or the other--"
1991.91-372,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1407.209,1411.383,--It can happen and it has happened in particular cases.
1991.91-372,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1414.035,1416.255,--If you assume a stereotypic attitude.
1991.91-372,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1416.255,1417.147,--That's correct.
1991.91-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1449.938,1454.78,"Well, it's a classic application of Batson after the Edmondson case."
1991.91-372,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1454.78,1456.473,"--That's correct, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1991.91-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1523.158,1524.717,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
1991.91-372,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1524.717,1525.248,--Thank you.
1991.91-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1525.248,1530.204,"Mr. Revell, we'll hear from you."
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,1530.204,1536.097,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the members of the Court:
1991.91-372,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1564.384,1569.287,"Would you say that the only things that stand between them are the attorney, the jury, and the law?"
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,1569.287,1572.65,"Yes, Justice Kennedy, I would agree with that."
1991.91-372,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1653.923,1661.317,"Mr. Revell, what about the situation where say the State of Georgia had sued your client civilly, not criminally?"
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,1668.253,1682.521,"Your Honor, I think the civil context... the Court in Edmondson, as I read it, distinguished the situation in which the Government would be a party to an action."
1991.91-372,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1693.838,1700.683,You say your case is still different from that because you're defending against the Government in a criminal action.
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,1700.683,1707.609,My case is different than that because the Government is the very party that I am in opposition to in a case.
1991.91-372,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1707.609,1710.421,"Well, that's true in a civil action brought by the Government, too."
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,1710.421,1713.403,But the posture of the parties is slightly different.
1991.91-372,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1713.403,1714.471,In what respect--
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,1714.471,1715.904,In the civil--
1991.91-372,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1715.904,1721.496,"--Other than the obvious, that in a criminal action the defendant faces the possibility of imprisonment."
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,1726.171,1741.269,"--Your Honor, in a civil action the parties are acting under the same rules and guidelines to achieve the end of a jury verdict or a judgment for money damages or property."
1991.91-372,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1741.269,1745.434,You mean they're operating under civil rules rather than criminal rules?
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,1745.434,1746.205,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-372,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1746.205,1755.808,"Well, if you say they're both operating under civil rules in a civil case, you would have to say they were both operating under criminal rules in a criminal case, would you not?"
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,1755.808,1765.195,"Your Honor, the distinction is the difference in which the posture of the criminal defendant is placed to that party."
1991.91-372,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1789.641,1792.813,Are you thinking of the Georgia Constitution or the Federal Constitution?
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,1792.813,1796.626,"--I'm speaking primarily of the Federal Constitution in this instance, and the purpose--"
1991.91-372,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1796.626,1801.699,"One of those rights given by the Constitution is not the right to make peremptory challenges, is it?"
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,1801.699,1803.129,"--No, Your Honor."
1991.91-372,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1920.377,1921.987,"Well, let's assume that's so."
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,1924.068,1924.839,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-372,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1924.839,1947.914,"Isn't the judge the person who ultimately excuses the challenged juror, so that even if we accept your theory that the defense counsel can't change hats all the time the Court is still going to be engaged in State action, and if the Court does it at the behest of someone acting from racial animus the Court partakes of that animus, and doesn't that compel the same result?"
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,1947.914,1977.894,"With all due respect, Your Honor, we feel that the judge in the specific context of the peremptory challenge does nothing more than administratively acquiesce to the private decision the attorney has made under the law to exercise a choice, that the function of the judge is merely an acquiescence, that he takes no official action in regard to that juror, and in fact in many cases in Georgia the judge makes no comment whatsoever."
1991.91-372,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2019.371,2026.105,"Well, what about the case in which there is objection to the exercise of the peremptory challenge because it's being exercised from racial animus?"
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,2028.386,2032.44,"--No, Your Honor, I'm not sure I follow the question."
1991.91-372,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2032.44,2042.556,"Isn't... let's assume that there's an objection to the peremptory challenge, and the objection is the challenge is being exercised out of racial animus."
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,2057.416,2066.94,"In that case it would seem that the Court, as in Batson, has already determined and held that that right to object exists."
1991.91-372,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2078.099,2091.92,"You might even be willing to concede, mightn't you, as far as your case is concerned, that if it were demonstrated that the strike was made out of racial animus as far as you're concerned that'd be okay."
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,2100.706,2101.608,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-372,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2115.479,2117.729,"Oh, but you're arguing for a right to do so, aren't you?"
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,2117.729,2122.761,"--I am arguing for a right to choose, a right--"
1991.91-372,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2122.761,2125.643,For any reason that seems acceptable to your client.
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,2125.643,2126.925,"--Or no reason, Your Honor."
1991.91-372,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2126.925,2128.665,"Correct, including racial animus."
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,2128.665,2129.937,That's correct.
1991.91-372,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2136.342,2149.69,Would you be satisfied with a holding that said you can't strike a juror because of racial animus but you can use race as one of the probabilities in deciding what kind of a jury to pick?
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,2149.69,2178.831,"Your Honor, I think this Court has implied that in its holding in Powers and also in a concurring opinion in Hernandez v. New York, in which the Court seems to indicate that there are... there's a continuum where on one end the peremptory challenge is solely out of racial animus and on the... somewhere moving down the continuum there are racial factors which influence the decision which are going to make it more and more acceptable to the trial judge when offered."
1991.91-372,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2178.831,2183.202,"But our holdings to date, Edmondson and so forth, don't hinge upon animus at all, do they?"
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,2189.868,2191.087,Absolutely.
1991.91-372,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2191.087,2193.851,Isn't the word animus somewhat ambiguous?
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,2203.415,2205.986,"It may very well be, Your Honor."
1991.91-372,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2241.56,2264.087,"Well, suppose that in a case such as the one we have here on voir dire a black juror said to you I have to tell you that I'm very affronted by an assault against someone of my race and I don't think I could put my race out of my mind in deciding this case."
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,2273.142,2274.192,"No, Your Honor."
1991.91-372,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2285.759,2298.218,"So that I've just demonstrated to you, and I think you agree, that race can be a factor in excusal of the juror if it indicates that the juror is... is not impartial."
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,2298.218,2300.248,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-372,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2327.365,2343.488,"Even if we rule against you here, you're going to be in better... a criminal defendant is going to be in better shape than the prosecution insofar as appealing adverse rulings."
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,2357.277,2369.595,"Yes, Your Honor, the State is going to have very little incentive in that situation to carry the case on, and the juror is likely going to have very little incentive in seeing a trial... a case retried or reversed."
1991.91-372,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2490.435,2494.379,I really don't understand why the jury is any different from the trial judge in that respect.
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,2507.238,2513.031,"--Your Honor, I would liken the jury more to a trustee of the people."
1991.91-372,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2513.031,2514.732,So's the judge in the same sense.
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,2514.732,2528.873,"But the jury have the bond of trust to their peers, in which they have the ultimate fact-finding say-so to determine guilt or innocence, and for that reason--"
1991.91-372,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2528.873,2532.115,They're surely not an agent of the defendant.
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,2532.115,2534.316,--Absolutely not.
1991.91-372,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2539.408,2542.962,"Well, they're not wholly independent."
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,2544.632,2546.965,Absolutely.
1991.91-372,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2674.997,2682.894,"We're going to have to do that for the prosecution and for attorneys in private civil litigations as the law stands now, are we not?"
1991.91-372,2,40271,robert_h_revell_jr,,2682.894,2687.847,"Very probably so, Your Honor, but hopefully we won't have to do it for the defendant."
1991.91-372,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2817.364,2823.057,"Thank you, Mr. Revell."
1991.91-372,3,27445,harrison_w_kohler,,2826.249,2830.453,"Your Honor, unless the Court has questions I will waive the remainder of my time."
1991.91-372,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2830.453,2831.705,Thank you.
