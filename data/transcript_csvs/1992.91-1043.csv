1992.91-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.689,"We'll hear argument now in No. 91-1043, the Professional Real Estate Investors v. Columbia Pictures Industries."
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,12.105,14.807,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,134.551,139.555,"What precise intent would you say was sufficient here, Mr. Coyne?"
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,139.555,148.661,"Chief Justice, it's the intent to use the process itself to harm competition as distinct from the intent to achieve a judicial outcome as an anticompetitive tool."
1992.91-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,148.661,155.397,And do you think... what about a mixed motive case where you're rummaging through a corporation's files?
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,160.349,164.003,Virtually every case is going to be a case of mixed motive.
1992.91-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,192.721,193.321,And that's the end of the case.
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,203.928,204.845,"No, Justice White."
1992.91-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,238.832,241.7,"Well, when you look at all the factors, what are you trying to decide?"
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,241.7,249.64,"You're trying to decide whether the litigant, the plaintiff, in the underlying lawsuit genuinely intended to be exercising a First Amendment right."
1992.91-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,249.64,254.275,"So, you say that intent in the end is the determining factor."
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,254.275,258.495,"In the way this case is presented to the courts... Court, absolutely, yes, it is."
1992.91-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,258.495,268.352,"And so, if they don't have any intent... considering all the factors, if there was no intent to harm competition, that's the end of the case."
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,268.352,271.637,If there were no intent to harm competition at all?
1992.91-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,271.637,271.97,Yes.
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,271.97,274.922,"Certainly, but that's not this case, and we have not yet--"
1992.91-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,274.922,277.022,"Well, I know, but if there is intent--"
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,277.022,277.422,--gotten discovery to examine--
1992.91-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,277.422,288.146,"--If there is intent to harm competition, it doesn't make any difference how well based the case was or even if it was won."
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,288.146,289.43,--Assuming that fact--
1992.91-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,289.43,289.815,Yes.
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,289.815,293.384,"--yes, there would be no basis to inject a sham argument."
1992.91-1043,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,311.428,311.728,You--
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,327.355,329.521,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, we do."
1992.91-1043,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,329.521,333.259,Is that not protected by the First Amendment?
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,333.259,333.725,It--
1992.91-1043,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,333.725,337.894,There's no First Amendment right to bring a lawsuit if you're indifferent to the outcome?
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,337.894,340.663,"--If you are indifferent to the outcome, no."
1992.91-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,356.105,356.772,"Well, there's a difference--"
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,361.926,364.509,The First Amendment protects a right to bring a lawsuit.
1992.91-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,364.509,366.461,I said have we held that.
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,366.461,382.804,"I believe that not in those terms, but this Court has in Vendo and in Bill Johnson's Restaurants held that a much higher standard, almost equivalent to a prior restraint standard, is necessary in the setting of trying to enjoin pending litigation."
1992.91-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,382.804,384.422,Because of the First Amendment?
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,384.422,389.207,"I believe that that... my reading of the case is that it is, yes."
1992.91-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,437.021,446.061,But you seldom get a summary judgment in a case like this if you can go through a corporation's files on a question of intent.
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,451.281,453.483,"It... Chief Justice, it is a bright line."
1992.91-1043,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,482.769,487.573,May I pin you down a little bit on your concept of motivation?
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,515.155,516.256,"Yes, it is."
1992.91-1043,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,518.692,519.258,Yes.
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,519.258,541.374,"On reflecting further on it, what may be a more workable standard for the Court is to examine it on a but-for basis; namely, if the case would not have been brought but for the predatory motive separating out the legitimate petitioning motive from the predatory motive, if it were not brought but for the predatory motive, that case would never have been brought at all legitimately."
1992.91-1043,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,541.374,544.492,"The courts are going to determine this, this very, very delicate--"
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,544.492,545.242,Depending on the--
1992.91-1043,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,545.242,547.342,--delicate question of motivation?
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,547.342,561.333,"--Depending on the development of the record, Justice Scalia, yes, there are situations where the court would be well within its province to dispose of the case if there were presumptions created, for example, a nonbaseless case that was successful below."
1992.91-1043,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,563.183,563.516,Right.
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,571.886,572.822,"--No, Justice."
1992.91-1043,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,572.822,579.242,--whether this suit would have been brought but for the fact that it is harming a competitor.
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,579.242,581.442,Not every case would go to that stage.
1992.91-1043,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,587.762,588.196,"Successful, right."
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,588.196,589.246,--unlike the one here--
1992.91-1043,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,589.246,589.646,Right.
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,589.646,598.118,"--and there were... discovery was allowed and there were no evidence... there was no evidence developed that the case was predatorily motivated, we would agree."
1992.91-1043,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,605.573,610.442,When does anybody bring suit against a competitor without hoping to harm the competitor?
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,610.442,612.044,"Well, I would imagine very rarely."
1992.91-1043,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,612.911,614.329,"So, there will always be some evidence."
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,620.067,623.285,"--Stated that broadly, petitioners don't agree."
1992.91-1043,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,639.779,640.897,"Well, you're changing your testimony."
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,642.914,647.55,My suggestion is that the standard is whether the intent is genuine.
1992.91-1043,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,660.208,665.596,The but-for test is different from your indifference to result test.
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,665.596,669.631,We have given this a great deal of thought since the briefs were prepared.
1992.91-1043,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,673.535,679.106,"But you're articulating it now and it's different from the standard of indifference to result, is it not?"
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,679.106,681.206,"--No, I don't believe it's different, Justice Souter."
1992.91-1043,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,717.045,720.929,"One thing is clear, isn't it, that we'll never have summary judgment in one of these cases?"
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,720.929,721.698,Not necessarily.
1992.91-1043,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,727.15,729.268,Somebody is going to have to be pretty careless.
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,729.268,730.452,Not necessarily.
1992.91-1043,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,741.76,742.093,Excuse me.
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,743.528,745.897,--Based on the success in the underlying case.
1992.91-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,757.622,760.989,But that still isn't going to do a whit for you on summary judgment.
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,760.989,763.191,"It would, Chief Justice."
1992.91-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,774.731,776.849,But that would be true without the presumption.
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,783.253,786.705,"That is true, but in this case, no discovery was allowed."
1992.91-1043,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,786.705,788.99,"Well, then isn't what I said correct?"
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,809.051,812.07,We believe that the United States is wrong in that position.
1992.91-1043,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,850.778,858.698,Was the argument made below for your clients basically that the suit was really baseless?
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,860.717,864.002,"We had argued both points below, that the suit was baseless."
1992.91-1043,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,889.569,907.115,"Even if we accepted your view or something that was quite proximate to it, would we not have to be quite careful about suits involving intellectual property which, after all, are monopolies in themselves?"
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,925.141,941.001,"Justice Kennedy, as long as the copyright holder or the patent owner is operating within the lawful scope of that statutory monopoly, that's fine, but for example, in this case, one of the issues we had raised that they were attempting to misuse their copyrights."
1992.91-1043,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,948.756,953.327,"Well, but it seems to me that you're not quite consistent with your predatory motive test."
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,970.789,976.693,"The standard that we would urge the Court to adopt is, in terms of the test that would be applied, a but-for test."
1992.91-1043,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,997.356,998.922,"Well, but I go back to my original question."
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1002.54,1013.912,The... what this Court did under Noerr and under Pennington is to immunize it as long as that motive is a motive to achieve the predatory result through the outcome as distinct from the process.
1992.91-1043,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1013.912,1015.098,But those weren't copyright suits.
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1015.098,1015.564,I'm sorry?
1992.91-1043,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1015.564,1017.55,But those were not copyright suits.
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1017.55,1026.155,"They were not, but this Court has dealt with the issue in Walker Process, in United States v. Singer, in the hand guards cases in the Ninth Circuit."
1992.91-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1050.853,1055.472,"Under your but-for test, would it be a strictly factual test?"
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1064.378,1067.03,We believe that it should be a subjective test.
1992.91-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1072.95,1077.754,But it's actual factual intent of these particular litigants that would be the question.
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1077.754,1078.571,"Yes, Chief Justice."
1992.91-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1097.584,1103.738,And this is all to be digested and found on by a jury I take it in a disputed fact question.
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1103.738,1107.273,"If there were genuine issues of material fact, yes."
1992.91-1043,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1107.273,1111.142,May I ask you two questions to be sure I have your test right?
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1142.613,1143.029,Yes.
1992.91-1043,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1149.783,1159.991,"Then the second question I have, would it not normally be true that the facts that enable one to decide whether the... your test is met would be privileged communications?"
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1159.991,1161.225,Not necessarily.
1992.91-1043,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1192.896,1195.998,"Why wouldn't it be crime fraud, I mean, if you're violating the Sherman Act?"
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1195.998,1196.564,In the--
1992.91-1043,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1196.564,1206.604,"I mean, any statement made to a lawyer that shows that you're bringing this suit violating the but-for case, you've been guilty of a criminal violation I suppose, wouldn't it?"
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1206.604,1208.805,"--The... we would agree, though... yes."
1992.91-1043,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1210.607,1212.29,"So, there's really no problem."
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1214.892,1215.259,--But the--
1992.91-1043,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1215.259,1219.277,The answer is you'll be able to get all the communications between the lawyer and the client.
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1219.277,1221.313,"--That's not necessarily true, Justice Scalia."
1992.91-1043,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1243.328,1246.946,"Mr. Coyne, why should we adopt this special rule for the Sherman Act?"
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1270.645,1271.078,Yes.
1992.91-1043,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1285.719,1295.777,But you contend that that's... you contend that that standard with respect to abuse of process in the antitrust area is different from the standard everywhere else.
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1313.988,1314.455,I'm sorry.
1992.91-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1349.994,1356.148,I guess your answer is there's a Federal law against litigation like that.
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1356.148,1357.767,There are Federal laws against--
1992.91-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1357.767,1358.95,Like the antitrust law.
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1358.95,1363.337,"--Justice White, yes, that is precisely the law that we urge is contrary to it."
1992.91-1043,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1395.19,1398.975,May I ask you a question about your understanding of the Ninth Circuit rule?
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1409.514,1413.399,It's unclear from the Ninth Circuit's decision in this case.
1992.91-1043,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1421.488,1422.438,Yes.
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1443.818,1445.953,"It depends on the lawsuit, Justice Stevens."
1992.91-1043,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1456.225,1462.146,"Of course, that's standard in trademark and copyright litigation, isn't it, to put everybody on notice that you're going to defend your monopoly?"
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1462.146,1471.584,"I'm not sure that the analogy is a perfect one in this setting for the precise reason the district court held below, that this was not a proper protection of the monopoly."
1992.91-1043,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1474.334,1478.654,"No, but if you assume they thought it was until after it had been litigated, then it would be normal behavior, wouldn't it?"
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1478.654,1481.773,"Well, we're getting into the baselessness issue."
1992.91-1043,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1481.773,1482.056,Right.
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1482.056,1489.296,We think there are very serious reasons why the district court should have realized that these respondents knew they did not have the rights they were alleging.
1992.91-1043,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1490.662,1493.248,"No, but for our purposes we're assuming it is not a baseless lawsuit."
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1496.116,1496.583,--Yes.
1992.91-1043,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1496.583,1497.883,"I mean, I can understand your argument."
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1501.585,1503.218,Or admissions in other cases.
1992.91-1043,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1503.218,1510.607,"--Yes, but we have to assume it was not baseless, I mean, for our testing the rule."
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1510.607,1513.143,"For purposes of this inquiry, yes."
1992.91-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1516.178,1519.713,What was your claim of antitrust injury?
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1519.713,1530.938,"The injury that we allege here is, as the Ninth Circuit recognized, at a minimum having to defend the case, but petitioner, Mr. Kenneth Irwin, was also a video equipment dealer at the time this case was brought."
1992.91-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1548.197,1560.588,"Well, you would always... he certainly has a... apparently has a right to protect his copyright."
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1560.588,1560.921,--He does.
1992.91-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1560.921,1566.991,"And if he thinks you're violating his copyright, he can sue you."
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1574.829,1576.745,He has a right to protect his copyright.
1992.91-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1583.85,1588.385,"Well, then the copyright owner is always going to be at risk."
1992.91-1043,0,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,1588.385,1590.151,Not necessarily.
1992.91-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1592.003,1593.053,"Very well, Mr. Coyne."
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1596.372,1600.359,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1043,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1616.035,1618.904,"Noerr doesn't even mention the First Amendment, does it?"
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1618.904,1623.039,"Well, it mentions... actually in a footnote, it states that the Court isn't reaching the First Amendment question--"
1992.91-1043,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1623.039,1623.289,Yes.
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1623.289,1628.507,--because it's resting its decision on statutory interpretation grounds.
1992.91-1043,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1708.293,1711.495,"Well, that's not their current test anyway."
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1720.617,1733.841,"I understand it's not their test, Justice Scalia, but in City of Columbia, the Court framed the inquiry as a lawsuit that was not genuinely aimed at procuring favorable government action at all, and Noerr was certainly--"
1992.91-1043,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1733.841,1738.126,"Yes, because Columbia wasn't a litigation case."
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1738.126,1740.745,"--No, but it was a case about what the sham exception means."
1992.91-1043,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1778.434,1791.575,"It is true, as the petitioners' counsel pointed out, you might tend to sit on the sidelines or just wait it out if it's in the legislative forum, whereas if you're being sued, you have no choice but to proceed."
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1794.527,1800.144,"Well, although your... I mean, your interests may be affected in just... in as much a material way."
1992.91-1043,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1827.709,1828.309,Well--
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1828.309,1830.478,--petitioning activity generally and lawsuits in particular.
1992.91-1043,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1830.478,1835.465,"--But Noerr, as you say, just relegates the First Amendment to a footnote."
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1838.065,1860.163,"Well, it relied on the interests, the petitioning interests, that were at stake there and said that one of the reasons it was... the Court said that one of the reasons it was construing the Sherman Act the way it did was to avoid potential First Amendment problems and also on the assumption that Congress would not have wanted to come close to burdening those interests, at least without some more particular directive."
1992.91-1043,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1870.269,1877.356,"Of course, it involved legislative attempts, I mean, rather than judicial attempts."
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1877.356,1879.291,"It did, and in California Motor Transport, the Court--"
1992.91-1043,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1879.291,1894.551,"So, I mean, you know, even if you assume that it referred to First Amendment interests, it's a lot more plausible in the context of trying to cut off somebody from going to the legislature than it is cutting off somebody from going to the courts."
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1894.551,1907.358,"--Several years later, though, in California Motor Transport, the Court squarely held that the very same interests warrant that extending Noerr to the judicial petitioning to the litigation area, and the decision in Bill Johnson's--"
1992.91-1043,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1907.358,1909.06,Did we mention the First Amendment there?
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1909.06,1911.06,"--Yes, you did."
1992.91-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1917.88,1926.986,"Well, you... your standard is exactly that of the court of appeals, that if you've got a... if your suit isn't baseless, that's the end of it."
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1926.986,1927.419,"No, Your Honor."
1992.91-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1955.719,1959.873,"So, in the end do you think intent is determinative?"
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1959.873,1969.229,"--We think it's a two-part test, that there is an objective element and a subjective element, that we don't say intent... and we don't think the court of appeals said intent... is irrelevant."
1992.91-1043,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1983.005,1986.94,"And if you don't reach that threshold, you don't inquire into intent."
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1986.94,1987.624,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1992.91-1043,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1994.027,2001.033,But the purpose of the objective threshold is in order ultimately to show the forbidden intent?
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2001.033,2007.521,The purpose of the objective threshold is to eliminate the chill that would result from a wholly subjective standard.
1992.91-1043,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2015.025,2034.671,"So, if there were unequivocal evidence of subjective intent to harass and to take predatory action only, say, by letters in the file that the plaintiff had before the discovery process began... he somehow had them... that would be insufficient?"
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2034.671,2035.921,"That would be insufficient, yes."
1992.91-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2127.966,2142.124,And you think your standard ought to apply in a copyright case if you've got clear unequivocal proof that you have an intent to monopolize.
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2142.124,2146.158,"--Well, Your Honor, that kind of intent, of course, is not the kind of intent that Noerr was referring to."
1992.91-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2158.733,2167.089,"Yes, and you want to put the fellow you're suing out of business because he's... he... you think he's using your copyright."
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2167.089,2174.845,"And that's entirely legitimate because the way you're going... if the way you're going to put him out of business is by getting an injunction by prevailing in a copyright proceeding, that's entirely legitimate."
1992.91-1043,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2186.568,2188.185,"But, Mr. Pincus, isn't there a little difference?"
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2212.268,2219.272,"--Well, although I think in the copyright context, you could premise it just on a single copyright because, as Justice White says, that's a monopoly in itself."
1992.91-1043,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2219.272,2219.772,"Yes, but--"
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2219.772,2220.505,"I mean, here there are efficiencies."
1992.91-1043,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2220.505,2221.624,--But that's certainly not this case.
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2221.624,2232.48,"There are tremendous efficiencies for copyright holders to use antipiracy committees to enforce their rights because the burden on one copyright holder to do that would be tremendous, and so if the law permits--"
1992.91-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2232.48,2244.739,"Well, you... if you're going to sue a person with a legitimate claim of a copyright infringement, you're always going to be imposing litigation costs on him."
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2252.443,2257.547,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that's exactly the problem with petitioners' standard is that in every single case--"
1992.91-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2257.547,2259.665,"Well, it sounds just like that's your problem too."
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2259.665,2263.967,"--Well, except the only way we can enforce our copyright rights are in court."
1992.91-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2284.695,2296.585,Tell me in a copyright case again what would be the... it wouldn't be the intent to monopolize and enforce your copyright that causes the plaintiff any trouble.
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2308.224,2322.534,"It's the intent... well, as the Court put it in City of Columbia, it's the intent to disrupt the defendants in the initial lawsuit, the defendants' business relationships, solely through the litigation process without any regard to prevailing--"
1992.91-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2322.534,2330.889,"Well, I know, but we're talking about a copyright, and he certainly is intending to interfere with the plaintiffs'... with the defendants' business."
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2332.925,2338.745,--But only through the burdens of the litigation process and not through the ultimate judgment.
1992.91-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2343.38,2351.136,"I know, but if you're going to succeed in the case and get a judgment, that burden on the defendant is always going to be there."
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2351.136,2351.836,"--I agree, Your Honor."
1992.91-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2354.755,2356.457,That's the problem with your test.
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2356.457,2378.703,"--No, I don't think it's the problem with our test, Your Honor, because I think that the problem... the Court recognized in Noerr that where there's a mixed motivation, where the intention is to burden the other side through the governmental process, through the outcome of the governmental process, as well as through the process itself, that mixed motivation case is a case that's protected under Noerr."
1992.91-1043,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2393.046,2399.867,"Well, you say also, but before you get to intent under your standard, you have to cross an objective threshold."
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2399.867,2421.197,"Exactly, Your Honor, and we think that... the reason for that is that when we're weighing the costs and the benefits of the contending standards, as I was saying, the cost in terms of antitrust... lessening of antitrust enforcement in requiring an objective test is quite low because, as Mr. Coyne said, virtually every case is going to be a mixed motive case."
1992.91-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2434.457,2437.992,Especially with the level of legal fees.
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2437.992,2438.792,--Exactly.
1992.91-1043,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2452.65,2453.502,"Mr. Pincus, can I ask you?"
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2458.906,2459.356,--Yes.
1992.91-1043,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2519.243,2520.778,Two... one.
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2524.896,2526.682,"Your Honor, I don't think it's clear."
1992.91-1043,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2554.832,2568.175,"Mr. Pincus, does rule 11 proscribe lawsuits that are properly conducted, but brought solely to impose litigation costs on the other side?"
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2568.175,2572.71,Rule 11 does have language prohibiting lawsuits with an improper purpose.
1992.91-1043,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2572.71,2573.46,Exactly.
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2573.46,2582.066,But the courts... the lower... it's interesting that the lower courts have interpreted that to permit proof of purpose only through objective misconduct.
1992.91-1043,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2619.858,2623.076,I guess we haven't handed down anything on that point.
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2623.076,2640.021,"You... this Court has not addressed it, but I think the Court's decision in the Harlow case is very instructive because that was a situation in which the Court had, for official immunity, adopted a standard that required... in order for immunity to apply, both an objective and a subjective test had to be satisfied."
1992.91-1043,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2657.399,2669.456,"On the other hand, there isn't a whole lot of social utility in allowing lawsuits for the sole purpose of causing business injury."
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2669.456,2673.492,"Well, Your Honor, but that's not the conduct that's being protected by an objective standard."
1992.91-1043,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2682.731,2699.56,"Before you do, if we agree that mixed motive is a safe harbor, we're really not arguing about a whole lot, are we, because if it is above the baseless level, there will almost always be a mixed motive?"
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2723.775,2728.662,I think it avoids significant burdens on the people with legitimate motives and legitimate claims.
1992.91-1043,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2769.203,2770.303,May I just ask one other question?
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2780.325,2789.598,"There were other acts that were alleged, but the Ninth Circuit held that petitioners had not shown antitrust injury as to those, and they didn't seek certiorari as to that determination."
1992.91-1043,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2791.216,2800.488,"Of course, it would seem to me most cases in the real world of antitrust litigation... usually the sham litigation charge is 1 of about 19 things you charge the defendants with."
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2824.104,2824.738,I agree with Your Honor.
1992.91-1043,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2824.738,2825.504,"But that's what this one is, isn't it?"
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2825.504,2850.338,"That's what this one is, although I should say even in the cases where there's other conduct, I think there's a danger in inferring bad intent... what Noerr makes bad intent from anticompetitive... alleged anticompetitive activity because the anticompetitive intent that supports the other allegations could be perfectly valid intent if the lawsuit... in the prosecution of a lawsuit."
1992.91-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2994.548,3002.117,"In a word or two, can you tell me what the Government's position is and how it differs from yours?"
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3002.117,3002.684,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1992.91-1043,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3034.306,3037.124,Would you characterize it as a discovery rule?
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3037.124,3039.909,"--Well, I think they haven't proposed any special discovery rule."
1992.91-1043,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3044.194,3047.146,"I mean, is that the way it works out?"
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3047.146,3047.996,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1992.91-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3149.555,3153.923,--subjective inquiry in very many cases.
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3153.923,3158.458,"Well, you will in the cases where the objective standard isn't met, but we think that's--"
1992.91-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3158.458,3167.147,"Well, you don't think... you think there are really very few... going to be very few baseless cases."
1992.91-1043,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3167.147,3169.063,"--Well, Your Honor, it's interesting."
1992.91-1043,2,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,3254.184,3255.686,Thank you.
1992.91-1043,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3291.471,3295.839,Would rule 11 be applied to a victor in the case?
1992.91-1043,2,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,3295.839,3296.773,--I'm sorry?
1992.91-1043,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3296.773,3299.875,Would rule 11 be applied to a prevailing party in the case?
1992.91-1043,2,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,3299.875,3300.827,"No, I don't believe it would, Justice Scalia."
1992.91-1043,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3300.827,3303.695,But you're arguing for a rule that applies even to the prevailing party.
1992.91-1043,2,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,3303.695,3303.945,No.
1992.91-1043,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3307.813,3316.502,"Whatever reason it is, I mean, you're dealing with a totally different situation when you say that even if you totally win, you can be liable under your theory."
1992.91-1043,2,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,3320.637,3320.887,Rule--
1992.91-1043,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3320.887,3323.989,"So, there is an objective component to rule 11."
1992.91-1043,2,37802,patrick_j_coyne,,3324.608,3327.241,"--Yes, there is, and rule 11 would not be applied in that setting."
1992.91-1043,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3388.508,3389.774,"Thank you, Mr. Coyne."
