1984.83-1266,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.465,We'll hear arguments next in United States against Boyle.
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,84.036,91.87,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1266,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,174.454,183.72,"Well, would it be any different in your view if it was for a personal return and he was involved in filing the return, a delinquent return as an individual?"
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,183.72,184.1,"No, it would not, Your Honor."
1984.83-1266,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,394.93,403.455,"Are you able to tell us, Mr. Lauber, if you know whether... what is the policy of IRS?"
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,409.089,423.918,"Well, we... the IRS tries to be reasonable, but I don't think they would be inclined to be particularly clement in a case like this, and I will try and explain why it would be--"
1984.83-1266,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,423.918,426.76,"Well, I don't mean as to this case."
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,436.895,439.857,"--I really don't know the answer to that, to that question."
1984.83-1266,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,558.866,574.978,"Well, somewhere in the archives of IRS, in the law department, there must he a sort of code, guidelines as to when this dispensation should be granted?"
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,574.978,577.048,"--Well, the regulations set out--"
1984.83-1266,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,577.048,579.67,I mean apart from the regulations.
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,579.67,580.301,--And the prior--
1984.83-1266,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,580.301,584.932,There must be some explanatory material about the regulations themselves.
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,584.932,598.071,"--Well, the only thing I know of is the Internal Revenue manual lists eight examples of cases where the penalty will not be assessed, and they are listed in a footnote in our brief."
1984.83-1266,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,642.07,652.507,But the Court of Appeals thought that the taxpayer should be able to rely on the doctrine of advice of counsel since it really was the lawyer's failings that prevented the thing from being filed on time.
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,652.507,660.944,"Well, that's right, Justice Rehnquist, and that would bring me to defining of proper scope of the reliance on counsel defense which I was going to get to shortly."
1984.83-1266,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,660.944,679.554,"Well, just before that, and along the same line, if the lawyer misled or negligently advised the executor and the executor was penalized for it, couldn't the executor get that money back from the lawyer--"
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,679.554,681.306,"He certainly could, Justice Marshall."
1984.83-1266,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,681.306,682.047,--in any court in the world?
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,682.047,682.816,I would think so.
1984.83-1266,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,686.299,687.799,May I ask this before you move on?
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,698.317,700.999,"--Well, that's hard to say, Justice Powell, because--"
1984.83-1266,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,700.999,703.32,"Don't they use the same words, essentially?"
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,703.32,716.189,"--They use the same words, but they really did not apply an objective test because... they quoted the regulations and they trotted them out, but when they performed their analysis, they didn't use an objective test."
1984.83-1266,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,721.272,729.717,"Are you advocating the rule of CA-5 and a couple of other circuits, that the duty is nondelegable in all circumstances?"
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,729.717,731.219,--That is our position.
1984.83-1266,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,731.219,731.82,You are?
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,731.82,732.679,Yes.
1984.83-1266,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,732.679,734.391,That's not what the regulation says.
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,734.391,738.553,The regulations about reasonable cause you mean.
1984.83-1266,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,738.553,739.304,Yes.
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,739.304,746.898,The regulations about reasonable cause say that the executor must exercise ordinary business care and prudence.
1984.83-1266,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,746.898,747.219,Yes.
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,747.219,763.92,"And our position is that ordinary business care and prudence per se require the executor, A, to find out the due date, and B, to make sure his agent, if he has an agent, is prompt in performing his agency activity."
1984.83-1266,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,770.034,789.657,"With respect to a filing date, perhaps you are right, but there are so many complications in preparing some tax returns, you are not arguing, I suppose, that a layman, for example, has to assume nondelegable obligations with respect to things of which he knows no--"
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,789.657,790.548,"Oh, exactly right."
1984.83-1266,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,793.761,802.025,--Do you think there is any analogy between filing dates of this kind and filing dates for petition for writ of certiorari in this Court?
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,802.025,808.32,"It simply is jurisdictional, period."
1984.83-1266,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,960.648,965.66,"But you don't go any farther than the filing date and the fact of filing, do you, for a per se rule?"
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,965.66,966.371,--No.
1984.83-1266,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,969.904,976.81,As far as the accuracy of the return or the intent or the legal problems involved in it?
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,976.81,977.809,"--No, we would not go that far in our position."
1984.83-1266,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,982.814,983.433,Right.
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,983.433,984.064,As to--
1984.83-1266,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,984.064,1002.907,"Mr. Lauber, would you apply that strict per se approach to someone such as a mentally retarded person who inherits property and has to file a return and relies on someone like a lawyer to help him?"
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1009.061,1010.821,"--Well, hard cases make bad law."
1984.83-1266,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1010.821,1011.472,Yes.
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1011.472,1013.696,"But I think I would have to say yes, we would stick to our standard there."
1984.83-1266,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1023.981,1028.886,"Well, you've added something, a fiduciary appointed, and that was not part of my inquiry."
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1036.128,1041.792,"Well, they generally don't because the penalty is one quarter, maximum, one quarter of the tax due."
1984.83-1266,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1048.157,1069.432,"Even though the executor or trustee may be not as affluent as his... the beneficiaries of the trust or of the estate, nevertheless, the penalty is deliberately aimed by Congress to fit the size of the problem, isn't it?"
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1069.432,1075.235,It is 5 percent per month for every month up to 25 percent that the return is late.
1984.83-1266,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1175.931,1182.396,How about an approach like that suggested by Judge Posner in his dissent?
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1182.396,1184.466,I think that's exactly what we would advocate.
1984.83-1266,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1185.247,1187.027,"Well, it isn't... I think it's not quite as--"
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1187.027,1187.778,--Simple.
1984.83-1266,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1187.778,1193.822,"--black and white and arbitrary as you've described yours, as I read it, anyway."
1984.83-1266,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1193.822,1196.503,"Well, he did have that final sentence that let us--"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1578.292,1582.065,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1266,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1597.906,1600.738,"Well, do you have any difficulty understanding the statute?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1600.738,1615.969,"--Yes, sir, I have a great deal of difficulty understanding the statute, and I think as Judge Posner pointed out, the... it sets up two conditions which I believe are almost the opposite of one another."
1984.83-1266,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1632.497,1645.627,"Does either the... Mr. Boyle or your firm claim that they locked at the statute and didn't understand it, and that that's accounted for the delay?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1645.627,1649.368,No... for the delay in filing the return?
1984.83-1266,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1679.989,1691.116,"Do you think the case is any different if the executor, Boyle himself is the lawyer, was handling his own affairs and made the same mistake?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1691.116,1694.739,"Yes, I think it would be a big difference in that case."
1984.83-1266,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1696.121,1697.08,In what respect?
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1697.08,1707.058,"--I think you're looking at a situation where you have the average layman, he comes in, he hires an expert, a person he is relying on and trusting."
1984.83-1266,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1707.058,1714.981,"Well, doesn't counsel and Mr. Boyle merge into one entity so far as this is concerned?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1714.981,1735.577,"I don't think so, Your Honor, because I don't think that's what the statute directs its attention, and the cases heretofore have always said the standard involved is one placed on the taxpayer, and I think we are getting a little bit off the boat, so to speak, by focusing our attention on the attorney."
1984.83-1266,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1744.342,1744.991,Who?
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1745.942,1747.184,The attorney or the accountant?
1984.83-1266,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1748.063,1749.685,Don't you think the malpractice cases take care of that?
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1749.685,1750.894,--They should.
1984.83-1266,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1752.557,1757.089,I don't see how you say that we put the weight on the lawyer.
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1760.672,1763.664,"Well, I don't either, Your Honor."
1984.83-1266,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1763.664,1766.445,"Well, then, I don't understand your argument."
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1766.445,1767.457,Well--
1984.83-1266,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1767.457,1774.549,The man... what is the difference between that and filing the certiorari petition on time in this Court?
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1774.549,1776.132,--Well--
1984.83-1266,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1776.132,1778.253,What happens if you don't do it?
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1778.253,1782.245,--You're... I think it's jurisdictional.
1984.83-1266,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1783.525,1784.927,"Yes, but what happens to the lawyer?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1791.542,1792.441,I think he's at fault.
1984.83-1266,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1795.125,1797.095,"Well, isn't that the same case here?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1803.841,1806.071,"--Under the existing law, that's correct."
1984.83-1266,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1806.071,1806.982,Under any law.
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1806.982,1808.832,That is correct--
1984.83-1266,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1808.832,1811.163,So they have been done in.
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1815.648,1823.733,"--Well, in this particular case, and I would hope in most cases, the lawyer would admit his mistake, as we did, and paid it."
1984.83-1266,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1823.733,1825.393,The lawyer paid it?
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1825.393,1826.554,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1266,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1826.554,1830.708,"Well, what, what... what are we doing with the case?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1830.708,1833.359,"Well, I think the question is, in looking--"
1984.83-1266,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1833.359,1834.951,What are we doing with the case?
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1834.951,1837.623,"--Well, when the case started out--"
1984.83-1266,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1837.623,1839.173,Are you trying to get your money back?
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1839.173,1842.085,"--Well, that would happen is--"
1984.83-1266,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1842.085,1843.587,"That would help, wouldn't it?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1843.587,1857.015,"--If the Seventh Circuit was affirmed, but I would respectfully point it out... point out when this case started that if we had been in perhaps any other circuit, there probably would not have been a case."
1984.83-1266,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1938.438,1940.499,Speaking for your own firm--
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1940.499,1941.4,"--Yes, sir."
1984.83-1266,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1941.4,1947.234,"--If we affirm this judgment, can we assume that you'll never make that mistake again?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1947.234,1949.064,"I certainly hope so, sir."
1984.83-1266,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1949.064,1952.036,"Well, is there any other way we can do it?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1952.036,1952.627,Pardon?
1984.83-1266,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1952.627,1955.91,Is there any other way we can do it other than affirming?
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1955.91,1964.867,"Well, I believe not, not if the government's position is accepted."
1984.83-1266,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1964.867,1980.857,"Well, there's nothing in this record to bear on something that you suggested, and I feel bound to ask you, are you representing to the Court that your firm has reimbursed Mr. Boyle, that you have paid the penalty?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1980.857,1982.069,The question was asked.
1984.83-1266,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1983.328,1986.911,"Well, then, is there possible mootness to this case?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,1989.262,1994.666,I guess you could technically say that.
1984.83-1266,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2003.003,2004.866,"Well, what if, what if you win this case?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2006.025,2007.827,"--Yes, we would."
1984.83-1266,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2007.827,2010.059,So the case isn't moot then.
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2012.82,2028.471,"Yes, sir, I believe there is, and I believe there's also the overall question that... of the per se rule, which I believe, and it is probably my understanding is why this case was granted by this Court."
1984.83-1266,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2028.471,2030.632,"Well, I know, but it still has... there still has to be a case with controversy."
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2030.632,2031.944,Yes.
1984.83-1266,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2031.944,2036.205,Between your client and the government.
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2036.205,2037.437,Yes.
1984.83-1266,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2041.0,2050.635,"In other words, you are saying, conceding that your private arrangements with your client are irrelevant to the issues of this case."
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2050.635,2051.897,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1266,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2180.399,2186.793,"Well, it is a two-part test that is phrased in the conjunction, I guess, because they use the word and."
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2201.603,2202.895,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1266,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2202.895,2206.478,"Well, then, I think that argument cuts in favor of the government, not you."
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2209.18,2225.62,"Well, I'm saying the additional words seem to me, because what they say is reasonable cause as an ordinary man standard, or shall we say, negligence, which normally does not connotate a willful action."
1984.83-1266,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2238.718,2247.724,"You say that perhaps reasonable cause should be read as mere negligence, or not due to mere--"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2247.724,2250.627,I think more than mere negligence.
1984.83-1266,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2265.745,2276.853,"--Well, what if a judge were to find in this case that the preparer's actions were negligent but they were not due to willful neglect?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2280.494,2281.375,Yes.
1984.83-1266,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2290.912,2298.917,But does the absence of willful neglect by itself prove that there was reasonable cause That's a twisting of the language.
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2298.917,2300.379,Not necessarily.
1984.83-1266,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2407.488,2415.494,"But if you are one day late in filing a document in the courts, under court rules or statutes, you are out of court."
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2417.214,2418.986,"That's correct, sir, and I doubt--"
1984.83-1266,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2418.986,2428.571,"Unless there's some... unless it is demonstrable that the United States mails are responsible for it, as often happens."
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2428.571,2429.503,--Right.
1984.83-1266,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2449.325,2457.242,"Well, have you any suggestion how much willful neglect glosses reasonable cause?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2457.242,2471.641,"Well, I think you have to look not only at what they did up to the time that they learned whether the return was late, and then what did they do when they learned of it?"
1984.83-1266,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2479.666,2483.679,That doesn't tell me what you think is the standard then.
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2483.679,2494.835,"I think the standard would be probably, if you are putting it on a scale of negligence, gross negligence."
1984.83-1266,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2499.698,2502.64,"Or reckless disregard, something like that?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2502.64,2505.412,"Yes, I think, yes."
1984.83-1266,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2505.412,2507.695,How would three months figure on this?
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2510.957,2511.775,"Yes, three months and a day."
1984.83-1266,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2511.775,2513.878,Wouldn't that be close to willful?
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2513.878,2519.081,"Well, except for the fact that what the... what was the reason."
1984.83-1266,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2533.079,2536.772,"Well, the executor is the only one covered by the law."
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2536.772,2538.362,--Right.
1984.83-1266,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2538.362,2542.416,The government can't reach anybody but the executor.
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2542.416,2547.97,"That is correct, but I am saying in looking at the--"
1984.83-1266,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2547.97,2550.771,The executor didn't have to get a lawyer.
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2550.771,2552.233,--Right.
1984.83-1266,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2552.233,2553.782,But he did.
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2553.782,2554.974,That is correct.
1984.83-1266,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2554.974,2556.674,And it's whose responsibility?
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2560.848,2562.168,That is correct.
1984.83-1266,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2618.124,2620.157,"Mr. Davies, can I ask you a question?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2640.67,2651.607,"Well, I agree that's probably a problem or a question of fact that has to be determined."
1984.83-1266,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2666.126,2667.568,Congress could settle that.
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2667.568,2669.138,"--Well, I believe they could, but--"
1984.83-1266,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2669.138,2671.309,They could just change the statute a little.
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2676.344,2678.515,--That is correct--
1984.83-1266,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2678.515,2681.367,To agree with the present government's regulation.
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2681.367,2683.109,--I believe it could.
1984.83-1266,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2821.837,2831.975,"What if he gives it to his chauffeur and says take this down and mail it or take it and deliver it by hand, and the chauffeur gets drunk and forgets all about it?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2831.975,2839.769,"Well, I think... I think that's why the statute is written that says reasonable cause."
1984.83-1266,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2839.769,2844.504,"Well, is that reasonable cause in your view?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2846.655,2848.655,Giving it to your chauffeur?
1984.83-1266,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2848.655,2853.12,"An employee, he's agent of the taxpayer."
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2853.12,2858.792,"I would say that as a practical matter, I think that's done."
1984.83-1266,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2861.374,2868.199,"Well, if you were the Internal Revenue, do you think Internal Revenue should impose a penalty then, or should they forget it?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2868.199,2868.66,--Do I?
1984.83-1266,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2877.884,2889.284,"Did you say earlier, Mr. Davies, that the executor actually before the filing date had called to ask whether or not the return had been prepared and filed?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2889.284,2893.017,The executor had called on numerous occasions wondering--
1984.83-1266,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2893.017,2894.086,Before the filing date?
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2894.086,2895.536,"--Yes, sir."
1984.83-1266,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2895.536,2896.688,Wondering what?
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2898.518,2909.756,"Wondering when the return would be due, or thinking, you know, I know we have to file a return because I was told that."
1984.83-1266,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2942.288,2944.388,What do you mean by keep calling?
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2944.388,2952.644,"Well, on several... the record does not say the exact number other than he called on numerous occasions saying--"
1984.83-1266,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2952.644,2956.637,And the subject was always when is the return going to be filed?
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,2956.637,2961.88,--I can't say that it was always that.
1984.83-1266,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3122.016,3134.333,"Well, don't you have to convince us that the Treasury regulation is invalid, under the statute, that it is inconsistent with the statute?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,3134.333,3137.516,"--As an alternative argument, yes."
1984.83-1266,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3137.516,3138.895,"Well, alternative."
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,3142.798,3144.36,Okay.
1984.83-1266,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3144.36,3146.572,And that it means what it says.
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,3146.572,3147.543,Okay.
1984.83-1266,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3147.543,3148.802,Would you lose?
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,3148.802,3151.456,Not necessarily.
1984.83-1266,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3151.456,3152.605,Why not?
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,3152.605,3166.005,"I, what I... okay, what I'm saying is I don't think it's necessarily unreasonable for Mr. Boyle or Mrs. Widow or we could think of a lot of sad cases--"
1984.83-1266,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3166.005,3167.756,So you think he used reasonable care.
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,3167.756,3169.839,"--Yes, I think so."
1984.83-1266,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3170.106,3174.57,"Well, do you agree that it should be judged on an objective basis under the regulations?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,3176.391,3177.853,"--Yes, I do believe it should be."
1984.83-1266,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3177.853,3184.458,"So it would be the objective test, and then you would just... you and the government would just disagree on how it is to be applied in this case."
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,3184.458,3186.728,"That's one way to look at this case, yes, sir."
1984.83-1266,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3186.728,3189.85,"Well, that isn't... wasn't the approach of the Court of Appeals, was it?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,3189.85,3193.262,"Well, I think it was on their holding."
1984.83-1266,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3207.323,3210.555,So you think they applied the objective test.
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,3210.555,3212.044,"Yes, I do."
1984.83-1266,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3221.64,3231.288,"But on one of your arguments, your primary argument, or the argument you made first, would require us to hold the regulation invalid."
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,3231.288,3233.619,Yes.
1984.83-1266,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3233.619,3234.668,"Yes, okay."
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,3234.668,3235.84,On that argument.
1984.83-1266,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3235.84,3240.312,"What amount of... what's the rate of interest on the delinquent payment, not the penalty, the rate of interest."
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,3240.312,3242.505,At this time it was 6 percent.
1984.83-1266,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3246.289,3254.613,"So the government pays about 11 percent to borrow money, and they are only charging, if you're correct, they would only be charging 6 percent."
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,3254.613,3255.381,At this time.
1984.83-1266,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3268.211,3279.008,"Well, didn't... isn't it possible that Congress put this penalty that you regard as so drastic in order to keep the interest at a more moderate rate?"
1984.83-1266,1,42603,thomas_e_davies,,3279.008,3281.081,It's possible.
1984.83-1266,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3347.062,3349.603,"Do you have anything further, counsel?"
1984.83-1266,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3349.603,3350.925,I have two points.
1984.83-1266,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3430.297,3443.296,"Well, do you, assuming that the regulation is valid, as you say, do you think the Court of Appeals did not proceed on an objective basis?"
1984.83-1266,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3443.296,3452.9,"I think they did not because they focused on whether or not this particular executor actually knew himself the due date, and whether or not he had particular experience."
1984.83-1266,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3453.521,3456.813,You don't think they concluded that he acted reasonably?
1984.83-1266,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3456.813,3464.309,"--Well, they thought... they looked whether he acted reasonably given his particular past experience."
1984.83-1266,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3469.723,3470.123,All right.
1984.83-1266,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3476.567,3486.184,I think there's no need for a remand because the Court of Appeals acknowledged that negligence was committed.
1984.83-1266,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3486.184,3493.478,"Well, it requires an assessment of the facts under a reasonable man standard which you say they didn't apply."
1984.83-1266,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3493.478,3510.54,"Well, they acted like they applied it, but because they erroneously employed the reliance on counsel defense, which was not available as a matter of law, if the statute is correctly construed, that was what led them to their incorrect result, and that was a legal error, not a factual error."
1984.83-1266,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3540.829,3542.021,"In other words, a bright line."
1984.83-1266,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3542.021,3543.16,A bright line test.
1984.83-1266,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3589.611,3591.383,"Thank you, gentlemen."
