1968.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,17.897,"Number 21, John F. Tinker and Mary Beth Tinker, minors, etcetera et al., petitioners versus Des Moines Independent Community School District et al."
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,18.892,22.692,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.21,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,56.269,59.126,"Well, this is not a religious establishment case here?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,59.126,60.145,"No, it's not Your Honor."
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,397.848,411.848,What if the student had gotten up in the class he went to and delivered the message orally that his armband was intended to convey and insisted on doing it?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,411.848,412.583,I think in that case --
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,412.583,413.835,All during the hour?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,413.835,414.063,Yes.
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,423.57,427.198,"Why did they wear the armband to the class, to express that message?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,427.198,428.057,"To express the message, yes."
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,428.057,429.41,To everybody in the class?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,429.41,430.419,"To every one in the class, yes Your Honor."
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,430.419,438.262,And everybody while they were listening to some other subject matter was supposed to also be looking at the armband and taking in that message?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,438.262,441.765,"Well, to the extent that they would see it but I don't believe there was any -- I don't believe that the --"
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,441.765,444.106,"Well, it wasn't they who were intended to see it, weren't they?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,444.106,445.508,They were intended to see it in a way they would not be distracting.
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,445.508,447.306,And to understand it?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,447.306,448.075,And to understand it yes Your Honor.
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,448.075,449.36,And to absorb that message?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,449.36,450.352,And to absorb the message.
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,450.352,456.754,"While they're studying arithmetic or mathematics, they are supposed to be picking in this message about Vietnam."
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,456.754,466.062,"Well, except that Your Honor I believe that the method that the students chose in this particular instance was specifically designed in such a way that it would not cause that kind of disruption."
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,469.598,472.183,You mean they're just wearing a meaningless armband?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,472.183,472.518,"No, Your Honor."
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,473.382,476.43,Carrying an ineffective message and they intended it to be ineffective?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,476.43,478.201,"No, they intended it to be effective but at the same --"
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,478.201,481.584,"Well, why didn't they take it off when they went in the class?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,481.584,483.384,"Well, there would be no reason to take it off when walking in a class."
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,483.384,485.599,Because it was ineffective nobody would notice?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,485.599,488.764,It was not disruptive in the class Your Honor.
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,488.764,492.246,"You mean physically, but how about the attention of the students?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,492.246,496.054,"Well, there's no testimony by any of the teachers that there was in any way --"
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,496.054,496.118,Why --
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,496.118,497.379,-- destructive or disruptive.
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,497.379,498.555,Why did they wear it again?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,501.005,502.63,They wore the armband to --
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,502.63,503.472,Convey a message --
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,503.472,504.788,"Convey the message, that's right."
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,504.788,507.886,They anticipated students to see and understand and think about it.
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,507.886,508.487,That's correct.
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,508.487,512.448,"And when they did it in class, they intended the students to do it in class?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,512.448,516.524,I think it's as fair in assumption that the method of expression --
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,516.524,520.481,They intended to -- they intended the students to think about it outside the class but not in class?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,520.481,526.659,"I think they intended, I think they chose the message, chose the method of expression, Your Honor, which would not be distracting -- distracting when they are in the class."
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,526.659,540.753,"Physically, it wouldn't make a noise, it wouldn't cause a commotion but don't you think it would cause some people to direct their attention to the armband and the Vietnam War and think about that rather than what they were thinking about -- supposed to be thinking about in the classroom?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,540.753,550.357,"I think perhaps Your Honor, it might for a few moments have done that and I think it perhaps might have distracted some students just as many other things do in the classroom which are allowed from time to time."
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,550.627,555.784,But which this school is permitted to forbid?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,555.784,558.563,But which the school also allows to continue.
1968.21,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,572.82,577.531,And all that we have that has prevent on wearing the armbands any place in the building?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,577.531,578.837,"That's correct, that's correct."
1968.21,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,578.917,580.519,It's not limited to the classroom.
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,580.519,581.188,That's right.
1968.21,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,588.398,589.548,Any place within the building?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,589.548,590.763,That's correct.
1968.21,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,590.763,598.045,But your contention is that the time of wearing in the classroom too because that's when they were removed from the school?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,598.045,612.339,"Well, our contention is that the policy as it was adopted, that was a broad policy we do not distinguish not in any way was directed toward disruption or distraction is a policy which will not stand the test of freedom of expression under the First Amendment."
1968.21,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,612.339,618.168,Suppose it had been a big button to stop the bombing?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,618.168,622.047,"Well, as a matter of fact a number of political buttons were worn at this school."
1968.21,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,622.047,623.828,"Oh, that is I'm for Humphrey or I'm for Wallace."
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,623.828,626.22,"I'm for Humphrey, I'm for -- well, we didn't have it at that time."
1968.21,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,631.117,634.298,Suppose it was designed to stop the bombing?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,634.298,639.057,"I don't believe that, that to me would not be the sort of thing which would be designed to disrupt the class."
1968.21,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,639.057,643.299,"Suppose it was a placard with the message, across it?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,643.299,651.721,The situation I think and the problem we have is this specific regulation directed only toward one specific kind of conduct.
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,687.31,698.789,"Do you think that a narrow, a narrower regulation it says that you may not wear armbands or buttons or placards in the classroom would be sustainable under the First Amendment?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,698.789,702.16,I believe it would be more easily sustainable or directed --
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,702.16,704.102,"Well, would it be sustainable if --"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,704.102,705.51,"No, I don't believe so Your Honor."
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,706.456,707.882,Do you have to take that position?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,707.882,709.349,I don't have to take that position in this case.
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,709.349,710.886,But you do?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,710.886,714.2,I do in answer to the Court's question because I have to be candid with the Court --
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,714.2,716.735,"So, why don't you have to sustain that position in this case?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,716.735,723.921,"Well, because the armband regulation in this case was directed toward wearing of the armband in any time in the school whether or not --"
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,723.921,725.132,Whether they wore it in class.
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,725.132,726.457,-- disruptive.
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,731.248,736.898,"Well, I know but why shouldn't the question be were they permitted to be suspended for wearing it in the class?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,736.898,748.925,Because that the question I believe I would suggest that's before us is the question of a policy that was adopted whether or not the policy itself will stand a test of freedom of expression under the First Amendment.
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,755.147,759.427,"Now, the action that was brought was what?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,759.427,763.725,"The action that was brought was for an injunction, for injunctive relief and for nominal damages under the --"
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,763.725,767.99,Against the -- against any enforcement of the regulation?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,767.99,773.037,Against any enforcement of the regulation which would infringe upon the student's freedom of expression.
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,773.037,785.936,"Do you think that would -- in your injunction then would forbid them of the injunction you wanted, do you think you ought to have, should forbid the school from keeping armbands out of classrooms?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,785.936,791.256,"Unless they were kept out of there for the express purpose of preventing disruption, unless there was some showing that they would cause disruption."
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,791.256,792.551,"Well, so your answer is yes?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,792.991,793.917,Yes.
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,794.773,798.272,-- and you're trying to sustain that injunction?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,798.272,799.354,I'm trying -- yes.
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,799.354,807.177,So you must be arguing that the school may not keep the armbands out of classrooms?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,807.177,809.195,On the state of this record.
1968.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,809.195,821.733,"I suppose you would concede that if it started fistfights or something of that kind and disrupted the school, that the principal could prevent the use of them."
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,821.733,829.454,"The suggestion, I believe we're making Your Honor is that there should not be any special rule for freedom of expression cases for schools."
1968.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,850.007,853.341,You go to the clear and present danger principle?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,853.341,872.461,"Or as the Fifth Circuit in two cases, Burnside versus Byars seems to indicate and Blackhall versus Isoqueena, Byars case cited in our brief, a material and substantial disruption to the schools would justify perhaps the subordination of freedom of expression."
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,872.461,878.764,Why should the Terminiello type case be applicable in the classroom?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,878.764,900.503,"Well, the facts of the Terminiello case are not necessary applicable to the classroom with the kind of test and the thing, Your Honor, that we've been trying to do with in this case since the trial was is the concept that wholly special rules -- wholly special doctrines for some reason should be applied to the First Amendment law in schools."
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,910.025,910.977,For disruption?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,910.977,914.584,"Well, anything that prevents the state --"
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,914.584,916.368,"Well, you are not talking just about violence?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,916.368,917.361,"No, certainly not."
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,917.786,925.723,But why do you (Inaudible)?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,925.723,929.039,I think that's correct.
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,929.039,942.813,"And so there could certainly be some whispering going on, some reciting of a favorite poem (inaudible) undertone in the classroom?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,942.813,944.387,"There isn't any doubt about that in our mind, Your Honor."
1968.21,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,944.387,951.466,"And even though it wasn't disruptive or bothered anybody else at all, we didn't make anybody mad or anything."
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,954.612,959.001,This might have been impaired the ability of the school to carry out the purposes that it was there for.
1968.21,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,959.001,961.846,"Well, is there any evidence of that in this record?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,961.846,963.883,"Your Honor, there's none."
1968.21,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1017.296,1024.704,"As I understand and I want to be very clear about this, in response to my Brother White's question."
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,1051.065,1052.387,I think we can take that position.
1968.21,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1122.932,1143.391,"Suppose the state passed a law applying a ban on black armbands for protest purposes, across the board, so that it would be applied in the private schools as well, would that be constitutional?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,1143.391,1158.662,I think that would probably Your Honor interfere with some earlier decisions of this Court probably in regard to the right of individuals of citizens to establish private schools and so long as they meet the accreditation standards to educate their children as they see fit.
1968.21,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1191.2,1193.481,Why is this case moot?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,1193.481,1193.803,The case is not moot --
1968.21,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1193.803,1198.051,"Nobody has been punished, have they?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,1222.448,1237.868,"Your Honor the students each testified in the District Court, and this will appear in the record, that although they did return to school because of the obvious dire consequences to themselves if they do not return to school, that they still have these views in the war in Vietnam."
1968.21,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1249.111,1251.118,"That's in the complaint, isn't it?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,1251.938,1253.736,"It's in the appendix Your Honor, that testimony in the record."
1968.21,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1253.736,1255.551,In the complaint?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,1255.551,1256.648,"Yes, it is in the complaint."
1968.21,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1258.894,1260.214,I just glanced at the complaint.
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,1263.598,1271.95,"The -- and in any event because we anticipated the possibility that by the time the case might be finally decided,"
1968.21,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1277.23,1278.278,"Well, you sued for dollar?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,1278.278,1278.915,"That's right, we did Your Honor."
1968.21,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1278.915,1280.465,But --
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,1280.465,1281.301,That's what I was getting to.
1968.21,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1281.301,1288.178,"-- isn't the jurisdictional -- isn't the statute require $10,000.00 to be in controversy?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,1288.178,1296.017,Not Your Honor in a case that goes up under the -- under 42 United States Code 1983 rather than under diversity.
1968.21,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1297.524,1303.706,And your hope is that these children correctly understood some of our opinions on mootness?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,1303.706,1304.922,"Yes, Your Honor it is."
1968.21,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1304.922,1305.445,Test and --
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,1305.445,1308.479,"I've also -- well, yes."
1968.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1308.479,1313.816,What happens if the Vietnam War ends before we decide the case?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,1313.816,1317.918,"Well, Your Honor we all hope for that of course."
1968.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1363.487,1370.847,What if this gets to the Supreme Court of the United States pretty deep in trenches of ordinary day to day school district?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,1370.847,1382.347,"Your Honor, I really would not think it would get you any further in that sort of thing then in Barnette versus Board of Education of West Virginia than did the case that the Court announced this morning."
1968.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1402.99,1408.236,"Suppose we didn't say such things of that kind, the majority of us."
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,1411.367,1412.583,I understand.
1968.21,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1412.685,1418.296,"May I ask you, does it matter what the expression is about?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,1478.389,1478.543,Mr. Justice --
1968.21,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1478.543,1482.377,"-- as we, as the older generation conceives it?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,1482.377,1505.781,"Mr. Justice Fortas, I believe that the real question in that regard hinges upon whether or not the utterance is expression, as contemplated by the First Amendment which was a finding that the District Court made, as a matter of fact that students were engaged and the expression of views privileged by the First Amendment unless it's subordinated by some other state interest."
1968.21,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1505.781,1510.873,"Yes sir, that's the question, what's your opinion if you care to express one?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,1510.873,1530.429,"My opinion would be, in that instance, that probably, again it would depend a lot upon what the students said and demeanor of the student when he expressed the things of that sort that probably would not be within the purview of the First Amendment, but again it's just conjecture on my part."
1968.21,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1545.278,1554.962,"Mr. Johnston, during the negotiation was the suggestion ever been made to limit the rule to not wearing the bands in classroom?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,1554.962,1556.33,"Not to my knowledge, Your Honor."
1968.21,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1556.33,1556.97,It never was?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,1556.97,1557.726,Never was made.
1968.21,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1557.726,1560.861,"The board never offered that as a solution, did they?"
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,1560.861,1561.959,"No, they did not Your Honor."
1968.21,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1569.623,1571.797,Which school was that?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,1571.797,1575.701,"This was the, generally, the public schools in Des Moines."
1968.21,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1576.439,1577.672,What grade?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,1577.672,1583.488,The -- Mr. Eckhardt was in the 10th grade Your Honor at Roosevelt High School.
1968.21,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1593.046,1596.888,Would your principle include to kindergarten?
1968.21,0,21057,dan_l_johnston,,1596.888,1605.753,"To the extent, Your Honor that those people have views and can express them within the purview of the First Amendment it would, yes."
1968.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1628.639,1630.65,Mr. Herrick.
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,1630.65,1636.146,Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices.
1968.21,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1821.708,1826.046,"Mr. Herrick, how many students were involved in the Adderley case?"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,1826.046,1827.028,In the Adderley case?
1968.21,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1827.028,1830.193,Uh-huh.
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,1831.271,1833.98,It was a large quite a large number.
1968.21,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1833.98,1836.453,How many were involved in this one?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,1836.453,1844.539,"Well, there were -- that's a question Your Honor, of what you mean by involved."
1968.21,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1845.38,1847.903,How many were wearing an armband?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,1847.903,1849.914,"Well, there were five suspended --"
1968.21,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1849.914,1850.212,Five?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,1850.212,1851.971,-- for wearing armbands Your Honor.
1968.21,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1851.971,1855.261,"Well, were there any wearing armbands who were not suspended?"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,1855.261,1858.002,"Yes, I think there were two --"
1968.21,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1858.002,1860.886,That make seven?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,1860.886,1863.731,They weren't accepted and I'll refer to that a little later.
1968.21,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1864.485,1874.593,"Seven out of 18,000 and the school board was afraid that seven students wearing an armband would disrupt 18,000."
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,1874.593,1875.244,I think if the Court --
1968.21,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1875.244,1876.346,Am I correct?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,1876.346,1892.432,-- please that that doesn't gives us the entire background that builds up to what was existing in the Des Moines schools at the time the armbands were worn.
1968.21,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1928.147,1930.185,Had there been any disruption?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,1930.185,1932.142,I'll refer to that also Your Honor.
1968.21,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1943.268,1948.956,"Well, how many boys were struck in the Des Moines school system per day normally?"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,1948.956,1962.274,"Well, if the Court please, I think the question there is and gets back to the first issue that I undertook in the states."
1968.21,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1974.329,1977.008,"Well, the school system was aroused?"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,1979.126,1982.395,"I think I can point that out, if the Court please."
1968.21,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2193.452,2200.656,"Mr. Herrick, suppose they decide to wear black neckties, four-in-hand necktie?"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,2200.656,2201.015,Oh!
1968.21,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2209.263,2223.182,"Suppose they used the same build up instead of saying we wear black armbands, it said and in order to mourn the war in Vietnam you wear a mourning black ties?"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,2223.182,2248.879,"I think, Your Honor, if we get all these back to the same problem whether under the circumstance it's difficult to set in this Court or to stand in this Court and say what face the schools out in Des Moines in the enactment of this -- making this decision against the wearing of armbands."
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2261.543,2263.8,"Mr. Herrick, before you get off that --"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,2263.8,2264.254,Yes.
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2264.254,2277.458,Does that -- is that any different from what was going on in practically every community in this country during the last two months during the campaign for the presidency?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,2288.089,2288.37,Oh!
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2292.058,2304.606,Do you think then that what you have read is to be a sufficient backdrop for stopping First Amendment rights in all of these communities because of that?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,2304.606,2319.042,"I think, Your Honor, that the correct answer of that is free discussion in the classroom is always permitted, always has been if they want to come in and discuss these matters."
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2336.218,2344.355,"What did the Court have to say the trial court, as to whether this was an exercise of First Amendment right?"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,2344.355,2347.228,"Well, the Court said this, --"
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2347.228,2348.328,What page?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,2348.328,2354.214,It's on page 75.
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2369.612,2372.188,"Now, didn't they say something before that --"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,2372.188,2372.517,Yes.
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2372.517,2377.454,-- whether this was a First Amendment right or not?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,2377.454,2378.831,"Yes, I think that's --"
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2378.831,2379.545,That's what I was --
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,2379.545,2379.957,-- immediately.
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2379.957,2382.987,-- interested in.
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,2382.987,2385.104,"Here we are, it's on page 72, Your Honor."
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2385.104,2385.932,Seventy-two.
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,2385.932,2387.333,Yes.
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2503.963,2505.204,"Yes, that's what I had in mind."
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,2505.204,2512.308,"Now, in this case, counsel has already referred to the fact."
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2742.121,2756.788,"On that theory, could they proscribe all discussion or demonstration of interest in political matters or political candidates or issues of Government?"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,2756.788,2757.431,Not at all.
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2757.431,2758.068,In the school?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,2758.068,2758.956,Not at all.
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2766.782,2785.379,"Suppose they were a Humphrey or a Nixon or Wallace button in the school which might be is, was in that a community is highly controversial in some places inflammatory."
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,2785.379,2786.364,"Well, --"
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2786.364,2787.927,Could that be done?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,2787.927,2802.157,"I think if the Court please, if it were done as I think the record in this case shows where they come in or the whole row of buttons on something of that sort that it could prove disruptive."
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2803.892,2806.9,Did they come in with a whole row of --
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,2806.9,2807.027,No.
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2807.027,2807.879,-- armbands?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,2807.879,2816.322,"No, but it would be any what -- would there be any question if they walked in of a placard and said, we protest the Vietnam War and that was --"
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2816.322,2818.584,That there would.
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,2818.584,2820.268,That -- under the circumstances --
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2820.268,2825.031,Won't you think it would definitely be different?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,2825.031,2835.154,"Normally yes, and but I think normally but I say this, this thing had been extensively exploited in the press."
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2843.22,2848.509,"Well now, what evidence is there of explosiveness in the community?"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,2850.521,2874.546,"Alright, if the Court please, I refer first, I think here to the John Tinker for just a moment."
1968.21,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2874.546,2876.366,What page?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,2876.366,2886.385,That would be on page 18 of the appendix.
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2904.562,2906.413,Didn't think that he saw it?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,2906.413,2911.486,"Saw the black armband, that's correct, because he sat in the back of a class."
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3020.43,3027.615,Do you want to say that anything happen -- that happened up to this time as you have read would show any --
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3027.615,3029.029,"Well, --"
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3029.029,3033.167,"-- immediate danger of disruption in the school, would you?"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3033.167,3039.922,I don't know and I see I believe it's page 62.
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3039.922,3043.146,How about that will the question I just asked you?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3043.146,3054.575,"Well, that's a pretty close question Your Honor as -- I don't think this, if the Court says there has to be disruption, I don't believe that's the test."
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3054.575,3058.022,Does it shows danger of disruption there.
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3058.022,3059.576,"I feel that it does, Your Honor."
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3059.576,3062.936,"Any more than what would go on ordinarily in the, in the --"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3062.936,3066.745,But I feel the test goes one step further than that.
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3082.452,3082.772,Yes.
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3082.772,3083.04,Without --
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3083.04,3094.384,"I agree to that but the reasonableness of it will have to depend upon what is in this record to support it, isn't that true?"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3094.384,3095.092,Yes of course.
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3095.092,3096.177,"Well, that's what I was asking."
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3096.177,3096.696,Of course it is.
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3096.696,3097.967,Where is this evidence --
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3097.967,3098.787,Well on page --
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3098.787,3100.568,-- to show that the danger of disruption --
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3100.568,3104.916,Sixty-two and this is from the deposition of John Tinker.
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3104.916,3105.914,What page?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3105.914,3110.634,Sixty-two toward the bottom of the page.
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3133.197,3135.516,Is that on 62?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3135.516,3136.204,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3136.204,3136.929,Where -- what part of that?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3136.929,3141.79,"Well, it says portion of the deposition of John Tinker down below there."
1968.21,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3165.972,3181.696,"Mr. Herrick, would I be correct in assuming that if that violence had occurred in any of the three schools in Des Moines, the school officials would've known about it?"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3181.696,3188.567,I wouldn't want to say that that is true because I wouldn't know depending on how it was brought to --
1968.21,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3188.567,3191.842,Would it be normal?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3199.77,3201.678,"That would sound reasonable, Your Honor."
1968.21,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3202.129,3210.681,"Now, what evidence did the school board and the school officials have when they adopted this resolution?"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3213.959,3215.758,"No, I think Your Honor that the --"
1968.21,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3215.758,3224.394,Do we have anything more than your assertion that they used due care and they were reasonable?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3224.394,3235.191,"I think as I've stated before, Your Honor that it was a matter of the explosive situation that existed in the Des Moines schools at the time the regulation was adopted."
1968.21,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3235.191,3243.371,And that explosive situation was that they had to meet in Washington D.C.?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3244.257,3245.34,Alright.
1968.21,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3267.34,3271.969,Do we have a city in this country that hasn't had someone killed in Vietnam?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3271.969,3273.244,"No, I think not Your Honor."
1968.21,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3287.188,3288.919,It could be.
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3288.919,3289.416,What?
1968.21,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3289.416,3291.523,"It could be, is that your position?"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3291.523,3292.553,"Yes, sir."
1968.21,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3292.758,3296.706,And there was no evidence that it would be?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3298.406,3300.721,"No, not at all, Your Honor."
1968.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3352.653,3355.966,Did she claim that was symbolic speech?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3355.966,3359.949,"Well, I can't answer that Your Honor."
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3362.179,3369.329,"Well, at least the court -- trial court didn't find that it was expression of free -- of a --"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3369.329,3369.716,No.
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3369.716,3372.94,-- First Amendment rights as did the Court in this case.
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3372.94,3378.619,"What was involved though, I think Your Honor, is that it was disruptive of the atmosphere of the schoolroom and it's --"
1968.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3378.619,3386.636,"I'd like to ask you a question because you seem to have admitted something -- well, that bothers me."
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3407.495,3409.745,"No, I don't believe I admitted that Your Honor."
1968.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3413.259,3415.418,I didn't think you intended to.
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3415.418,3415.81,"If I did, I could --"
1968.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3415.81,3428.374,"Now, does the person have any more right to have, say, make symbolic speech and he does actually to talk and engage in speech which the First Amendment protects?"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3435.819,3436.009,Oh!
1968.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3442.482,3452.509,"And what you claim is that you have the right to run your school for the teaching of geometry, history, mathematics --"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3452.509,3452.862,Yes.
1968.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3452.862,3466.381,-- grammar and the things that people want to teach and that the Federal Constitution doesn't step in and tell you that you got to let anybody discuss any subject symbolic or otherwise if they see fit.
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3466.381,3471.242,I think so long as it doesn't interrupt or disrupt the atmosphere in the school.
1968.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3471.242,3475.063,"Well, he did disrupt it wouldn't he if he broke a valid rule?"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3475.063,3475.859,Yes.
1968.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3475.859,3482.417,"Well, what you are arguing then is whether or not this rule is valid or it's constitutionally protected?"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3482.417,3483.281,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1968.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3483.281,3505.729,"And do you think that the Constitution prevents the schools in barring the discussion of particularly acute emotional subjects such as this is and lets them, allows them to say that we will have nothing in here except the teaching of the things that the schools bar?"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3505.729,3509.75,I think within the reason that's true.
1968.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3509.75,3523.35,"But you wouldn't say, would you, Mr. Herrick, that in doing that they could pick out one particular issue, public issue and say this, this you cannot do but the rest you can do."
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3523.35,3524.784,I'd go further than that Your Honor.
1968.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3553.211,3557.18,"Well, do you -- I don't understand you to be saying now."
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3560.056,3560.452,"No, sir."
1968.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3560.452,3569.607,"-- your history classes, your mathematic classes and any other classes that the school is supposed to teach in order to talk about Vietnam?"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3569.607,3572.362,"No, I think that that is not correct."
1968.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3572.791,3575.65,"You don't think that, do you?"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3575.65,3576.938,"No, I don't believe that."
1968.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3596.688,3600.967,"But there wasn't any disruption here, was there?"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3600.967,3602.373,"Well, that's a question."
1968.21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3602.373,3609.669,"Well, on page 29, it says the whole period of mathematics on Wednesday was taken up by this discussion of students and demonstrations."
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3609.669,3611.557,That's correct Your Honor.
1968.21,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3624.527,3645.894,"Mr. Herrick, I seem to be remembering reading the briefs and that's where this argument that there was something here about other students wearing other badges or symbols but now glancing them over I can't find it except in footnote 2 of petitioner's brief with respect to some of the students having been seen wearing iron crosses."
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3645.894,3646.417,I think that's true.
1968.21,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3646.417,3647.824,Is there anything else?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3647.824,3649.0,I think there was a --
1968.21,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3649.0,3650.578,In the record?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3650.578,3654.871,"-- iron crosses, I think some times they've worn political buttons --"
1968.21,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3654.871,3657.025,Does that show in the record that you remember?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3657.025,3657.939,It does Your Honor.
1968.21,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3657.939,3658.819,It does.
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3658.819,3659.455,Yes.
1968.21,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3659.455,3665.078,What do you do with Meyer against Nebraska and Bartels against Iowa?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3665.078,3669.339,"Well, of course, Meyer against Nebraska is forbidding and teaching the German language, as I recall it, yes."
1968.21,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3669.339,3671.924,"Yes, so is Bartels in substance."
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3671.924,3673.924,"Well, I --"
1968.21,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3673.924,3676.255,Those were decided in 1923.
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3676.255,3677.722,Surely.
1968.21,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3693.726,3717.315,"But is that the test you'd really say, that is a court makes a judgment as to whether it's so unreasonable, and if it so -- if we think it's so unreasonable, by which I suppose you mean excessively unreasonable then we say to violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment then we tell the school board what it can and cannot do."
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3717.315,3717.871,I think we're getting very --
1968.21,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3717.871,3721.218,"Is that your argument, I'm asking for your opinion?"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3721.218,3729.927,"My opinion is that if the Court undertakes to go that far, you're getting in to very difficult field of trying to say in every instance --"
1968.21,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3729.927,3731.113,"Well, I agree with you."
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3731.113,3739.536,-- whether a regulation is or is not a violation of the constitutional rights and I think some things have got to be left to the judgment of the administrators.
1968.21,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3739.536,3779.699,"You would have to agree with me then, wouldn't you that Meyer and Bartels present very serious obstacles because certainly those cases stand for the proposition that denial of -- that a state criminal laws, state law making it a criminal offense not to teach German is unreasonable and that although that's the state law and state exercise of power over state schools, this Court declared that law's unconstitutional in 1923."
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3779.699,3781.397,That's correct.
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3792.182,3793.893,"This was a public school, wasn't it?"
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3793.893,3794.501,"It is, Your Honor."
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3794.501,3798.232,Did Meyer have something reservation about public school?
1968.21,1,16255,allan_a_herrick,,3800.183,3803.253,That's correct Your Honor.
1968.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3803.253,3808.353,"Mr. Johnston, you have a few moments to rebut."
1968.21,2,21057,dan_l_johnston,,3808.353,3809.73,Thank you Your Honor.
1968.21,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3824.225,3833.869,"Well, do you deny that under the law of Iowa the school was acting within the authority of the state law?"
1968.21,2,21057,dan_l_johnston,,3833.869,3837.7,"The school was acting, Your Honor, under a very broad state statute which gives --"
1968.21,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3837.7,3840.975,"Well, is there any question about that, do we have to look into that?"
1968.21,2,21057,dan_l_johnston,,3840.975,3842.073,"No, Your Honor."
1968.21,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3842.369,3845.271,We have to accept that as being a law of Iowa?
1968.21,2,21057,dan_l_johnston,,3845.271,3845.735,"Yes, I think that's true."
1968.21,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3845.735,3849.382,They were engaged in doing what the law gives them the right to do.
1968.21,2,21057,dan_l_johnston,,3849.382,3851.319,"It gives them the power to do, yes Your Honor."
1968.21,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3895.88,3902.212,But if that's a valid rule it was an explosive situation and a disruption was it not?
1968.21,2,21057,dan_l_johnston,,3905.553,3908.247,"Yes, Your Honor it is but our point is that the rule is not valid."
1968.21,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3908.247,3909.04,That's right.
1968.21,2,21057,dan_l_johnston,,3909.04,3909.748,Because it's based --
1968.21,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3909.748,3911.421,It gets back to that issue?
1968.21,2,21057,dan_l_johnston,,3911.421,3917.17,-- and because it's based solely upon a Fourteenth Amendment alone type stand of reasonableness.
1968.21,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3917.732,3926.14,But I must say I agree to some of the implication of my Brother Fortas about that reasonableness rule.
1968.21,2,21057,dan_l_johnston,,3937.155,3943.798,"Well, for instance in the case of -- in the Barnette case which we've cited in the brief which was the case of the compulsory flag salute."
1968.21,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3993.388,4007.799,"Well, is it your view that your State of Iowa is without power if it sees fit, to bar political discussions in the school hours where children are being taught?"
1968.21,2,21057,dan_l_johnston,,4007.799,4009.556,It would not -- it has that power.
1968.21,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4021.477,4022.085,Yes.
1968.21,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4022.085,4024.571,You have almost an equal protection argument now.
1968.21,2,21057,dan_l_johnston,,4024.571,4025.314,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1968.21,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4025.314,4028.717,You have something close to an equal protection argument?
1968.21,2,21057,dan_l_johnston,,4028.717,4038.997,"In addition to the other argument that I want to make and that is -- and I believe the stronger argument is not the equal protection argument, not the censorship by discrimination argument Mr. Justice Black has called it."
1968.21,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4055.722,4069.876,"Well, now you have the real interest that the state is trying to protect is the right of the state authorities and the teachers to run the schools and establish the rules for teaching rather than the pupils."
1968.21,2,21057,dan_l_johnston,,4072.401,4074.36,"Your Honor, I don't read that from the record."
1968.21,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4077.215,4086.625,"Which do you think has the most right about control in the school, the pupils and their policies and teaching, the pupils or the authorities that are running the school?"
1968.21,2,21057,dan_l_johnston,,4086.625,4094.687,The authorities that are running the schools under the authority given by them by the Constitution of the United States and within the provisions of that Constitution.
