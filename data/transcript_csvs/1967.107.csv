1967.107,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,9.364,"Number 107, United States, Appellant, versus Arnold Habig, et al."
1967.107,0,28425,harris_weinstein,,10.789,14.888,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.107,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,222.782,230.131,Are there a lot of cases that present this pinpoint question?
1967.107,0,28425,harris_weinstein,,230.131,232.951,"In terms of when the statute begins to run, Mr. Justice Fortas?"
1967.107,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,232.951,234.563,Yes.
1967.107,0,28425,harris_weinstein,,234.563,251.413,"Under the tax code sections, I'm aware of a handful and I'm only aware of three in addition to this case that we think are pertinent -- I beg your pardon, four."
1967.107,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,262.016,269.112,I know that but I meant that there are a lot of pending indictments which raised this question.
1967.107,0,28425,harris_weinstein,,269.112,290.776,"Our information of the importance of this as I recall is that there, I believe, we're told that approximately a dozen cases a year arise where the return was filed during extended period of time and the indictment is brought and after the sixth anniversary of the statutory due date."
1967.107,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,290.776,308.377,Because you would assume that the United States would somehow rather be able to spur the fact curiously and not so as to eliminate this question of six years in which to bring these actions.
1967.107,0,28425,harris_weinstein,,308.377,313.913,"Well, of course, the prosecution could be brought within five years and nine months."
1967.107,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,313.913,314.225,Right here?
1967.107,0,28425,harris_weinstein,,314.225,319.069,"If that were the statute, I imagine, many more of them would be brought within five years and nine months."
1967.107,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,368.043,382.355,"Well, no I'm not raising that obviously since the promoting the fact, the operation of the democratic principle would never do anything until the last possible moment and that it has created this problem."
1967.107,0,28425,harris_weinstein,,382.355,385.852,I won't speak in defense of that principle.
1967.107,1,34940,lester_m_ponder,,1743.762,1748.68,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.107,2,28425,harris_weinstein,,3399.13,3405.999,"Yes, if I may briefly make two points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1967.107,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3498.298,3504.944,Could you just say once again what do you think the point of the last sentence is in 6513?
1967.107,2,28425,harris_weinstein,,3504.944,3505.842,Solely --
1967.107,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3505.842,3507.334,And you're reading the statute?
1967.107,2,28425,harris_weinstein,,3507.334,3527.043,Solely to define the phrase “the last day prescribed” that appears in each of the first two sentences and to eliminate two of the four possible meanings from that phrase which in turn defines what is meant by “early return” or advanced payment.
1967.107,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3536.513,3538.266,Very well.
