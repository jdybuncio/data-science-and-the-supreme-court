2003.02-857,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.795,"We'll hear argument now in No. 02-857, Household Credit Services v. Sharon R. Pfennig."
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,10.486,12.715,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-857,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,38.516,48.009,Would you enlighten us on just how this transaction gets authorized in the ordinary course of events and in this event?
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,61.838,95.192,"Well, as the Solicitor General has explained in his brief for the Federal Reserve Board, ordinarily the arrangement between banks... that is, the banks that issue the cards and the banks that do the corresponding relationship with the merchants... have an agreement between the merchants and the banks where the merchant will be liable for fraudulent use of the card or the other unless it obtains authorization to process the charge."
2003.02-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,228.158,248.508,"But, Mr. Waxman, is it not true that there are many occasions on which the credit limit will, in fact, be exceeded and there will, nevertheless, come back an approval, and that the customer in those cases may or may not know that his... that, A, his limit was exceeded, and B, that he's going to be charged for it?"
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,248.508,267.827,"Well, the creditor... the consumer may or may not know that his or her credit limit was exceeded, but of course, that information is entirely within the knowledge of the... the potential knowledge of the consumer because the consumer does know what or... what charges he or she has made and what payments he or she has made."
2003.02-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,267.827,268.365,"Well, not necessarily."
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,284.917,285.289,"Well, the--"
2003.02-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,285.289,297.632,"And... and I'm just asking you, is it not true that it is possible that he will receive an affirmative answer to using the card without knowing whether or not he exceeded the limit and therefore is going to be... be charged for it?"
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,297.632,309.975,--It's possible either because he doesn't keep good track or he doesn't... he's not accurate or he's allowed a child or a spouse to use the card and isn't keeping track or control of that.
2003.02-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,324.836,325.579,"Well, but I'm not sure that's right."
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,341.016,342.009,--The merchant--
2003.02-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,342.009,342.669,Isn't that true?
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,342.669,343.989,--The merchant won't know.
2003.02-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,345.929,346.301,No.
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,346.301,348.159,And the credit card issuer may not know.
2003.02-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,348.159,348.781,But he may know.
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,348.781,349.274,But you're positing--
2003.02-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,349.274,349.811,That's my point.
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,349.811,350.267,--Yes.
2003.02-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,350.267,354.475,The credit company may know and he will not pass that information on to the consumer.
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,354.475,358.828,There is a credit... there is an agreement that must be accepted--
2003.02-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,358.828,359.759,"Well, am I correct on my facts?"
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,359.759,361.245,--You're--
2003.02-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,361.245,362.277,Is it not possible?
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,362.277,369.707,--You are correct that it is possible that the consumer won't realize it and the issuer may know.
2003.02-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,379.821,380.193,Correct.
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,380.193,381.186,"But, Justice Stevens--"
2003.02-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,381.186,385.023,And so the consumer may end up paying a charge that he didn't realize he'd incurred.
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,385.023,386.137,"--Well, the--"
2003.02-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,386.137,387.419,Is that correct or not?
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,387.419,389.481,--That is only partially correct.
2003.02-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,399.595,400.915,If he has... if he knows two things.
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,405.168,405.911,--I--
2003.02-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,405.911,415.504,"But if he doesn't have either of those in mind, it could occur... it could occur that he would run an overcharge and be charged $15 or $20 or whatever it is without realizing he's incurred the charge."
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,415.504,418.626,--It is true with the following caveats.
2003.02-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,421.021,424.858,It seems to me you're unwilling to give me a categorical yes answer when the answer is yes.
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,424.858,426.798,"--And I can't, and here's why, Justice Stevens."
2003.02-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,453.426,456.52,"Well, you've given me lots of examples where the charge would not be incurred."
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,469.812,473.777,--I think that must... there must be instances in which that is true.
2003.02-857,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,496.439,503.414,"Well, now, Mr. Waxman, exactly what happens when a point-of-sale transaction is authorized?"
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,506.032,508.45,"The merchant has a safe harbor, Your Honor."
2003.02-857,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,529.049,530.452,"Mr. Waxman, is... I'm sorry."
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,530.452,530.907,--No.
2003.02-857,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,530.907,554.973,"Is the... is the event of exceeding the... the limit defined in these agreements characteristically as an event that can occur at any time during the billing period, or is it an event that is defined as... as occurring only at the end of the billing period when all the credits and... and all the debits are... are accounted for?"
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,554.973,574.663,"My understanding, Justice Souter, is it varies depending on issuer and card, but that is, some... some cards will... all... all... well, there are some credit cards and charge cards that don't have limits, but when they have a limit, the limit is required to be explicated in the initial disclosures."
2003.02-857,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,593.239,597.614,"Mr. Waxman, will you explain what the consequence is?"
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,618.502,623.515,"Well, I don't... I will explain what difference it makes."
2003.02-857,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,655.2,659.741,Are you talking about solicitation for a purchase of a credit card or for purchase of merchandise?
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,659.741,661.31,--For a purchase of a credit card.
2003.02-857,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,738.958,740.278,That's the only thing it could occur to.
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,740.278,740.75,--Yes.
2003.02-857,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,740.75,741.187,Yes.
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,741.187,745.441,Because you don't know whether there will be late charges or over-limit charges.
2003.02-857,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,745.441,750.104,Is... is it a consequence of... of the other position that they would somehow have to try to do the impossible?
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,750.104,758.194,"Not at those two stages, but at the third stage, that is, the periodic statement, when you get your bill every month, there is a difference there."
2003.02-857,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,802.033,812.807,"Are there any other... other instances in the act where the APR, calculated retroactively on the monthly statement, is higher than what was the APR that was disclosed?"
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,812.807,819.412,"Yes, there... yes, there are, Justice Stevens, because there are certain types of charges that may or may not occur."
2003.02-857,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,837.988,841.331,"So... so then the respondent's theory could... and that's consistent with the act, I take it."
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,855.782,856.358,--Well--
2003.02-857,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,856.358,864.837,"But if you can and... and do have an adjustment of the APR that's permitted under the act, on the disclosure statement, then her theory at least can work."
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,864.837,869.007,"--Well, her... I'm not saying that her theory or the Sixth Circuit's rule couldn't work."
2003.02-857,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,956.502,976.897,"Mr. Waxman, I don't think you finished the answer to the question I asked, and what I wanted to know is if it's labeled a finance charge, then there won't be interest on it; whereas, if it's treated as a debit like any purchase, then the interest would run on it in the future."
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,981.521,998.695,"Well, yes, in the month in which it has occurred because, with respect to the next month, whatever finance charge was applied and... and continues as a balance will also have applied to it the finance charge, that is, the interest rate that would apply."
2003.02-857,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1014.52,1016.528,So it could be... it could be--
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1028.583,1048.478,"These cards typically have a grace period in which you can pay off your balance and you don't have to pay any finance charge, but if you don't, whatever charges are carried forward, whether they derive from purchases or over-limit charges or late fee charges or... or finance charges in the previous month, something is charged against it."
2003.02-857,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1050.253,1051.822,"Very well, Mr. Waxman."
2003.02-857,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1053.885,1061.194,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-857,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1165.84,1166.333,Ms. McDowell?
2003.02-857,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1166.333,1166.788,--Yes.
2003.02-857,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1166.788,1189.329,"Would you... as I understand the respondent's brief, it asks us to draw a line between the over-the-limit fees that are imposed for acts of default and those that are imposed for extension of the credit limit and says that Regulation Z draws such a distinction."
2003.02-857,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1191.475,1194.009,"That argument is incorrect, Your Honor."
2003.02-857,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1261.404,1268.257,Was this an account that carried a finance charge?
2003.02-857,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1275.688,1279.487,That's... the particular account at issue in this case was a credit card.
2003.02-857,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1279.487,1284.067,"Which did have a finance charge, or you don't know?"
2003.02-857,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1284.067,1296.038,"Yes, it does impose a periodic charge if charges that are run up during a particular month are not paid within the grace period."
2003.02-857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1296.038,1301.9,"If I understand the other side, they make kind of a plain language argument."
2003.02-857,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1325.927,1335.352,"We don't disagree with you, Justice Stevens, that it is, at some general level, a charge imposed incident to the extension of credit."
2003.02-857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1337.648,1337.937,"In... in exchange for the higher credit limit, yes."
2003.02-857,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1337.937,1343.032,"The... but... but the term, incident to the extension of credit, is an ambiguous one."
2003.02-857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1374.224,1376.675,"And then the... but wouldn't the customer say, well, I didn't violate anything?"
2003.02-857,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1379.918,1388.092,"--In the first place, there was no communication in this case, and there typically is no communication when we're speaking only of the authorization process."
2003.02-857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1388.092,1389.578,But what if there were... what if there had been a communication?
2003.02-857,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1420.208,1436.389,"It would look more like an extension of credit, I... I might grant you, but the board is still entitled to draft categorical rules by virtue of its authority under section 1604(a) to make classification adjustments and exceptions."
2003.02-857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1436.389,1440.476,"There's no duty on the... on the part of the bank to say, of course, if we okay it, you have to pay an extra 15 bucks."
2003.02-857,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1440.476,1449.93,"Well, Your Honor, you're raising a policy question that Congress or the board could address whether additional disclosures are required at the point of purchase."
2003.02-857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1456.906,1462.867,"Just a bill that said, you didn't realize it, but you just earned a... you just... you owe us $15 that you should have realized."
2003.02-857,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1462.867,1470.735,"Well, and whether it's imposed as a finance charge or... or as an other charge, the consumer is still going to have the... the kind of surprise that you referred to."
2003.02-857,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1503.346,1516.516,Would you agree that... that it would be to the consumer's advantage to have this categorized as a finance charge because then she wouldn't have to pay interest on that in... in future charges?
2003.02-857,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1516.516,1518.206,"No, Your Honor."
2003.02-857,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1617.691,1619.055,"Thank you, Ms. McDowell."
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,1622.232,1628.343,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-857,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1668.55,1673.418,"Are... are you fully defending the decision of the Sixth Circuit, Ms. Goldsmith?"
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,1673.418,1674.905,We... yes.
2003.02-857,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1690.22,1699.979,"Ms. Goldsmith, before you continue, the Sixth Circuit said a portion of Regulation Z is invalid because it's incompatible with the statute."
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,1704.133,1707.56,"--In theory, yes."
2003.02-857,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1708.879,1710.282,How about in practice?
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,1711.192,1720.684,"--We feel that perhaps the court did not need to go there, that... in... in looking at the situation now, we... we have always--"
2003.02-857,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1720.684,1722.83,But you asked... you asked the court to do that.
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,1722.83,1724.483,"--Yes, we did."
2003.02-857,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1724.483,1733.976,"When you argued the case before the Sixth Circuit, you made it very clear that you were seeking a holding that a portion of Regulation Z was incompatible with the statute."
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,1733.976,1746.774,"I think to the extent that Regulation Z says that anything you call an over-limit fee as excluded from the finance charge, that is incompatible with the regulation."
2003.02-857,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1802.707,1805.308,But that's an argument you didn't make before the Sixth Circuit.
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,1810.387,1812.245,That is correct.
2003.02-857,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1824.505,1826.113,But they clarified it in the Sixth Circuit.
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,1832.512,1836.515,--I don't believe that the Government clarified that for us in the Sixth Circuit.
2003.02-857,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1868.195,1869.325,"Well, you used the word review."
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,1873.396,1874.594,--I'm sorry.
2003.02-857,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1874.594,1880.455,But you didn't... you... we would not be reviewing anything that the court below determined.
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,1887.308,1899.485,"I think that in Connecticut v. Door, for instance, this Court acknowledged that there are circumstances that this Court wants to make sure that the right rule of law is handed down."
2003.02-857,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1919.343,1928.547,"Usually if we're asked to affirm on an alternate ground, it's a ground that the court of appeals passed on as kind of an alternate ground."
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,1931.064,1933.022,--I agree.
2003.02-857,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1963.675,1966.526,"It isn't just a procedural point, Ms. Goldsmith."
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,1975.814,1985.018,"And I would agree, and... and the only defense that I have to that is that this is a matter that has been fully briefed and argued by counsel before this Court."
2003.02-857,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1997.073,1998.309,What other argument is there?
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2021.427,2022.375,--I believe so.
2003.02-857,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2022.375,2022.997,What?
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2022.997,2033.975,I think that a fee denominated an over-limit fee that is actually an anticipated cost for approving an extension of credit is in fact a finance charge.
2003.02-857,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2033.975,2037.113,Does it say on the paper this is a charge for exceeding a credit limit?
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2037.113,2039.631,I believe they called it an over-limit fee assessment.
2003.02-857,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2039.631,2040.169,All right.
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2049.456,2051.043,I think that's a factual question.
2003.02-857,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2051.869,2052.241,"Oh, okay."
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2057.896,2063.675,--I believe the facts of this case... this is not a fee that was imposed for the unilateral act of exceeding a credit limit.
2003.02-857,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2063.675,2063.925,Okay.
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2071.859,2075.036,I believe the allegations of our complaint have always been clear.
2003.02-857,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2075.036,2076.606,"Oh, yes, but, I mean... that may be."
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2096.007,2097.328,No.
2003.02-857,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2097.328,2097.866,No.
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2102.158,2103.523,I don't believe we would.
2003.02-857,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2103.523,2112.272,"We... we'd just have another case a little bit down the line, perhaps with the same parties before the Court, arguing this... this follow-on question."
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2113.304,2114.502,I believe absolutely.
2003.02-857,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2121.272,2124.261,"If we don't resolve it, we've essentially wasted our time."
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2167.962,2173.74,I don't believe that our interpretation conflicts with that of the Federal Reserve Board.
2003.02-857,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2176.507,2177.334,We wouldn't be arguing here.
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2177.827,2191.285,"--I believe what the... what the Federal Reserve Board has said is that when you have a fee for a unilateral act of default, that that fee is properly excluded from finance charge."
2003.02-857,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2192.111,2196.586,"--Well, don't we have to accept the Government's position?"
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2200.368,2201.687,--Absolutely.
2003.02-857,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2201.687,2203.999,So it is the agency position.
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2203.999,2218.944,I don't believe that you will find in the Government's brief an argument that the fee alleged in this case necessarily fits within the terms of section 226.4(c)(2).
2003.02-857,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2241.607,2244.208,I didn't think that was the Government's argument in my... as I read it.
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2321.856,2333.994,"I think if we assume that this fee is a fee for exceeding a credit limit, then we need to look at the nature of the fee and determine whether or not that is obviously repugnant to the statute."
2003.02-857,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2379.403,2380.267,"I mean, you say the agency said this?"
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2382.003,2384.065,--In both the regulation itself and the commentary.
2003.02-857,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2385.347,2387.78,What... what portion of the regulation says that?
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2387.78,2393.437,--That's in 226.4(c)(2) in the portion that says actual unanticipated late payments.
2003.02-857,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2412.634,2417.836,I suppose that depends on what... what time period unanticipated refers to.
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2417.836,2422.46,--I believe that the commentary helps explain that for us.
2003.02-857,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2422.46,2422.666,Okay.
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2423.387,2434.061,"The commentary says if this is truly a late fee because you have paid and the creditor could do nothing about it, then that is going to be an actual unanticipated late fee."
2003.02-857,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2444.547,2445.7,Where... where is that in... in your brief?
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2445.7,2453.296,"The portion of the commentary... to be perfectly honest, I don't know if the... if the commentary is reprinted in the appendix."
2003.02-857,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2455.154,2457.096,"Gee, if it's that central, I would have thought it ought to have been there."
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2460.661,2462.48,"--I don't know, Your Honor."
2003.02-857,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2462.48,2465.202,You don't know what you just said?
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2465.202,2468.463,I don't know where in the appendix it is is what I don't know.
2003.02-857,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2500.785,2502.271,"Yes, sort of."
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2514.903,2519.899,I was trying to give an analogy as to late fees which is somewhat tangential to the issue.
2003.02-857,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2539.506,2541.364,May I ask you a question about that?
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2588.358,2598.661,I think the answer to the question is is that this is really no different than a request to... to... a request to make a purchase below the credit limit versus a request to make a purchase above it.
2003.02-857,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2602.376,2602.626,No.
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2602.626,2603.369,--credit is.
2003.02-857,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2603.369,2626.319,"But if your point... and I think I'm not getting your point, but if your point is that they approved this in the sense that they said, yes, we will honor this... they're telling you in... in effect... we will honor this charge and that that, in effect, is a renegotiation of your credit limit with the bank, then it would follow that they can't charge you any penalty at all."
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2645.844,2647.224,I think two things.
2003.02-857,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2663.927,2674.451,"So you're saying, yes, it violates the contract, but it's okay to violate the contract because they... they approved in advance this charge."
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2674.451,2679.818,--We do not feel that it's a violation of the contract if they allow you to do it.
2003.02-857,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2679.818,2687.498,"Then if it's not a violation of the contract because they allowed you to do it, why do you concede that they can charge you any fee at all for doing that?"
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2687.498,2699.387,"I'm not conceding that they can charge you a penalty on top a finance charge, but what I'm saying is that anytime a creditor extends credit, they may charge a fee and--"
2003.02-857,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2699.387,2700.213,Okay.
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2700.213,2700.48,--as a credit.
2003.02-857,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2700.48,2711.73,"They may, but in the original contract with you in the... the... at the... at the beginning of your relationship with the bank, they didn't spell out the particular situation that you're describing here."
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2751.4,2762.545,I believe what we have always said is that this extension of credit was like any other extension of credit on the card.
2003.02-857,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2772.659,2778.771,"Yes, but your... your argument is that the extension of credit in this case is an agreement to exceed the credit limit."
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2779.885,2782.047,--I don't think so.
2003.02-857,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2782.047,2799.841,"I thought your argument, Ms. Goldsmith, was that the contract provides that any extension of credit over the credit limit shall be subject to the regular percentage plus the $15 penalty."
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2813.438,2814.907,I don't--
2003.02-857,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2814.907,2818.622,"If that's not your argument, then... then I think Justice Souter has to be correct."
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2818.622,2829.684,"--I think at this stage of... of the litigation, since we have not conducted any discovery, we have not seen the actual cardholder agreement to know what it says with regard to over-limit fees."
2003.02-857,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2831.997,2834.226,Didn't... didn't Ms. Pfennig get a copy?
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2837.941,2849.086,"On her bill it will tell her what her contract rate is, but the initial disclosures... I believe she had this card 7-8 years before this happened and it is not in the record."
2003.02-857,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2849.086,2854.455,I thought... I thought the terms have to be disclosed monthly in addition to when the credit card is new.
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2854.455,2864.153,"What has to be... and... and I believe that... that Mr. Waxman explained this, but you have your initial disclosures that come with the card when you originally get it."
2003.02-857,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2896.148,2899.325,"And if that's not in the record, how can you make the argument you're making?"
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2910.161,2925.037,I think the confusion is coming in because ultimately what is or is not labeled in an over-limit fee may not be a fee for exceeding a credit limit as that term has been used in the regulations.
2003.02-857,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2925.037,2927.084,"And the only way we can tell that is to look at the contract, isn't it?"
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2927.084,2928.115,I don't believe so.
2003.02-857,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2928.115,2928.653,No?
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2928.653,2942.316,"I believe that if you look at section 1637(b)(2) that describes how each and every extension of credit needs to be itemized, we're talking about a singular event, an extension of credit."
2003.02-857,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2957.26,2966.055,"Are you talking about just an ordinary credit card transaction where you go in and say, look, I'm buying a pair of gloves and I want to put them on my credit card?"
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2969.77,2970.429,Absolutely.
2003.02-857,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2970.429,2971.461,Okay.
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2974.971,2975.919,I'm not quite sure.
2003.02-857,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2976.745,2987.065,"Well, one reason it's complicated, if I understand your position, you're objecting both to the fee and to the later statements imposing an interest charge on the fee, aren't you?"
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,2987.065,2989.294,"I think it's triple dipping, yes."
2003.02-857,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3003.373,3004.692,"If that's in the contract, so what?"
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,3016.126,3017.158,--I think--
2003.02-857,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3017.158,3018.727,And you don't know whether it's in the contract.
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,3020.502,3023.064,--But this is not a breach of contract case.
2003.02-857,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3026.157,3029.79,"Whether it is or not, you shouldn't call it unfair if you don't know."
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,3029.79,3032.762,--I don't recall using the word unfair.
2003.02-857,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3040.275,3041.473,Could I interrupt with this one question?
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,3057.365,3072.886,"--I don't believe so because when it is charged as a flat fee as an other charge, besides the fact that there's interest charged on top of it, the consumer is in a position that they then need to compare cost of credit, one, as a dollar figure, the other as an APR."
2003.02-857,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3092.827,3098.687,But why would the consumer understand the cost of credit any better by labeling it a finance charge rather than an other charge?
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,3100.423,3103.767,--Because Congress said we want that to be an apples-to-apples comparison.
2003.02-857,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3115.86,3116.77,So how does that work?
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,3145.498,3149.585,--The simple answer is I don't know.
2003.02-857,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3158.752,3163.869,"I think that's why Justice Stevens might have thought it's going to confuse the consumer if you win, not help the consumer."
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,3202.878,3205.851,--But I don't believe that that's necessarily how it would be done.
2003.02-857,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3240.236,3252.207,"But, of course, the difficulty for you is all you have to say is that the view I was taking somewhat by argument is a reasonable one, and if it's a reasonable one, I guess it's a reasonable interpretation of the statute."
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,3267.689,3271.693,--I think that ultimately depends on... on the construction of the regulation.
2003.02-857,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3296.296,3308.845,The one thing that the... the board has said is we don't want these individual to make every extension of credit or what... to do this kind of thing on a case-by-case basis.
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,3328.042,3332.501,And I think that gets back to Justice... Justice Kennedy's question of quite some time ago.
2003.02-857,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3396.485,3399.495,Now you're going back to the regulation itself is no good.
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,3399.495,3404.947,"To the extent that it controls here, which I'm not sure it does, I think yes."
2003.02-857,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3418.443,3429.217,"Ms. McDowell said that... that in dollars and cents, there's no difference to the customer using... there is a dollars and cents difference, I take it, and would you explain what it is?"
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,3429.217,3429.755,Yes.
2003.02-857,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3433.636,3435.494,I think you've answered it.
2003.02-857,2,41416,sylvia_antalis_goldsmith,,3438.383,3438.671,Thank you.
2003.02-857,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3438.671,3451.386,The question of whether or not we disclosed this fee properly within the regulation was passed on by the lower court.
2003.02-857,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3607.424,3608.334,"Thank you, Mr. Waxman."
2003.02-857,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3608.334,3609.077,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2003.02-857,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3609.077,3609.942,The case is submitted.
