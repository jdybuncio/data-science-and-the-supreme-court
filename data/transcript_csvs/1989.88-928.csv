1989.88-928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.575,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-928, James M. White versus the United States."
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,10.606,11.839,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,40.359,50.262,"Mr. Payment, has this so-called attack occurred only in one area of the country, or is this a nationwide effort?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,50.262,58.384,"It started in the western district of New York; it has spread to other parts of New York and apparently could be expected to spread nationwide, depending on the--"
1989.88-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,58.384,60.476,"But, thus far, just in New York?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,60.476,61.539,--That... that is true.
1989.88-928,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,61.539,67.098,"What is there, an... an ambitious revenue agent up there, who wants to make a quota or something?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,67.098,68.737,"So it would seem, Your Honor."
1989.88-928,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,68.737,74.532,"In competition with the income tax people, who would pick it up on the other side of the coin?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,74.532,86.309,"I... that is our position, indeed, that as the Second Circuit mentioned, one would well wonder why the Internal Revenue Service would deploy its forces in this manner."
1989.88-928,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,101.21,102.46,"Not only allowable, but allowed?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,102.46,103.444,--That's correct.
1989.88-928,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,104.676,109.456,"I will say, in my day, when I practiced a little tax law, this thing was just completely unheard of."
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,109.456,113.892,"--It was unheard of until three or four years ago, Your Honor."
1989.88-928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,132.899,138.804,"Mr. Payment, when you... you use the term ""collateral attack"", that isn't strictly correct, is it?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,145.081,156.079,"--As a matter of fact, the government does not have to appear in such cases, and, as a matter of policy, never does appear."
1989.88-928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,160.748,169.714,"Well, I think of a collateral attack as being a challenge to a final judgment by someone who... who is bound by the judgment, by someone who is a party to it."
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,169.714,175.992,"--I understand there is a difference, Your Honor, but... and... and of course, we do not assert res judicata principles apply here."
1989.88-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,212.586,219.209,"Well, I guess this comes up in the context of a summons enforcement proceeding, right?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,219.209,221.567,"--That's correct, it does come up in that context."
1989.88-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,221.567,233.374,"Which complicates it somewhat, because the Court has been careful not to trench upon the summons enforcement power of the IRS."
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,233.374,233.749,That is very true.
1989.88-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,236.185,237.06,That's right.
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,237.06,246.135,"And there... have had many in the last 24 or <five> [= 5] years since the Powell case, and the government almost always wins, and the policy comes--"
1989.88-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,246.135,246.354,Right.
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,246.354,247.494,--out the same way every time.
1989.88-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,252.367,267.251,"So, presumably, the IRS could legitimately seek information by... by way of the summons enforcement technique?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,267.251,277.746,"--Well, that depends on whether our position is correct or not on Bosch and on 2053."
1989.88-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,278.403,291.523,"So, for you to win, you have to persuade us that Bosch was perhaps... went too far, or we need to cut back on it or something?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,291.523,293.039,--Well--
1989.88-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,293.039,293.944,For you to win?
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,293.944,298.583,"--First of all, we're dealing with a different statute than was involved in the Bosch case."
1989.88-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,355.903,363.088,"You don't rely on any argument that the IRS has acted in bad faith, I gather?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,363.088,372.413,"In... in the sense that if you do not have a proper purpose for a summons enforcement proceeding, that is bad faith."
1989.88-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,397.183,406.352,What if there were fraud or the state court had applied state law erroneously in allowing the fee?
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,406.352,410.585,"--Well, to treat those subjects one at a time."
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,489.474,490.396,"Mr. Payment, may I interrupt?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,506.139,506.904,--I understand.
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,506.904,516.525,"Could they do this in the attorney fee area... just not necessarily have to allege fraud, but just say as our routine enforcement, we check up on every 15th fee... fee award?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,516.525,524.663,"Let's say that were the case, not... not what is actually happening, but that... hypothetical were the case."
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,555.791,559.555,"Well, but the other side of the coin here is it's... it's not all that burdensome to turn over your time sheets, either."
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,559.555,562.554,"That's true, unless you don't have to do it."
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,568.535,570.02,"Well, he has to do--"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,570.02,571.457,That the state court decree should have been given--
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,571.457,582.11,"--But whatever records are... are sufficient to justify the fee for the probate court, or whatever you call the judge, you used to have to turn over those same records to the... to the IRS."
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,582.11,583.874,--They weren't satisfied with those records.
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,591.043,592.353,Were the time sheets in the records?
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,593.088,594.353,--The time sheets were not in the records.
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,594.353,599.445,"--But, if the surrogate had... if the surrogate had said to you, I'd like to take a look at your time sheets, you wouldn't have any doubt that you'd have to turn them over to him, would you?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,599.445,600.272,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,602.991,610.55,"And he wouldn't have to say, I suspect you of fraud, I just think, every now and then, I ought to... ought to find out just how much time goes into these for... for general information."
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,610.55,616.048,"--That would be... that... if we were in surrogates court and that inquiry was made of Mr. White, I am sure he would have turned them over."
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,681.318,690.533,"But, really, what you're saying is that if you turn over the records and the IRS challenged them, that a fee is not being a... allowable as a matter of New York law, you would win?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,695.219,703.341,I'm... I'm saying that the Internal Revenue Service can look at the same material that the surrogate looks at.
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,728.83,729.486,Then IRS--
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,729.486,729.799,--because it's binding--
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,729.799,731.157,"--Then IRS must make an eyeball judgment, too."
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,731.157,736.313,"--The IRS wants to make an eyeball judgment, but an eyeball judgment with a microscope."
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,756.351,761.38,Are there any cases in which you've litigated out the merits of a fee award in your... your county?
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,761.38,762.661,"Oh, certainly."
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,762.661,763.55,"With the IRS, I mean?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,763.55,769.158,Not with the IRS in... in... you mean in connection with the federal case--
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,769.158,773.641,I understand you probably settle them; it's a lot easier to settle... to take... knock a thousand dollars off the fee and save the expense.
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,780.779,808.251,"--Mr. White paid... or rather the estate paid, apparently, a... because the Internal Revenue Service disallowed the entire fee, paid a deficiency, and has brought a companion action, a refund action in the federal district court, in which, of all things, the Internal Revenue Service has demanded a jury trial to have this entire matter relitigated."
1989.88-928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,813.375,818.045,"Yes, but the government disallowed the entire attorney's fee in the--"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,818.045,823.058,"--Didn't... didn't disallow a portion, disallowed the entire attorney's fee."
1989.88-928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,823.058,825.354,--Was any reason given for that?
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,825.354,828.167,"None that's in the record, Your Honor."
1989.88-928,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,829.915,833.633,"Well, as a standard reason, the failure to obey the subpoena."
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,833.633,835.757,--I'm sure that that was their position.
1989.88-928,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,845.315,849.688,I'm... I'm still not sure how you answered Justice Stevens' question that I was interested in.
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,867.228,879.488,"The rule is, to start with, that once the state court has spoken, as it... as it did in this case, that's... that's preclusive, that the Internal Revenue Service can go no further."
1989.88-928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,892.405,893.607,"Oh, so it's looking for something else."
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,893.607,893.873,--again and again.
1989.88-928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,893.873,895.404,It's looking for something else.
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,911.132,911.647,There are--
1989.88-928,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,911.647,915.959,"In which case, it would investigate further to see if there is any evidence of fraud--"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,915.959,917.77,--But there are no mysteries here.
1989.88-928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,947.508,948.43,--It's your--
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,948.43,952.038,He's making the other judgments that Freeman permit him to make.
1989.88-928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,952.038,969.423,"--It's your position, then, that if... if the practice in the surrogate in Monroe County is to just barely give a nod to time, that the... and that's supported by the New York Court of Appeals decision--"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,969.423,970.062,Right.
1989.88-928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,970.062,975.201,--that the Internal Revenue Service must analyze in the same way?
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,975.201,977.106,Exactly so.
1989.88-928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,990.399,991.898,"Well, I would hope so, yeah."
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,991.898,994.302,"Just peer below the surface and ask the question, what's going on here?"
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,994.302,997.223,"But under your rule, could they do it if it was 90 percent of the estate?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,997.223,997.473,Certainly.
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,997.473,998.145,What--
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,998.145,1000.582,Because they would have grounds to suspect.
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1007.626,1020.135,"--Well, supposing you had findings by the trial judge that this was a complicated estate, and I know from similar complicated estates it takes a great deal of time and effort, and I think it's an awful lot of money, but in this particular case, it's perfectly reasonable to give them 90 percent of the estate?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1020.135,1023.025,"--If you have that kind of a finding, then they haven't got any reason to suspect fraud."
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1025.493,1026.32,So--
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1026.32,1029.008,--and you had a routine sort of... of a case--
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1029.008,1031.959,--I would suspect you can never go behind a state court judgment.
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1033.646,1034.146,--Not at all.
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1068.21,1079.158,"Yes, but don't we also have to presume that if you turned over the records and they disallowed the fee, you'd say I'm going to stick to my guns because I've got a court order approving it, and if we litigate it out, you're going to lose?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1079.158,1082.017,--If we litigate it out--
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1082.017,1084.142,Don't we have to presume you would win the lawsuit on the validity of the deduction?
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1084.142,1087.844,--If we go into the refund case.
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1087.844,1088.28,Yeah.
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1092.17,1092.998,But... but--
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1092.998,1099.275,"But... but in the normal case where you comply with the subpoena and you've got a court order approving your fee, aren't you going to win 99 percent of those cases?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1099.275,1103.273,"--Well, the Internal Revenue Service says no."
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1103.273,1104.477,No they don't.
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1104.477,1114.551,"The Internal Revenue Service's position is they're entitled to jury trials in such cases, they're entitled to drag the surrogate in, I guess, and have him testify under oath as to what he did."
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1135.808,1144.04,"But... I... I grant all that, but don't you think that if you assume an neutral tribunal in which the issue is litigated out, you think there's a danger of losing these cases?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1144.04,1147.46,We're in federal court; that's the neutral tribunal.
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1147.46,1150.974,"Well, isn't that... you think the... the federal court is not a neutral tribunal?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1150.974,1161.408,"I... I don't... I don't think that there should be a loss in a case like that, but I don't think the Internal Revenue Service ought to be coming in with these summonses, either, and causing this sort of disruption."
1989.88-928,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1178.869,1180.649,"Well, I understand that."
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1180.649,1184.867,Because you're asking... you're putting the negotiator in a... in a very touchy position.
1989.88-928,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1184.867,1189.989,"Mr. Pay... Payment, the deficiency has been paid, hasn't it?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1189.989,1190.911,That is correct.
1989.88-928,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1190.911,1197.128,"Are you taking the position that this aspect of this case, the summons aspect, is moot?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1197.128,1198.955,"No, not at all, Your Honor."
1989.88-928,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1198.955,1199.408,Why isn't it?
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1199.408,1200.188,Because he hasn't complied.
1989.88-928,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1200.188,1201.625,Why isn't it moot?
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1201.625,1205.562,Because he has not complied with the summons.
1989.88-928,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1235.58,1236.58,Wouldn't you welcome--
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1236.58,1240.61,"But, if the result is that you affirm--"
1989.88-928,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1240.61,1241.953,--Wouldn't you welcome a holding to mootness here?
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1241.953,1245.577,"--I... I don't think so, Your Honor."
1989.88-928,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1253.012,1253.794,"Well, you'll do that--"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1253.794,1254.902,We didn't come all this way--
1989.88-928,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1254.902,1257.432,--You'll do that on the case that's pending out there.
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1257.432,1264.852,"--Well, that won't be from the United States Supreme Court; that'll be from a district court."
1989.88-928,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1264.852,1270.442,"Well, in that case, cannot the government subpoena the time records in the refund case?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1270.442,1275.377,They would certainly do so in the normal discovery process.
1989.88-928,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1275.377,1277.736,"Well, why doesn't that make the case moot, then?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1278.923,1281.048,"Well, it all depends."
1989.88-928,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1304.242,1308.348,"Well, I'm not sure why that... that follows, if the refund suit is still pending."
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1308.348,1324.171,"I... I think it's very clear that the issue in this case is whether there can ever be a proper purpose for issuing a summons, where the state court decree has a preclusive effect."
1989.88-928,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1418.429,1419.819,What was the size--
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1419.819,1420.241,This case goes the--
1989.88-928,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1420.241,1421.553,--What was the size of the estate?
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1424.411,1426.051,"--It was a $450,000 estate."
1989.88-928,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1433.47,1437.718,Which was in... which was in line with a bar schedule for an estate of that size?
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1437.718,1448.433,"--It was in line with the judge's own local custom of... first of all, you have to understand, the executor's commission is fixed by statute, and so it doesn't vary."
1989.88-928,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1450.307,1452.993,Is the executor's commission also questioned here?
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1452.993,1454.29,"No, it is not."
1989.88-928,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1454.29,1455.758,Because it's fixed by statute?
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1455.758,1456.711,Fixed by statute.
1989.88-928,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1474.907,1475.985,How did--
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1475.985,1476.86,And you couldn't have--
1989.88-928,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1476.86,1479.077,--How did the two fees compare in size?
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1481.561,1486.372,"--Was about 16,000, and the executor's commission was about 17,000 and some odd change."
1989.88-928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1500.07,1503.224,Was Mr. White both executor and attorney?
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1503.224,1505.255,"--He was in this case, which is permitted under New York law."
1989.88-928,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1506.801,1508.363,"So he got a double fee, though?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1508.363,1509.644,--That's... that's correct.
1989.88-928,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1534.868,1546.504,"Well, do you... do you think that... do you think that the IRS may inquire as to whether a surrogate's decision is consistent with state law?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1546.504,1554.719,Only if this Court believes that the Bosch decision requires that result.
1989.88-928,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1569.009,1581.192,"Well, you shouldn't... if you know that the decision is consistent with state law, that may be so, but does it necessarily follow that every surrogate's decision is consistent with state law?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1581.192,1586.269,"It doesn't follow that every one is, but the fact of the matter is, once it's been done--"
1989.88-928,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1586.269,1594.515,"Well, suppose the Internal Revenue Code says what the surrogate did is... is wholly contrary to a... a decision of the Court of the Appeals in New York?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1594.515,1597.342,"--That's what they seek to do, but they--"
1989.88-928,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1597.342,1598.653,And you say they cannot do that?
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1598.653,1606.182,"--They... they cannot do it, because 2053 of the Internal Revenue Code makes state law binding."
1989.88-928,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1607.994,1611.352,"Well, state law is what the court of appeals say it is, not what a surrogate says it is."
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1611.352,1624.675,"--And Freeman... Freeman... that's true, but Freeman governs the exact discussion here, and the surrogate contended that he followed the Freeman case, and the Freeman case has mainly subjective factors, not just time."
1989.88-928,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1624.675,1630.033,"Well, they've... they've got... the IRS, I would think, should be able to inquire as to whether what he did is consistent with Freeman."
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1630.033,1636.952,"And involve the federal courts in relitigating this very matter, just as in the refund... this case."
1989.88-928,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1636.952,1651.617,"But I guess if we conclude that under United States v. Powell, that you didn't make a showing of bad faith by the IRS, we don't reach any further question?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1651.617,1657.178,"Bad faith, in our view, is the same as an improper purpose."
1989.88-928,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1676.232,1685.462,"My... my notes show that the executor's commission was reduced also from $17,450 to 16,804; is that incorrect?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1685.462,1690.303,Apparently that was through some negotiations on incorrect mathematical calculation.
1989.88-928,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1695.943,1699.848,So the... so the agent in this case did reduce the executor's commission as well?
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1699.848,1704.861,"Well, he... before this summons enforcement proceeding, the matter was conceded, yes."
1989.88-928,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1709.235,1711.484,I would like to--
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1718.153,1729.273,"Well, one of the things is that that wasn't implicated in the summons enforcement end of the thing; it happened before they brought the summons enforcement proceeding."
1989.88-928,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1729.273,1732.428,"Well, could you have a summons enforcement just to determine there's no mathematical error?"
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1732.428,1740.861,I don't think that the Internal Revenue Service would come into federal court on a mathematical error issue ever.
1989.88-928,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1741.893,1743.642,"Well, I... I suppose they might if they were in disagreement."
1989.88-928,0,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,1743.642,1745.064,"--Well, perhaps so."
1989.88-928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1759.979,1761.087,"Very well, Mr. Payment."
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1762.416,1768.054,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1817.238,1824.641,"So the... the disallowance, then, did depend on the refusal to obey the summons?"
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1824.641,1825.282,Absolutely.
1989.88-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1825.282,1834.34,"So, it would be hard to say, though, that the summons enforcement proceeding was moot, so long as the entire refund proceeding has been necessitated by that?"
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1834.34,1838.745,"No, the summons enforcement proceeding is not moot; the refund... the deficiency is being litigated."
1989.88-928,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1846.929,1848.741,"Yes, but you have the tax?"
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1848.741,1854.863,"Well, we have the tax until the refund suit is litigated, but we don't have it to keep, yet."
1989.88-928,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1854.863,1858.549,"Well, can you use the discovery proceedings in the refund suit to get the documents?"
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1858.549,1871.731,"Well, I guess we can ask, but, as far as I know, the IRS summons power is broader than any discovery right they would have in district court, so I assume if we can't get it with a summons, we can't get it with discovery, either."
1989.88-928,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1894.722,1911.715,"Mr. Horowitz, is the Internal Revenue Service, in fact, starting some effort to review, generally, claims as allowed by state courts in estates?"
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1911.715,1916.181,I'm not aware of any IRS policy to begin to do this.
1989.88-928,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1923.929,1931.191,"Well, is there just some particular agent in New York that's on a roll, so to speak?"
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1931.191,1934.189,"--Well, I... I can't really answer that."
1989.88-928,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1955.556,1969.317,"Well, do you... do you think that... that the statutes, section 2053, generally suggests, anyway, that the Internal Revenue Service will accept the fees that are awarded by the state courts?"
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1969.317,1972.769,"Well, I... I think it's clear enough what the statute says."
1989.88-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2020.143,2029.092,You... you... you... you're... the IRS' position is that the surrogate in Monroe County is not following the Freeman decision?
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2029.092,2033.918,"--That's not our position yet, because we haven't been permitted to make an investigation."
1989.88-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2035.418,2039.151,"Well, but I... I thought you said that you're investigating to see if... if--"
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2039.151,2041.994,"--Well, yes, there is a concern that--"
1989.88-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2041.994,2043.274,"--Well, where did the concern come from?"
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2043.274,2050.928,"--Well, none of these papers are in the record; there are some papers that were shown to Mr. White."
1989.88-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2066.623,2067.435,"Well, what... what--"
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2067.435,2069.279,"And it doesn't seem that he did anything, as far as we can tell."
1989.88-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2069.279,2069.435,"--Well, okay."
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2080.992,2087.741,"Then we probably would have very little reason to suspect that the... that this fee was not allowable under state law, and they probably would not have issued a summons."
1989.88-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2090.27,2096.128,"--But you... you feel the New York law is different, that it requires a certain expenditure of time in order to warrant any fee?"
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2096.128,2102.501,"Well, what the New York Court of Appeals said in Freeman was, it listed a whole host of factors, about nine factors or something, that it goes into."
1989.88-928,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2113.34,2116.994,"Mr. Horowitz, what is the government really after here?"
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2129.646,2133.129,"Justice Blackmun, we don't know if we would even disallow this deduction."
1989.88-928,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2133.129,2134.877,"Well, usually, I think that's the case, is it not?"
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2134.877,2137.986,That we would disallow--
1989.88-928,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2137.986,2140.469,That why I think you have an agent up there working on a quota.
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2140.469,2146.138,"--Well, we have an agent who is trying to make an investigation."
1989.88-928,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2159.242,2159.617,Exactly.
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2162.101,2165.006,"Well, I don't think we're making such a fuss over it, frankly."
1989.88-928,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2174.44,2175.315,"Yes, but you issued... you issued the summons?"
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2175.315,2177.97,"Yes, we did issue the summons, because the agent--"
1989.88-928,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2177.97,2178.751,And it may well be misguided--
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2178.751,2183.906,--the agent looked at the return and he thought there was reason to suspect the... the fee was not allowable.
1989.88-928,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2183.906,2188.277,--The IRS may lose a lot more taxes doing this than they would if they let it go to the income tax aspect.
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2188.277,2194.306,I understand that Petitioner has claimed in his reply brief that we have state tax attorneys who are sitting around with nothing to do and this isn't what we should be doing.
1989.88-928,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2236.945,2240.039,Is your next step along the line of Justice O'Connor's question?
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2245.708,2250.191,"There is no next step, Justice Blackmun."
1989.88-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2336.765,2346.262,And... and your position is the IRS need say nothing more in a case like this than it wishes to look into the propriety of the award of attorney's fees.
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2350.432,2351.963,--That's absolutely right.
1989.88-928,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2368.502,2392.102,"And I suppose you would say that... that even if the service is wrong about whether it has to accept the... the finding of the probate court, even if you're wrong about that, even if it is ultimately held that you have to accept it, at least at this point that's not clear, and you're not in bad faith to assume the contrary?"
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2392.102,2393.086,--Absolutely right.
1989.88-928,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2475.57,2485.082,"xxx as I gather from your brief, you say that the... the Service doesn't know whether there might be fraud?"
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2485.082,2487.8,--That... that's... that's the second point that I wanted to get to.
1989.88-928,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2487.8,2488.065,And--
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2488.065,2490.735,We've talked about fraud a little bit because--
1989.88-928,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2490.735,2494.657,--And that might be true even if the statute said 10 percent?
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2494.657,2498.262,"--Well, that's so, I suppose."
1989.88-928,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.276,2505.167,That may be so.
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2505.167,2521.754,"--The... the only way in which... looking down the road to the merits... could effect the summons enforcement proceeding, it seems to me, is if it raised an inference of bad faith on the part of the agent, that it was clear enough that the stated purpose of investigating tax liability was not the true purpose, and that's not the case here."
1989.88-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2521.754,2536.25,"Some... somewhere in... somewhere in the briefs or record, Mr. Horowitz, it seems to me there is something to the effect that one of the concerns of the I... IRS was that New York allowed the attorney to... to also be the executor."
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2538.404,2555.553,"Well, that... that's one of the things that... that... that I think was a contributing factor in the decision to investigate this return, because it makes it a little more questionable what the surrogate might have done."
1989.88-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2556.224,2559.411,But that... that... that's... that really seems quite dubious to me.
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2561.519,2572.562,"--Well, New York law allows the same individual to serve as both executor and attorney, but New York law clearly does not allow him to collect a double fee for the same services."
1989.88-928,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2613.685,2614.404,"--Well, that's rather--"
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2614.404,2615.935,And that would be litigated in another proceeding.
1989.88-928,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2615.935,2617.794,"--That's rather a broad statement, Mr. Horowitz."
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2624.572,2626.086,"I've never probated an estate, no."
1989.88-928,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2626.086,2626.289,No.
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2626.289,2630.789,But there's nothing in the record as to what the attorney did.
1989.88-928,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2691.076,2700.76,"Mr. Horowitz, don't misunderstand me, I'm frank to say I've never liked double fees, and I've never liked double fees that are fixed at the maximum possible."
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2705.695,2715.441,"Well, Justice Blackmun, as I said before, I mean, there... there has yet to be a case where we've actually been litigating whether the fee should be disallowed or not."
1989.88-928,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2726.014,2728.373,"Well, I'm sure--"
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2728.373,2731.403,But I'm sure you recognize that there can be abuses in this area and we can't find out--
1989.88-928,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2731.403,2734.261,--I'm sure some fee is allowable in an estate of this size?
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2734.261,2736.87,"--If he did work for attorney, probably some fee is allowable."
1989.88-928,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2736.87,2737.183,And the--
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2737.183,2740.058,And I doubt very much we would have disallowed the whole fee if we had the records.
1989.88-928,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2740.058,2742.976,"--And the surrogate not only found it allowable, he allowed it."
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2742.976,2744.554,The surrogate did allow it.
1989.88-928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2753.425,2765.328,"Well, it really relates to the first issue, though, because if we construe the statute to mean, in effect, that anything that's been allowed by the state judge is deductible, then you would not have a proper purpose."
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2765.328,2771.341,"Well, I disagree with that, Justice Stevens, on... on two grounds."
1989.88-928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2771.653,2773.199,I thought that was your hypothetical earlier?
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2774.761,2778.697,"--No, my hypothetical is not if you ultimately construe the statute that way; my... my hypothetical--"
1989.88-928,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2778.697,2782.633,--You would not have a proper purpose in the next case if we came out that way in this case?
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2782.633,2782.961,"--Yes, sir."
1989.88-928,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2783.977,2790.301,"That's... but you would say that, as far as this case is concerned, having an arguable position on this, your... your purpose is... is--"
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2790.301,2793.362,"--Well, we have more than an arguable position, we have a decision out of this Court that's directly on point."
1989.88-928,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2793.362,2794.783,"--Well, no."
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2795.033,2796.846,Pretty close.
1989.88-928,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2796.846,2797.236,Which one?
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2797.236,2798.564,The estate of Bosch.
1989.88-928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2798.564,2804.405,"Well, the Bosch is a case where you basically had a collusive suit; everybody was interested in reducing taxes there."
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2810.247,2810.669,Who--
1989.88-928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2810.669,2813.293,--presumably don't want to pay a larger fee than they have to.
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2813.293,2813.948,--Who... well--
1989.88-928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2813.948,2815.979,"Bosch is quite different, I think."
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2815.979,2819.805,"--The Court did not... as I recall, the Court did not focus on whether it was a collusive suit or not."
1989.88-928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2820.195,2820.977,"But, in fact, that was true."
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2832.299,2833.127,"--Well, I... I mean, I understand that."
1989.88-928,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2833.127,2833.94,"Well, that's not the case here."
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2833.94,2848.449,"To try to distinguish it on its facts, but I think the holding of the Court is that what... what the code means when it talks about applying state law in... in the case of a federal estate tax deduction, what it means is applying the law as set forth by the highest court of the state."
1989.88-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3036.234,3050.619,"But you certainly can say there is a reason, suggested by Justice Stevens' question that, in Bosch, there was a motive on the part of all the parties to the litigation to have it come out a particular way, in order to reduce their tax liability."
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3060.646,3060.865,[inaudible]
1989.88-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3060.865,3063.644,That's certainly a factual difference from Bosch.
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3063.644,3068.032,"Yeah, you're suggesting that Bosch could be restricted to its facts, and that--"
1989.88-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3068.032,3073.515,"I don't find the Bosch majority, in particularly, crystal clear as to what the rule is or why it's that way."
1989.88-928,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3073.515,3074.108,--All right.
1989.88-928,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3152.076,3155.982,"Thank you, Mr. Horowitz."
1989.88-928,2,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,3158.715,3177.644,"I want to respond only to the issue of this so-called inability of the court, under Powell, to look at the merits in determining whether a proper purpose is had by the Internal Revenue Service."
1989.88-928,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3297.16,3300.001,"Thank you, Mr. Payment."
1989.88-928,2,33947,kenneth_a_payment,,3300.001,3300.673,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1989.88-928,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3300.673,3301.783,The case is submitted.
