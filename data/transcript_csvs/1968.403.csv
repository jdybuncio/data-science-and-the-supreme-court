1968.403,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,20.49,"Number 403, Jack Frederick McKart, petitioner versus United States."
1968.403,0,25881,gorge_c_pontikes,,22.037,26.558,"Good morning Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.403,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,320.498,323.772,The Court of Appeals never reached the merits.
1968.403,0,25881,gorge_c_pontikes,,323.772,333.127,They did not Your Honor and neither that the District Court because they felt that it was not necessary given the posture of the case.
1968.403,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,476.539,479.522,What about the appellate process within the system?
1968.403,0,25881,gorge_c_pontikes,,479.522,487.231,I believe Justice White that you will find that the appeal boards are made up of the same types of persons as the local boards are made up of.
1968.403,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,543.406,548.975,"Well, judicial decisions include findings of fact."
1968.403,0,25881,gorge_c_pontikes,,548.975,549.74,Quite correct.
1968.403,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,549.74,551.147,"It's a judicial function, isn't it?"
1968.403,0,25881,gorge_c_pontikes,,551.147,557.467,"That is a judicial function, I would agree and perhaps the word “judicial” is a little bit too broad for our position."
1968.403,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,572.695,581.458,What makes these boards -- the presidential boards for example different from them from an ordinary administrative agency?
1968.403,0,25881,gorge_c_pontikes,,591.634,596.62,"Oh, I would say so Your Honor but I think there, you have an entirely different apparatus."
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,1486.272,1491.214,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.403,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1900.933,1911.404,But it isn't the question of first impression with respect to other administrative agencies I gather?
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,1911.404,1913.149,I'm unclear what you mean by that?
1968.403,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1913.149,1917.515,"Well, it may be a question of first impression vis-à-vis the Selective Service System?"
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,1917.515,1918.418,Yes.
1968.403,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1918.418,1930.054,But certainly another context is the usual rule that the administrative agency view should be obtained?
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,1930.054,1932.568,"Well, that's what I'm suggesting should obtain here."
1968.403,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2004.356,2009.587,That he did just perhaps an advertently mentioned that his father (Voice Overlap) --
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2009.587,2023.125,He mentioned this Your Honor and the board then responded and sent him a conscientious objector form because he had also indicated that perhaps he had some reasons for filing that sort of claim.
1968.403,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2043.948,2045.019,His mother was still then alive?
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2045.019,2046.551,And his mother was still then alive.
1968.403,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2048.058,2065.518,"And then the -- his suggestion that the statutory -- the construction of the statute might depend upon whether or not there are other relatives are alive, grandmothers, grandfathers is that -- is it clear what the facts are in that respect?"
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2065.518,2076.748,"It's not wholly clear, it's clear as I recall that one set of grandparents is alive and at least one grandparent on the other side is alive."
1968.403,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2083.918,2085.853,Might give to it.
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2087.978,2098.221,"Well, there is an information in the record there is a testimony in this regard that it was taken at trial --"
1968.403,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2098.221,2099.768,At the criminal trial?
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2099.768,2113.141,-- at his trial and it appears that pages 15 and 16 of the appendix of the testimony was as I recall by his uncle to criminal crime.
1968.403,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2318.903,2320.037,The petitioner here what?
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2320.037,2321.749,That he argues on the substantive issue --
1968.403,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2321.749,2322.172,I see.
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2322.172,2331.341,-- i.e. that the basic theory is one of preservation of lineage rather than compassion or comfort whatever.
1968.403,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2364.868,2372.118,This indictment in this conviction were for failure to report for induction or failure to report for preinduction physical?
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2372.118,2375.054,Failure to report for induction.
1968.403,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2375.054,2383.205,"With respect to the physical exams the system is changed since the days of Estep and Falbo, has it not?"
1968.403,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2384.499,2389.67,"In those days, you don't have any -- get any physical until you were went down to report for induction, isn't that correct?"
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2389.67,2390.349,That's correct.
1968.403,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2404.583,2405.217,Half of would be --
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2405.217,2406.196,Half of would be.
1968.403,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2406.196,2406.952,-- unqualified.
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2406.952,2426.778,So the system since that time with only minor changes has been the one that they adopted then of preinduction physical is roughly 60 to 90 days prior to the proposed induction day and then if the man passes it he's given an order to report for induction if he fails because he's classified for (Voice Overlap).
1968.403,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2426.778,2431.075,And then the time of induction there's another physical I suppose.
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2431.075,2431.687,That's correct.
1968.403,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2431.687,2432.95,See if there's any change.
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2432.95,2436.182,That's pursuant to army regulations not Selective Service --
1968.403,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2436.182,2437.605,That's an army?
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2437.605,2441.409,"-- at the induction station, yes Your Honor."
1968.403,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2597.548,2608.905,Didn't Falbo proceed on the assumption or this is what Congress intended by saying by providing some finality to Selective Service decisions --
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2608.905,2611.046,I think it's --
1968.403,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2611.046,2614.97,-- at least Congress intended to require exhaustion?
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2614.97,2619.251,I think it's clear from a reading of Falbo that that's exactly what the Court was doing --
1968.403,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2619.251,2621.875,"What section was that, is that 11?"
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2621.875,2624.21,It was attempted to construe.
1968.403,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2627.072,2631.717,But isn't there -- is there some specific provision in the Act that says which you refer --
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2631.717,2632.558,"Well, under --"
1968.403,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2632.558,2634.119,-- to finality?
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2634.119,2657.184,"Under Section 10 (b) (3) is amended the Congress provided that such review, judicial review shall go to the question of the jurisdiction here in reserve to local boards, appeal boards and the president only when there is no basis in fact for the classification assigned to such registrant."
1968.403,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2763.826,2772.107,"Exhaustion really means or can mean two rather separate things in this area, can it?"
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2772.107,2773.43,I think that's right.
1968.403,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2784.005,2785.626,Which Oestereich did do?
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2785.626,2787.619,Which Oestereich did do.
1968.403,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2787.619,2790.91,At least get its administrative remedies?
1968.403,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2797.264,2800.355,That's correct.
1968.403,2,25881,gorge_c_pontikes,,3504.921,3506.012,Thank you.
1968.403,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3641.95,3644.347,That is with respect to who was a sole surviving son?
1968.403,2,25881,gorge_c_pontikes,,3644.347,3645.124,Correct.
