1980.80-756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.108,"We will hear arguments first this morning in Schweiker, Secretary of Health and Human Services v. Gray Panthers."
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,25.465,35.756,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,131.485,134.803,"Could I ask, that new regulations have been issued finally?"
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,134.803,135.653,Yes.
1980.80-756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,135.653,141.057,And if you win this case what happens to them?
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,141.057,143.909,The regulations may be modified.
1980.80-756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,158.918,163.056,Well did he need to issue the regulations Under the... was he ordered to issue them?
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,163.056,163.889,--Yes.
1980.80-756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,164.922,166.174,Did he ever ask for a stay?
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,166.174,167.424,--Several times.
1980.80-756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,168.926,170.776,"Including here, I suppose?"
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,170.776,175.247,No stay was asked for in this Court.
1980.80-756,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,175.247,181.001,Will these new regulations be rescinded if you prevail in this litigation?
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,181.001,193.558,"The Secretary has indicated that depending on the nature of this Court's disposition of this case, the regulations would probably... may have to be revised and of course, rescinded first and then revised."
1980.80-756,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,193.558,196.877,"You mean, if there's a reversal there will have to be a revision?"
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,196.877,197.493,Yes.
1980.80-756,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,197.493,200.329,"There wouldn't have to be, would there?"
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,200.329,223.028,"There wouldn't have to be, but since the Secretary was in effect ordered to disregard his own analysis of the statutory provisions, and instead, published regulations based upon the analysis of the Court of Appeals, if that... if the analysis in the Court of Appeals is held to be wrong, the Secretary would of course have to reconsider the regulations."
1980.80-756,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,223.028,229.698,"Well, all he says, and this is in that footnote on page 2, it may be necessary to revise them."
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,229.698,231.7,Depending on the nature of this Court's disposition.
1980.80-756,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,231.7,234.652,"Well, if there's a reversal, I suppose--"
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,234.652,235.385,That's right.
1980.80-756,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,235.385,239.337,--He still wouldn't require... having a reversal wouldn't require him to do anything.
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,239.337,240.889,That's right.
1980.80-756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,242.522,248.66,Well he says if I win this case I may revise these regulations.
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,248.66,249.043,"--Well, no."
1980.80-756,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,250.595,254.08,"He says it may be necessary, whatever that is supposed--"
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,254.08,254.964,--the Supreme Court grants--
1980.80-756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,254.964,272.225,"--Well when would it ever be necessary to... I suppose if the Secretary loses the case, but on a ground that's different from the Court of Appeals, maybe he would have to issue some different regulations, is that what he means?"
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,272.225,273.293,--That's right.
1980.80-756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,273.293,281.883,"Well what if the Court of Appeals is just reversed, outright, and say the Secretary is told that you were right the first time?"
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,286.201,287.201,"No, the Secretary doesn't."
1980.80-756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,289.42,296.157,"Well, did he make these new regulations under the coercive impact of the Court of Appeals' decision?"
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,296.157,296.893,--Yes.
1980.80-756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,296.893,305.915,"So the odds are that he will re examine them at the very least, and see whether he wants to stay with them if you prevail here?"
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,305.915,307.099,That's right.
1980.80-756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,307.099,311.652,"And whether or not he does, he's asserting the right to do so, that's what you're here for, why you're here?"
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,311.652,312.002,Sure.
1980.80-756,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,316.054,318.239,And we can't rewrite them?
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,318.239,318.856,Excuse me?
1980.80-756,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,318.856,320.774,And we can't rewrite them?
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,320.774,321.958,That's for sure.
1980.80-756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,663.182,682.076,"Mr. Jones, while you are on the legislative history... although I understand you are directing yourself now to this question of spouses, what about the House Report that is quoted on page 42 of your opponent's brief, which says that another provision that is included that requires states to take into account"
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,699.371,715.747,"Well, the omission from the quotation here is that the states were to take into account income that was... as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary, actually available to the applicant."
1980.80-756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,715.747,726.121,--But can the Secretary pass standards that include the deemed income to be available when it is not actually available?
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,727.321,748.519,"Well, to put the question that way is almost to assume the answer, because the available, for purposes of the Medicaid statute, is determined by the Secretary and income that the applicant's spouse actually receives is actually available."
1980.80-756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,759.376,766.763,"Would you... is it your view that if the statute included the words ""actually available"" we'd still have the same case?"
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,766.763,771.75,"If the statute also said ""actually available"" as determined in accordance with--"
1980.80-756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,771.75,777.421,"We've just inserted the word ""actually"" in the statute, which is not there, but the word ""actually"" is in the legislative history."
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,779.69,781.858,--I think not.
1980.80-756,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,785.66,790.98,"Mr. Jones, do you think that this case is controlled by Batterton v. Francis?"
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,790.98,792.48,--Yes.
1980.80-756,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,814.011,820.583,"Of course, the Court in that case was closely divided."
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,820.583,826.137,But the majority opinion is controlling here.
1980.80-756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1479.178,1480.711,"Mr. Jones, could I ask you another question?"
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,1489.717,1490.0,No.
1980.80-756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1491.919,1494.621,"But on this particular issue, on the deeming issue?"
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,1494.621,1503.126,"--The regulations have always permitted the states to include or consider the income of an applicant's spouse, whether they live together or not."
1980.80-756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1503.126,1506.745,And some states have done that since the beginning evidently?
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,1506.745,1507.511,That's right.
1980.80-756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1507.511,1514.684,How do you explain the fact that this issue wasn't litigated somewhere between 1965 and 1972?
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,1514.684,1515.051,Well--
1980.80-756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1515.051,1516.451,"Because it could have been, couldn't it?"
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,1516.451,1518.236,--It could have been.
1980.80-756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1550.274,1559.13,"But as I understand it, some of the states had, although hadn't been using SSI standards because there was no SSI, they had been using the same approach to the joint income."
1980.80-756,0,25538,george_w_jones,,1559.13,1559.563,--Right.
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,1726.571,1734.341,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1825.585,1832.321,"But the Court of Appeals did set aside the existing regulations of the Secretary, did it not?"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,1832.321,1836.292,"The Court of Appeals did affirm the District Court's invalidation of those regulations, that's true."
1980.80-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1836.292,1838.308,And that was under the Administrative Procedure Act?
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,1838.308,1839.51,"Yes, that's correct."
1980.80-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1839.51,1845.248,Well where you have to show they are either arbitrary or capricious or contrary to law?
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,1845.248,1849.983,"Well, Your Honor, I assume you refer to the Batterton standard which is quoted... which quotes the APA--"
1980.80-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1849.983,1854.004,Well I'm referring to the Administrative Procedure Act.
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,1854.004,1858.756,--I would say that the Court of Appeals must have been acting under that aspect of the Act.
1980.80-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1858.756,1862.96,"We often don't know, of course, with this Court of Appeals."
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,1862.96,1875.283,"Well, assuming since they referred throughout the decision, both to Batterton and to Overton Park, Citizens for Overton Park, I assume that the Court of Appeals was using the APA standard in making its determination."
1980.80-756,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1875.283,1877.669,Well may I ask what--
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,1889.01,1906.286,"What the Court of Appeals held was, in certain circumstances deeming was not permitted and in certain circumstances it was permitted, specifically where the spouses were still living together, but in certain circumstances especially where they were separated, and especially where they were separated under certain conditions, deeming was not permitted."
1980.80-756,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1920.545,1926.883,"May I ask, what is the significance of what you just said to the issue we have to decide?"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,1926.883,1932.187,Well the issue was raised before as to whether the Court of Appeals had told the Secretary what exactly--
1980.80-756,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1932.187,1935.272,"I know, but what's it's relevance?"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,1935.272,1939.193,"--Your Honor, I simply wanted to clarify what I consider a point which was made--"
1980.80-756,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1939.193,1940.759,You don't suggest the case isn't a live case?
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,1940.759,1942.411,"--No, I certainly don't, Your Honor."
1980.80-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1978.601,2003.849,"Is it not generally true that under state law, take a hypothetical case, a man and wife are separated but not divorced, and the wife is affluent, has millions, and the husband falls on evil times and can't take care of himself, under state law in most states cannot the one spouse be required to--"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2003.849,2005.018,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1980.80-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2006.585,2007.67,"--No question about it, is there?"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2007.67,2027.165,"--No question that this... I think virtually every state has spousal responsibility laws, which allow the state to force the contribution, an appropriate contribution from the wealthy spouse, if that's what it is, and to go into state courts and demand that contribution be provided; the same way a state can obtain a contribution from an absent father."
1980.80-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2027.165,2036.454,"My hypothetical was wealthy, even if not wealthy, whatever the other spouse has must be employed to--"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2036.454,2039.239,"Not whatever, the other spouse has to have sufficient income--"
1980.80-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2039.239,2040.223,--I see.
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2043.458,2044.175,--Exactly.
1980.80-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2045.477,2051.03,"But if there's enough for both it must be shared, is it?"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2051.03,2051.946,That's correct.
1980.80-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2062.036,2069.975,"Non-institutional, I guess, why do you make the difference between institutionalized and non institutionalized?"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2069.975,2071.444,--For purposes of support.
1980.80-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2089.238,2099.444,"What if they are separated first and then after the separation one of them becomes institutionalized and the other one has resources, those resources may be reached?"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2099.444,2102.413,"Through the state's judicial processes, that's correct."
1980.80-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2102.413,2129.497,"Well, isn't it true also that under the statute, 49 U.S.C. 1396a, Appendix H, in the petition for certiorari, these numbers and letters are kind of difficult to cope with, but Section 17(B) in the middle of the page of 35(a) says"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2168.858,2169.658,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.80-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2236.533,2244.056,--But what Congress said was that the Secretary shall issue regulations that shall define this--
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2244.056,2245.106,Shall define what is available.
1980.80-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2245.106,2261.434,"--distribution... and you, to say that spouses are placed in an impossible situation, may lead one court or this Court to conclude that the regulation is arbitrary or capricious or contrary to law."
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2270.024,2274.075,"That's correct, Your Honor; that is right in the statute, there's no dispute about that."
1980.80-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2288.318,2292.953,"Are you referring to the use of the term ""actually available""?"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2292.953,2294.572,"That's one instance, Your Honor."
1980.80-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2294.572,2303.011,But isn't that a term that could have so readily been put into the statute that if Congress intended that they would have said it?
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2303.011,2307.13,"I think Congress' thinking was that available meant ""actually available""."
1980.80-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2307.13,2308.815,"Well, how do we know that?"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2308.815,2312.2,"Well, because of other instances in the legislative history."
1980.80-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2319.037,2320.187,Where did they say that?
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2320.187,2322.056,In the same portion of the legislative history.
1980.80-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2322.056,2324.091,"Legislative history, not in the statute?"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2325.241,2327.726,"Not in the legislation itself, that's correct."
1980.80-756,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2327.726,2340.7,"But Mr. Deford, I think you have still another hurdle, because as I understood your opponent, he conceded for purposes of argument that even if the word ""actually"" could be considered to be a part of the statute, and it wouldn't change his basic argument."
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2347.454,2364.416,"I think the Department of Health and Human Services itself, has in some senses recognized what I believe most people would believe actually available and income in fact mean, which is income actually in the hands of, in the control of, the institutionalized spouse."
1980.80-756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2465.866,2468.985,Do you think there's a difference between in hand and available?
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2483.076,2483.762,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.80-756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2484.078,2486.278,You have to go through a little something to get it?
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2486.278,2496.402,"--Until that will... is probated, the income is not available or is certainly not in hand of the individual who might have access to it at some point later in the future."
1980.80-756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2496.402,2498.02,So there is a difference between the two?
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2498.02,2500.837,"There's a difference, but I think the Secretary--"
1980.80-756,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2500.837,2503.889,"Is it significant, that's what I want to know?"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2503.889,2518.918,"--Well I think the Secretary has understood that in this context, given the legislative history, Congress intended that available meant in hand, because it was the Secretary who repeatedly interpreted the word ""available"" to mean in hand or under the control of the applicant spouse."
1980.80-756,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2518.918,2530.374,"May I ask you one other question while you are stopped, what is your view of the sort of standards he should write under Clause (b)?"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2539.829,2543.164,As to what the regulation should look like?
1980.80-756,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2543.164,2555.805,"Yes, what should... what kind of standards should he be writing to determine what income is available if he isn't adopting some rather arbitrary rules, saying well, if the husband makes 3X, why certain percentages--"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2555.805,2559.357,"I think the Secretary has, in fact, promulgated those regulations."
1980.80-756,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2580.684,2586.505,"--But if the statute means what you say, you didn't even need those regulations, it would have been obvious on the face of the statute."
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2586.505,2595.51,"Well I must say that the words ""actually available"" in the statute and the regulations, when I first read them, suggested to me that the Secretary was not, himself, following his own regulations."
1980.80-756,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2614.922,2619.059,"My question though, is directed at what do you think Congress meant?"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2635.485,2648.662,"--I can't think of an example off the top of my head, Your Honor, but I suppose there would be instances in which income might ultimately be considered available to someone and should be considered available, which that individual does not have."
1980.80-756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2719.473,2722.358,You're talking about the amicus brief--
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2722.358,2722.742,--I'm talking about--
1980.80-756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2722.742,2723.325,--There's more than one?
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2723.325,2723.725,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2723.725,2726.86,"You're talking about the one filed by John H. Ford, Lana Carter and others?"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2726.86,2727.543,That's correct.
1980.80-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2800.475,2811.114,"Well, are you claiming as the result of examples like that, that deeming is totally improper under the statute, or that a hearing has to be held in every case?"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2811.114,2839.783,"Claiming, Your Honor, that in order for the state to demand a payment from the spouse outside of an institution, if that spouse refuses to cooperate voluntarily, that the state would have to use its relative responsibility laws which the Medicaid statute specifically allows it to do in Clause (d) of subsection 17, and go into Court, and at that point a determination would be made as to what a reasonable contribution should be."
1980.80-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2839.783,2850.908,"Well, then what do you make of the subsection (b) of 17, where it says ""available"" in accordance with the regulations that the Secretary shall prescribe."
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2867.783,2874.873,"I think as a general rule, the Secretary obviously has a right to promulgate fairly general regulations."
1980.80-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2881.325,2884.277,"Well, why don't they ask Congress to change the law?"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2884.277,2887.629,"I don't know, Your Honor."
1980.80-756,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2895.401,2905.941,"What it does, Mr. Deford, on the very example you give... let me just be sure what your view is... your view is that under the statute the husband is entitled to be institutionalized, but the state could nevertheless bring a lawsuit against the spouse and--"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2905.941,2906.526,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1980.80-756,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2906.526,2909.477,--get an order requiring her to turn over $80 a month.
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2909.477,2910.01,I don't think--
1980.80-756,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2910.01,2913.096,"It may end up in the... economically in the same harsh position, is what you're saying?"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2913.096,2927.806,"--I don't think the state would be able to go into a state court of law and get a judge to order a woman whose income is only $240 a month to pay a third of that income to the institution, if that's going to force her to live in a sub poverty standard at living."
1980.80-756,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2931.824,2939.994,"But is the deeming... is it arbitrary then because it imposes a greater financial burden on the spouse than state law would impose, is that your argument?"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2939.994,2952.651,"--It's arbitrary in the sense that it is administratively convenient to the state, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist has pointed out, but that administrative convenience is far outweighed by the terrible burden it places on both spouses."
1980.80-756,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2954.753,2968.194,"Well, I was under a misapprehension, because I was under the impression that you were assuming that the Secretary could not deny the medical benefit to one spouse but would nevertheless have a remedy in state court to collect the $80 a month."
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2969.427,2975.098,"I'm saying that in many instances, the non institutionalized spouse would have sufficient income--"
1980.80-756,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2975.098,2979.719,"--Well, let's take the hard cases, let's take this very case."
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,2991.11,2997.096,--I'm saying that the state could go into court and might be able to get some money out of her.
1980.80-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3045.11,3057.602,Well do you think the federal statute places some limit on what a state court might do under your theory as to allowing recovery by the state from one spouse or another?
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,3057.602,3065.074,"No, the federal statute simply gives the state the right to use its responsibility laws for spouses."
1980.80-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3101.497,3110.853,"But in cases like Weinberger v. Salfi, we've said that the... you don't have to have an individualized determination in every cases."
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,3128.848,3136.404,"Well first, Your Honor, if I am not mistaken, Salfi was a statutory case; I think there was a statute which was challenged, not a regulation."
1980.80-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3147.628,3157.417,"But here, the statute says available as prescribed by the Secretary's regulations."
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,3164.423,3172.093,"--Your Honor, I think that is not only implicit, but explicit in everything Congress has said in the legislative history of this case, both by individuals--"
1980.80-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3172.093,3177.245,You are challenging... you are in effect challenging the statute here?
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,3177.245,3177.678,"--No, Your Honor."
1980.80-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3218.403,3226.242,"Then you don't distinguish between whether it is $500 a month or $5000 a month, that the spouse has, apparently?"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,3226.242,3237.9,"I don't distinguish, but I think in the great majority of cases, and I'd like to emphasize this, spouses do want to contribute to each other, they do not want to leave the other hanging in the nursing home and say, good luck."
1980.80-756,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3392.247,3409.775,"Mr. Deford, would you comment just very briefly on the government's second argument which, as I understand it, is that deeming is permitted under SSI and it's not realistic to assume Congress intended the 209(b) option to prohibit deeming if it is permitted in the more liberal option."
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,3409.775,3414.345,"Your Honor, I don't agree with the government's interpretation of 209(b) option."
1980.80-756,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3426.67,3428.705,Can I interrupt you just for one preliminary?
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,3431.374,3432.257,--No.
1980.80-756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3521.412,3524.364,"Well, you differ with government counsel as to--"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,3524.364,3525.647,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1980.80-756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3525.647,3528.916,"--what the statute says, don't you?"
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,3528.916,3530.601,The statute does not say anything about maximum eligibility levels.
1980.80-756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3532.468,3548.644,"Well it also says that an option state can go back to the regime that it administered from 1965 to 1972, if the dates are right."
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,3548.644,3552.046,--As long as it was in effect in 1972.
1980.80-756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3552.046,3554.147,"Yes, in '72, so long as it was lawful."
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,3563.937,3567.655,"That is the government's position, but the statute does not say that."
1980.80-756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3567.655,3568.838,And you disagree?
1980.80-756,1,25282,gill_de_ford,,3571.023,3577.277,The statute has no language about using the SSI rules as the most liberal which a state can use.
1980.80-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3579.963,3583.348,Very well.
1980.80-756,2,25538,george_w_jones,,3590.034,3622.906,"The first point that I want to make in my three minutes is that Respondent's emphasis, one, the levels with the hypotheticals of Mrs. Ford or Mr. Ford, I guess, is inappropriate in this case because the level of benefits or the levels... or the amount of the contribution the state requires the spouse to make is not at issue in this case."
1980.80-756,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3774.788,3775.521,"Thank you, gentlemen."
