1993.92-1625,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,24.006,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 92-1625 the International Union, United Mine Workers of America v. John L. Bagwell."
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,25.007,29.311,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1625,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,125.674,140.036,"Mr. Gold, do you take the position that the defendant has to continue to have an opportunity to avoid payment of the fine in order for it to be classified as civil?"
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,140.036,144.646,--We think that that is--
1993.92-1625,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,144.646,149.432,"Is that a hard and fast test, in your view, of this case?"
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,149.432,165.704,--We think that that is one of the underlying points which leads to what we understand to be the basic point when you're dealing with fines and imprisonment.
1993.92-1625,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,165.704,168.495,But it's your position that that's a requirement.
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,168.495,169.146,Yes.
1993.92-1625,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,169.146,171.298,How can that ever be coercive?
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,177.612,257.946,"The... when I say that it has to be avoidable, what it... what I understand the cases to say is that in a situation in which a fine or a... an imprisonment is imposed in order to coerce an act, where that is done to coerce a discrete affirmative act, there is a sense in which the individual has... to use the phrase which runs from the beginning and the... to the end of these cases, has the keys to the prison or the... to his own strongbox in his hands, in a way which is different from the situation in which there is a prohibition and an alleged violation of the prohibition."
1993.92-1625,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,268.801,274.295,"Well, if your response is that it also depends upon whether it's mandatory or prohibitory--"
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,274.295,274.915,Yes.
1993.92-1625,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,274.915,281.71,--I suppose in this case there were both types of things involved.
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,281.71,292.138,"Yes, and in that... in that sense, Justice O'Connor, the first of the arguments we make is first because it raises the larger, more general question."
1993.92-1625,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,303.675,318.124,"Well, in this case, this very case, do you say that the fines could be imposed insofar as they applied to those things that the union was asked to do separate and apart from violent acts?"
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,318.124,318.956,Yes.
1993.92-1625,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,318.956,319.747,Uh-hum.
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,319.747,320.736,Yes.
1993.92-1625,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,365.536,366.127,Mr. Gold--
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,381.227,402.682,"The opinion in Gompers talks about the rules being rules of constitutional import having to do with, as the phrase in the case, substantive rights and constitutional privileges."
1993.92-1625,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,471.278,483.883,"So you think that the Constitution enjoins a distinction between the mandatory provisions of an injunction and the, you know, prohibitive, prohibitory."
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,487.917,500.015,--I can only judge by our understanding of the words in the U.S. reports.
1993.92-1625,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,518.256,525.641,"But isn't it a fact, Mr. Gold, that a court can turn anything from mandatory into prohibitory just by a matter of phrasing?"
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,525.641,531.524,"I... well, two... two points on that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-1625,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,558.031,569.709,"Mr. Gold, in that respect, are you saying... are you saying that a stop order can never be enforced except through a criminal contempt process."
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,569.709,570.66,"No, Your--"
1993.92-1625,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,570.66,576.685,There were examples given by your opponent for... in the brief.
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,600.19,606.034,"--Two... two points, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-1625,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,691.96,692.852,"Mr. Gold, are you--"
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,693.823,695.293,Well--
1993.92-1625,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,695.293,697.336,Wasn't that a fine per day?
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,697.336,709.263,--I'm not familiar with the particulars of the Patco orders.
1993.92-1625,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,709.263,725.965,"Well, do you take the position that if the order... an appropriate order is issued not to strike, which is, in effect, to continue to work, that that cannot be enforced with a coercive and still civil fine for each day in which they refuse to return?"
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,725.965,728.556,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1625,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,733.159,734.06,You take... I'm sorry.
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,740.464,741.175,--Correct.
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,741.175,743.987,"Suppose the judge says, go back to work instead of, stop striking?"
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,746.198,749.771,The... I think the answer is no.
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,749.771,751.091,Why?
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,753.712,761.879,The underlying point is prohibitory.
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,765.489,766.09,Why do you say that?
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,779.56,794.03,"--The... I think it makes sense in terms of the underlying theory of the distinction, Justice Scalia."
1993.92-1625,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,866.398,881.259,"Well, Mr. Gold, is doesn't seem to me that the mandatory prohibitory distinction upon which you seem to think the whole case turns has any underlying connection with the constitutional values that are at stake here."
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,909.557,923.897,"--Well, I think the argument for this distinction is very much like the Churchillian argument for democracy; it is superior to the alternatives."
1993.92-1625,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,923.897,926.848,"Mr. Gold, does your... does your case rest on this?"
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,930.691,935.596,Our first argument most definitely rest on what would--
1993.92-1625,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,935.596,939.938,But suppose... suppose we reject this distinction between not doing and doing.
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,941.671,966.599,"--In terms of our first argument, we are left with nothing other than the complete lack of any principle differentiating content in the standard applied by the Virginia courts and urged by the respondents."
1993.92-1625,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1036.425,1051.256,"If the Court is unwilling to draw a line between acting and not acting, what is the remainder of your argument on why these particular fines should be classed criminal?"
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1051.256,1107.623,"--Our view is that if that line is rejected, then you have to go to the highest level distinction, which is the distinction between proceedings which are to vindicate the authority of the courts and the law, versus proceedings which are to provide a definite unique benefit to the plaintiff that is, in a real sense, different from the overall effort to maintain peace and social value."
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1107.623,1109.305,Ex ante or ex post?
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1130.63,1133.321,I--
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1133.321,1136.032,You could say at that point there's nothing left but vindication of the court.
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1136.032,1146.769,"--I think that, far better than I've been able to do so far, that exposes the nature of the problem."
1993.92-1625,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1278.186,1281.479,"Well, what you speak of as the single individual is, in fact, the court."
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1312.197,1325.107,"The history of the doctrine, to date, has been, as we understand it, precisely the opposite, Justice Souter."
1993.92-1625,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1335.244,1338.205,"Oh, I will grant you that it does create grave risks."
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1354.165,1357.788,--I'd like to move on to the second argument.
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1388.218,1389.56,Can I ask you a question about the second question?
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1389.56,1390.251,--Absolutely.
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1390.251,1412.253,"Is it your position that despite all of the characteristics which exist that you say would make this a criminal proceeding, it can be converted into a civil proceeding so long as the State court announces when it's imposes, of course, you know, even if you violate these orders and incur liability for the fines, you'll be able to settle?"
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1422.833,1434.009,"The... that characterization, I think, is... of the process is the respondents'."
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1479.73,1480.361,And vice versa.
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1484.264,1485.794,We would not--
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1485.794,1488.408,"Or if you say A, you have to say B, Mr. Gold, don't you?"
1993.92-1625,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1488.408,1508.08,"--Well, we would say that any case... we would say that any case in which the plaintiff can waive... let me just put it in these terms."
1993.92-1625,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1524.92,1529.274,"Thank you, Mr. Gold."
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1531.054,1534.496,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1625,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1578.675,1588.522,"Mr. Roberts, if the fines hadn't been prospective, then the enforcement of the injunction would have had to have been through a criminal process with a jury trial."
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1588.522,1589.761,--If the--
1993.92-1625,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1589.761,1592.133,But everything turned on specifying the fee schedule.
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1592.133,1593.996,"--In general, I think that's correct."
1993.92-1625,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1600.24,1603.282,What are the constitutional values that are served by that distinction?
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1603.282,1614.201,"--The constitutional values that are served is that your... the Bill of Rights protections that the union is saying it wasn't granted are applicable only in a criminal proceeding, one brought to punish."
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1625.106,1629.5,"Well, why has it become... why has it become coercive just because you name the amount of money?"
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1641.707,1642.228,It's not--
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1642.228,1643.389,"I mean they're both coercive, it seems to me."
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1643.389,1646.231,"--Well, they do have general coercive aspects."
1993.92-1625,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1668.679,1675.194,"But the only difference is he makes a speech to the defendant, as opposed, in effect, to deeming that the defendant knows the criminal law."
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1675.194,1675.903,No--
1993.92-1625,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1675.903,1678.695,That seems to me a totally formalistic distinction.
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1678.695,1684.578,"--It's not a formalistic distinction, Your Honor, in this respect; the general criminal law does have deterrent effect."
1993.92-1625,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1709.596,1717.52,"I see... I see it's narrowing, but I'm not sure why its narrowing makes it coercive, and I don't see what the extra element of coercion is."
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1717.52,1721.835,"Well, the extra element starts, first, with the fact that there's been a violation of the injunction already."
1993.92-1625,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1734.304,1735.162,Sure.
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1752.546,1756.416,"Well, the distinction is the same one that the Court has drawn between civil and criminal statutes."
1993.92-1625,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1774.319,1775.361,"Mr. Roberts, can I ask just one other question."
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1782.217,1787.318,"Imprisonment has not been used traditionally, Your Honor, in the sense of--"
1993.92-1625,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1787.318,1787.849,I understand.
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1789.641,1791.703,--That the imprisonment may well not be valid.
1993.92-1625,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1824.584,1832.421,"So in a domestic relations case, a judge can say that for every time you go near the wife's house in violation of this order, I'll fine you $500."
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1832.421,1841.597,"--If... adding one feature that I think... again, that is present in this case and confirms the remedial aspect, which is there has been violations of a prior order."
1993.92-1625,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1848.994,1860.541,"Well, what's... is the basis for that distinction just to vindicate the authority of the court as opposed to bringing the dispute to an orderly focus before the court?"
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1876.783,1881.544,"Not simply to vindicate the court's authority, but to remedy the problem before the court."
1993.92-1625,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1891.771,1894.054,"Mr. Roberts, why don't we take the court at its word?"
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1918.781,1921.252,"--Two... a very important distinction, Your Honor."
1993.92-1625,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1958.888,1965.23,"But doesn't that show, if there was ambiguity before, what the court conceived the character of these fines to be?"
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1965.23,1965.911,"--No, Your--"
1993.92-1625,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1965.911,1973.238,It says I'm not vacating... the court says we're not vacating these fines because they relate to the dignity of the court.
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1973.238,1985.624,"--No, it's... the trial court quite clearly spelled out... and they're set forth in our brief... whenever he imposed these sanctions, that this is civil contempt, it is to get you to comply, if you comply you will not incur any fines whatever."
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2015.453,2016.224,Mr.--
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2016.224,2020.008,That doesn't retroactively change the character of the sanctions when they were announced.
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2020.008,2030.804,"--Mr. Roberts, the answer you gave to Justice Stevens a little earlier about an order that imposes imprisonment instead of fines prospectively, it seems to me to stand history on its head."
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2051.417,2051.978,Certainly.
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2054.699,2055.44,I said very early.
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2068.4,2068.9,--I don't--
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2068.9,2075.985,"And yet you told Justice Stevens, well, if prospectively you put him in jail it's obviously bad, although prospectively you can fine him and that's just civil."
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2083.271,2089.096,"--Well, I don't disagree with you that the classic case is putting someone in jail until they comply with the court's order."
1993.92-1625,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2097.251,2103.625,Was the reason for that the necessity of coercing corporate defendants as opposed to individuals?
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2103.625,2111.179,"--It's certainly a significant factor, although perhaps the judge could have put the union leaders in jail until the union complied with his order."
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2141.369,2156.96,Do you know of any early... the early cases in the development of this civil contempt at common law in which what the person in jail was required to do before he could get out was something very... maybe there's no way it could have been something very complex.
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2172.529,2174.101,"No, I don't think the distinction is--"
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2174.101,2178.192,"Because it was simple to tell, whereas where the... whether this has been violated or not is very difficult to tell."
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2179.343,2185.658,"--No, I don't think the distinction has always been whether it was something easy to do or hard to do, and it's certainly not that difficult to tell."
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2187.328,2188.96,"Easy to determine, not necessarily easy to do."
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2190.17,2202.899,"--Well, it was easy to determine in this case, because the one thing this circuit court judge and his counterpart in the Federal court who was addressing the same situation, both concluded is that the union leadership had complete control over the conduct of the strikers."
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2207.892,2209.484,Whether there had been any violence?
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2213.725,2216.269,--The question is not violence--
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2216.269,2220.751,"In the old common law, the classic case, the judge says here's the document, Your Honor, let me out of jail."
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2227.926,2228.487,"--Well, there--"
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2228.487,2229.526,What's the judge going to do?
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2230.828,2231.659,--And he did.
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2235.861,2237.774,That didn't have to be done in the old common law.
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2237.774,2238.151,Well--
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2238.151,2242.546,When you threw somebody in jail until he coughed up the key or signed a document or delivered a document.
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2242.546,2249.13,--I don't know that the old common law had a situation where there was such widespread organized flouting of a court injunction.
1993.92-1625,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2274.206,2275.538,"Well, Mr. Roberts, that's not quite right."
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2283.852,2284.513,That's correct.
1993.92-1625,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2284.513,2286.985,"Now, that sort of thing, you could tell whether the man was there or not."
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2286.985,2288.557,"Well, yes, Your Honor, that's right."
1993.92-1625,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2294.1,2297.353,"That... those penalties for that sort of thing are not at issue here, are they?"
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2297.353,2303.647,"--Well, not from what my brother has said this morning, I gather they're not, no, because they meet his affirmative prohibitory test."
1993.92-1625,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2304.056,2317.757,"As I understand it, the penalties are for things like somebody threw a rock, and the union says it was a stranger or he didn't have authority to do it or he was violating orders or something like that which, as Justice Scalia suggests, requires some kind of a evidentiary hearing, discovery, to find out whether it happened."
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2323.459,2325.139,--Let me... let me clarify my answer to your earlier question.
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2334.406,2335.197,"Oh, I was going to ask that."
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2341.852,2342.421,Well--
1993.92-1625,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2342.421,2343.853,"That is, those were settled out of it."
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2343.853,2345.112,"--Well, then let me talk about part two."
1993.92-1625,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2368.149,2376.724,"Mr. Roberts, why would somebody regard that as going to mootness instead of revealing what the character of these proceedings were?"
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2396.118,2402.373,"--Well, the Gompers Court, in considering the same question in the Federal context, analyzed it in mootness terms."
1993.92-1625,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2470.277,2478.432,"Well, Mr. Roberts, it was, of course, raised in their application to the State court."
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2488.239,2488.9,Well--
1993.92-1625,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2488.9,2492.962,Has this Court ever said the Excessive Fines Clause is incorporated?
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2492.962,2493.733,--It has not.
1993.92-1625,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2494.384,2495.663,And do you think we should?
1993.92-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2497.786,2500.825,--The question was specifically left open in Browning Ferris.
1993.92-1625,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2522.04,2524.912,"Thank you, Mr. Roberts."
1993.92-1625,1,37685,paul_bender,,2526.253,2536.361,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1625,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2582.5,2583.76,"Well then, what are those rules?"
1993.92-1625,1,37685,paul_bender,,2588.715,2591.997,"I think it's a matter of due process and I think it is procedural, yes."
1993.92-1625,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2625.217,2627.48,"Well, Mr. Bender, let me interrupt you for a moment."
1993.92-1625,1,37685,paul_bender,,2652.156,2662.082,"It may not be, and it may be that any time a judge announces that he is proceeding by way of civil contempt and that the penalties are going to be imposed civilly, that that's constitutional."
1993.92-1625,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2662.823,2665.284,"Well, is it just a matter of how the judge characterizes it?"
1993.92-1625,1,37685,paul_bender,,2670.137,2671.569,--Yes.
1993.92-1625,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2681.095,2683.367,How about describing what falls on the other side of the line when--
1993.92-1625,1,37685,paul_bender,,2683.367,2687.678,"Well, essentially, what falls on the other side of the line are prohibitory, if there is another side of the line."
1993.92-1625,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2699.216,2712.114,"--Well, what do you with the old distinction between a judge can act on the spot if a contempt is committed in the judge's presence, but if it's not in the judge's presence, then it has to be enforced through a criminal procedure?"
1993.92-1625,1,37685,paul_bender,,2712.114,2712.896,--I think even--
1993.92-1625,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2712.896,2715.507,"Do we wipe that out and say if the judge calls it civil, it's civil?"
1993.92-1625,1,37685,paul_bender,,2715.507,2720.79,--My own view is that there is a core of contempt which must be treated criminally.
1993.92-1625,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2734.999,2738.332,So your definition of criminal contempt is an act that's malum in se?
1993.92-1625,1,37685,paul_bender,,2738.332,2739.504,"No, it's not a definition."
1993.92-1625,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2740.973,2742.646,Is there a definition of criminal contempt?
1993.92-1625,1,37685,paul_bender,,2742.646,2750.539,"--Yeah, and I think it is... I think it's better to put it the other way around, that there are at least two categories of cases--"
1993.92-1625,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2750.539,2751.15,"Well, we'll take it either way."
1993.92-1625,1,37685,paul_bender,,2751.15,2751.979,--All right.
1993.92-1625,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2843.292,2852.618,"So the Board, in effect, can do just what you were saying or suggesting the judge might be able to do at the beginning, and that is to say we're telling you right now that when we coerce, it's civil coercion."
1993.92-1625,1,37685,paul_bender,,2856.091,2858.151,"Congress' labeling, I think, clearly is sufficient."
1993.92-1625,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2865.017,2872.492,"What if... what if a judge announces this labeling and he says, look, I'm not going to mix myself up in this labor dispute or this custody dispute."
1993.92-1625,1,37685,paul_bender,,2897.548,2902.873,I think it clearly is in a situation where the legislature has said that that's the way the Government wants to proceed.
1993.92-1625,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2902.873,2905.615,Even though there's nothing... nothing left to converse... to coerce.
1993.92-1625,1,37685,paul_bender,,2905.615,2906.424,Yes.
1993.92-1625,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2908.457,2926.549,"Mr. Bender, there... there are scholars who think that that was a great mistake, our line of decisions which allowed administrative agencies, at the direction of Congress or not, to avoid the right to jury trial by imposing civil crime... so-called civil penalties."
1993.92-1625,1,37685,paul_bender,,2936.186,2938.528,I don't think you do either to a creation by a district judge.
1993.92-1625,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2949.306,2953.269,"Mr. Bender, suppose the State didn't have the civil party in this case."
1993.92-1625,1,37685,paul_bender,,2967.999,2986.98,"I think the State could do what the Federal Government has done and decide to deal with that kind of a behavior in a strike situation civilly rather than criminally, and pass a statute authorizing a State agency, and I think authorizing the agency to go to court for enforcement of its orders, to operate civilly rather than criminally, because that's the kind of thing where that choice is available."
1993.92-1625,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2997.866,3006.702,"Since he didn't have a statutory regime like that, the characterization of this case as civil, then, depends on the existence of a civil party."
1993.92-1625,1,37685,paul_bender,,3006.702,3008.474,--Yes.
1993.92-1625,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3008.474,3018.72,"And if that's so, then when the civil party departs and says I'm through, then how can the State continue to maintain that it's civil?"
1993.92-1625,1,37685,paul_bender,,3018.72,3028.788,"The government can be a civil party, and the State in this case, or the judge in this case treated... and so did the Virginia Supreme Court, treated the governments, the county and the State, as being parties to the case."
1993.92-1625,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3047.17,3050.532,A real party in interest or the... the State isn't named as a party.
1993.92-1625,1,37685,paul_bender,,3050.532,3051.163,--That's true.
1993.92-1625,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3074.816,3079.08,And our model of constitutionality is going to be civil fines by administrative agencies.
1993.92-1625,1,37685,paul_bender,,3079.08,3082.843,"That is a constitutional way of using civil contempt, yes."
1993.92-1625,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3099.653,3100.164,"Thank you, Mr. Bender."
1993.92-1625,2,34494,laurence_e_gold,,3103.047,3104.228,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1993.92-1625,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3135.69,3146.206,"The Labor Board doesn't have to announce in advance what the fines will be, which is, assertedly, what distinguishes this and makes it civil contempt, right?"
1993.92-1625,2,34494,laurence_e_gold,,3149.939,3150.66,--Right.
1993.92-1625,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3151.569,3153.031,"And that's what we're going to extend to district judges, I assume."
1993.92-1625,2,34494,laurence_e_gold,,3153.031,3196.251,"--Well, beyond that... that point, with which I agree insofar as it's a debater's point rather than a prediction, the fact of the matter is that 100 people could disagree which way you deter most effectively: by saying, as Justice Souter did, if you do what I have prohibited you from doing, there will be very serious penalties, or saying the maximum penalty would be $100,000."
1993.92-1625,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3290.451,3291.212,"Thank you, Mr. Gold."
