1983.82-374,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.592,We will hear arguments next in Flanagan v. United States.
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,13.402,15.51,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-374,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,233.702,236.716,How do we know all this?
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,236.716,243.496,"These facts, Your Honor, did not come out during the course of the District Court proceedings."
1983.82-374,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,248.494,249.932,But they have never been found by anybody.
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,249.932,252.649,"They have never been found, but I do not believe they are disputed by anyone."
1983.82-374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,252.649,255.71,"Well, they are disputed by the indictment surely."
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,255.71,256.914,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1983.82-374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,256.914,258.132,They are disputed by the indictment.
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,263.473,267.83,But there are no inculpatory facts which the clients represent.
1983.82-374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,269.548,276.623,"I understand, but I do not think... You must assume the possibility that there is some evidence of guilt that will surface sooner or later."
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,276.623,302.691,"No, I must assume the possibility with all due respect that there may be evidence which the government believes demonstrates wrongdoing, but I need not assume that there will be evidence of guilt nor need I assume in making my determination as to whether or not I can represent all four that anything they tell me is incorrect unless I have something to present me with a doubt."
1983.82-374,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,328.727,333.992,At some time are you going to discuss the question of whether this order was appealable?
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,333.992,337.146,I would be happy to discuss that right now.
1983.82-374,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,337.146,338.803,At your own time.
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,338.803,341.286,Let me turn to it very quickly.
1983.82-374,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,471.561,480.588,"Well, I suppose if some per se reversal rule were adopted you would not have difficulty."
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,480.588,499.94,"That is what the Ninth Circuit said in Greger, Justice O'Connor, and I do have a difficulty with per se reversal because there is too much which can occur during the course of a trial which is not reversable."
1983.82-374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,598.37,617.565,"Mr. Rubenstone, the Cobbledick case says that the policy especially in criminal cases is against piecemeal appeals, and there is no doubt that an appeal like this first in the court of appeals and conceivably here if certiorari is granted does delay the start of the criminal trial."
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,617.565,626.046,"Yes, especially if, as has occurred in this case, the District Court entered a stay."
1983.82-374,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,648.818,664.984,"Mr. Rubenstone, are there any cases to your knowledge in which a Faretta situation if a defendant is denied the opportunity to represent himself for whatever reason that that has been held to be immediately appealable on an interlocutory basis?"
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,664.984,674.198,"I am not aware of any, Your Honor, but I would imagine that if a state--"
1983.82-374,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,674.198,677.057,Would that be a similar situation?
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,677.057,677.619,--I would think so.
1983.82-374,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,685.912,703.296,"No, well let's say he wanted to represent himself and for whatever reason the court determined, for instance, he was not capable of doing it and appointed counsel and the defendant insisted on an interlocutory appeal on that question."
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,703.296,711.573,"--Well, what I am saying is really just the flip side of the Gideon situation where the government does not comply with Gideon."
1983.82-374,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,728.098,729.441,But you have found no case?
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,729.441,729.801,No.
1983.82-374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,729.801,739.563,But your suggestion in response to Justice O'Connor that if there is a constitutional right involved there must be a right to an interlocutory appeal certainly is not supported by our cases.
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,739.563,739.766,No.
1983.82-374,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,774.767,783.295,You do not think one of the criteria for immediate appeal is that the issue would not otherwise be reviewable?
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,783.295,788.324,"I am sorry, Your Honor, I do believe."
1983.82-374,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,788.324,800.882,"Well, certainly if the criminal trial had gone on and there had been no appeal you could still have raised the issue and had the issue reviewed at the end of the... at least the defendant could have."
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,800.882,802.382,The defendant--
1983.82-374,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,802.382,807.208,The defendant could have if he had been convicted in an appeal.
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,814.314,815.282,"--Of course, he can."
1983.82-374,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,818.046,820.655,"Well, if he was right there would be a new trial."
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,820.655,836.242,"--Well, but there has been no decision that I am aware of other than the Ninth Circuit decision that says that if you prove that the denial of counsel of choice was erroneous you are automatically entitled to a new trial."
1983.82-374,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,853.516,864.435,My question really was do you think that it is one of the criteria for immediate appeal that the issue that you want to appeal is not otherwise reviewable?
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,864.435,872.462,--It is hard to answer that question directly so let me try it this way.
1983.82-374,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,872.462,876.43,"Well, you went quite a ways toward answering just a minute ago."
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,878.992,882.506,The Cohen court does not say otherwise reviewable.
1983.82-374,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,901.762,913.618,You think if there is any real doubt about your ability to get a new trial even if you show that your right had been denied that it is not effectively reviewable?
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,913.618,913.821,Absolutely.
1983.82-374,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,932.251,936.248,Is your position grounded in the Constitution?
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,937.655,941.012,"--Which position, Your Honor?"
1983.82-374,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,941.012,948.446,The position that you should have been entitled... that your client should have been entitled to joint representation?
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,948.446,949.025,Absolutely.
1983.82-374,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,949.025,951.305,Is it in the Sixth Amendment?
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,951.305,953.164,"I find it in the Sixth Amendment, Your Honor."
1983.82-374,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,953.164,955.523,Sixth.
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,963.098,964.801,I believe that the Sixth Amendment--
1983.82-374,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,964.801,965.738,Or just to have counsel?
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,965.738,983.605,"--No, I believe that the Sixth Amendment... Inherent in the Sixth Amendment if not implicit and inherent in our society is the right of an individual defendant to select who he wishes to represent him in a criminal trial."
1983.82-374,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,983.605,986.168,What did Faretta decide?
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,989.697,993.367,Faretta decided that the individual had the right to represent himself.
1983.82-374,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,993.367,994.945,Based on what provision?
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,994.945,997.585,Based upon the Sixth Amendment assistance of counsel clause.
1983.82-374,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,997.585,1004.456,We have not given indigent defendants a right to select their own lawyer have we?
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,1004.456,1008.689,"I do not think you have to give it to them, Your Honor."
1983.82-374,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1009.892,1026.557,"We have not recognized the right of an indigent defendant to select a nonpublic defender, for example, or even in the private sector a lawyer of the defendant's choice that the public will pay for."
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,1032.32,1045.018,"That is correct but I think there are different considerations, the consideration being that here you are imposing upon the state and in imposing upon the state your rights are going to be limited."
1983.82-374,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1051.704,1055.749,"Well, you were speaking of it as though it was a right to choose."
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,1055.749,1057.06,--It is a right to choose.
1983.82-374,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1107.618,1115.912,You have not mentioned the First Amendment.
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,1117.771,1135.139,"Well, I would be willing to take any help I can get, and if freedom of association fits into this, Your Honor... I do not really see the application in as clear a sense as I do the Sixth Amendment."
1983.82-374,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1176.824,1195.566,"Well, Mr. Rubenstone, getting back to the interlocutory appeal question have we not normally treated violations of a Sixth Amendment right or even a due process right as being in criminal cases not reviewable by way of interlocutory appeal?"
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,1195.566,1209.858,"Yes, but I do not believe that any of those decisions, for example, the denial of the jury trial or the denial of proper notice has the same kind of irreversible impact that denial of counsel has."
1983.82-374,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1283.125,1295.87,Would this foreclose a later claim that he should not have been permitted to do what you suggest by him if he wound up with a conviction?
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,1295.87,1300.524,Would it foreclose a collateral attack on the conviction?
1983.82-374,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1318.112,1331.481,Even if he came in and said that his counsel did not make a complete disclosure and he did not understand what he was doing and the trial judge should have conducted a hearing to determine whether that was a sound decision?
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,1331.481,1337.354,"My answer, Your Honor, was with regard to the fact that there was a hearing."
1983.82-374,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1355.627,1358.938,Without the hearing would your position be the same?
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,1358.938,1359.86,No.
1983.82-374,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1361.39,1376.275,You mean the judge must conduct a hearing before he can in effect intervene between the defendant or defendants and his or their choice of counsel?
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,1376.275,1385.005,In the federal system as I read Rule 44 the judge must conduct a hearing in any case of multiple representation.
1983.82-374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1388.707,1402.671,"May I ask, Mr. Rubenstone... I take it you are ready to go to the merits now?"
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,1402.671,1402.92,Yes.
1983.82-374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1402.92,1415.9,Supposing if while the trial is in progress some evidence comes out that persuades you that one of your clients was lying to you... Sometimes we are all disillusioned by our clients.
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,1434.22,1444.077,"I believe, Your Honor, that if an actual conflict of interest arises at any point in the proceeding I have an absolute obligation to withdraw from representing that client."
1983.82-374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1452.651,1456.18,Let's leave out the first half of my suggestion.
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,1467.098,1473.283,"--I believe that I misspoke myself just a moment ago, and I did not mean to go as far as I did."
1983.82-374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1507.191,1510.517,On whom would the client rely for advice?
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,1510.517,1518.685,"--I would have to advise the client to get separate counsel to represent him, and I would make myself available to him to relate to him any nonprivileged information I might have."
1983.82-374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1540.599,1543.833,How about the first half of my question?
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,1551.282,1558.779,"Well, Your Honor, I do not mean to quibble, but I am not sure what you mean by greater exposure."
1983.82-374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1558.779,1570.916,"Well, there is a pretty good chance he will be found guilty and there is a pretty good chance the others would be not guilty and you can assure it by taking a plea of some kind or getting the charges dismissed against one if he would fill out the facts with respect to--"
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,1570.916,1578.834,I believe I would be under an obligation to advise him of my analysis and to advise him that he has to get separate counsel to have those discussions with the government.
1983.82-374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1582.692,1589.407,--So it is entirely possible that in this case the facts may develop later on in which you might have to withdraw?
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,1589.407,1590.173,There is no question.
1983.82-374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1607.541,1610.445,But your answer... The solution is to meet them when they arise?
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,1610.445,1610.945,--Absolutely.
1983.82-374,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1674.092,1683.12,"Mr. Rubenstone, why is it do you suppose that the government would take such an active role in trying to seek disqualification?"
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,1701.752,1716.512,It is clear to me from my experience that where defendants are jointly represented there is a lesser likelihood that any of them will break away and plead.
1983.82-374,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1716.512,1718.776,And turn state's evidence?
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,1718.776,1719.135,Absolutely.
1983.82-374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1787.437,1788.14,Let me ask you--
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,1837.762,1846.493,I have no problem in seeing a district court enter a disqualification order where there is a demonstrated conflict.
1983.82-374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1846.493,1857.396,So what we are talking about here is really what this record showed as respecting whether there was a demonstrated conflict or whether the standard is potential conflict?
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,1857.396,1857.818,Right.
1983.82-374,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1931.631,1936.129,"Your time has expired now, counsel."
1983.82-374,0,23014,edward_h_rubenstone,,1936.129,1937.565,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1983.82-374,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1937.565,1938.003,Mr. Frey.
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1938.003,1945.422,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2099.218,2100.827,"Mr. Frey, may I ask you this?"
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2130.3,2135.595,"--Well, Justice O'Connor asked that of my colleague, and I think the answer is clearly that would not be appealable."
1983.82-374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2189.199,2215.189,Do you think if there had been a trial here and the trial judge denied... if he did just the reverse and held the trial and there was a conviction and appeal and one of the issues was he should have been entitled to joint representation and the Court of Appeals decided exactly... The Court of Appeals said there should have been--
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2215.189,2218.688,Should not have been disqualification.
1983.82-374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2218.688,2219.188,--Yes.
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2220.017,2220.579,"Well, I--"
1983.82-374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2220.579,2222.39,Would there have been automatically a new trial?
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2222.39,2229.185,--Our argument in this Court is that there would not automatically be a new trial.
1983.82-374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2240.335,2246.536,"Well, does that not mean then that the issue really is not effectively appealable after--"
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2246.536,2251.893,--That is true of any pretrial ruling that turns out not to have been prejudicial.
1983.82-374,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2259.329,2264.092,"--Well, it may not be effectively reviewable on appeal, Mr. Frey."
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2286.208,2290.143,"I would I think favor the opposite, the result."
1983.82-374,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2307.965,2313.4,Is the appealability not a factor in part of how you decide the merits?
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2323.35,2330.691,"That would be true although if it were a per se bar against disqualification, for instance, there would be no need for an interlocutory appeal."
1983.82-374,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2400.599,2414.64,--What is the government's motive since we are talking about motives here apparently?
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2420.169,2424.918,That is an obvious question in this situation.
1983.82-374,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2511.366,2522.348,"Well, it does make it easier in a case of codefendants to get a plea agreement out of one of them, does it not, if they are not represented by just one lawyer?"
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2522.348,2525.393,It may indeed be easier in some circumstances.
1983.82-374,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2532.203,2536.248,But it is a lot easier if you have one of them who has confessed and testifying against the other.
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2536.248,2538.136,"Yes, but it is rather odd."
1983.82-374,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2578.247,2593.069,"But, of course, if there has been a valid waiver what public interest is served by the failure to initiate a plea bargain on behalf of one defendant when his counsel does not recommend it?"
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2593.069,2617.511,"Well, the question is whether there is an interest that the courts may serve in not having unethical practice occurring in their courtroom, and the question is also whether the court has the power to protect the defendant who is not necessarily getting advice that is looking only to his interests."
1983.82-374,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2621.509,2636.113,"Yes, but I think to defend the order that was entered by the District Court here you would have to say that the District Court at any time it wants to is going to be able to disqualify an effort at joint representation because it makes plea bargaining less likely."
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2638.004,2659.104,"That was certainly not the basis of the disqualification order in this case and nobody has suggested that that is... That is simply pointed to by the authorities who have written on this subject as one of the problems that is associated with joint representation, but this case is not... The problem that the District Court saw had nothing to do with plea bargaining."
1983.82-374,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2663.696,2671.849,"--Mr. Frey, on the other hand the district judge here disqualified these lawyers from representing any of the four."
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2676.862,2691.061,"Well, assuming Flanagan was... I mean the surmise in your question was that Flanagan was the person whose interests they were principally protecting in this situation because he was the one who was in the most exposed position."
1983.82-374,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2691.061,2692.872,"Well, he was the one from whom the others--"
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2692.872,2707.569,"Sought to divorce themselves although there are also problems, for instance, with Landis because some of these charges involve dog attacks on the alleged victims and Landis was the officer who controlled the dog."
1983.82-374,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2802.905,2804.967,"--Mr. Frey, let me interrupt you right there if I may."
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2824.726,2829.863,That would raise a question in my mind only about the rule making power of the District Court.
1983.82-374,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2829.863,2831.738,Assume it is within the rule making power of the court.
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2832.456,2836.049,Let me make this point.
1983.82-374,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2865.974,2868.27,"Well, it does not go quite as far as the rule I proposed."
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2872.003,2893.261,If my hypothetical statute is constitutional then it seems to me difficult to say that a statute which has the force that goes so far as to say the judge shall make an inquiry but he can allow the multiple representation if it is demonstrated that there is no likelihood that a conflict will arise.
1983.82-374,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2893.261,2899.835,--Is it not true that there are some cases where you have four defendants and there is no conflict at all?
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2899.835,2904.115,"Well, the difficulty is that at the point of time at which--"
1983.82-374,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2904.115,2906.052,You then have to appoint four lawyers.
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2906.052,2910.581,"--For instance, that is the principle under the Criminal Justice Act."
1983.82-374,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2921.701,2924.606,"I at one time represented nine defendants, and I did not have any trouble."
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2924.606,2929.87,--There are cases in which it may happen.
1983.82-374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3044.09,3047.464,Are you going to get back to the appealability matter or not?
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3047.464,3048.166,Well--
1983.82-374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3048.166,3049.354,You hope so.
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3050.479,3055.711,"--I hope so, but if you prefer I am happy to--"
1983.82-374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3055.711,3058.552,You can do it on your own time.
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3060.582,3065.658,--My own time may not get me to it so let me get back to it now since you are interested in it.
1983.82-374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3065.658,3068.502,"Well, what if we agreed with you on nonappealability?"
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3070.782,3072.249,Vacate and remand.
1983.82-374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3072.249,3076.764,So there would be no decision on the merits in the Court of Appeals?
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3076.764,3078.529,There would be no decision on the merits in this case.
1983.82-374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3085.761,3087.51,Until later.
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3087.51,3089.54,"Until later, yes."
1983.82-374,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3089.54,3090.165,Because of conviction.
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3090.165,3092.242,"If there is a conviction, that is right."
1983.82-374,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3092.242,3103.518,"Mr. Frey, Rule 44 refers to conflict of interest without really defining it in any greater length."
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3124.994,3132.976,"No, I am not sure that that factor alone... There is much more than plea bargaining."
1983.82-374,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3136.911,3138.677,Because of your discussion of it.
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3141.128,3146.11,I was asked about that by Justice O'Connor which is why I discussed it.
1983.82-374,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3147.923,3149.687,Don't blame it on Mr. Frey.
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3150.781,3170.242,My opinion is that the rule gives the District Court broad discretion in a situation of joint representation and that it would be the extraordinary case in which an appellate court could find that disqualifying a lawyer in that circumstance would be an abuse of that discretion.
1983.82-374,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3196.574,3200.011,But that virtually rules out joint representation.
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3200.011,3202.806,"No, the District Court can permit joint representation."
1983.82-374,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3202.806,3208.538,But if the District Court said no you say the Court of Appeals should never reverse for an abuse of discretion.
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3208.538,3208.804,Rarely.
1983.82-374,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3208.804,3214.271,So any district court that wanted to just disqualify across the board would never reverse.
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3214.271,3224.22,After all the ethical propriety of joint representation is tenuous in the best of circumstances it seems to me.
1983.82-374,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3297.534,3303.468,What about four defendants above the indigency line but not too much above it?
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3315.104,3338.502,"Well, I do not think it is... From the standpoint of the clients they may have an interest in saving money, but I do not think when weighed against all of the other interests that are at stake that the court can assert that they have this constitutional right to conflict-ridden counsel which is the claim in this case."
1983.82-374,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3363.507,3364.631,"Well, there is no obstacle except human nature."
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3367.334,3374.112,"Well, human nature is, but part of the problem we are dealing with here is human nature in terms of what the position of these defendants is."
1983.82-374,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3399.087,3401.679,What sort of serious consequences?
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3401.679,3416.298,"Well, it can have fatal consequences because the lawyer is often nominally his lawyer but actually... As I say this is not this case at all but it is a class of circumstances that we have to be concerned about with he waiver."
1983.82-374,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3416.298,3428.855,"No one is saying there should never be disqualification in joint representation, but it seems to me the government's position it is fair to say there can never be joint representation if the district court says otherwise."
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3428.855,3446.38,It may come close to saying that if the district court... That is I think the decision that underlies Rule 44(c) which is designed not if a conflict actually exists but if there is any possibility or likelihood that a conflict will arise.
1983.82-374,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3496.704,3500.828,"Mr. Frey, what can the district judge to in this case?"
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3522.85,3556.29,"No, I suppose if the judge... I mean, my first reaction to that question is that the judge probably could not prevent that although he would then have to make special efforts to try to get them to explain or make sure that they understand that at least they can consult with a lawyer after which they may choose to go forward with their joint defense, but it would be quite strange for them to be even unwilling to talk to another lawyer."
1983.82-374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3603.882,3608.004,It might lead to some very severe problems of severance would it not?
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3608.004,3609.942,It might lead to severe problems of severance.
1983.82-374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3615.111,3616.048,Or a mistrial of the entire case.
1983.82-374,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3616.048,3617.063,Yes.
1983.82-374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3834.335,3835.273,"Thank you, gentlemen."
