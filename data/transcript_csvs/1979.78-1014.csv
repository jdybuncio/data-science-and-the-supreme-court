1979.78-1014,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,21.186,"We will hear arguments next in 78-1-14, United States v. Kubrick."
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,48.386,50.369,"Thank you, your Honor."
1979.78-1014,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,262.852,266.437,"And you say it is the event, do you?"
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,266.437,268.117,"No, we don't say it is the event, Your Honor."
1979.78-1014,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,279.272,283.444,The event of known injury.
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,283.444,285.683,"Knowledge of the known injury, yes, sir."
1979.78-1014,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,288.84,290.924,And the cause you would concede?
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,290.924,291.839,Yes.
1979.78-1014,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,291.839,293.443,Not whether or not there was negligence but --
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,293.443,293.955,Of course.
1979.78-1014,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,293.955,297.658,-- what art or episode was the causation.
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,297.658,298.129,Exactly.
1979.78-1014,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,303.598,304.344,Right.
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,304.344,305.945,-- we say that it accrues at that point.
1979.78-1014,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,305.945,313.304,"There is no issue in this case, is there, of concealment, fraudulent concealment or any other kind of concealment?"
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,313.304,323.343,"No, Your Honor, unless you assume that the VA's denial that neomycin caused it or their denial of liability --"
1979.78-1014,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,323.343,325.573,Is there any claim of concealment or fraudulent --
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,325.573,326.48,"No, I don't believe so."
1979.78-1014,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,348.242,349.735,They were not hiding anything from him.
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,349.735,350.336,"No, no."
1979.78-1014,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,527.935,529.42,Mrs. Stillman --
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,529.42,529.665,Yes.
1979.78-1014,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,529.665,533.216,"-- this ringing in the ears, is that when it happened?"
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,533.216,537.673,He had ringing in the ears and loss of -- some loss of hearing in June.
1979.78-1014,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,538.269,540.282,Is that when he knew?
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,540.282,544.258,"Well, we say that his claim ran from later than that."
1979.78-1014,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,559.861,564.972,And that diagnosis was by the same people he has got this case against.
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,564.972,569.452,"No, this diagnosis was by a private practitioner, an ear specialist."
1979.78-1014,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,569.452,573.177,"But he had been to the VA hospital, too, hadn't he?"
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,573.177,574.117,He went --
1979.78-1014,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,574.117,576.851,I thought he had this running letter business going.
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,576.851,581.803,"Well, he was writing the VA hospital for two years, denying --"
1979.78-1014,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,581.803,594.555,"Well, do you mean an average person would say that because I am getting older and I am getting deafer, so therefore neomycin is the cause of it?"
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,594.555,595.48,We would say --
1979.78-1014,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,595.48,597.439,Would that be normal?
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,597.439,606.011,This would be quite a different case if he had not consulted his doctor and then told that it was highly possible that the drug had caused his deafness.
1979.78-1014,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,606.011,607.738,Possible.
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,607.738,615.733,"Yes, but he then filed a claim in April stating that the VA medication had made his deaf and seeking benefits on that basis."
1979.78-1014,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,615.733,617.479,"And what did the VA say, that it had not."
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,617.479,620.892,VA denied it but he was never deterred by this denial.
1979.78-1014,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,620.892,621.118,That's right.
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,622.436,623.55,But he didn't.
1979.78-1014,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,623.55,630.809,"But that claim was not and did not have to be based on any negligence, did it?"
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,630.809,633.945,"It is not based on negligence, according to the tort standard."
1979.78-1014,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,648.029,648.402,If it had happened.
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,648.402,652.352,Whether or not doctors at that time should have known.
1979.78-1014,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,653.589,654.872,It is not the same as negligence.
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,654.872,658.85,"Not attributable to the tort standard, no, Your Honor."
1979.78-1014,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,676.99,682.713,How many courts of appeal are against you on this?
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,682.713,683.914,Well --
1979.78-1014,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,683.914,685.929,All but one?
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,685.929,699.238,"Among the courts of appeal that have cited this rule, the Sixth Circuit in Jordan, the Tenth Circuit in Exnicious, the Seventh Circuit in DeWitt, the Third Circuit in this case."
1979.78-1014,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,699.238,700.598,Who is with you?
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,700.598,726.732,"We say the Eighth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit are with us, Your Honor, but we would say that in fact the Kubrick case is the first case that really squarely presents this issue because Bridgford and some of those other cases can be understood as cases where the plaintiffs might have been confused about the nature of the injury and the connection with causation."
1979.78-1014,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,739.668,745.754,Did the government try to bring any of those cases that were against you here on cert?
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,745.754,768.29,"We have not tried to bring those cases, Your Honor, but I think this case presents the issue much more plainly because we have here so clear an acknowledgement that the person knew causation and it can't be interpreted in any way as a case that might come under a construction of the rule that the claim accrues at the time that you know injury and its cause."
1979.78-1014,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,768.29,778.091,How do you understand your opponents to apply the rule in terms of knew or should have known that it constituted malpractice?
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,783.399,797.371,"We understand them to be interpreting the rule rather broadly and we think that the courts below, although they claim that this had limits and was very narrow, we think that in fact it is really a very broad rule."
1979.78-1014,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,880.503,883.61,"Mrs. Stillman, let me just be sure about what you just now said."
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,899.027,902.782,"Well, it depends on how you characterize that."
1979.78-1014,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,916.081,916.49,"Well, you are asking --"
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,916.49,920.807,"-- court's finding that he didn't believe, but we can't attack --"
1979.78-1014,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,920.807,930.791,It is a finding of fact that was approved by the Court of Appeals and I thought we probably had to start with the assumption that he reasonably assumed there was no malpractice.
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,930.791,933.917,"I don't think we could accept the word ""reasonably,"" because --"
1979.78-1014,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,933.917,935.097,It is in the finding.
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,938.026,939.4,I think that is --
1979.78-1014,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,939.4,945.661,Page 29a of the appendix to the petition for writ of certiorari.
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,945.661,946.83,"Your Honor, I am aware --"
1979.78-1014,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,946.83,950.409,It is really quite important to know whether you are asking us to set aside a finding of fact or not.
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,950.409,954.366,"Well, if Your Honor regards that as a finding of fact, we are asking you to set it aside."
1979.78-1014,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,954.366,956.127,Why?
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,959.731,960.91,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1979.78-1014,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,960.91,965.008,"That as long as he knew that he was injured and causation, that is enough."
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,965.008,965.521,That is enough.
1979.78-1014,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,965.521,968.811,Whether he reasonably believed it was malpractice or not.
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,968.811,972.604,Perhaps there is a semantics problem here.
1979.78-1014,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,972.604,977.197,Does the record show that he knew he was given this neomycin?
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,977.197,980.105,"Oh, yes, Your Honor, there is no question about that."
1979.78-1014,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,980.105,981.2,Does the record show that?
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,981.2,982.841,"Yes, the record does."
1979.78-1014,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,983.207,984.079,Affirmatively?
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,986.898,995.236,"Well, in January of 1969, when he was told by Dr. Sataloff that neomycin --"
1979.78-1014,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,995.236,996.489,That wasn't my question.
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,999.47,1000.503,"Oh, at the time."
1979.78-1014,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1004.745,1008.541,"So how could he -- he couldn't have assumed it until somebody told him, could he?"
1979.78-1014,0,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1008.541,1014.693,"Your Honor, for that reason we say the statute did not start to run until the following January."
1979.78-1014,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1334.239,1336.493,"Thank you, Mrs. Stillman."
1979.78-1014,1,17771,benjamin_kuby,,1340.791,1345.747,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1014,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1386.233,1389.776,Did they change the statute of limitations at that time?
1979.78-1014,1,17771,benjamin_kuby,,1389.776,1401.993,"They changed the statute of limitations, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, at that time to a two-year statute of limitations but kept the word ""accrual."""
1979.78-1014,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1401.993,1403.23,As it was.
1979.78-1014,1,17771,benjamin_kuby,,1403.23,1404.943,As it was.
1979.78-1014,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1517.012,1520.124,"Well, he wasn't hard of hearing in the hospital, was he?"
1979.78-1014,1,17771,benjamin_kuby,,1520.124,1544.378,"He was not hard of hearing in the hospital but, Mr. Justice Stewart, that I would submit -- and there is no question about malpractice here, there is no question about negligence, goes to the issue of what they were doing for him and what he trusted them with."
1979.78-1014,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1544.378,1546.857,"Well, I just wasn't to be sure."
1979.78-1014,1,17771,benjamin_kuby,,1557.001,1557.701,"That's right, sir."
1979.78-1014,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1557.701,1570.025,-- and while he had previously been in the hospital they had done nothing and I wanted to be sure that I understood that there was no need to give him audio metric tests while he had previously been in the hospital because he wasn't hard of hearing.
1979.78-1014,1,17771,benjamin_kuby,,1570.025,1587.281,"Unfortunately, in the negligence aspects of the case, it became abundantly clear that it was necessary to give him audio metric tests when you are feeding someone neomycin which has ototoxic effects as well as neurotoxic effects."
1979.78-1014,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1587.281,1593.394,"I don't understand either one of those words, but how long does it take you to become hard of hearing?"
1979.78-1014,1,17771,benjamin_kuby,,1593.394,1599.079,"In this situation, it took a number of months before --"
1979.78-1014,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1599.079,1599.323,That is what I thought.
1979.78-1014,1,17771,benjamin_kuby,,1599.323,1601.179,-- it started to develop.
1979.78-1014,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1601.179,1601.811,That is what I thought.
1979.78-1014,1,17771,benjamin_kuby,,1601.811,1613.395,"In the Portis case, another case under the Federal Tort Claims Act, it took years to develop with the same drug."
1979.78-1014,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1613.395,1623.888,"Well, in both of those cases, they are not unlike Urie v. Thompson with the gradual development of silicosis are they?"
1979.78-1014,1,17771,benjamin_kuby,,1623.888,1625.942,For instance --
1979.78-1014,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1625.942,1637.098,"Well, the gradual onset, the long period of time in which it takes to develop the condition for which remedy is sought."
1979.78-1014,1,17771,benjamin_kuby,,1637.098,1637.374,Yes.
1979.78-1014,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1665.947,1682.982,But in Urie the court said in what seems to me quite a similar case that the inflicted employee can be held to be injured only when the accumulated effect of the deleterious substance manifests themselves.
1979.78-1014,1,17771,benjamin_kuby,,1700.526,1705.763,"Well, that was not, if I may submit, a malpractice case."
1979.78-1014,2,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2795.747,2808.539,"First, with respect to the Department of Defense regulation that was quoted from the Steel case, I would say that that is simply another way of stating the Quinton rule, and we would interpret either one the same way as consistent with the position we are taking here."
1979.78-1014,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2808.539,2822.44,"Well, I may not have heard it correctly, but as I understood that regulation, it was that the potential plaintiff has to discover the wrongful act --"
1979.78-1014,2,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2822.44,2826.207,It said when he has knowledge of the acts alleged to be wrongful.
1979.78-1014,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2826.207,2827.412,Alleged to be wrongful.
1979.78-1014,2,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2827.412,2838.192,"Well, the Quinton rule says when he discovers the acts constituting the malpractice, and we would interpret either one to mean when you discover the acts which turn out to be provable."
1979.78-1014,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2838.192,2840.504,I was just wondering if he had to have knowledge of the wrongfulness of the acts.
1979.78-1014,2,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2840.504,2841.123,Yes.
1979.78-1014,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2845.034,2858.374,How did this man find out that there was a possibility that he was given this drug in the wrong way?
1979.78-1014,2,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2858.374,2866.46,"Well, we say he was on notice to start finding out in January of 1969 or April of 1969 at the latest."
1979.78-1014,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2868.619,2872.545,On the basis of -- what put him on notice of that?
1979.78-1014,2,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2872.545,2878.827,Put him on notice simply because he went into the hospital and was harmed by a treatment and knew himself to have been harmed by the --
1979.78-1014,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2878.827,2881.137,So the best thing to do from now on --
1979.78-1014,2,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2881.137,2881.96,Is to consult --
1979.78-1014,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2881.96,2885.504,-- is to sue the day you come out.
1979.78-1014,2,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2885.504,2890.946,I don't think file suit but I think investigate the basis for a possible suit.
1979.78-1014,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2890.946,2898.701,You should investigate the possibility -- you assume that the medical authorities of the United States government are negligent?
1979.78-1014,2,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2898.701,2900.691,"No, we make no such assumption and we assume --"
1979.78-1014,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2900.691,2902.409,"Well, I don't think anybody should."
1979.78-1014,2,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2903.504,2906.141,Most people are not harmed by or are not made deaf by --
1979.78-1014,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2906.141,2910.53,"But that is what the respondent says, he trusted them."
1979.78-1014,2,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2910.53,2914.821,"Well, we think that the decision would rest on different issues."
1979.78-1014,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2914.821,2919.686,"Mrs. Stillman, going back to the standard for just a moment that Mr. Justice Stewart asked you about --"
1979.78-1014,2,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2919.686,2920.598,Yes.
1979.78-1014,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2920.598,2931.665,"-- in the Urie case, which Mr. Justice Rutledge wrote, he said the critical time is the specified period of time after notice of the invasion of legal right."
1979.78-1014,2,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2931.665,2932.555,"Your Honor, we would --"
1979.78-1014,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2932.555,2933.627,Do you accept that language?
1979.78-1014,2,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2933.627,2934.025,Yes.
1979.78-1014,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2939.098,2948.667,"No, not possible but notice of the invasion of legal rights which -- doesn't that imply knowledge of a possible breach of duty?"
1979.78-1014,2,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2948.667,2952.26,"Well, of course, in Urie they weren't focusing on the question that is involved here."
1979.78-1014,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2952.26,2953.703,But you did rely on the Urie case.
1979.78-1014,2,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2953.703,2968.72,"We do rely on Urie because we think that on the facts, they are similar to the facts that we say should put you on notice, and I suppose we just interpret that phrase too implicitly in --"
1979.78-1014,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2968.72,2976.086,You say notice of the invasion of legal rights should be paraphrased to say notice of the harm and its cause?
