1955.34,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,9.735,"Number 34 Sears, Roebuck and Company versus Bruce A. Mackey."
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,10.991,25.886,"Yes, sir."
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,569.433,574.016,What type of the question made difference from that Court of Appeals (Inaudible)
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,574.016,574.182,I think --
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,574.182,575.931,That's what I understood you to say.
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,575.931,588.989,"I think the question here is different because the Court of Appeals had it before two questions, namely, the effective Rule 54 (b), and secondarily, the question of whether or not the judgment in the trial court was final."
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,599.321,608.147,"Well, an (Inaudible) with 54 (b), the District Court had to determine not to write a piece of paper saying it is final, doesn't he?"
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,608.147,609.318,"I think that's right, Your Honor."
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,609.968,612.621,Did the Court of Appeals assumed that?
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,612.621,613.521,I think it did but the --
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,613.521,617.828,"I mean, that can't -- that cant be read onto this rule, whatever (Inaudible)"
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,617.828,618.308,"No, sir."
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,626.249,627.643,That's a different question.
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,627.643,634.495,I think the question of -- of what the word final means under 1291 under the facts of this case is a different question.
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,634.495,636.061,If the -- I understand that.
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,636.061,636.644,"Well, let me -- let me --"
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,636.644,648.499,"Under -- under 54 (b), the District Court has to say this is -- had to enter a final judgment whatever the final may mean under the rule for getting all about 1291, right?"
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,648.499,649.496,"Right, right."
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,649.496,659.485,"Now, then after the Court of Appeals have to find that there was a determination of finality within the rule, no matter what the rule is."
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,659.485,663.614,"Well, let me say -- in my --"
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,663.614,672.667,"I just want to -- I -- I don't -- I don't understand, still don't understand that your remark, the question here is different from what the Court of Appeals have decided?"
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,672.667,676.989,"But the question with respect to Rule 54 (b), I think, is the same question."
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,686.693,694.299,"Well, that -- it wouldn't have to reach for that if it post that final -- that under the rule, it is final, it cannot mean something different."
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,694.299,694.828,That's right -- if --
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,694.828,697.075,But not a different (Inaudible)
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,697.075,699.523,"I think -- I think that's entirely correct, Mr. Justice."
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,709.412,715.768,Unless -- unless this would be final under 1291.
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,715.768,721.544,"But if it -- if -- if this Court agrees with the court below, there is no question under 1291."
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,721.854,723.299,Suppose it doesn't agree with it?
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,723.299,730.974,"If it doesn't agree, then there remains the question in this case of whether or not the order in the trial court was final under 1291."
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,746.299,759.888,"And if the -- suppose we hold if -- if we hold it was final under 1291 whether we don't to bother what it understand in any event, 54 (b) for taking care of a business."
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,759.888,760.811,I think that's right.
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,760.811,775.404,Suppose we hold that 54 (b) isn't qualified or appeal effectively 1291 and would still have to reach the question of doing that and that reached the question whether this satisfies the requirement of finality under 1291.
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,775.404,777.514,I think this Court can reach that question.
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,779.163,783.375,"You mean to say, if we -- if we reach that point, we might hand it back to the Court of Appeals?"
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,783.375,786.511,That is what we -- that's what we've recommended and proposed to this Court.
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,795.766,802.391,"Well, I said I'd look up to review a question of you -- you (Inaudible)"
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,802.391,813.296,"I think you'll find that under the petition for certiorari, there was no question presented to this Court as to how 1291 applies."
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,813.918,815.935,Nothing as to the (Inaudible) of this litigation.
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,833.567,833.598,Yes.
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,833.598,834.942,That's your position.
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,834.942,836.579,"Mr. Justice, I think that's entirely correct."
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,836.924,838.298,I -- I understand.
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,838.298,847.987,"Now, in our reply brief, we set forth the reasons why we believe that question is more properly before the Court of Appeals."
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1192.536,1201.9,"When you said it was (Inaudible) valid in this Court, Reeves against Beardall, shows no controversy about the validity of this rule --"
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1201.9,1201.931,I think --
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1201.931,1205.501,-- the question of whether this particular complaint came within it?
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1205.501,1207.1,I -- I think that's entirely correct.
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1225.739,1229.149,It just verified my recollection.
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1250.849,1252.31,"Well, I agree and that -- that is the position --"
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1252.31,1275.691,"This was the question of Court, namely, that if we should be construed to involve the jurisdiction beyond 1291, if it grant the importance, the District Court can say something in final that they concededly not -- can final it under 1291 that that would exceed the power of the rule-making that heard about this Court by legislation and --"
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1275.691,1275.946,I --
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1275.946,1280.57,"And -- and recognized by this Court suppose they (Inaudible), isn't that true?"
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1280.57,1281.829,I agree with that entirely.
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1613.476,1614.447,I wonder if it were all related --
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1614.447,1614.77,"Yes, sir."
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1614.77,1634.84,"-- to deserve your argument with the different States because I know, as what my mind could run on (Inaudible) of yours, what your position is, on this problem, or you going to the nicest things and -- because I have to give a decision, what is -- what are you contending for with regards to the rule?"
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1641.98,1651.874,"Well, Mr. Justice, I believe that there is no difference substantially in the position taken by Judge Hastie, Judge Learned Hand and Judge Frank in their various opinions in this area."
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1651.874,1653.535,(Inaudible)
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1653.535,1657.47,They -- they used different language but I think the result is the same in each case.
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1703.12,1711.556,"Well, are you suggesting that the rule was merely intended to govern the procedural activity that the District does in --"
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1711.556,1711.806,Mr. Justice --
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1711.806,1712.47,(Inaudible)
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1712.47,1715.088,I -- I believe that's necessarily so.
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1716.762,1726.796,"That may be -- that, undoubtedly, must be a consequence because it does alert and (Inaudible), but if that does exhaust the -- the function of the rules."
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1726.796,1732.866,I think it has to exhaust the function of the rules because otherwise the rule overlaps Section 1291 and revises it.
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1753.389,1758.659,When you say in this area there was a draft -- one of that draft with reference to this --
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1758.659,1758.972,This situation --
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1758.972,1762.542,"-- but that draft of that, isn't it now 54 (b)?"
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1762.542,1763.059,"Yes, sir."
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1763.167,1772.012,"Oh that's very -- so this very rule had ascertained which by terms that different a folk, was that the finality came out of the Committee?"
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1772.012,1772.187,I believe --
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1772.187,1772.739,Is that right?
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1772.739,1774.661,"-- I believe there is no question with that, Mr. Justice."
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1803.005,1811.806,"So that the -- the rule of those who were formulated it, those who were engaged are positively training for responsible (Inaudible) rule."
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1840.483,1842.207,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1866.895,1872.165,Could you tell me -- I ought to know but I don't about the (Inaudible)
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1892.606,1898.046,"Mr. Justice, I believe the notes of the Advisory Committee certainly have been widely circulated."
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1898.046,1899.784,"The notes are part of the rule, the public (Voice Overlap) --"
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1899.784,1900.821,The notes are a part of the rule --
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1900.821,1901.076,But what about the --
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1901.076,1901.543,-- but beyond that --
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1901.543,1903.36,-- (Inaudible) of the pleading (Inaudible)
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1903.36,1903.468,-- I think --
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1903.468,1904.515,(Inaudible)
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1904.515,1907.575,I -- I have not tried a law library which does not have them.
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1908.31,1909.78,Not in law libraries.
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1909.78,1911.296,There aren't law libraries --
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1911.296,1912.751,I think there are couples from --
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1912.751,1923.586,The mimeographs of correspondents are also in law libraries and I think it's generally known in the bar that there is an Advisory Committee and that the Advisory Committee can be contacted.
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1923.586,1929.085,(Inaudible) find out naturally what they meant by the rules.
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1929.085,1929.383,"No, I -- I --"
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1929.383,1931.233,-- isn't that in the provision from that?
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1931.233,1938.84,I -- what I meant to suggest was of the -- there is an office of an Advisory Committee and that office can be contacted for materials with respect to the rules.
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1938.84,1944.551,"But all of this them may become materials with a confidential, meaning that -- between material that are unpublished --"
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1944.551,1944.746,I can --
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1944.746,1945.743,-- across the case (Inaudible)
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1945.743,1946.237,I can assure this --
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1946.237,1956.012,But the party of the -- the -- or it might be called the legislative history of these rules that are deposited to tell me there he draw a library.
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1956.012,1956.427,"Yes, sir."
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1956.427,1957.913,(Inaudible)
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1957.913,1960.255,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1970.05,1973.013,"Well, it's in the law library (Inaudible)"
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,2009.301,2010.328,That's exactly correct.
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2010.328,2012.091,All right.
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,2012.091,2019.792,"And one corollary, the rule has no affect with respect to what the Court of Appeals can examine on the question of the final decision under 1291."
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2019.792,2030.975,"And you say that there is an application for that -- for such a rule and that they had to call the rules against it, the restriction upon the power of (Inaudible)"
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,2030.975,2037.47,"Well, there was at one time a -- a general statement of an old rule which said that all issues as to all parties had to be disposed of."
1955.34,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2082.868,2090.42,And it's your view that the reason in (Inaudible) couldn't decide as the same way to have acting on Federal Rules.
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,2090.42,2093.237,That is my opinion.
1955.34,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2111.408,2113.917,I don't quite understand.
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,2118.717,2120.801,"No, Mr Justice Black."
1955.34,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2128.439,2129.794,What?
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,2129.794,2136.621,"The -- the Court could indicate, the District Court Judge could indicate that he was through at the part of the action."
1955.34,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2140.244,2140.43,What effect --
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,2140.43,2140.927,What is --
1955.34,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2140.927,2144.317,"-- but he could do that before, doesn't it?"
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,2148.933,2153.404,"Well, to that extent -- to the extent that he could do that before, I don't think the rule didn't make any change."
1955.34,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2153.404,2155.588,"Well, did it make any change (Inaudible)"
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,2164.187,2173.599,"In its amended form, the rule by the form which it prescribes directs the attention as Judge Clark has said of the trial court to this very problem."
1955.34,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2188.948,2190.034,What are the consequences?
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,2190.034,2190.233,The --
1955.34,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2190.233,2191.453,(Voice Overlap) --
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,2191.453,2196.784,"-- the -- the consequence of that, I think, is largely to avoid the difficulties that arose in the Dickinson situation which this Court --"
1955.34,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2196.784,2198.156,It doesn't -- doesn't avoid it.
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,2201.756,2204.821,"Mr. Justice Black, I don't think that under the amended rule, there's any question."
1955.34,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2222.163,2226.865,"Well, then what can the parties do that they couldn't have done that he had refrain from telling?"
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,2226.865,2235.182,"Well, one thing they can do is if think that the part which has been disposed of is sufficiently separate and distinct from the rest of the subject matter if they have any question as to that."
1955.34,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2240.839,2253.364,"Well, they -- they probably review before, I guess, that -- that was a very strict position and they better file notice of appeal (Inaudible) but does it give me a new information on when it can and whether it should?"
1955.34,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,2253.364,2255.743,"If I -- I believe so, Mr. Justice Black."

1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,3610.855,3611.023,No.

1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,3649.414,3655.222,The Court of Appeals still may throw us out and I say it's under a duty to examine that question.

1955.34,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3669.7,3670.735,Or is just time.
1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,3674.536,3677.195,"Well, certainly, if the place on that basis but to the litigant --"

1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,3697.849,3697.978,-- I'm not --
1955.34,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3697.978,3707.452,"Suppose you win or you lose, either one of you have any right to finally taken away from here that can't ultimately be settled under the federal court?"

1955.34,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3709.408,3709.909,Of course --
1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,3709.909,3710.784,-- that's my point.
1955.34,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3710.784,3711.769,-- that's why I agree with that.
1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,3711.769,3716.631,I'm forced to -- to multiple appeals as involved what it amounts to.
1955.34,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3716.631,3719.052,Multiple appeals that uncertainty as to whether --
1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,3719.052,3720.175,Whether it be heard on the merits.
1955.34,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3720.175,3721.192,-- almost of it.

1955.34,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3801.267,3801.666,Needlessly.
1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,3801.666,3802.405,-- needlessly.
1955.34,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3803.856,3810.642,Because the word “finality” is so indefinite that will -- we can't have what the judges (Inaudible)

1955.34,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3830.236,3839.388,"Can -- in this case prior with Rule 54 (b), if you have thought (Inaudible) could you have thought desirable to take an appeal?"
1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,3839.388,3841.6,"Prior to the original rule, Your Honor, or to the amendment?"
1955.34,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3841.6,3842.42,Which is it?
1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,3842.42,3849.244,"Well, that's a very difficult question to answer, Your Honor, because I have some doubt as to whether this pleading could have been filed prior to the original rule."
1955.34,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3861.612,3867.505,"They are all counts if I understood your argument, the violations have serious failure of the caveat (Inaudible)"

1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,3891.996,3892.186,Well --
1955.34,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3892.186,3894.744,Back into the Dickinson case here.
1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,3894.744,3910.15,As I say it's very difficult to answer that question because it is even more abstract from the question of petitioner wishes you to decide because I doubt very much at this very pleading could have come up this way under the free rule practice before the original rule themselves.
1955.34,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3910.15,3915.798,As I understand the pre-rule effect that it was (Inaudible) absolutely.

1955.34,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3916.124,3917.613,That was suggested in --
1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,3917.613,3923.157,The general doctrine was that it has to dispose of all matters in controversy before our party.

1955.34,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,4375.039,4375.125,Yes.
1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,4381.879,4398.761,"Well, that is an argument that is made and I'm -- I stated to the Court that I'm suggesting that that argument is a valid argument but I do not rely solely on it because I -- into your speaking of the enabling act which gives the -- the rule of the force of statute and if the statutory problem, the enabling act prevails."
1955.34,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4398.761,4408.71,"But that doesn't enable that that couldn't help, what the scope of the rule is but that doesn't tell us so that the Congress speak no more than that 54 (b)."
1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,4412.974,4413.174,No.
1955.34,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4426.27,4427.098,Make it appealable.
1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,4427.098,4427.703,They could do it.
1955.34,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4428.786,4443.467,"But before you get to that, they must decide whether they have done and before you decide that they have done so, you want to take a long (Inaudible) in Sears Company would have to invade if the federal jurisdiction (Inaudible)"
1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,4443.467,4445.87,"Well, I'm not suggesting that they go (Inaudible)"
1955.34,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4445.87,4448.111,You don't know?
1955.34,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4453.383,4454.091,May I ask you?
1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,4462.889,4464.856,"Yes, Your Honor."
1955.34,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4469.449,4474.372,Appealable under 1291 and its clear that it is.

1955.34,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4480.491,4481.896,But I want you to say.

1955.34,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4499.721,4501.248,Suppose they did?
1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,4517.372,4517.982,"Yes, Your Honor."
1955.34,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4517.982,4519.64,They're just separate cases.
1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,4519.64,4519.953,There could be separate cases.

1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,4550.64,4557.857,And that you may not have -- have been able to raise this question that you're suggesting under the pre-rule's practice so that -- I don't how I can answer that.
1955.34,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4557.968,4564.371,What I have in mind -- I don't know that it's -- it may not be covered to ask it that exists.
1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,4594.366,4599.092,"Well, the relevance that it has again is the opening of the door."
1955.34,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4604.301,4605.362,But the stamp is on.
1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,4605.362,4607.101,The stamp is on it and I -- and I --

1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,4607.676,4608.722,-- and I say to Your Honor --

1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,4620.264,4620.34,Well --
1955.34,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4620.34,4621.283,-- that you have?
1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,4621.283,4631.925,"-- that gets to the question which is the difficult question, even assuming you are -- the Court is with the respondent on the -- on the case and that is --"

1955.34,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4708.616,4710.033,-- or different problems.
1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,4714.124,4715.055,That's correct.
1955.34,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4715.055,4716.502,I'm not concerned with that point.

1955.34,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4757.42,4759.017,All right.
1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,4759.017,4759.511,I say --

1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,4762.068,4778.708,"I say this, Your Honor, that if you will take out of a multiple claims case, one claim that has been disposed of -- in “dispose of in the District Court with the others left undisposed of in the District Court.”"

1955.34,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4805.377,4810.124,Is not an easy case.
1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,4810.124,4812.125,It's an easy case now.
1955.34,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4812.125,4814.049,"Certainly, that's the point about finality."
1955.34,1,23012,edward_i_rothschild,,4844.538,4846.111,And clearly not appealable.
1955.34,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4846.111,4846.62,Pardon me?

1955.34,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4872.216,4872.88,Would make any difference at all.
