1985.85-410,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,27.483,"Mr. Berardo, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,27.483,30.102,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-410,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,78.833,92.193,"May I ask, counsel, because you started out with Carey v. Piphus, is it your position that damages, intangible damages, emotional distress and mental damages, are recoverable or not?"
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,92.193,103.317,"Justice Stevens, we think that emotional distress damages are recoverable as an element of actual damages in any 1983 case for any constitutional deprivation."
1985.85-410,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,103.317,104.4,Including this one?
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,104.4,105.15,Including this one.
1985.85-410,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,105.15,106.769,"Oh, I misread your brief."
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,111.154,113.506,Including a case like Carey against Piphus--
1985.85-410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,113.506,114.389,If the denial--
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,114.389,123.112,--If proofs had been made that the actions taken in that case had caused the litigants emotional distress.
1985.85-410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,162.689,170.926,"--Mr. Berardo, did you say that punitive damages would be available in a case like this against the School District?"
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,170.926,179.116,"Justice Rehnquist, our position throughout, and I think the instructions of the court in this case, were that punitive damages could not be awarded against the School District."
1985.85-410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,179.116,180.568,Because of the City of Newport?
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,180.568,181.851,Because of the City of Newport.
1985.85-410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,200.045,204.099,Say that again.
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,208.468,216.324,The instruction involved here allowed the jury to consider the intrinsic value of the constitutional rights that were defied.
1985.85-410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,222.478,223.361,You go ahead.
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,224.846,226.479,And that will explain your question.
1985.85-410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,226.479,228.148,You do it your way.
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,228.148,237.654,"First, the jury was authorized to award actual damages, being admonished not to consider speculative damages."
1985.85-410,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,521.038,525.609,May I interrupt you for a minute because I must confess from the beginning I am having a little bit of difficulty.
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,534.179,534.715,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-410,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,536.631,538.433,I am reading from page 93.
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,551.741,578.058,"--Justice Stevens, even though the instructions seem to indicate that there has to be an injury, if you will look on page 96 of the instructions, after nominal damages have been discussed... I am assuming that a jury which has these instructions with them in the jury room deliberating is going through each paragraph, paragraph by paragraph, to determine what they are going to do with these instructions."
1985.85-410,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,597.556,598.288,"It says,"
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,603.792,605.644,"--That presumes an injury, Your Honor."
1985.85-410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,607.827,610.012,The injury is the deprivation of the constitutional right.
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,610.012,611.129,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1985.85-410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,611.129,614.314,Isn't the injury the deprivation of the constitutional right?
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,614.314,615.3,I think not.
1985.85-410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,626.39,639.781,I would think you would say the court was implying or saying that it is enough to find injury in a sense of the deprivation of a constitutional right.
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,639.781,643.233,"--Then, Your Honor, I think Carey would require that nominal damages be awarded."
1985.85-410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,643.233,644.019,Very well.
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,646.585,656.077,"However, damages as opposed to injury flow from the expectation that the plaintiff might have had to exercise certain rights, including First Amendment rights."
1985.85-410,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,656.077,668.9,Under Tennessee law may you recover in an automobile accident case for the abstract violation of a constitutional right not to be run down by an automobile?
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,668.9,670.334,I think--
1985.85-410,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,670.334,672.952,Or do you just recovery the injury?
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,672.952,688.298,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I think that there would be no damages permitted for that kind of injury, but there would be damages permitted for pain and suffering and emotional stress under Michigan law if a constitutional or statutory right were, of course, involved."
1985.85-410,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,688.298,692.916,"Loss of employment, permanent disability, all that sort of thing?"
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,700.189,703.558,That is correct.
1985.85-410,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,779.022,780.641,Let me ask you a hypothetical question.
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,800.554,806.958,"--I think, Justice Stevens, the answer to that question depends on the proofs that are put in by the plaintiff."
1985.85-410,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,820.866,825.003,"Suppose it didn't cause him anything, he just couldn't go to church and he very deeply wanted to go to church."
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,825.003,830.555,--Then he is entitled to nominal damages.
1985.85-410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,830.555,846.582,"Mr. Berardo, you don't question, do you, that a jury properly instructed in your view of the law of the case could have returned this amount of damages for the plaintiff or do you question that?"
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,846.582,851.653,"Justice Rehnquist, we don't know what the jury considered in this case."
1985.85-410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,856.105,858.324,"No, that is why I asked you the question."
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,873.5,880.304,"I think you might claim that this verdict was excessive, Your Honor, because it was more than double what plaintiff's attorney asked for in his final argument."
1985.85-410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,880.304,883.44,"Well, that isn't an invariable."
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,883.44,884.475,No.
1985.85-410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,884.475,886.642,It wouldn't be unconstitutional.
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,886.642,897.599,"I agree, but in view of defendant's counsel it is certainly an indication that this award included factors other than what plaintiff's counsel at least argued to the jury at the conclusion of the trial."
1985.85-410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,935.724,943.08,"But, he got some very bad publicity, didn't he, of the same sort that a libel plaintiff is apt to get?"
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,943.08,951.234,"Justice Rehnquist, he did get very bad publicity the same as a libel plaintiff might be expected to get, but this wasn't a libel for a deformation case."
1985.85-410,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,962.042,966.344,Could there be a recovery for libel against a school board as such?
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,966.344,967.861,I--
1985.85-410,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,967.861,969.727,As distinguished from individuals.
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,969.727,971.479,"--As a state law case, I think not."
1985.85-410,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,979.899,1006.716,"Mr. Berardo, if we were to agree with you on the single question of proper instructions for damages for intrinsic value of a constitutional right, is there any need to do more than to remand it for a new trial on damages alone as opposed to liability?"
1985.85-410,0,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,1006.716,1029.649,"I think not, Justice O'Connor, for the reason that this Court in granting certiorari failed to grant certiorari as to Issue No. 2 in our petition which was more factually oriented, therefore, I presume from the Court's action on our petition that the facts in this case are settled and we are only talking now about damages and the proper calculation of damages."
1985.85-410,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1054.633,1056.583,Mr. Heldt?
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1056.583,1059.251,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-410,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1107.601,1111.97,You think they could consider it wholly apart from any instruction?
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1111.97,1114.588,Wholly apart from any instruction?
1985.85-410,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1114.588,1120.325,Suppose Judge Harvey had not given the instruction of which complaint is made here.
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1128.764,1130.347,They certainly could.
1985.85-410,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1150.761,1169.591,"And, hence, I take it, you would say it would be quite proper for the judge to say now as a matter of damages I am instructing you that there has been no evidence presented of any actual injury in the sense of monetary loss or pain or suffering or humiliation or anything like that."
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1189.553,1195.139,"Well, I don't think that issue is presented in this case and I am loathe to speak on behalf of--"
1985.85-410,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1195.139,1202.145,I think it quite well is presented in this case.
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1203.595,1209.549,--My answer is that that would be permissible depending on the nature of the constitutional right which was violated.
1985.85-410,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1209.549,1209.949,Right.
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1209.949,1213.87,"As Justice Stevens said, if you are not allowed to go to church, perhaps that is a case--"
1985.85-410,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1213.87,1216.22,Then you have problems with Carey against Piphus.
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1220.19,1222.624,"--No, I don't think that is true."
1985.85-410,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1254.476,1265.634,But then you have to say that the holding of Carey against Piphus as to procedural due process violation damages would not be carried over into the First Amendment area.
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1265.634,1268.403,I think that is clearly correct.
1985.85-410,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1273.472,1282.495,"Counsel, can you explain to me the elements of $233,750?"
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1282.495,1287.13,"I am not sure I can, but I don't think that any plaintiff can."
1985.85-410,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1287.13,1289.999,"You can't even get close to explaining this, can you?"
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1289.999,1291.934,I don't think any plaintiff can.
1985.85-410,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1296.922,1304.009,"How about $35,350 compensatory?"
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1304.009,1307.878,They broke those awards out by party.
1985.85-410,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1317.835,1321.387,"You don't think they drew lots for something like that, do you?"
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1321.387,1322.989,Not that I am aware of.
1985.85-410,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1322.989,1326.024,"I mean, drew it out of a hat or something."
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1333.178,1350.723,"Well, there is a special verdict forum here, but when it came to the question of what value do you place on the damages that you find are appropriate, we don't ask them how did you do it, did you accept the plaintiff's lawyer's calculus and multiply these numbers together to come up with your verdict?"
1985.85-410,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1478.239,1482.393,"Of course, he was... It was held he was denied procedural due process."
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1482.393,1483.576,That is correct.
1985.85-410,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1483.576,1489.813,Then that denial is regardless of whether or not after a hearing he would have been found guilty.
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1489.813,1494.015,"But, what the Court in Carey says is that that creates an ambiguity of causation."
1985.85-410,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1514.013,1529.624,At least that... The Carey opinion suggests that you don't get anything in the way of substantive damages by reason of the fact you were denied the constitutional right to procedural due process.
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1535.611,1537.277,"Carey, I think, clearly requires that."
1985.85-410,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1553.656,1577.854,"How about my example where the judge says there is no evidence of any other damages except the denial of this constitutional right and he said, of course, the plaintiff hasn't gotten on the stand and claimed that it really hurt him any, but members of the jury, you are entitled to give damages for the violation of this right, whatever you think it is worth."
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1577.854,1580.973,I don't believe that Carey would permit that.
1985.85-410,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1582.19,1584.258,No matter what the constitutional right is involved.
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1584.258,1585.175,--That is what I was going to say.
1985.85-410,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1590.762,1591.948,What about other constitutional rights?
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1591.948,1596.933,It leaves that open and it says expressly it depends on what right you are talking about.
1985.85-410,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1603.253,1616.245,It might be too much to make a plaintiff get up on the stand and attempt to say how he really has been injured if some other kind of constitutional right is involved like freedom of speech or--
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1616.245,1631.07,"--I don't think it is ever too much to expect a plaintiff to try and articulate that, but the question as a legal matter I don't see as being before the Court in this case because the plaintiff took the stand and he testified at length about the consequences of these deprivations on him."
1985.85-410,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1635.974,1648.882,"--So, it is just really a question of whether or not... what chance there is that the jury pay too much attention to the last part of his instruction."
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1648.882,1649.549,I don't--
1985.85-410,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1649.549,1669.029,"Because that instruction... You know, maybe he read it in the context that it isn't all that harmful, but that part of the instruction embodies the idea that the denial of the right itself entitles you to substantial damages without, as you say, your plaintiff getting on the stand proving anything."
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1669.029,1674.016,--I don't think that is true and I think it is belied by the balance of the instructions.
1985.85-410,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1674.016,1683.705,"Well, perhaps it is belied by the balance of the instructions, but do you feel that even the particular instruction that the petition brings here doesn't permit that?"
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1683.705,1688.859,I don't think it permits it in the context of this case because it was never argued that way.
1985.85-410,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1782.719,1787.457,Are you the one who requested the instruction the judge gave about constitutional rights?
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1787.457,1788.673,--Yes.
1985.85-410,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1788.673,1794.694,"And, I suppose in the record here that that request is contained somewhere."
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1796.128,1797.528,It is not contained in the printed record.
1985.85-410,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.414,1799.28,In the transcript.
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1799.28,1805.85,"--No, it would be contained in the series of proposed written instructions which were presented to the court before trial."
1985.85-410,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1805.85,1806.2,"Well, isn't that in the record?"
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1806.2,1807.384,"Yes, but not in the transcript."
1985.85-410,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1807.384,1811.504,"But, it is in the record that has been lodged here?"
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1811.504,1814.706,"Yes, yes, it is."
1985.85-410,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1853.779,1887.702,"You are saying as long as you get on the stand and prove up a major injury by the way of emotional distress, if it so happens you have been denied the right to go to church and that is a denial of an important constitutional right, the jury should maybe double the damages it otherwise would have awarded just because of the nature of the constitutional right that is involved."
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1887.702,1891.487,If you are asking me do I think that is a permissible argument for plaintiff to make--
1985.85-410,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1891.487,1894.956,I thought that was the argument you were making.
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1894.956,1895.356,--No.
1985.85-410,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1912.299,1912.799,That is what I say.
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1928.91,1932.529,"No, I would formulate it differently."
1985.85-410,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1962.648,1967.385,"Counsel, do you practice in this county regularly?"
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1967.385,1970.654,Do I practice in Memphis or in Port Huron when the court sits?
1985.85-410,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1970.654,1972.106,In Michigan--
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1972.106,1976.074,"I practice with some regularity in that state and in those counties, yes."
1985.85-410,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1976.074,1983.997,--What is the average death value in a civil action in your practice?
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1983.997,1988.299,As I understand it... I have never tried a wrongful death case.
1985.85-410,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1988.299,1989.366,Have you heard of any?
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,1989.366,1998.388,"As I understand it, in Wayne County, the county in which Detroit resides, it is probably in excess of seven figures."
1985.85-410,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2005.927,2012.897,"Less than this, so this is more than he would get if he was killed."
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,2012.897,2015.199,I don't think that is true.
1985.85-410,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2115.048,2138.58,"Well, supposing this had been a diversity case that was being tried before Judge Harvey in Port Huron and the defendant was someone... the school board had done exactly these same things to the plaintiff except there was no claim that there was a federal constitutional violation, it was a claim that it was a violation of Michigan state law."
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,2160.493,2164.981,"No, I don't think so and I don't think this instruction says that."
1985.85-410,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2176.303,2196.083,"Well, isn't the real question we have whether these instructions then permitted the jury to base their award of damages in part or in whole on the jury's estimate of the intrinsic value of the constitutional right as opposed to all those things you have been telling us about?"
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,2196.083,2236.493,"Well, that is the issue as framed by the petitioner and to that we say, first of all, that all the language of the instruction says is you may take into consideration the roots of these rights and their application in the context of Mr. Stachura's conduct at the time those rights were violated in deciding what quantum of damages should be awarded and that we did not argue... We simply did not ask the jury to award some extra element, award something over and above the reasonable value that they placed on his suffering."
1985.85-410,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2282.622,2283.924,"But that isn't the allegation, is it?"
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,2288.86,2293.164,That seems to be Mr. Berardo's argument here today.
1985.85-410,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2326.985,2328.17,But you weren't satisfied with those instructions.
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,2331.289,2355.655,"I asked only for an instruction which said if you find there is damage, and there is clearly damage in this record, you may take into consideration in deciding what amount of money to place on that damage, the fact that these are constitutional rights and that they are important rights that the teacher was entitled to engage in--"
1985.85-410,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.655,2369.08,"In short, if except for the fact that there were constitutional rights involved, you would have found $50,000 worth of damage, because of constitutional rights you are entitled to return $200,000."
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,2369.08,2372.699,--I don't think that is what the instruction says.
1985.85-410,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2372.699,2373.866,Or one million.
1985.85-410,1,30714,jeffrey_a_heldt,,2376.001,2384.424,"The only limit was imposed by the plaintiff's complaint which, as I understand it, was considerably higher than the amount returned by the verdict."
1985.85-410,2,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,2650.594,2654.565,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-410,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2694.773,2697.892,Does your objection go to causation?
1985.85-410,2,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,2697.892,2699.761,"Justice O'Connor, I think so."
1985.85-410,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2699.761,2708.7,"As I looked at it, your objection to the instruction was that they allowed the jury to speculate on the value of a constitutional right citing Carey."
1985.85-410,2,37711,patrick_j_berardo,,2708.7,2719.925,To say speculate to me means to permit the jury to determine damages without relation to objective factors and without relation to what caused the damages.
1985.85-410,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2831.412,2832.462,"Thank you, gentlemen."
