1968.51,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,24.001,"Number 51, United States, appellant versus Joseph Francis Nardello and Isadore Weisberg."
1968.51,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,24.81,26.125,May it please the Court.
1968.51,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,36.756,38.463,Motion is granted.
1968.51,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,41.913,45.789,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.51,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,556.596,572.549,"In reading your -- in reading the briefs of this case, I was impressed by the -- negatively impressed by the seeming lack of legislative history bearing really a very explicitly on this question is -- and I assume there is not, is that correct?"
1968.51,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,572.549,582.677,"Yes, the Senate or House hearings do not reveal any specific focus on the question of what extortion was meant."
1968.51,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,675.722,677.794,Where is that -- what part of the brief?
1968.51,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,677.794,678.819,Letter is not in the brief.
1968.51,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,679.545,681.202,Reply brief.
1968.51,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,681.202,682.453,In the record?
1968.51,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,688.656,690.004,There's no record.
1968.51,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,690.004,699.786,The -- it is quoted in a law review article which we cite the Palner article in Volume 28 of the Brooklyn Law Review.
1968.51,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,719.871,724.696,Do those records do have (Inaudible)?
1968.51,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,724.696,728.636,The article was written by an attorney of the Department of Justice.
1968.51,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,737.409,740.424,But where did he get it from?
1968.51,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,740.424,741.978,"Apparently, I think that's --"
1968.51,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,741.978,743.279,Can you get it again?
1968.51,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,747.301,756.314,"We -- I'm sure we can obtain the copy of that letter and submit it if the Court wishes to see it, if the Court wishes to see the full letter."
1968.51,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,756.314,763.391,"Well I'd be happy to look at it, if you want us to look at any of it, I would think you would furnish the whole record."
1968.51,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,763.391,766.419,"Very fine, I'll make final arrangements to do that."
1968.51,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,840.478,849.335,"Well now, extortion is linked here with bribery and bribery involves by definition public officers, doesn't it?"
1968.51,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,849.335,850.653,Yes.
1968.51,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,868.113,871.002,"I don't understand that, was arson -- was arson added later?"
1968.51,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,871.002,872.696,Arson was added in 1965.
1968.51,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,872.696,876.822,The original -- the original language was extortion or bribery.
1968.51,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,876.822,878.726,That's right.
1968.51,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,878.726,882.442,In any event which is the brief to the letter you and I were discussing?
1968.51,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,882.442,890.776,"Except for the citation in the -- of the law review article, there is none."
1968.51,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,890.776,898.263,"We'll recess now, Mr."
1968.51,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,901.12,902.995,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1968.51,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1082.34,1090.655,Am I correct in my belief that nowhere in the statutes under consideration did Congress use the word blackmail?
1968.51,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1090.655,1092.219,That is correct sir.
1968.51,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1136.753,1147.456,Have you made any study to determine how many states consider the facts in this case as being extortion?
1968.51,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1147.456,1148.292,Yes.
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,1821.356,1831.208,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2004.298,2025.285,"Suppose this prosecution have taken place in say in California where this fact situation would be covered by the extortion statute assuming that it does, I believe it does, would this conviction stand?"
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2025.285,2031.772,"Assuming the facts as Your Honor has stated them and I certainly defer to your judgment in the area, I think that it would, there is no question in my mind."
1968.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2031.772,2034.495,I don't assert that it would that's just --
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2034.495,2036.098,"No, I will assert that it would."
1968.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2042.338,2052.172,"Well then, wouldn't that indicate that Congress intended to proscribe this kind of conduct by this statute?"
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2052.172,2053.554,"No sir, it would not."
1968.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2055.094,2055.643,Yes of course.
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2055.643,2070.076,I think really that the prosecution that you have just mentioned and the fact that a successful prosecution may be obtained in California under these same set of facts was not within the intention with the purview of the individuals who drew the Travel Act.
1968.51,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2182.755,2194.457,"Mr. Fitzpatrick, how about the average congressman, do you think when he put this word extortion in there he did or did not intend to cover this specific act?"
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2194.457,2200.315,I frankly sir do not think that the average congressman ever even thought of this particular type of activity.
1968.51,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2200.315,2212.499,Do you think that it's unreasonable to think that Congress intended extortion to mean what it was generally understood to cover in 1961?
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2212.499,2213.529,"Yes sir, I do."
1968.51,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2215.149,2228.556,"Do you believe that in 1961, the word extortion in this generic sense in his understanding at that time was broad enough to cover the facts in this indictment?"
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2228.556,2230.129,I will have to admit that.
1968.51,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2263.365,2268.735,Do you say -- can you point to any of the legislative history the said Congress was aware of that fact?
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2268.735,2270.065,"No sir, I cannot."
1968.51,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2276.957,2282.338,"But you don't believe that the general understanding at that time would have covered this, the word extortion?"
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2282.338,2289.798,I do feel that if the word extortion were not modified by Congress was in violation of the laws of the state it would have covered this circumstance.
1968.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2386.197,2420.996,"So, what bothers me and what prompted my question was this and I know in California and maybe in other states too many years ago, there was great confusion as to what would constitute larceny as distinguished from larceny by trick and device and from obtaining money under false pretenses and it confused the courts, it confused everyone so they combined all three and called it theft."
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2430.935,2432.168,"No sir, I would not because --"
1968.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2432.168,2434.72,"Well, what is the distinction between that and your case?"
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2434.72,2443.864,The distinction there sir is that what the Government is doing is picking out an element which is a part and a clear part of a larger crime that is theft.
1968.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2485.629,2501.873,"Well, I understand here that from this brief, the Government that there's some 25 states I can't count them all but I think it's about that where the facts in this case would be covered by the word extortion."
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2501.873,2502.867,That is correct sir.
1968.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2502.867,2507.095,"Now, in most states, you say that this law would be applicable."
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2507.095,2508.548,That is correct.
1968.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2510.598,2513.029,Even though the same conduct --
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2513.029,2513.174,The same conduct.
1968.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2513.174,2516.028,Wasn't criminal in those states.
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2516.028,2522.53,Correct and I think really that we have faced the problem but the problem is precisely this.
1968.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2533.565,2537.509,"Well, what was the purpose of Congress in passing this law?"
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2544.614,2546.572,I think that certainly is true Your Honor.
1968.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2563.427,2566.915,No body has a broader language than that.
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2566.915,2571.817,There are some law review articles that go perhaps a bit beyond that sir and some other treatises.
1968.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2621.701,2625.277,But there are others who have heard of that and I am one of them.
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2625.277,2626.51,"There may very well be, sir."
1968.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2626.51,2632.758,I'm one of them -- the -- that's been an instrument of interstate crime for ages.
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2656.397,2657.723,I wouldn't deny that sir.
1968.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2657.723,2658.237,Beg your pardon?
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2658.237,2659.577,I would not deny that.
1968.51,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2683.241,2691.167,I respectfully suggest that you should read some of the material that was given to Congress before this Bill was passed.
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2691.167,2692.518,That may well be sir.
1968.51,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2692.518,2696.804,From an agency that does know something about organized crime.
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2696.804,2696.932,That may --
1968.51,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2696.932,2701.163,The United States Department of Justice.
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2701.163,2702.14,"Well then, may I respectfully suggest that --"
1968.51,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2702.14,2705.714,Don't go around to your law review article once try there.
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2705.714,2707.651,May I respectfully suggest sir that if Congress did have this knowledge --
1968.51,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2707.651,2710.592,You going to say that it's not in there?
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2710.592,2721.15,"That if Congress did have this knowledge they did not include it within the statute, if this really was an important factor in Congres's mind, they did a very poor job of including it within the statute."
1968.51,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2721.15,2730.012,"Say -- I suppose Congress should have said that if somebody holds somebody up and threatens to expose them unless they pay money, that will be a crime."
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2730.012,2736.103,"Congress has done it, may I respectfully say sir, in the Hobbs Act which they passed just a short time before."
1968.51,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2736.103,2737.813,We're talking about this one.
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2737.813,2738.724,I understand that.
1968.51,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2742.964,2749.673,"If you admit that -- you admit that extortion meant the same thing to you that I think it meant to Congress, you admit that."
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2749.673,2750.687,Extortion does.
1968.51,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2754.555,2767.677,"But you said that in order to make a National Law, Congress also intended that it should cover all the vagrancies of all of the 50 -- 48 state statutes."
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2767.677,2774.152,"When you say cover, if you may take into account that they are different and recognize that difference in the Act, yes I do admit that."
1968.51,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2774.152,2774.276,do you --
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2774.276,2784.135,"If you're asking me if I feel that Congress meant by this term extortion, to include just generally extortionate conduct, no sir I do not."
1968.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2928.554,2947.514,"Do you think that Congress could pass a law providing that any man who leaves one state to go into another and commit certain offenses or engage in certain conduct which is not a violation of the local law, Congress could make the other crime?"
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2947.514,2949.058,"Yes, sir."
1968.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2949.058,2954.104,"Suppose it was a purely local crime, ordinarily treated as such?"
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2954.104,2955.386,I think that by virtue of the --
1968.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2955.386,2958.073,Could the commerce clause be used for that purpose?
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2958.073,2959.059,I'm sorry Mr. --
1968.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2959.059,2961.617,Could the commerce clause be used for the purpose?
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2961.617,2962.267,"In my opinion, it could sir."
1968.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2962.267,2975.675,"While giving the Federal Government how to create crimes in states if the person had traveled in interstate commerce for the purpose of doing that, engaging in that conduct."
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,2975.675,2980.021,"In my opinion, Congress could make a criminal law that Congress of the Federal Government could punish."
1968.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3004.945,3005.856,(Inaudible)
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3005.856,3009.116,Regardless of the laws of Pennsylvania.
1968.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3017.16,3030.342,"What you're saying is when they could do the other and they say violate a particular thing that is a crime in the state, that you shouldn't read to do it in a more than that?"
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3030.342,3031.281,That is correct sir.
1968.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3086.59,3088.403,Violation of the laws of Pennsylvania.
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3088.403,3097.244,"Of violation of the laws of Pennsylvania, it clearly is and there is absolutely no question but that this complaint of conduct here was the violation of the laws of Pennsylvania."
1968.51,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3137.647,3140.069,If you don't have the Hobbs Act cited in your brief.
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3140.069,3143.669,The Hobbs Act sir is cited in the Court's opinion.
1968.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3153.881,3154.776,Is that what's called the antitrust (Voice Overlap)?
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3154.776,3170.481,"The term extortion means the obtaining of property from another with his consent induced by wrongful use of action or a threatened force violence or fear or under collar of official right and that certainly if it were here, I would not have the pleasure of appearing before this Court."
1968.51,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3170.481,3173.117,And when was that enacted?
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3173.799,3183.901,"I do not know independently, the courts speak of it as being an earlier but I do not know how much earlier than the Travel Act sir."
1968.51,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3183.901,3190.056,"Alright, thank you."
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3190.056,3211.815,"I do not believe, I must disagree respectfully with my brother, when he tells the Court that the interpretation as imposed upon this Section by the United States District Court would seriously hamper the Government's attempt to wipe out interstate crime particularly organized crime."
1968.51,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3254.405,3257.636,What about loan sharking?
1968.51,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3257.636,3259.246,"Yes, sir."
1968.51,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3259.246,3260.948,Could that be reached by this law?
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3260.948,3269.827,"I think it would, I think at least those sections of it sir that it have to deal with the violence, with the threatened violence of loan sharking would be reached by another section of the law."
1968.51,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3269.827,3270.499,What?
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3270.499,3286.429,"The one that is not quoted widely herein, subsection 2 of Section 1952, “commit any crime of violence to further any unlawful activity.”"
1968.51,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3286.429,3289.908,"Yes, but unlawful activity as defined would not include loan sharking."
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3289.908,3291.811,"Would not include loan sharking, you're quite correct."
1968.51,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3291.811,3292.161,Unless it's extortionate.
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3292.161,3293.182,I apologize.
1968.51,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3293.182,3297.131,Unless it was extortionate.
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3297.131,3300.665,"Well, therein lies a very difficult problem if a man owes a debt."
1968.51,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3300.665,3303.197,"Well, it's a problem that's in this case."
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3303.197,3307.199,Not necessarily if I could respectfully just for a moment and this had not --
1968.51,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3307.199,3318.126,"Well, you would admit I suppose that if the state law covered loan sharking as extortion, in a statute with a label extortion on it, could it then construe to include loan sharking."
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3318.126,3318.783,Yes.
1968.51,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3318.783,3319.831,You wouldn't have any problem.
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3319.831,3320.868,No problem.
1968.51,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3323.08,3338.797,"Or if the state law used to and construe extortion, if he extorts a statute to cover A, B, C, D and E, and then they refined their statutes and they took out of the extortion -- out from under extortion, they called it loan sharking."
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3338.797,3340.119,I would have no problem with that.
1968.51,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3340.119,3340.94,Why wouldn't you?
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3342.726,3343.321,It was at time --
1968.51,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3343.321,3350.105,"It isn't extortion under -- illegal under state law according to your argument, is loan sharking illegal under state law?"
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3350.105,3356.691,Loan sharking is illegal under those sections of state law at least in Pennsylvania which have to do with the charging of unlawful interest.
1968.51,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3376.03,3376.291,What --
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3376.291,3376.714,Pardon me.
1968.51,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3379.506,3408.346,"We got an opposite track with just a hypothetical case but I suppose your argue -- what you're making with the -- you would certainly stick to it if some state that used to include the loan sharking, shylocking or something under extortion suddenly had a specific statute applied to shylocking and there's no longer indictable or punishable under the extortion statute."
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3412.583,3412.82,I would have--
1968.51,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3412.82,3416.328,"And then wouldn't be extortion illegal under state law, would it?"
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3416.328,3421.647,It would not at that time sir but I would frankly have less problem with that I would with the Chief Justice's hypothetical were.
1968.51,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3426.987,3438.002,The only reason it would be is because extortion in common understanding would cover situations like that where money is collected under a threat or violence.
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3438.002,3441.204,Yes sir but in my opinion --
1968.51,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3441.204,3444.352,That's precisely the Government's argument in this case.
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3444.352,3445.815,Not as I understood it sir.
1968.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3534.474,3535.567,Suppose --
1968.51,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3535.567,3537.499,"Excuse me, go ahead."
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3597.146,3597.373,Well --
1968.51,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3597.373,3599.043,Be meaningless if it were --
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3599.043,3610.172,"It unless sir, the rare circumstances that it would go to New York for the pay off or that some would come to Philadelphia to pay off a judge or a legislator or the chief of police."
1968.51,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3610.172,3619.913,But generally the leverage that a law officer has to extort is right within his own state using his office?
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3619.913,3620.573,That is correct.
1968.51,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3620.573,3621.799,Using his state office.
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3621.799,3622.32,"Yes, that is correct."
1968.51,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3622.32,3623.572,Or local office.
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3623.572,3625.189,That is correct.
1968.51,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3625.189,3626.03,And so --
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3626.03,3630.229,But there could be circumstances particularly in a city like Philadelphia that as bad as I seen.
1968.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3652.075,3658.171,I was just looking at what the late Robert Kennedy had to say.
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3694.514,3698.42,I once again must agree that the term extortion does do that to me sir.
1968.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3761.704,3765.927,May I ask you a question about your loan shark illustration?
1968.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3786.598,3792.48,"Well, I would say I'm afraid does not come as the result of accumulated experience over the years."
1968.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3798.548,3802.961,"Well, would argue then like you're arguing here that they didn't intend to do a thing like that?"
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3802.961,3803.923,"No sir, I would not."
1968.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3810.822,3815.471,"Well, do you think Congress would pass a law trying to regulate the interest rate in Montana --"
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3815.471,3815.935,I think --
1968.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3815.935,3818.325,Put down its law at 3%.
1968.51,2,23892,f_emmett_fitzpatrick_jr,,3818.325,3824.106,Whether they would get a 3% or not is something I really don't want to get involved with the bankers over because I know nothing about it.
1968.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3848.246,3853.202,Thank you Mr.
1968.51,3,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3853.202,3868.898,"Mr. Justice White, I'm not sure what the result of the colloquy was between counsel and you on the question of possible effect of re-labeling or separating out provisions that at one time were called extortion."
