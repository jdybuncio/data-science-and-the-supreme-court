1972.71-1336,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.619,"This morning, the number 71-1336 in matter of the application of Griffiths for admission to the Bar."
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,14.534,18.466,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,113.841,120.274,Does the record indicate that why she doesn’t want to -- why she does not intend to become citizen of the United States?
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,120.274,124.048,This was the fourth hearing that we’ve attended and you’re the first person to ask.
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,132.372,139.25,"Well, does the record show whether or not she intends to remain in the United States and particularly in Connecticut?"
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,139.25,146.067,The record does not show whether she intends to remain in the United States or in the State of Connecticut.
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,150.93,152.004,Indefinitely?
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,152.004,155.574,Yes and she does intend to reside in the United States indefinitely.
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,155.574,157.932,And clearly intends not to become a citizen?
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,157.932,160.77,She does not at this time intend to become a citizen.
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,214.727,225.07,"Just to have a personal feeling or one never knows about the future, about the relationships for example between our country and Holland, or any other nation."
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,225.07,225.516,No there are contingencies (Voice Overlap)
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,225.516,236.91,"And as long as that personal feeling of loyalty exists to the nation of which you’re now a citizen, that’s I suppose what Connecticut was trying to get at, isn’t it?"
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,236.91,239.623,I think it is not what Connecticut is trying to get at.
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,253.67,258.543,"But in international affairs under our Constitution and all those matters, you’ll turn over to the National Government."
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,264.129,265.391,That’s correct.
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,265.391,266.829,So that’s not (Voice Overlap).
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,266.829,270.867,"Well, to contingency -- if you’re asking, is there a contingency that she might go back to Holland."
1972.71-1336,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,319.464,334.206,"Mr. Broiles, to pursue your hypothetical, if you are moving to Holland and having a Dutch wife, as a member of the Bar of the United -- some one of the States of the United States, do you think you’d have a right to be a judge in Holland?"
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,334.206,348.475,"No, I would not have a right to be a judge in Holland though it is interesting that my client, who is not a citizen to United States, and is a citizen of Holland, would on our research, have a right to be the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court."
1972.71-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,371.111,374.316,We’re going to the constitution (Inaudible) need to be lawyers?
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,374.316,379.202,There’s no requirement that a Justice on the Supreme Court be a lawyer.
1972.71-1336,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,379.202,387.473,"Mr. Broiles, following through with your hypothetical as a matter of curiosity, do you know whether you could be admitted to the Bar of Holland?"
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,387.473,390.496,"According to my client, I could not."
1972.71-1336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,390.496,391.74,Without being a Dutch citizen?
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,391.74,394.373,Without being a Dutch citizen.
1972.71-1336,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,409.941,411.26,This is outside the record.
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,413.509,421.843,She is presently living in Holland and is coming back Thursday and has the intention of practicing in Connecticut if this opinion is favorable to her.
1972.71-1336,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,427.47,429.594,"Well, is the case moot?"
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,429.594,430.553,No it is not Your Honor.
1972.71-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,443.06,450.343,"So, an intent to reside that means an intent to live in Connecticut and indefinitely."
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,450.343,451.369,"No, it does not Your Honor."
1972.71-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,461.017,462.273,How can you have an intent?
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,464.469,465.671,Residency means living there.
1972.71-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,465.671,466.372,Just being there?
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,466.372,467.924,Just being there.
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,507.691,510.481,Residence doesn’t mean domicile then?
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,510.481,513.317,I think residence in fact does mean just that.
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,523.679,530.666,"Well, also domicile involves an intent to remain there indefinitely."
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,534.254,535.014,That would not.
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,535.014,542.858,But if I have the intention residing in Connecticut indefinitely then I am and then domicile depends upon intent?
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,542.858,544.229,I think domicile intents (Voice Overlap)
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,544.229,545.308,(Voice Overlap) intent?
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,545.308,549.496,"Yes, I don’t think the intent can reasonably said to be indefinitely."
1972.71-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,559.073,563.169,That is the -- residency doesn’t even mean that thing?
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,563.169,563.885,No.
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,564.21,566.004,No I don’t think so.
1972.71-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,566.873,573.576,But you could just move to Connecticut for long after you take the exam and leave?
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,573.576,576.68,"Based on the rules of the State of Connecticut, that is quite right."
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,576.958,591.624,"So far under your submission in this case, somebody could come from Japan, or Uganda, or Nepal, and just fill out the questionnaire and take the Connecticut Bar exam."
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,591.624,592.38,No that’s (Voice Overlap).
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,592.38,594.102,That’s an absolute constitutional right to do so.
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,594.238,596.367,"No, that’s absolutely not the position here."
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,602.193,604.361,"Alright, is there long enough for an interview."
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,604.361,607.571,And the Bar Committee is satisfied to these qualifications.
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,607.571,608.113,Alright he is found he law school in (Inaudible)
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,608.113,613.551,As to his residency in the State of Connecticut then it seems clear under the rule of the State of Connecticut that he’s admissible.
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,613.551,614.898,"Well, except if (Voice Overlap)"
1972.71-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,614.898,616.085,If so required --
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,616.085,618.385,"Constitutionally requires, it’s what you’re saying."
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,618.385,620.724,I’m saying that that’s what the rule of the State of Connecticut requires.
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,620.724,620.885,No.
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,655.679,656.959,That is not my position.
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,686.918,692.334,The issue in this case is whether or Connecticut can constitutionally require that a person be a citizen.
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,692.334,693.371,That’s correct.
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,693.371,697.212,And you’ve told this that it doesn’t require that he be domicile in Connecticut.
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,704.87,705.535,It does not.
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,705.535,705.907,Why not?
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,705.907,708.146,Connecticut could require constitutionally.
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,708.146,710.547,"Alright, it could but it hasn’t you told us."
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,710.547,711.145,It has not.
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,737.419,750.94,"He comes from Timbuktu so long as he was there long enough for an interview, and filled out question 8 (2) that he was a resident in Connecticut and intended to stay there then Connecticut couldn’t require that he’d be a citizen?"
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,750.94,754.127,Connecticut could change its rule and require more about way of residence (Voice Overlap).
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,754.127,759.264,I thought your claim was that Connecticut could not constitutionally require that a person be a citizen.
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,759.264,760.702,It cannot require a citizen.
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,764.199,765.654,But that’s not the issue.
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,765.654,766.29,"No, that is not the issue."
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,766.29,774.684,"The issue in your case, is whether or not the Constitution compels Connecticut to allow somebody to take its Bar exam even though that person is not a citizen."
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,775.553,776.766,That’s what this case is about.
1972.71-1336,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,776.766,790.488,"Isn’t it true that an existing Connecticut law a man could catch a plane from Anchorage, Alaska, change in New York, go to New Haven take the exam and will be admitted?"
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,790.488,793.327,"That is the way the rule is written, yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1336,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,795.082,797.039,And go right back to Anchorage?
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,797.039,799.855,That is the Statement of the rule of the State of Connecticut.
1972.71-1336,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,802.764,812.253,"You say that if somebody came from Canada, did the same thing, he’d be entitled to the same discretion that the person from Anchorage had?"
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,812.253,820.634,"If the Board of Bar Examiners were satisfied that he met the residency requirement under the facts that you stated, he would be certified by the board to that."
1972.71-1336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,824.186,846.467,"Well, Mr. Broiles, basically what you’re saying is that if this sort of fugacious presence is acceptable to the Connecticut Bar examiners on the part to someone coming from Alaska as Mr. Justice Marshall posits, it is a constitutional matter must be acceptable in the same circumstances except that the person comes from Canada or Japan?"
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,846.467,847.303,I’m not sure I understand it.
1972.71-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,871.86,874.739,"But in no event, they can condition it being a citizen?"
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,874.739,878.635,In no event -- may they condition it on being a citizen.
1972.71-1336,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,878.635,894.634,"Mr. Broiles, looking at the other side of this coin, what limitations, if any, are there on the length of time that the petitioner may remain in the United States as an alien?"
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,894.634,897.862,With regard to constitutional considerations by a Bar Examining Committee?
1972.71-1336,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,897.862,905.116,"No, no, present law -- may an alien remain in United States indefinitely?"
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,905.116,912.63,"My client, as a resident alien, a permanent resident alien may reside in the United States indefinitely."
1972.71-1336,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,944.953,948.74,"That’s because she’s married to citizen, is it?"
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,948.74,949.339,"No, Your Honor."
1972.71-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1111.372,1118.804,Would you -- would your position necessarily outlaw the exclusion of aliens from voting?
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,1118.804,1122.968,"It would -- it would not necessarily outlaw it, but I will it this way Your Honor."
1972.71-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1131.849,1132.897,What do you think about that?
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,1132.897,1134.427,I think that it cannot.
1972.71-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1147.843,1150.399,And when that one that you think should be prevail?
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,1150.399,1152.939,"I think that on the facts as I understand, it would prevail, yes Your Honor."
1972.71-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1152.939,1156.02,Alright.
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,1165.335,1166.648,I would take that would one reason.
1972.71-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1166.648,1172.524,"And if that were to be sustained, you might be in more trouble -- that you would have a troublesome case here, wouldn’t you?"
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,1172.524,1176.125,"I would say, it would make my case more troublesome to answer that, yes Your Honor."
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1176.125,1193.939,"It’s a little strange to be saying that a classification that is made in the Constitution itself in many different provisions of the Constitution itself, i.e. between citizens and other persons who are not citizens within the United States, that classification is constitutionally suspect."
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,1221.169,1222.529,"No, I think so, both."
1972.71-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1269.029,1273.545,"But he’s entitled to those same rights as it gives the State, isn’t it?"
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,1273.545,1276.997,Equal protection of the laws and due process or from deportation?
1972.71-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1276.997,1278.022,"From what you just said, yes."
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,1278.022,1282.174,"A State cannot take away if he is entitled, cannot have that taken away."
1972.71-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1282.174,1283.343,State can’t chase him out anyway?
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,1283.343,1289.211,"That’s true, State cannot chase him out."
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1289.211,1294.121,"Thirteenth Amendment, protects all (Inaudible) you were saying."
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,1296.263,1299.206,I realize the Constitution is fully distinguishable.
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1300.846,1302.337,Precisely this distinction --
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,1302.337,1302.712,Yes.
1972.71-1336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1302.712,1304.359,-- is what is my point.
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,1311.23,1317.763,"Would have to meet the test that’s laid down in Graham of showing a compelling interest, yes."
1972.71-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1408.074,1412.255,What oath does the -- does the practitioner in Connecticut take?
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,1412.255,1423.257,The practitioner as an attorney takes the oath that he will not be guilty of any malice or take anybody's money without just representation or allow any fraud to be perpetuated on the Court.
1972.71-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1438.148,1440.345,So long as you remain the citizen?
1972.71-1336,0,38635,r_david_broiles,,1440.345,1441.94,So long as I remain a citizen thereof.
1972.71-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1441.94,1445.379,"So you don’t, so the oath means nothing."

1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,2834.493,2835.374,"No, I didn’t say that."
1972.71-1336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2835.374,2839.799,Do you say are alien has less character than a citizen?
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,2839.799,2848.263,What you’re trying to say is that alienage is an irrational classification per se.
1972.71-1336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2852.303,2859.048,But I am waiting for you give us a reason why we shouldn’t say it and I’m still waiting for that reason.
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,2859.048,2862.57,I’m backing up to the Court.
1972.71-1336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2912.534,2917.676,Am I correct that this applicant has three law degrees?
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,2917.676,2920.602,And there are three degrees.
1972.71-1336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2927.39,2930.714,"Well, didn’t she qualify to understand the rules?"
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,2930.714,2930.871,Oh!
1972.71-1336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2931.387,2935.058,"Well, you said that the lawyer has to understand the rules, well, she’s qualified?"
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,2936.903,2941.755,"I didn’t say she -- it’s obvious, she understood the rules because she so admitted in the transcript."
1972.71-1336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2949.727,2952.966,I’m still trying to get the reason.
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,2958.477,2962.07,"Well, in the first place if Your Honor please, the Court stated really three things."
1972.71-1336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3012.335,3019.475,"Well, this man said he resides in and he is now a resident of Fort Worth, Texas can go up there and serve one right now, am I correct?"
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,3019.475,3022.026,Yes he can sir but he can you can sign that issue.
1972.71-1336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3025.62,3034.104,Where he comes up and serve one and go back to Fort Worth and that doesn’t offend Connecticut at all.
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,3034.104,3034.219,I --
1972.71-1336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3034.219,3038.292,As a matter of fact he could move to Honolulu and come back and do it.
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,3046.415,3053.469,"Well, of course, as long as he retains -- as long as he retains his position in Connecticut."
1972.71-1336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3053.469,3054.375,Alright.
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,3054.375,3063.321,"Whether they are known by the authorities or not and in whatever connection, he is of course clothed with the rights of the office that he has."
1972.71-1336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3063.321,3068.361,Would he lose that if you took out double citizenship?
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,3068.361,3071.151,"Well, of course that would be obviously a question --"
1972.71-1336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3071.151,3072.933,"Would he, under those rules?"
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,3072.933,3078.952,Well there’s no rule here that says that if you can be a citizen of two countries and still be a lawyer and of course --
1972.71-1336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3078.952,3080.034,"Well, is there anything?"
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,3087.508,3090.393,If he gives up his citizenship?
1972.71-1336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3090.393,3099.812,"If he gives his citizenship, his United States citizenship five years from now, does he lose his Bar membership in Connecticut?"
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,3099.812,3099.987,Oh!
1972.71-1336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3101.577,3118.343,"So, that this man can -- who is sitting in there --Mr. Broiles, could go to Netherlands, live in the Netherlands, take out the Netherlands citizenship and he’ll still be able to practice law in Connecticut."
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,3119.382,3123.716,"Well, by what test or standard do you mean?"
1972.71-1336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3123.716,3126.762,Under the -- under the law in Connecticut right now?
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,3126.762,3130.764,"Well, there is no a specific provision that covers any particular case, Your Honor."
1972.71-1336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3130.764,3138.451,"Well, there’s nothing in the law that says once he loses his citizenship, he loses his right to practice law?"
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,3138.451,3143.984,"Well, I assume that that could be considered without any specific reference thereto."
1972.71-1336,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3208.182,3209.714,In those treaties?
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,3209.714,3214.311,It was after 1956.
1972.71-1336,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3214.311,3221.437,"While I have interrupted you Mr. Tiernan, let me ask you one other question which really isn’t here on case but it still bothers me?"
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,3221.437,3222.163,Yes.
1972.71-1336,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3222.163,3238.462,"Am I correct in my understanding that Connecticut in addition to requiring citizenship for attorneys and physicians also requires it for funeral directors, and embalmers, and hairdressers, and barbers, and sanitarian?"
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,3238.462,3248.694,"Yes, that’s what’s listed in the original Court decision of the Supreme Court as a reference of the appendix."
1972.71-1336,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3248.694,3251.333,Is it a fact that this State does this?
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,3251.333,3254.024,There is to the statute so -- still there.
1972.71-1336,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3255.487,3257.715,I did.
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,3257.715,3263.387,"That is becoming moot in Connecticut, but that is a fact that those statutes are still there."
1972.71-1336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3263.387,3267.042,Because there are no barbers?[Laughter]
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,3267.042,3277.07,"You see I come from New Haven, Justice White and the demand is, bless me.[Laughter]"
1972.71-1336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3320.397,3324.56,How is dual citizenship involved here?
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,3324.56,3332.432,"Well, it isn’t because of course this applicant wants it this way, being a citizen of the Netherlands --"
1972.71-1336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3332.432,3335.596,But I don’t -- she doesn’t claim dual citizenship in any?
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,3335.596,3336.242,No.
1972.71-1336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3336.242,3338.294,"Well, how is it in this case?"
1972.71-1336,1,26200,george_tiernan,,3338.294,3339.531,"Well, she’s getting around that."
1972.71-1336,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3400.23,3401.797,Thank you gentlemen.
