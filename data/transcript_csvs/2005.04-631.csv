2005.04-631,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.753,We will now hear argument in Wagnon vs. Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation.
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,5.604,8.873,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,42.875,50.797,"Mr. Olson, may I ask you to go one step beyond that on an issue of fact that I just don't understand from reading the briefs?"
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,123.652,127.784,"I had... I had the same question, Justice Souter, as I was looking at this yesterday."
2005.04-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,163.776,163.776,"Make it up on volume, I think."
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,163.776,167.546,--Maybe they make it up on volume.
2005.04-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,178.688,193.993,"But if... if I may interrupt you... if it's getting passed through, and they're still selling their gas, then there's no... then the tribe cannot make an argument here that their sovereign taxing authority is being compromised or threatened."
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,199.298,200.702,"--Well, I agree with that."
2005.04-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,203.158,206.817,Or want to impose a higher tax.
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,206.817,207.27,--Pardon me?
2005.04-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,207.27,210.016,Or want to impose a higher tax.
2005.04-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,210.016,210.546,Yeah.
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,210.546,211.137,Yes.
2005.04-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,211.137,210.016,Yeah.
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,212.001,210.016,Yeah.
2005.04-631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,242.634,251.819,"Well, but aren't they going to tell us that... as a practical matter, that the tax is really being collected for the retailers?"
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,276.862,277.123,--Yes.
2005.04-631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,277.123,287.653,"And if the tribe view prevails, then the distributor still sends the truck to the stations that are in the State and passes on the tax for those--"
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,287.653,288.105,It's--
2005.04-631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,288.105,288.335,--distributors only.
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,287.653,309.489,"--It's my understanding... and this is explained... the details of this are explained in Section 3410... I can't give you a citation to the record, but the statutes, I'm presuming, are available... that the distributor pays a... pays a tax as a result of taking the fuel down from what they call the rack, and then taking it to various service stations--"
2005.04-631,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,309.489,318.104,"Well, what event triggers, if you will, the incidence of the tax on the distributor?"
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,318.104,309.489,--It's--
2005.04-631,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,309.489,324.433,Is it... is it the obligation... is it the minute the fuel is brought into Kansas?
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,326.709,327.533,--It's--
2005.04-631,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,327.533,328.334,Or is it later?
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,328.334,342.595,"--The statute explicitly says, Justice O'Connor... this is on page 2 of the petition... the incidence of this tax is imposed on the distributor of the first receipt of the motor fuel."
2005.04-631,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,358.283,365.031,"So, the distributor gets the fuel and incurs the obligation at that point, whether or not it's resold."
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,365.031,365.774,That's correct.
2005.04-631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,365.774,376.043,"But doesn't incur it, or gets a credit or gets it back, if it sells to the United States or if it sells out of State."
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,379.462,385.643,"It's... Justice Ginsburg, it is the receipt that triggers the liability for the tax."
2005.04-631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,402.332,404.527,And out of State or abroad--
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,404.527,411.105,"--And out of State, there is a deduction for fuel sold out of State."
2005.04-631,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,418.658,428.477,"Then that's the problem, right there, because I thought... first, there is a tax... you get a credit if you don't sell the fuel to anybody."
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,431.375,431.796,--I don't--
2005.04-631,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,431.796,432.85,--Maybe not--
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,432.85,436.058,"--I think... I would disagree with you, Justice Breyer."
2005.04-631,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,436.058,436.259,--You don't?
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,436.269,440.381,I think it's my understanding that if you sat on that fuel for the next year--
2005.04-631,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,440.381,441.863,You'd still have to pay tax.
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,441.863,441.906,--you'd still have to pay--
2005.04-631,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,441.906,441.996,Okay.
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,441.996,442.167,--the tax.
2005.04-631,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,442.167,442.317,"Now, on--"
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,442.317,442.467,That's my understanding.
2005.04-631,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,442.597,442.788,--All right.
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,442.788,445.977,--with respect to the out of State distribution--
2005.04-631,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,445.977,446.167,Yes.
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,446.167,446.688,--that's because--
2005.04-631,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,446.688,447.09,All right.
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,447.09,448.344,--that fuel is not going to be used on--
2005.04-631,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,448.344,449.065,Fine.
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,449.065,449.639,"--Kansas highways, presumably."
2005.04-631,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,449.639,451.493,You are Kansas.
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,493.365,494.63,"Well, sometimes."
2005.04-631,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,494.63,494.92,"--""# sometimes""."
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,494.92,495.481,The vast--
2005.04-631,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,495.481,497.619,"So, they say... get into interest balancing."
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,497.619,497.809,--Well--
2005.04-631,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,497.809,499.894,"Now, what... now you have the whole argument that I'm thinking of."
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,500.706,506.0,"--Well, one of my responses is that the tribe is located entirely within the State."
2005.04-631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,541.251,545.461,"But, Mr. Olson, would it make any difference if all of the driving was inside the reservation?"
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,546.182,546.933,"--No, we would--"
2005.04-631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,546.933,546.995,--make any difference?
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,546.995,552.481,"--we would argue that it would not make any difference, Justice Stevens, because this is a tax on distributors."
2005.04-631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,574.507,593.574,"--Well, that... that has been what's discussed in the brief, and I think that the court, in Chickasaw, was saying, If the State puts the incidence on the tribe itself, we don't have to look any further."
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,623.91,626.78,"--I... that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-631,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,665.563,675.872,"Well, Mr. Olson, the Solicitor General tells us that... and here we have... you have the statute, but they have the Kaul case that suggests that this tax is imposed on the reservation."
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,675.872,689.07,"But the Kaul case, in the context of deciding whether other retailers there had standing, basically said that there was an economic impact that affected the retailers."
2005.04-631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,761.111,765.925,"Yes, but, again, that would still be true if the incidence... the tax was on the retailer rather than the wholesaler."
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,765.925,767.548,--It still would be true.
2005.04-631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,775.783,782.646,Which the statute contemplates will be collected when the gas is sold to the... by the retailer.
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,782.646,801.67,"--It... what the statute specifically says... this is Section 3409... it says that the distributor may pass on... ""may""... it's a permissive provision... may pass on the cost of the taxation as a part of the cost of doing business."
2005.04-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,812.23,814.074,But what a strange provision.
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,818.948,819.108,I--
2005.04-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,819.108,821.926,"--they ever put that provision in, unless it means something different from--"
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,821.926,826.829,"--I think what it means... I understand, Justice Scalia, and I... because I've had the same reaction,"
2005.04-631,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,885.319,887.064,"Mr. Olson, what does it mean when they say, in law, the"
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,891.667,899.048,"--It is unclear from this court's decisions precisely what ""legal incidence"" means."
2005.04-631,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,937.33,944.481,"Well, I guess the reason for my question is, they look back at the court's decisions and see that it turns on where the incidence of the tax is."
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,951.511,951.932,--Well--
2005.04-631,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,951.932,954.458,"So, it suggests that we shouldn't give too much weight to that."
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,954.458,963.143,"--Well, the bright lawyer in Kansas who may have done that was the Kansas Legislature, following the unanimous decision of this court in Chickasaw Nation, saying,"
2005.04-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1067.055,1069.631,May I go back to one factual nuance on that?
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1083.262,1084.324,That's not my understanding.
2005.04-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1104.472,1118.213,"But isn't that a surrogate for sale to the... well, I guess what I'm getting at, the tax apparently is not payable when the distributor receives the fuel, but only when the distributor transfers the fuel to a retailer."
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1118.213,1118.693,--No.
2005.04-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1119.074,1119.274,No?
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1119.274,1120.305,--That's not my understanding.
2005.04-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1132.171,1134.969,"Well, why would he be drawing it down, except to sell--"
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1134.969,1140.465,"--Well, of course... of course, the distributor is drawing it down to sell fuel to gasoline stations."
2005.04-631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1140.465,1140.465,--Yeah.
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1140.465,1145.228,"It may... there may be some storage involved, there may be other occasions."
2005.04-631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1153.402,1163.773,"Mr. Olson, in terms of the text of the statute that is... the incidence is on the distributor of the first receipt, but then there's this language... and it appears in a few places..."
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1175.474,1193.778,"Well, this is... this is an effort by the legislature to say that fuel, which is going to be used in Kansas, by and large... there's always going to be exceptions... fuel that is used, by and large, in Kansas on the roads of Kansas, shall be subject to a tax so that those roads can be built and maintained."
2005.04-631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1202.834,1213.003,"Does that mean, Mr. Olson, that the tax that the... the fuel, rather, that's sold to the United States Government, later, out of State, when is the credit for the sales out of State made?"
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1218.419,1219.433,I don't know the answer.
2005.04-631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1219.433,1220.013,I couldn't tell from the--
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1220.013,1221.137,"I don't know the answer to that, Justice--"
2005.04-631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1221.137,1226.733,"--It seems to me that might be a way of identifying whether the term ""legal incidence"" really has any significance."
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1226.733,1245.007,"--Well, I would say that the... that if the... this Court's prior decisions have any consistent meaning, that the person who has the obligation to pay the tax, and who might claim some credits or deductions, like we all do when we file our tax returns, the legal incidence of the tax is on us, as taxpayers."
2005.04-631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1250.531,1255.103,"I, sort of, take ""legal incidence"" to mean the duty to pay the tax."
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1272.636,1273.167,--I think--
2005.04-631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1273.167,1274.028,"--subtract, later on?"
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1274.028,1280.716,"--I think, but I can't represent to you know that I know for sure, that that is an accounting process that takes place."
2005.04-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1364.926,1369.328,"--Mr. Olson, you mentioned Section 3410."
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1370.612,1370.872,--Well--
2005.04-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1370.872,1372.837,--I can't find it in anybody's--
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1372.837,1375.805,"--I was not able to find it, either, in the briefs."
2005.04-631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1388.5,1389.041,Mr. Olson--
2005.04-631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1389.041,1389.441,I couldn't either.
2005.04-631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1389.441,1389.762,--could we go back--
2005.04-631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1389.762,1390.423,May I ask... excuse me.
2005.04-631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1390.423,1396.019,--to the question that Justice Souter raised at the outset?
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1451.13,1455.903,"The... it's a matter of economics, Justice Ginsburg, just as your question suggests."
2005.04-631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1473.085,1473.977,But not tax free.
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1492.211,1494.126,"--Well, it wouldn't have to use a tax to do that."
2005.04-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1496.111,1496.121,--Who is it taxing?
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1497.845,1498.136,--It's--
2005.04-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1498.136,1500.482,"I mean, the tribe sells the gas--"
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1500.482,1500.914,--That's--
2005.04-631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1500.914,1501.214,--doesn't it?
2005.04-631,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1501.214,1514.051,"--precisely the point, that the tribe would probably not like to pay the taxes that are paid by the distributor or the refiner or the person that brings the fuel... the petroleum product out of the ground."
2005.04-631,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1543.448,1545.304,"Thank you, Mr. Olson."
2005.04-631,1,28553,ian_heath_gershengorn,,1547.662,1550.6,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"

2005.04-631,1,28553,ian_heath_gershengorn,,2394.607,2395.11,--Your Honor?

2005.04-631,1,28553,ian_heath_gershengorn,,2482.687,2492.425,"--Because this Court has held, in Colville... and we don't dispute here... that when the tribe is marketing an exemption, it has no... it has no... there are no Federal and tribal interests implicated."

2005.04-631,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2823.521,2823.691,--in the record?
2005.04-631,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2823.691,2825.376,That is my understanding of what's happening.
2005.04-631,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2827.591,2829.487,Let's assume... let's assume that is true.
2005.04-631,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2852.375,2868.552,"--I think, for example, in this Court's decision in Colville, where the Court stressed there that the Court was marketing an exemption from State taxation; that portion of the analysis of the Court there did not turn on whether the tribe was imposing its own tax."

2005.04-631,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2909.994,2923.162,"Well, maybe... maybe it contemplated that, and maybe it simply contemplated that that particular... that particular argument against it... i.e., that it was simply selling a tax exemption... would not have been an argument against it."
2005.04-631,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2930.214,2932.85,"--No, but we... but we believe it is a winning argument."

2005.04-631,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3071.407,3073.843,"--Yes, they do."
2005.04-631,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3115.063,3119.256,"Well, why isn't it the sale between whoever is selling it to the distributor and the distributor?"
2005.04-631,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3119.256,3133.538,"--I... because if you look in... it becomes particularly clear if you look at the form that is at the back of the respondent's brief, but we also believe it's clear from the... from the provisions of the statute that are on page 8(a) of the brief."
2005.04-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3175.864,3181.37,It would seem to me exempting distributor to distributor taxes just means that only one distributor has to pay.
2005.04-631,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3181.37,3189.422,"--Only one distributor has to pay, but it means that a sale between the first distributor and the second distributor, for example, is not taxed."
2005.04-631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3189.422,3192.793,"No, but that's because there was a tax on the first sale to the first distributor."
2005.04-631,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3195.382,3196.153,"Actually, there is not."
2005.04-631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3201.449,3209.06,"Yeah, but that's because when a distributor sells to another distributor, he is not acting, for purposes of that sale, as a distributor."
2005.04-631,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3209.06,3211.287,I think that--

2005.04-631,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3243.132,3245.608,"But none of this... none of this mattered to the tenth circuit, though, did it?"
2005.04-631,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3249.48,3250.331,"--Right, that's true."
2005.04-631,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3251.244,3252.136,And you think that was wrong.

2005.04-631,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3308.259,3311.468,--is the general... the general ability to impose a tax.
