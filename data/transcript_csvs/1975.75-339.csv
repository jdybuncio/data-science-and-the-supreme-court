1975.75-339,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,53.664,We will hear arguments next in Buffalo Forge against United Steel Workers.
1975.75-339,0,29727,jeremy_v_cohen,,53.664,58.871,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-339,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,453.08,455.516,That (Inaudible) case is Yellow Transit Systems?
1975.75-339,0,29727,jeremy_v_cohen,,455.516,457.36,Yellow Transit Systems --
1975.75-339,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,457.36,457.939,Is it in the --?
1975.75-339,0,29727,jeremy_v_cohen,,457.939,474.659,It is it in the reply brief as also mentioned in the respondent’s brief.
1975.75-339,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,497.278,500.03,It is Teamsters against Yellow Transit Systems that is the reason I could not find it?
1975.75-339,0,29727,jeremy_v_cohen,,500.03,503.726,"I am sorry, Your Honor."
1975.75-339,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,749.968,757.669,"Mr. Cohen, let me be sure I understand what you just said about the issue that would have been presented to the arbitrator had there been arbitration."
1975.75-339,0,29727,jeremy_v_cohen,,768.195,769.386,It would have been --
1975.75-339,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,769.386,770.081,What would the issue be?
1975.75-339,0,29727,jeremy_v_cohen,,770.081,801.912,"The issue would have been, Mr. Justice Stevens, that the Union’s directive, the Steel Workers’ directives to their local union officials and members to honor the office-workers picket lines was a violation of the No Strike Clause of that contract and that the arbitrator was empowered to determine the union’s disagreement with the company’s position, that is whether the strike, the orders and the ensuing work stoppage were in fact a violation of the no strike pledges in the Collective Bargaining Agreement."
1975.75-339,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,801.912,810.586,Did the Court of Appeals say that the arbitration clause did not reach the stand of the dispute?
1975.75-339,0,29727,jeremy_v_cohen,,810.586,827.961,The Court of Appeals and the District Court neither concluded that the arbitration clause went to the issue of aribitrability of the issue that I have just described to Justice Stevens.
1975.75-339,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,830.007,832.211,This kind of a dispute was not arbitrable?
1975.75-339,0,29727,jeremy_v_cohen,,832.211,843.179,"No, they said that this was not the kind of arbitrable dispute which would permit the granting of an injunction since it would not be an aid of the arbitration processes."
1975.75-339,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,860.575,864.443,"I thought that if it is not a live grievance though, it is un-arbitrable, is it?"
1975.75-339,0,29727,jeremy_v_cohen,,864.443,865.386,Oh! Very much so.
1975.75-339,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,867.918,871.176,"Where does the clause, the arbitration clause appear in the record here?"
1975.75-339,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,871.176,876.201,"At page 13 (a), I think (Inaudible) in the petition?"
1975.75-339,0,29727,jeremy_v_cohen,,876.201,904.751,"In the appendix -- well, in the appendix on page 16, there is the No Strike Clause and on page 17 paragraph 26 of the agreement, there is the definition of arbitrable grievance and any dispute or any trouble of any kind arising in the plant, there was in the District Court’s decision --"
1975.75-339,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,904.751,906.074,(Inaudible)
1975.75-339,0,29727,jeremy_v_cohen,,906.074,907.163,"Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan?"
1975.75-339,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,907.163,922.114,"Taking is there or is there not a determination either District Court or the Court of Appeals that Article 26 does not reach, does not make arbitrable this dispute?"
1975.75-339,0,29727,jeremy_v_cohen,,922.114,922.602,"No, there is no such --"
1975.75-339,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,922.602,923.865,There is no such holding.
1975.75-339,0,29727,jeremy_v_cohen,,923.865,925.28,"No, there is a statement in the District Court --"
1975.75-339,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,925.28,928.017,"If there was such a holding, would you be here?"
1975.75-339,0,29727,jeremy_v_cohen,,928.017,928.916,No.
1975.75-339,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,928.916,935.545,Because then I gather that as an interpretation of the clause which we are not likely to review again?
1975.75-339,0,29727,jeremy_v_cohen,,935.545,943.775,"No, if the Court were to decide that the Arbitration Clause did not cover this dispute, then in no way could an injunction be in aid of the arbitration process."
1975.75-339,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,943.775,947.672,And your position is that the Court did not decide it or it did not reach dispute?
1975.75-339,0,29727,jeremy_v_cohen,,949.92,952.067,It did not decide that either.
1975.75-339,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,954.385,957.177,Did it decide that as am initial question in here?
1975.75-339,0,29727,jeremy_v_cohen,,957.177,958.17,"No, you do not."
1975.75-339,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1018.264,1028.193,"But what is the No Strike Clause here had been absolutely plain on its face, so that it was clear the union was breaching it by engaging in this sympathy strike."
1975.75-339,0,29727,jeremy_v_cohen,,1033.255,1037.042,"I would say it would be stronger, Your Honor."
1975.75-339,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1037.042,1046.05,In effect that any strike that is a breach of contract in effect whether it is a breach of the Union’s No Strike Clause can be enjoined?
1975.75-339,0,29727,jeremy_v_cohen,,1046.05,1049.872,"No, I am not saying that."
1975.75-339,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1134.943,1149.992,"So in answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question, if the breach of the Collective Bargaining Agreement were very, very clear then there would be no -- then it could not be enjoined?"
