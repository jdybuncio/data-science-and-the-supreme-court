1964.17_orig,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,38.562,"Number 17 Original, State of Nebraska, Plaintiff, versus State of Iowa."
1964.17_orig,0,27627,howard_h_moldenhauer,,41.528,44.702,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.17_orig,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,435.457,438.09,"Mr. Moldenhauer, may I ask you?"
1964.17_orig,0,27627,howard_h_moldenhauer,,443.221,447.261,"Your Honor, the line was defined in the Compact as the middle of --"
1964.17_orig,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,447.261,447.459,Yes.
1964.17_orig,0,27627,howard_h_moldenhauer,,447.459,449.781,-- the main channel as it existed on these maps.
1964.17_orig,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,449.781,450.666,Yes.
1964.17_orig,0,27627,howard_h_moldenhauer,,450.666,465.963,I think it's our position that this created an artificial line but it is a little difficult to tell in many places where this line is because the maps which were on file and referred to had a scale of one inch equals to 2640 feet.
1964.17_orig,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,504.563,515.191,"Well, may I ask, is there a dispute between Nebraska and Iowa as to which state this particular piece of property is in?"
1964.17_orig,0,27627,howard_h_moldenhauer,,515.191,518.705,There is not Your Honor except as to 50 feet.
1964.17_orig,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,534.619,535.065,Yes.
1964.17_orig,0,27627,howard_h_moldenhauer,,535.065,540.365,"In the other case, the land is with the exception of the westerly 50 feet."
1964.17_orig,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,567.38,568.702,As to that 50 feet?
1964.17_orig,0,27627,howard_h_moldenhauer,,568.702,584.373,"As to that 50 feet particularly and we think that the fact that they have taken that position is indicative of -- of course, Iowa's entire approach to the Compact because we'll go into our contentions as to Iowa's unilateral approach towards this -- towards the interpretation of this Compact."
1964.17_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,2535.044,2542.141,"Honorable Chief Justice, Honorable Associate Justices, may it please the Court."
1964.17_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2591.844,2594.213,Do any of those cases involved Compacts here?
1964.17_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,2594.213,2595.33,No they did not Your Honor.
1964.17_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2596.104,2602.2,"So in that sense, as regard to the application of that principle, this is the first time that question has been here, is it?"
1964.17_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,2602.2,2633.474,"To my understanding, this is the first time that this precise question and this state of facts as made up by the complaint and the answer that has been before this Court for in all boundary cases where this Court has assumed jurisdiction, there has either been a question of the validity of the Compact or as to the location whereas in this instance by legislation and ratification and with the consent of the Congress, the boundary was established and we feel nothing for this Court to determine in that respect."
1964.17_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2633.474,2644.026,"Well, I suppose you're going to explain why Nebraska doesn't have an interest in enforcing Iowa's promise into this compact."
1964.17_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,2644.026,2655.374,"Your Honor, we feel that first of all by virtue of Nebraska (Inaudible) law, the common law of Nebraska invest title to the bed of the stream --"
1964.17_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2655.374,2658.799,"Well, let's just concede that Nebraska has no interest in any of these lands."
1964.17_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,2661.217,2661.845,Yes.
1964.17_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2661.845,2666.761,No interest in any of the land and that the only people that have any interest in the land are private parties.
1964.17_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,2670.286,2688.721,"I say this Your Honor for the reason that in the complaint as stated by the State of Nebraska, they are asking for what they call a construction of Section 3 apparently of the Iowa and Nebraska Boundary Compact which merely provides that the State of Iowa will recognize those titles which are good in Nebraska."
1964.17_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2688.721,2701.075,"Well, they alleged that Iowa is not living up to its promise to recognize those titles and admitting that Nebraska has no interest in the -- in that land, doesn't own any interest in the lands."
1964.17_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,2723.466,2725.204,Of course we say that --
1964.17_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2725.204,2733.136,"I know you deny it but let's -- but the claim is made and you have to accept that it's true on its face, don't you?"
1964.17_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,2733.136,2744.982,"Well, I would assume then that for that purpose, if assuming that the complaint is true in that respect, just for the purposes of arguing jurisdiction."
1964.17_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2754.392,2755.972,"Well, it's got contracting parties and that --"
1964.17_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,2755.972,2756.829,That's correct.
1964.17_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2764.495,2774.307,"Well if that's true, then here, we've got Iowa -- Nebraska saying, â€œYou broke your promise about two pieces of the land""."
1964.17_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,2800.319,2819.833,"Well, not entirely because I think if we could examine their entire complaint and the matter submitted in connection there with that we'll find out that there are not facts sufficiently clear and presently submitted by the State of Nebraska to warrant invoking the jurisdiction of this Court in connection with that particular allegation."
1964.17_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2819.833,2822.863,But if there were?
1964.17_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,2822.863,2823.097,If there were --
1964.17_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2823.097,2833.744,"The mere fact that -- the mere -- if there were sufficient facts alleged, the mere fact that Iowa -- that Nebraska doesn't have an interest in the land isn't going to --"
1964.17_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,2833.744,2846.136,"No, I would say that is correct, the mere lack of ownership in the land."
1964.17_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3231.833,3251.818,"In view of the argument that you're making now, I don't understand the answer you gave to Justice Brennan or Justice White that you did not regard the question of Nebraska having no interest in this land as such itself as a state was dispositive of the original jurisdiction question."
1964.17_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,3251.818,3253.598,And not entirely.
1964.17_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3299.358,3310.117,"Well, then as I understand that you are saying that the controlling question is the lack of interest in the point of view of original jurisdiction, the lack of interest that Nebraska has in this land."
1964.17_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,3310.117,3311.569,"For certain purposes, yes (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.17_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3311.569,3313.793,"You might not understand the qualification, is that it?"
1964.17_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,3313.793,3314.405,"Well, then --"
1964.17_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3314.405,3318.266,"Excuse me, (Inaudible) -- I'm sorry."
1964.17_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,3318.266,3334.754,"I'm saying that if the State of Nebraska were the owner of this land, then the only court that could hear this dispute would be this Court because they would then be the real party in interest without question."
1964.17_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3363.271,3368.108,(Inaudible) because this if they have not pleaded a breach.
1964.17_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,3368.108,3368.371,That is correct.
1964.17_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3368.371,3372.179,"Exactly pleaded a breach, then your -- I think (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.17_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,3372.179,3374.961,We claim that the bill of complaint in of itself --
1964.17_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3374.961,3380.899,"But if you look at the bill of complaint they have not pleaded the breach of the Compact, is that what you're saying?"
1964.17_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,3380.899,3382.988,The complaint coupled with the matters submitted with it.
1964.17_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3382.988,3383.494,Yes.
1964.17_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3383.494,3389.771,"Well, then you're really saying that we ought to be ruling here on a motion to dismiss not based on jurisdiction."
1964.17_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,3392.349,3395.544,"Well, I'm saying -- I won't say both Your Honor."
1964.17_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3395.544,3405.724,"Oh, I understand that but you're -- but the -- but -- do you say if there were -- that there isn't any jurisdiction because he has completed the brief."
1964.17_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,3405.724,3409.17,"No, I can't say that."
1964.17_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3414.507,3421.835,"Well, what -- where do you -- on what do you base your claim that there is -- that the Court has no jurisdiction in this case?"
1964.17_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,3430.89,3437.265,"Oh, perhaps, I should be saying that the Court does have jurisdiction but it should not be exercised for these reasons."
1964.17_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3437.265,3440.833,"Oh, because of the insufficiency of the factual allegation."
1964.17_orig,1,16091,attorney_general,,3440.833,3442.602,That is one allegation.
1964.17_orig,2,27627,howard_h_moldenhauer,,5188.149,5190.182,We only have a few short comments Your Honor.
