1971.70-5025,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,15.48,"5025, Haines against Kerner."
1971.70-5025,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,19.524,23.112,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-5025,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,80.386,82.132,"Where was he, at State Ville or?"
1971.70-5025,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,82.132,83.045,He was in Menard.
1971.70-5025,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,83.045,84.921,Menard.
1971.70-5025,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,84.921,91.197,At the time he had a foot disability for which he had been awarded compensation by the Illinois Industrial Commission.
1971.70-5025,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,324.986,326.882,Mr. Bass I am just a little curious.
1971.70-5025,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,329.977,338.075,The record does not show what happened to Dorothy and Moore in terms of whether or not they were punished or prosecuted nor does the record show if Haines was ever prosecuted.
1971.70-5025,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,342.119,343.347,Do you know?
1971.70-5025,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,343.347,344.161,I do not know.
1971.70-5025,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,359.527,362.864,You said there has been no hearing in this case?
1971.70-5025,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,362.864,365.744,We said that there was a disciplinary hearing.
1971.70-5025,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,365.744,368.937,"No, in the District Court was there hearing?"
1971.70-5025,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,368.937,373.476,The District Court summarily dismiss under the motion of the defendants to dismiss.
1971.70-5025,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,581.821,588.686,"Would you clarify for me Mr. Bass, I am a little confused by something that you just said."
1971.70-5025,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,597.169,599.198,Well he refused to explain his actions.
1971.70-5025,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,772.452,783.145,"Mr. Bass, he was -- in fact that no reasons were given for the punishment really does not make this case very unusual?"
1971.70-5025,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,795.674,797.811,"Well, I was leading for another point Mr. Justice Stewart."
1971.70-5025,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,797.811,799.851,Not such a procedural due process claim?
1971.70-5025,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,799.851,825.867,"To the extent to which the Federal Courts might defer to administer determinations which are based upon sound procedural basis then it may be that if it can be shown that there were statements of reasons that they are adequate procedures, the Federal Courts might then not undertake to review every single situation, but what we have as here a situation where no reasons were given without any explanations to whether or not that would have been impossible."
1971.70-5025,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,830.626,837.447,You mean give reasons why they impose ten days in solitary confinement rather than 12 or rather than eight?
1971.70-5025,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,837.447,837.965,I believe some --
1971.70-5025,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,837.965,865.213,"If so this makes it much different from the ordinary criminal process where no states, where juries set the punishment, no reason is ever given and/or ascertainable and in those state, those jurisdictions where the federal judge or where the judge in a federal system or in the state systems where the judge imposes the punishment, he quite typically does not give reasons why he imposes a sentence of two years rather two-and-a-half or three rather than one-and-a-half."
1971.70-5025,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,865.213,871.673,"Well, the alternatives to no reason is that the Federal Courts will then have sufficient to the cases is to determine what the reasons were applied."
1971.70-5025,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,871.673,872.899,Why?
1971.70-5025,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,872.899,876.512,In order to ascertain whether or not there was an impermissible basis of punishment.
1971.70-5025,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,879.917,885.9,In the whole -- in reviewing State Criminal convictions and Federal Criminal convictions.
1971.70-5025,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,902.031,912.312,"Well, in the event that the Court does not require a statement of reasons be given that it would be necessary then in individual cases to ascertain exactly what the basis was."
1971.70-5025,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,919.29,921.761,You mean as to why he was punished at all?
1971.70-5025,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,921.761,925.542,Why he is punished at all or why he was punished to the extent to which he was punished?
1971.70-5025,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,925.542,930.445,"Well, that is the second part that I do not understand."
1971.70-5025,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,930.445,954.87,"We would simply submit that it may be required by due process and perhaps more important, it will enable to Federal Courts to ascertain whether or not the case does present the constitutional infirmity raised by the prisoner, but in any of that we would suggest that the way that the dilemma that the inmate has can be resolved is suggested by the District of Columbia Circuit decision in Nelson versus Hart."
1971.70-5025,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1094.005,1096.347,"Very well, Mr. Bass."
1971.70-5025,1,46315,warren_k_smoot,,1101.053,1106.99,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court and may it please the Court.
1971.70-5025,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1251.428,1258.231,Were the prison regulations published and disseminated upon the prison population?
1971.70-5025,1,46315,warren_k_smoot,,1258.231,1258.917,"Yes sir, Your Honor."
1971.70-5025,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1277.534,1279.582,Is that Rule 19 or is it the guidebook?
1971.70-5025,1,46315,warren_k_smoot,,1279.582,1281.185,"It is in the respondent’s brief, Your Honor."
1971.70-5025,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1282.914,1284.744,Thank you.
1971.70-5025,1,46315,warren_k_smoot,,1284.744,1288.952,"After the hearing, giving Mr. Haines the chance –"
1971.70-5025,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1288.952,1292.554,Does the regulation provide for the hearing?
1971.70-5025,1,46315,warren_k_smoot,,1292.554,1298.564,"I do not think it does, Your Honor, but it is the policy for the penitentiary to have a hearing for all serious rule infractions."
1971.70-5025,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1319.792,1323.899,By impartial that is someone who was not connected with the particular incident?
1971.70-5025,1,46315,warren_k_smoot,,1323.899,1325.103,"That is true, Your Honor."
1971.70-5025,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1499.116,1504.895,"Mr. Smoot, what was he punished for, not answering the question or for hitting the man over the head?"
1971.70-5025,1,46315,warren_k_smoot,,1504.895,1510.653,There is no question that the record supports that he was punished for the rule infraction.
1971.70-5025,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1510.653,1512.787,"Well, where is that in the record?"
1971.70-5025,1,46315,warren_k_smoot,,1512.787,1518.545,"Well, I think it is a reasonable assumption to make it if an inmate strikes another inmate over the head with a shovel."
1971.70-5025,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1525.075,1530.918,Was it possible that he was punished for not saying he did it?
1971.70-5025,1,46315,warren_k_smoot,,1530.918,1533.012,Not in this situation.
1971.70-5025,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1534.615,1535.756,Why is it an impossible?
1971.70-5025,1,46315,warren_k_smoot,,1535.756,1546.289,"Alright, it could be possible but it is not logical in this situation that he was punished for not -- he already admitted the rule violation, so he was not silent in this situation."
1971.70-5025,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1554.293,1554.966,"Oh, you do?"
1971.70-5025,1,46315,warren_k_smoot,,1554.966,1556.596,Yes sir.
1971.70-5025,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1699.95,1701.763,With the same -- same utensil?
1971.70-5025,1,46315,warren_k_smoot,,1701.763,1702.536,Same unit Your Honor.
1971.70-5025,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1703.109,1704.553,It was a toilet and a wash basin?
1971.70-5025,1,46315,warren_k_smoot,,1704.553,1706.041,"Yes, there is one unit there installed."
1971.70-5025,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1723.249,1727.112,"Well then you say that is a policy, you are just telling us that?"
1971.70-5025,1,46315,warren_k_smoot,,1727.112,1727.775,That is right Your Honor.
1971.70-5025,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,2800.35,2803.433,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1971.70-5025,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2864.769,2865.841,Thank you Mr. Bass.
1971.70-5025,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,2875.788,2876.611,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-5025,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2876.611,2877.192,Thank you gentlemen.
