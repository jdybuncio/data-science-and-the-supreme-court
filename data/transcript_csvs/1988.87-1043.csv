1988.87-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.559,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 87-1043, United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises."
1988.87-1043,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,11.762,16.525,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,322.603,325.853,"Mr. Wallace, to what kinds of property does the government's tax lien extend?"
1988.87-1043,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,325.853,345.954,"Well, typically to real property and any other assets to which a security interest could attach, the same as is true of many commercial liens today that are created by agreement."
1988.87-1043,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,472.401,473.448,"Mr. Wallace, can I interrupt for just a second?"
1988.87-1043,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,479.962,483.039,--Yes.
1988.87-1043,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,483.039,485.709,"The words ""such claim"" are used repeatedly in the sentence."
1988.87-1043,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,485.709,493.566,"I believe that the ""such"" refers back to the fact that the claim has to be an oversecured claim--"
1988.87-1043,1,28508,i_william_cohen,,1626.364,1639.733,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1043,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1681.279,1690.806,"Is that true, Mr. Cohen, in a case where you have the Bankruptcy Code of 1978 that really was out to change a whole lot of things?"
1988.87-1043,1,28508,i_william_cohen,,1694.946,1700.224,"We believe, Your Honor, that Section 506(b) did codify pre-Code law."
1988.87-1043,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1707.753,1709.096,But that's not how it reads.
1988.87-1043,1,28508,i_william_cohen,,1740.396,1762.074,"--Well, the voluntary lien, Justice, was a lien that would be created by agreement, and the reason that the Section 506(b) adopts the pre-Code law is the rationale behind that was to allow secured creditors only if they negotiated for, only if they bargained for interest to be entitled to interest."
1988.87-1043,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1763.137,1767.65,Are you saying the pre-Code law did require that the agreement contain a provision for interest?
1988.87-1043,1,28508,i_william_cohen,,1767.65,1768.51,"--Yes, I am."
1988.87-1043,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1768.51,1769.946,Which of those cases say that?
1988.87-1043,1,28508,i_william_cohen,,1769.946,1784.877,"The five court of appeals cases, all the courts of appeal decisions that dealt with the issue of whether or not a tax lien was entitled to interest stated that it was required to be included in the agreement."
1988.87-1043,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1790.937,1800.215,They certainly have a basis to--
1988.87-1043,1,28508,i_william_cohen,,1800.215,1826.282,"--The Bass case; the Boston and Maine Corporation case, which was a First Circuit case; the Kerber Packing Company Case, which was the Seventh Circuit case; the Harrington case, Fourth Circuit; and the Mighell case, which was the Tenth Circuit."
1988.87-1043,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1840.012,1855.631,"--May I ask you, because you seem to disagree with Mr. Wallace on what the pre-Code law was, are the cases that you just called our attention to cases in which the government was making a claim for interest, or are those cases in which a private secured creditor was asking for it?"
1988.87-1043,1,28508,i_william_cohen,,1855.631,1860.55,"Always, in all of those cases, the government is making a claim for interest."
1988.87-1043,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1861.861,1870.67,"Do you have any cases involving private creditors who were claiming interest, and they said... and the court said no, you can't have it because it's not in your agreement."
1988.87-1043,1,28508,i_william_cohen,,1874.342,1892.505,"--I'm not aware of any, Your Honor, but I believe that the reason that Mr. Wallace is making the distinction is that he is overlooking the rationale for the decision, the rationale for the requirement that a creditor must be a consensual creditor in order to be entitled to interest."
1988.87-1043,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1892.505,1894.238,What is the rationale?
1988.87-1043,1,28508,i_william_cohen,,1895.254,1905.189,"That in order to be able to share interest, to be entitled to interest before other creditors get paid, you have to have bargained for interest."
1988.87-1043,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1935.426,1939.799,"Gee, but that doesn't seem to me in accord with what the law usually does."
1988.87-1043,1,28508,i_william_cohen,,1951.966,1955.011,"The general rule is that interest stops on the date of bankruptcy, Your Honor."
1988.87-1043,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1960.697,1961.775,That's what you're telling me.
1988.87-1043,1,28508,i_william_cohen,,1961.775,1962.462,Yes.
1988.87-1043,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1962.462,1973.457,"But I'm saying that seems to me contrary, the fact that it has to be spelled out in the agreement and that it's not enough that the agreement is simply consensual, so that it would be an implied term."
1988.87-1043,1,28508,i_william_cohen,,1976.768,1977.127,"No, it is not."
1988.87-1043,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3393.468,3420.082,"The very first of the pre-Code cases we cite on page 25, In re Kerber, is one in which the court of appeals said that the exception has been recognized by the courts to the extent of allowing post-bankruptcy interest to creditors who are deemed to have bargained for collateral to secure not only the principal obligation but the interest thereon as well."
1988.87-1043,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3484.62,3510.453,"Mr. Wallace, am I correct that you no more can point for us to a pre-Code case which denied interest on a consensual secured claim because interest was not specified in the agreement than can the other side point to a case which granted it?"
1988.87-1043,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3510.453,3512.483,"I cannot, Mr. Justice."
