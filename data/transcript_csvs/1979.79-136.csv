1979.79-136,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,54.976,"We will hear arguments next in Diamond, Commissioner of Patents v. Chakrabarty."
1979.79-136,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,59.516,62.994,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-136,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,104.564,108.728,"We are pretty well bound by the statute in that area, aren't we, anyway?"
1979.79-136,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,108.728,111.482,"That is our view, Mr. Justice."
1979.79-136,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,226.037,227.947,"I didn't understand the word you used, Mr. Wallace."
1979.79-136,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,227.947,232.432,Inoculum -- i-n-o-c-u-l-u-m.
1979.79-136,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,232.432,233.456,"Not ""innocuous""?"
1979.79-136,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,233.456,234.164,No.
1979.79-136,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,393.75,406.055,"Mr. Wallace, do you think that when Congress passed the patent statute in the 1790's it foresaw telephone, radio, television and that sort of thing?"
1979.79-136,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,406.055,417.237,"Not at all, Mr. Justice, and as I just said we do think the patent law applies to claims involving new technology so long as the claims are within the statutory category."
1979.79-136,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,417.237,422.466,I mean it was to reward inventors who saw things that Congress didn't see --
1979.79-136,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,422.466,422.602,Well --
1979.79-136,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,422.602,424.651,-- that patent laws were passed.
1979.79-136,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,424.651,434.412,The reason I mentioned this sentence is because this case really involves a considerable variant on this sentence.
1979.79-136,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,445.623,448.805,"Others don't think we are talking about an extension of the patent law, either."
1979.79-136,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,448.805,450.261,"Well, we do think --"
1979.79-136,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,450.261,450.869,I know.
1979.79-136,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,453.521,476.183,"Our contention is that this would be an extension unforeseen by Congress but not an area wholly unforeseen by Congress, because for the last 50 years Congress has dealt quite specifically with hybridization of living organisms in patent statutes."
1979.79-136,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,532.557,536.512,Are penicillin and yeast patented?
1979.79-136,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,536.512,553.852,So far as I am aware there have been patents issued on some medicines involving living organisms but I don't know of any patent on a particular strain of yeast.
1979.79-136,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,591.351,606.493,I take it from your response that the patents listed on page 50 of your friend's brief running from 1873 to 1930 you think are not relevant to --
1979.79-136,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,606.493,618.955,"We have dealt with all of those that preceded the 1960's in the appendix to our reply brief, Mr. Justice."
1979.79-136,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,705.735,709.005,"Living organisms would be products of nature, would they not?"
1979.79-136,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,709.005,710.11,Many of them would be.
1979.79-136,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,710.11,721.621,It is conceded and very clear that section 101 of the Act does not make patentable any product of nature.
1979.79-136,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,721.621,737.284,But what Congress has dealt with for the past 50 years are man-made hybrids that do no occur in nature and the extent to which patentability should be available on those organisms.
1979.79-136,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,984.105,1006.043,"Going back to Secretary Hyde's letter, Mr. Wallace, what significance do you place on what would appear to be very carefully chosen words that at the present time are understood to cover -- ""are understood"" -- if there were holdings that were perfectly clear he wouldn't have used that language, would he?"
1979.79-136,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1006.043,1010.564,"There was no court holding, that is correct."
1979.79-136,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1047.287,1055.769,If you were looking for an expert of patent laws would you -- would the Secretary of Agriculture come to your mind right away?
1979.79-136,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1055.769,1059.309,Of course he is not the foremost expert.
1979.79-136,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1060.671,1063.997,"He is not necessarily an expert at all, is he?"
1979.79-136,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1066.216,1066.962,"Well, he --"
1979.79-136,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1066.962,1068.095,If any.
1979.79-136,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1068.095,1071.59,He was informed.
1979.79-136,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1191.473,1192.714,"At what date, now?"
1979.79-136,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1192.714,1194.581,1940.
1979.79-136,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1199.153,1212.882,Is it not pretty clear that the developments in the 40 years since then have been of such magnitude that they would not have even been in the imagination of people at that time?
1979.79-136,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1212.882,1226.514,"The premise of that decision was that the claimant had devised in a laboratory a new strain of bacteria, the same claim being made by Chakrabarty."
1979.79-136,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1554.919,1568.094,I take it there was no explanation in the legislative history of why this plant language was added to a predecessor of 101.
1979.79-136,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1587.41,1601.092,There was no indication in the 1930 legislative history of why the language was being added to section 4886 of the revised statute rather than enacted separately.
1979.79-136,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1624.227,1633.769,Isn't it equally arguable that this recital that you have been going over shows a state of uncertainty about the coverage?
1979.79-136,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1633.769,1646.084,"Well, that would be enough for us to win our case under this Court's decisions, because in the absence of a clear and certain signal the Court has said twice recently that the patent law should not be extended."
1979.79-136,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1646.084,1647.618,I am not talking about the statute now.
1979.79-136,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1650.856,1651.935,"Well, --"
1979.79-136,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1651.935,1656.216,That merely shows there was uncertainty at that time.
1979.79-136,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1656.216,1670.039,There may have been uncertainty but there is no indication that anyone in Congress thought that patents could be secured other than under the Plant Patent Act and the Plant Variety Protection Act.
1979.79-136,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1718.657,1720.359,Mr. McKie.
1979.79-136,1,22741,edward_f_mckie_jr,,1720.359,1724.142,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1830.481,1839.997,"Well, if you -- under 101 if you just discover a new microorganism is it patentable?"
1979.79-136,1,22741,edward_f_mckie_jr,,1839.997,1842.364,"That depends, Mr. Justice White, on --"
1979.79-136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1842.364,1846.069,I mean you find it and you try to patent it just the way you found it.
1979.79-136,1,22741,edward_f_mckie_jr,,1846.069,1852.262,"If you mean that it existed previously in nature, I think you could not for the reason that it would have been a product of nature."
1979.79-136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1852.262,1854.916,And where is that exclusion in 101?
1979.79-136,1,22741,edward_f_mckie_jr,,1854.916,1856.358,It is not expressly mentioned.
1979.79-136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1859.7,1862.494,Just one of those things in the air.
1979.79-136,1,22741,edward_f_mckie_jr,,1862.494,1863.831,"I think that that is correct, Mr. Justice White."
1979.79-136,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1863.831,1868.198,"It does not fall under any of the language of 101, does it?"
1979.79-136,1,22741,edward_f_mckie_jr,,1870.112,1870.55,"Well, it --"
1979.79-136,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1870.55,1873.881,You discover a composition of matter.
1979.79-136,1,22741,edward_f_mckie_jr,,1873.881,1877.472,"I think that would be the closest, discover a composition of matter."
1979.79-136,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1877.472,1880.552,"The word ""discover"" meant something else from what it means now."
1979.79-136,1,22741,edward_f_mckie_jr,,1880.552,1883.042,That may well be the case.
1979.79-136,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2028.556,2036.995,"Your reference on page 50, the list of cases from 1873 to 1930 is directed at that point?"
1979.79-136,1,22741,edward_f_mckie_jr,,2036.995,2041.575,"That is one of the items of evidence that we have adduced, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.79-136,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2242.195,2243.392,Can I interrupt you on that.
1979.79-136,1,22741,edward_f_mckie_jr,,2267.801,2270.351,"Yes, I would but only to a limited degree."
1979.79-136,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2270.351,2270.476,I see.
1979.79-136,1,22741,edward_f_mckie_jr,,2270.476,2275.894,Most of those patents do claim something in addition to the living thing.
1979.79-136,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2277.85,2278.086,"Yes, I understand that."
1979.79-136,1,22741,edward_f_mckie_jr,,2278.086,2282.052,-- claimed only living things and the three additional patents that they refer to.
1979.79-136,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2694.191,2698.564,May I ask question on the 1930 legislation.
1979.79-136,1,22741,edward_f_mckie_jr,,2711.001,2714.487,"No, I don't think it would be for this additional reason."
1979.79-136,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2725.438,2726.554,I understand that.
1979.79-136,1,22741,edward_f_mckie_jr,,2748.411,2749.009,Well --
1979.79-136,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2749.009,2753.219,You would have then demonstrated the Patent Office had been wrong in its narrow view of the statute.
1979.79-136,1,22741,edward_f_mckie_jr,,2753.219,2756.74,"I think not, and for this reason, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1979.79-136,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2802.952,2817.685,"Do you contend that there is a different standard of patentability, whether it be novelty or invention or non-obvious or whatever the term might be, under the Plant Patent Act than there would be for living things like bacteria?"
1979.79-136,1,22741,edward_f_mckie_jr,,2817.685,2830.349,"The Plant Patent Act calls for a different variety, which is a different kind of problem than unobviousness, I think."
1979.79-136,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2884.602,2887.424,Are plants any harder to describe than bacteria?
1979.79-136,1,22741,edward_f_mckie_jr,,2887.424,2888.846,"Yes, indeed."
1979.79-136,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2929.99,2945.878,"Prior to the Plant Act what would you have said a new plant was, a composition of matter; you had discovered a new composition of matter?"
1979.79-136,1,22741,edward_f_mckie_jr,,2947.517,2959.201,"I would think that but for the prior decisions which indicated that it was a product of nature, I would have claimed it as either a composition of matter or a manufacture."
1979.79-136,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2959.201,2980.371,"And now that -- and after the amendment, section 4886, I suppose then there would be some kind of new plants that would not be patentable under that section, I mean that limited the patentability of the plants to those described in the section."
1979.79-136,1,22741,edward_f_mckie_jr,,2980.371,2983.124,I would think that is a probable interpretation of the section.
1979.79-136,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2983.124,2987.778,Even though they might have been new compositions of matter.
1979.79-136,1,22741,edward_f_mckie_jr,,2987.778,2991.716,"Well, I think they would not have been, for the reason that they would have been products of nature."
1979.79-136,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3015.311,3029.231,Before we had brand breeders -- human beings -- wasn't this evolutionary process taking place in nature and when the human beings got into the act they accelerated it and refined it.
1979.79-136,1,22741,edward_f_mckie_jr,,3031.09,3031.853,"I think that is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.79-136,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3031.853,3038.434,And that is why -- that is the basis of the rule that products of nature were not dependable.
1979.79-136,1,22741,edward_f_mckie_jr,,3039.073,3040.189,It may well be the case.
1979.79-136,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3143.103,3145.628,"You have about three minutes left, Mr. Wallace."
1979.79-136,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3145.628,3151.638,Respondent's bacteria were not produced from inanimate materials.
1979.79-136,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3187.02,3190.325,But the resulting microorganism did not occur in nature.
1979.79-136,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3190.325,3195.977,That is correct that is what it has in common with the products of the plant breeders.
1979.79-136,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3237.358,3251.935,Your colleague suggests that at this stage of the case that absence the Plant Protection Act that you have in effect abandoned your argument that any living thing cannot be patented.
1979.79-136,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3251.935,3253.844,We haven't abandoned it at all.
1979.79-136,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3281.088,3284.053,Process involved only an organism.
1979.79-136,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3284.053,3289.881,"Well, the use of an organism in combination with other materials and the process would specify that."
1979.79-136,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3289.881,3292.472,What is the difference; what is the significance?
1979.79-136,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3292.472,3315.614,"The significance of the difference is that if you exclude others from being able to produce a living organism or to offspring of the organism because someone is granted a monopoly on the organism itself, it is an unprecedented extension of patent monopoly to the biological offspring of living organisms."
1979.79-136,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3365.687,3386.272,"If one looks -- putting that immediate problem to one side -- if one looks at the basic reasons for patents and the encouraging of research and development and also encouraging disclosure of those things that have been discovered, what is the essential difference between bacterium and some new chemicals, say a new acid?"
1979.79-136,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3386.272,3404.729,"Well, the essential difference is the bacterium like other things engages in genetic cellular reproduction which in the case of a microorganism means reproducing the entire organism."
1979.79-136,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3429.257,3432.505,You fear incubation of the spores or something of that nature?
1979.79-136,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3432.505,3435.519,"Well, it isn't a fear."
1979.79-136,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3462.339,3467.245,"I suppose if these are patentable then every time they reproduce they infringe the patent, don't they?"
1979.79-136,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3467.245,3470.388,"Well, there are difficulties of --"
1979.79-136,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3470.388,3471.429,"Well, wouldn't that be technically correct?"
1979.79-136,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3471.429,3474.238,-- fitting into the conception of the present patent law.
1979.79-136,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3526.223,3539.949,"Do they have a patent issued for the process of putting one of these -- putting these plasmas in one of the microorganisms and creating a new microorganism, the process of doing it?"
1979.79-136,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3541.185,3541.891,The particular process --
1979.79-136,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3541.891,3548.358,-- whether it was feasible or not as a legal matter you have indicated that that kind of a process patent would be all right.
1979.79-136,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3548.358,3550.055,They were allowed in this case.
1979.79-136,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3550.055,3550.336,They were allowed.
1979.79-136,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3550.336,3555.491,They were there were numerous process claims that were allowed in this case.
1979.79-136,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3569.411,3574.425,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
