1995.94-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.196,"We'll hear argument now in Number 94 818, Hercules, Incorporated v. United States."
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,9.697,12.07,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,61.903,64.313,Who can't recover against the United States.
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,64.313,66.024,Who cannot recover against the United States?
1995.94-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,66.024,71.359,"I mean, I really find your simple fairness argument a little hard to take in this field."
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,81.945,82.636,No.
1995.94-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,83.715,90.299,"Should we be outraged that the companies cannot pass on their liability, when the injured parties themselves can't recover?"
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,90.299,98.536,"--Well, at least some portion of the injured parties, of course, are taken care of by veterans benefits programs, and that was a decision the court made a long time ago with respect to the--"
1995.94-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,98.536,103.47,"Sure, the companies had golden parachutes, too, or something else, but that's a different question, whether they can get moneys--"
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,103.47,117.157,"--But the... as I understand the theory, Justice Scalia, the quid pro quo for depriving soldiers of the ability to go against the United States on a tort theory was because they have other remedies, and therefore the Court interpreted the Tort Claims Act not to prove... not to allow recovery."
1995.94-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,130.497,138.012,"--Well, but it's been established for a long time, Mr. Phillips, that he who deals with the Government must turn square corners."
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,146.116,152.59,"That's absolutely correct, Your Honor, but there's no question in this case that there's been a waiver of sovereign immunity."
1995.94-818,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,187.993,220.685,"Mr. Phillips, with respect to that, suppose this case had developed that Judge Pratt's acceptance of the Government's contractor defense had stuck, that there had been no change of district judges, and he had entered that judgment, an appeal is taken, and the companies are concerned about how the court of appeals would resolve the Government contractor defense, so they settle, precisely the terms that we have before us here."
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,232.964,234.734,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe they would have a claim."
1995.94-818,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,251.026,259.18,"But the loss in what I've described to you is their decision, their uncertainty whether their victory in the district court will prevail."
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,271.839,291.091,"Yes, Your Honor, under an implied indemnification, which is either a variant of Spearin, or a concept that you ought to take directly from Ryan Stevedoring, where the nature of the relationship between the parties demonstrates the kind of control that we're talking about here, where you have compelled production, you have precise specifications, and you have superior knowledge."
1995.94-818,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,299.416,328.667,"But if the law is as a Government contractor you have a complete defense to the tort action, if that's what the law is, and then the manufacturers say, yes, we urge that that was the law, it was accepted by the court that that was the law, but we know those courts of appeals are not reliable, so we're going to settle rather than risk a reversal."
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,328.667,340.693,"--As I understand the standard rules of damages in an indemnification arrangement, the fact that you had to expend moneys under any circumstances is recoverable against the indemnitor."
1995.94-818,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,458.112,466.607,"Did you allege that you had been compelled within the meaning of section 101, that you had been compelled to produce this stuff?"
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,466.607,474.821,"Yes, we did allege that we had been compelled to produce under... that there were orders entered under section 707 of the defense production--"
1995.94-818,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,474.821,479.864,Why should we get into indemnification when you had a defense under 707 by virtue of the compulsion?
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,479.864,482.397,"--Well, I mean we argued that we--"
1995.94-818,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,482.397,497.047,"I mean, leaving aside whatever under other circumstances might or might not be implied, doesn't your allegation, if it is accepted, entitle you to a defense and, therefore, why should we get into implying indemnification that you don't need?"
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,497.047,499.23,"--Well, I've two answers to that."
1995.94-818,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,520.871,524.455,Should you be excused from litigating your position on that?
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,544.558,557.929,"--Let me step back for a second in terms of the sort of convenience of an indemnification, because I think it's quite clear that that's not a matter of convenience, it's a matter of the basic way of interpreting the relationship between the parties under these particular circumstances."
1995.94-818,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,557.929,575.85,"Well, regardless of whether you call it a convenience or not, if, to the extent that we are going to do any implying here, or find an implication, why should we find an implication when, on your own allegations, you have a defense under 707 and, secondly, why shouldn't you have to litigate that point?"
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,575.85,584.575,"Well, we did litigate that point up to the stage where we faced a 40 billion claim, and at that point we blinked."
1995.94-818,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,587.728,610.822,"It may be reasonable, but if we have to choose between allowing you to blink at the expense of an indemnification which, in fact, may not be necessary, or may not have proven to be necessary even on your own theory had you pursued your defense, why should we prefer you to the Government?"
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,610.822,631.406,"Well, I think the basic reason is that the Government contractor whose entire enterprise is controlled exclusively by the United States is an innocent party to this entire proceeding, and as between an innocent party and a not innocent party in an implied indemnification arrangement, it's Hornbook law that you favor the innocent party."
1995.94-818,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,631.406,643.474,"Well, but my difficulty is, your argument seems to be proving, if I accept it, that you do have a defense under 707 and the question is, who should be, in effect, relieved from establishing this."
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,643.474,651.539,"Well, you know, the other side of that is that when we argued this, the United States did not come in and argue that we were entitled to protection under section 707."
1995.94-818,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,657.131,662.595,"Well, by the same token... I don't know the answer to this, but did you request the Government to take part in the settlement?"
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,664.698,665.697,"Well, absolutely."
1995.94-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,671.982,686.321,"Well, I assume it follows from your position that if you would... if the Government would have to contribute to your settlement you would also logically have a claim against the Government if you didn't settle and ultimately won."
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,690.234,690.574,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,693.046,694.077,"Well, my goodness, why is that?"
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,707.215,713.118,"I understand that, Justice Scalia, but those people also don't have a contractual relationship with the Federal Government."
1995.94-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,713.118,729.31,"Yes, but whether it's reasonable to imply that term in a contract with the Government surely is colored by the fact that the Government doesn't even pay off when it's prosecuted you wrongfully and you have to expend hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend yourself."
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,729.31,729.951,Justice--
1995.94-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,729.951,742.288,Would the same Government who doesn't pay you off in that situation likely have entered into an implied contract with you to pay you off in what seems to me the much less heinous situation that you're complaining about?
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,742.288,743.96,"--Well, it's difficult for me to--"
1995.94-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,743.96,746.501,"This is a different Government you're talking about, it seems to me."
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,746.501,763.311,"--But I mean, under ordinary indemnification rules, Justice Scalia, the party who has the power to compel, the party who has the power to require compliance, and the party who has superior knowledge and who allows the innocent contractor to engage those kinds of expenses is entitled to be indemnified."
1995.94-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,763.311,764.583,But this party is the Government.
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,775.599,777.332,"Well, let me suggest there are two answers to that."
1995.94-818,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,793.923,811.714,"Between the parties have you got any case in the Spearin line where, not the parties to the immediate contract was involved, but where Spearin was successfully invoked to recover money paid to third party tort claimants, as here?"
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,811.714,823.451,"The two closest cases on point in that regard are the Traveler's Insurance case out of the Federal Circuit and the... or is it... I'm sorry, maybe the Third Circuit, and the Williams McWilliams case that we cited."
1995.94-818,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,838.783,840.623,Were they third party tort claimants?
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,840.623,841.003,--Yes.
1995.94-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,846.896,859.025,"Well, I don't read Spearin to say that the law of implied warranties is... or indemnity is just going to be incorporated bag and baggage into every deal with the United States."
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,859.025,860.514,"Well, I don't read that--"
1995.94-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,860.514,863.096,Spearin is a fairly limited case on its facts.
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,863.096,878.046,"--Well, the one thing that Spearin says, and I think this applies just as well with the warranty as it does with the... excuse me, with the indemnification as with the warranty, the contractor will not be responsible for the consequences of defects in the specifications."
1995.94-818,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,916.601,919.055,"Mr. Phillips, how does the Defense Production Act work?"
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,927.893,928.893,"We could ask for that, yes."
1995.94-818,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,928.893,931.044,And does the Government have to give it to you?
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,933.467,936.168,"Well, we don't have any leverage at that point."
1995.94-818,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,941.19,943.181,"--Well, can they force you to proceed then anyway?"
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,943.181,943.962,"Yes, of course they can."
1995.94-818,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,970.39,973.973,"Just following up on Justice Kennedy, what happens if... how do they fix the price?"
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,979.937,986.881,"The Government asks the contractor to provide them with cost information, and they build that in, and then they set a price."
1995.94-818,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,988.732,989.931,"Who sets the price, the Government?"
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,989.931,991.734,--The United States sets the price They set... and then--
1995.94-818,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,991.734,993.103,Did you allege... excuse me.
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1000.5,1016.421,"--I think you would still have a specifications argument, and you would still have a superior knowledge argument, but I do agree that the underlying compulsion that forces us to the table in the first instance provides the strongest argument in my mind with respect to implied indemnification."
1995.94-818,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1016.421,1020.982,Certainly this Court would not have to adopt any theory that would extend beyond the compulsion--
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1020.982,1022.682,"No, and in fact--"
1995.94-818,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1022.682,1023.153,--combination.
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1023.153,1033.03,"--In fact, Justice O'Connor, this Court doesn't have to adopt a theory that extends beyond the combination of compulsion and compelled specifications and superior knowledge as a combination."
1995.94-818,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1033.03,1033.371,Right.
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1033.371,1037.703,Because all three of those uniquely fit into the facts of this particular case in which--
1995.94-818,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1037.703,1047.23,"Is this case sort of a sport, because in most instances the lower courts are going to find that the companies have a full defense?"
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1047.23,1049.521,--Under section 707?
1995.94-818,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1049.821,1059.578,"Well, under... under the law that allows the contractors to have a defense to third party claims."
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1060.61,1065.542,"Well, there are a number of cases in which the lower courts have in fact held in that manner."
1995.94-818,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1069.054,1071.707,--But is this kind of a sport in that regard?
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1080.672,1090.888,"--Well, that... you see, my theory on Boyle is... I mean, the Government argues that Boyle is rendered superfluous by the provision of a contract remedy here, and I think that's wrong on two counts."
1995.94-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1149.856,1156.992,"Except that it will always pay your attorney's fees, and that's why this case, on the way you present it, is not a fluke."
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1168.139,1169.12,"Absolutely, Justice Scalia."
1995.94-818,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1169.761,1170.54,It's not a fluke.
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1179.436,1187.91,"--Unless the United States exercises its role as an indemnitor and takes over the defense of the claim, in which case it doesn't lose anything as a consequence of that."
1995.94-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1187.91,1201.24,"That's another result which is... you know, you can say the... or, it's quite different, because ordinarily, in any sort of litigation, to recover attorney's fees against the Government there has to be an express statutory provision for it."
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1201.24,1208.276,We're not attempting to get the Government to pay us attorney's fees in this particular litigation.
1995.94-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1217.222,1228.899,"Yes, but you have to look at the whole picture, it seems to me, just as Justice Scalia says you have to look at the whole picture when you're saying the Government doesn't indemnify people wrongly prosecuted under criminal law."
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1235.642,1241.767,But the point... and I think the reason why it's different is that the Government has a unique relationship with contractors.
1995.94-818,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1259.669,1277.19,"Could you have built... in setting the price of this contract, the question that Justice O'Connor and Justice Breyer were asking about before, you're compelled to make the contract with the Government, but could you have put in as a cost the cost of insuring against potential tort liability?"
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1277.19,1280.712,We can put in... we don't put in the costs.
1995.94-818,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1296.593,1296.884,In your view--
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1311.563,1317.668,"--No, not in the way that term is used in the context of an existing contract."
1995.94-818,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1350.748,1353.9,"Well, certainly not based upon any theory--"
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1353.9,1355.612,"--Oh, no--"
1995.94-818,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1355.612,1359.924,"--that assumes that, in fact, this was implicit in the agreement that they actually made."
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1359.924,1376.516,"--Right, and the argument is that under ordinary contract principles involving indemnification, the underlying assumption is, is that the party who has control will indemnify the party who is innocent and is exposed to particular injury."
1995.94-818,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1376.516,1384.982,"But is that general rule, taking it on its face, plausible in the very case that you are arguing in which you are acting under compulsion?"
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1418.572,1432.742,"Well, I have not seen from the Government a persuasive argument why anything in the nature of the relationship between the United States and the petitioners should cause the Court to deviate from what the ordinary rules of contract interpretation would be."
1995.94-818,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1472.046,1480.043,"Is there a general principle that underlies... do you have a lot of experience in Government contracts, a certain--"
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1480.043,1482.505,"Not an extraordinary amount of experience, no, Your Honor, I'm sorry."
1995.94-818,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1482.505,1490.379,"--Then maybe you can't answer this, but what I'm looking for is, it seems to me that these things... there's a superior knowledge claim."
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1549.708,1549.969,Right.
1995.94-818,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1549.969,1552.62,"--you say, they... there's a promise to pay."
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1552.62,1555.511,"Justice Breyer, I think it comes out of just straight indemnification law."
1995.94-818,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1560.945,1562.046,I have one other question.
1995.94-818,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1566.959,1578.747,"--There was an allegation of a taking in the Thompson complaint, but until we are not compensated under the contract theories, there wouldn't be a basis for saying we had not received just compensation yet, but there is a takings issue that underlies all of this."
1995.94-818,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1578.747,1580.637,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
1995.94-818,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1582.74,1591.726,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-818,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1695.672,1696.203,Let me ask you this.
1995.94-818,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1713.433,1717.347,--I wouldn't want to comment on the validity of the claim.
1995.94-818,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1717.988,1718.279,Well--
1995.94-818,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1718.279,1718.97,"--I think, the claim."
1995.94-818,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1718.97,1725.212,--and do you... does any logical reason occur to you why they wouldn't prevail on the claim?
1995.94-818,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1725.212,1726.424,I have two answers.
1995.94-818,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1740.983,1745.547,I don't see what that has to do with whether it's a valid takings claim or not.
1995.94-818,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1745.547,1747.127,"Well, only this, that, you know--"
1995.94-818,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1747.127,1749.088,"I mean, the Government compelled them to do it against their will."
1995.94-818,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1749.088,1749.628,--Only this--
1995.94-818,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1749.628,1751.728,"They lost their company, everything."
1995.94-818,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1751.728,1754.54,--That might prove to be a valid claim.
1995.94-818,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1769.891,1770.352,"Yes, but--"
1995.94-818,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1770.352,1771.183,--at a normal price.
1995.94-818,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1779.318,1780.86,--And Thompson had given up production of this.
1995.94-818,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1786.964,1790.404,"Thompson is, in that regard, different, very different from Hercules, that's true."
1995.94-818,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1790.404,1793.266,Are you finished?
1995.94-818,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1793.266,1793.746,"Quite, sir."
1995.94-818,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1793.746,1794.247,Okay.
1995.94-818,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1827.029,1828.95,Well--
1995.94-818,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1828.95,1830.092,"The answer's yes, right?"
1995.94-818,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1830.092,1830.813,--to the extent I understand--
1995.94-818,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1830.813,1831.461,Okay.
1995.94-818,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1890.489,1903.61,"--Well, I'm not sure I can sort them out, but let me try to direct my answer to one of them, which is the notion of wouldn't it be reasonable to interpret the contract in light of all the surrounding circumstances."
1995.94-818,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1960.938,1965.489,But just stop... isn't that an argument against all implied terms in Government contracts?
1995.94-818,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1965.489,1968.251,There is definitely a gray area there.
1995.94-818,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1968.672,1969.904,It's not a gray area at all.
1995.94-818,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1973.694,1975.106,"--Well, the issue was not raised in Spearin."
1995.94-818,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2039.027,2041.418,"What provision is that you're relying on, Mr. DuMont?"
1995.94-818,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2041.418,2043.861,--That's 50 U.S. Code section 1431.
1995.94-818,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3255.585,3256.684,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.94-818,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3293.029,3313.411,"Mr. Phillips, that argument, if this were a court of error correction, if this were a court of appeals and errors, that might be a very sympathetic argument, but in terms of the question on which we granted certiorari, the law that we are making not for this peculiar case, but for the class of cases, how does that--"
1995.94-818,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3313.411,3334.987,"--Justice Ginsburg, I would answer that by reference to Justice Breyer's question, when he said that people who deal in Government contracts, and I'm not one of them, look at things like Spearin claims and Helene Curtis claims and other claims, and the truth is, what this Court ought to hold in the context of this case is that this is a Hercules and Thompson claim, where you have compulsion, and specifications, and superior knowledge all combined in one."
1995.94-818,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3341.682,3356.12,"--I take it it isn't that you're asking that you'd like us to hold that, but I take it that technically you'd say the question is whether the Fed Circuit should have an opportunity to ask the district court to find the facts so that one can decide whether or not that should be so."
1995.94-818,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3356.12,3360.111,"I think, though, the Court could hold that if the facts are as I've described them to you--"
1995.94-818,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3360.111,3361.303,But I don't know--
1995.94-818,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3361.303,3361.684,--and you have to assume that for summary judgment--
1995.94-818,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3361.684,3362.004,--All right.
1995.94-818,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3362.004,3377.364,"--I understand that, but the rule of law ought to be one in which we have an opportunity to recover, and that the remedy that the Government offers us, the Government contract defense as our sole opportunity to protect ourselves, was revealed as plainly in this case as it can be revealed is inadequate."
1995.94-818,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3400.659,3401.448,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
