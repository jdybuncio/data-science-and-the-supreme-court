1990.90-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.358,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 90-97, American Hospital Association v. National Labor Relations Board."
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,12.109,15.331,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-97,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,118.167,143.474,"Mr. Holzhauer, we have to determine what the meaning of the ""in each case"" language is in this context, and it occurs to me that this Court, for example, has an obligation to consider each case on its plenary docket, and yet we search for rules of general applicability to be applied to these cases."
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,143.474,144.065,That's right.
1990.90-97,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,144.065,162.118,"Now, isn't the Board doing essentially a similar thing in searching for some kind of rule of general applicability for most cases, leaving, of course, its extraordinary circumstances out if necessary?"
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,162.118,162.586,Sure.
1990.90-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,206.547,214.952,"Counsel, suppose the Board... is this, what, is this the second rule that the NLRB has ever adopted?"
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,216.542,219.256,I believe that this is the first substantive rule they have adopted.
1990.90-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,219.256,219.885,The first substantive one.
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,220.365,220.676,Right.
1990.90-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,221.447,224.64,"--Now, but there's a lot of law that the NLRB has made."
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,224.64,225.17,That's right.
1990.90-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,225.17,229.251,"I mean, all sorts of rules about what constitutes an unfair labor practice, and so forth."
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,229.251,229.792,That's right.
1990.90-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,229.792,233.866,"Now, I assume they have been adopted on a case-by-case basis in adjudication."
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,233.866,234.885,That's correct.
1990.90-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,234.885,236.427,And you have no problem with that?
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,236.427,237.816,I have no problem with that because--
1990.90-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,237.816,252.626,"So the NLRB could say in its next adjudication it seems to us these eight units are appropriate bargaining units with respect to hospitals, and if it said that in adjudication it would be all right."
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,253.437,253.868,--No.
1990.90-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,268.147,269.258,"Well, not exactly the same."
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,276.152,288.709,"I would make the same statutory argument if they established a rule saying that these eight units are appropriate in every case, and that we will not consider the facts and circumstances of hospitals in subsequent cases."
1990.90-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,288.709,299.386,"--But why is that an inappropriate rule, although it is appropriate to say what constitutes an unfair labor practice, to say that every time you do this, every time you do it it's an unfair labor practice."
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,299.386,300.498,"Well, there are two differences."
1990.90-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,339.123,350.22,"I thought that your brief said that the Board used to approve only four units because of a test it used to apply, the disparity of interest test or something of that sort."
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,350.22,356.124,"No, the Board never said that it, that it would approve or would not approve any particular number of units."
1990.90-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,383.693,385.984,But applying a general rule to all of them.
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,385.984,386.975,"That's right, a rule--"
1990.90-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,386.975,389.416,"The disparity of interest test, or whatever other test it--"
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,389.416,389.817,--That's right.
1990.90-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,401.855,410.85,"--And even though it knows that the outcome of that test will always be that there are eight appropriate bargaining units, it must not say that?"
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,410.85,417.015,I don't think it would ever know that the outcome of that test would only be eight appropriate units or four appropriate units.
1990.90-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,431.315,436.587,But suppose the agency does believe that applying that test faithfully will always lead to these eight.
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,443.95,451.987,"If the Board believes that, I think it's free to say we think that... we will presume that these eight units might, will be correct in each and every case."
1990.90-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,451.987,453.927,"It can do that in adjudication, but not in rulemaking?"
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,453.927,454.248,No.
1990.90-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,479.694,481.307,Without any general principles at all?
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,481.307,483.737,"Oh yes, it can establish general principles."
1990.90-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,487.591,496.607,"But it can't... it can't establish a rule that is conclusive, regardless of the facts of a particular case?"
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,496.607,497.028,That's right.
1990.90-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,534.834,540.617,Does that mean simply that the Board can't have a conclusive presumption in the interest of administrative efficiency?
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,540.617,541.656,That's correct.
1990.90-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,542.698,543.907,Does it mean anything more than that?
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,543.907,547.31,"--It can't have an exclusive presumption, period, no matter what the interest is."
1990.90-97,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,587.217,597.814,"Is your argument helped, Counsel, by the provision in the statute that a majority of professional employees can vote to be included in another unit?"
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,597.814,598.745,Sure.
1990.90-97,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,603.056,606.759,So the language of the statute itself helps you in that respect?
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,606.759,607.61,I think that's correct.
1990.90-97,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,623.0,635.838,"I... as I recall, the regulations, though, did acknowledge that there could be this cross-over if a majority of the employees in the unit, in each unit accept the cross-over."
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,636.759,638.9,"Well, as far as professionals go, yes."
1990.90-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,677.074,681.82,Why isn't that enough to establish that they are considering it case by case?
1990.90-97,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,699.079,700.92,They are not considering on a case-by-case basis.
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1582.942,1590.128,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-97,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1689.211,1697.308,"Mr. Shapiro, would you say the rule would be valid even if there were no extraordinary circumstances--"
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1697.308,1699.028,"--I believe that it would, Your Honor."
1990.90-97,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1699.028,1700.269,--exception?
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1700.269,1700.908,"Yes, I believe that it would."
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1731.949,1735.142,Even though it's the first time in history they have ever tried to do it?
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1735.142,1737.573,"--It's unfortunate that it has taken so long, Your Honor."
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1737.573,1740.405,"They did pretty well on the first try, is that it?"
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1741.326,1746.64,"I think they did magnificently, because they knew how important this process was."
1990.90-97,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1746.64,1751.345,"A lot of courts and commentators have criticized the Labor Board in the past, haven't they--"
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1751.345,1752.106,"Yes, Indeed."
1990.90-97,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1752.106,1753.555,--for not conducting rulemaking?
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1753.555,1761.542,"Yes, indeed, and I think the Board has been responsive to those criticisms in an area where there was a singular need for that kind of response."
1990.90-97,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1761.542,1763.142,"13 years of litigation, though."
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1763.142,1768.204,"Well, it... that was a factor, no question about it."
1990.90-97,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1769.175,1793.893,"Your comment that this is a ceiling on the number of groups, because there can be fewer groups if the employees so elect, that excludes any participation by the employer in that determination, and that, I take it, and I take it also that that is inconsistent with the Board's rule in all other areas, where the employer has a voice."
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1793.893,1806.089,"Well, the employer... I think it's important to establish at the outset that the employer's role in the petitioning process is a very limited one."
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1868.76,1874.565,"Well, that's just, that's what exactly the employer wants to do in this case, is to show that it's inappropriate."
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1874.565,1875.816,"--Well, the employer--"
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1875.816,1877.286,And the Board won't let him.
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1877.286,1880.578,--You mean in this rulemaking proceeding?
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1911.27,1918.522,Did the employers participate... did the association participate in this rulemaking and oppose this rule?
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1918.522,1919.844,"--Yes they did, Your Honor."
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1922.777,1925.378,And they had their full say in the hearing?
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1925.378,1926.349,"--Oh, yes."
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1926.349,1927.759,Too much?
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1928.38,1931.001,At least enough.
1990.90-97,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2003.929,2009.303,What do the Mr. Shapiro?
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,2009.303,2024.752,"Your Honor, we think the obligation of the ""in each case"" requirement is an obligation to apply whatever standards and rules may exist in the context of a particular proceeding to determine the appropriate unit."
1990.90-97,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2164.404,2168.935,"Was there similar language in the Communications Act to the ""in each case"" language in the Labor Act?"
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,2168.935,2190.841,"--In a way it seems to me, Your Honor, that there was stronger language, because in the Communications Act the statute said that if the agency cannot decide that a particular application, a particular license, would be in the public interest, then it was required to set the case for hearing."
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2264.029,2278.748,"What were the circumstances, or what was the reason that the Board undertook this rulemaking and arrived at this result, rather than doing what it did for 13 years?"
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,2278.748,2282.611,"Well, I think there were a number of reasons, Your Honor."
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2385.819,2395.485,You don't think they had any reason just to administrative efficiency or just some abstract value of uniformity--
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,2395.485,2398.458,I think administrative--
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2398.458,2402.07,--without which they might have found some of these units to be inappropriate?
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,2402.07,2405.541,--I think administrative efficiency was a factor.
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2485.453,2488.087,"There's a tradeoff, and what's traded off against what?"
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,2488.087,2503.466,"--What is traded off is perhaps certain marginal cases where a particular proceeding might be decided differently in the sense that a given unit was inappropriate, and yet it doesn't qualify for the extraordinary circumstances exception and is governed by the rule."
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2503.466,2512.942,"Well, in that kind of a case is the Board really acting consistent with the direction to decide in that particular case what unit is appropriate?"
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,2512.942,2524.419,"Yes, I believe it is, Your Honor, because I... I believe that the ""in each case"" requirement does not stand in the way of the Board's articulating rules that are to be applied in each case."
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2524.419,2528.102,"But you just said that except for this general rule that they have now made, that they would decide the case differently."
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,2538.22,2541.082,"Well, yes, they might decide it differently for a wide variety of reasons."
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2543.243,2546.475,One of them is that the hospitals are different.
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,2546.475,2550.217,--Hospitals are different.
1990.90-97,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2596.186,2599.809,"But it has been done only in the area of hospitals by the Board, has it not?"
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,2599.809,2603.412,"--Your Honor, this kind of regulation is novel."
1990.90-97,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2605.263,2606.194,I didn't quite get your--
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,2606.194,2608.314,--This regulation is novel.
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2704.597,2706.199,--That was a rule established by adjudication.
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,2706.199,2709.2,"--Yes, Your Honor, but it was conclusive in character."
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2709.2,2716.143,But it was a very... with a result very similar to this rule that has been adopted.
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,2716.143,2716.424,Yes.
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2893.309,2907.26,"Are you suggesting that over all these years of litigation about hospitals, that their case-by-case adjudication sort of pointed towards eight units?"
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,2907.26,2909.462,"--By and large, Your Honor, yes."
1990.90-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3061.189,3075.12,"Mr. Shapiro, to what extent... this is to show my ignorance about this area, but to what extent is there room under the regulation for there to be debate and divergence over whether a particular employee is, for example, a professional or a technical employee?"
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3075.12,3079.08,That question is effectively left open in most areas.
1990.90-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3079.08,3080.673,"That has to be resolved in each case, does it?"
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3080.673,3083.735,There are many questions that have to be resolved in each case.
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3115.045,3130.415,"Mr. Shapiro, did I understand you to say that it's very likely that an awful lot of hospitals will, as a matter of fact will not have the eight bargaining units?"
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3130.415,3132.336,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3133.518,3135.618,How many... what percentage?
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3135.618,3147.676,"Oh, I can't give you a percentage, except that I don't think there are many hospitals out there that have been operating under the 1974 act that have any where approximating those... that number of units."
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3147.676,3149.259,So this... you're saying this is just a ceiling?
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3149.259,3151.921,This is a... for all practical purposes--
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3151.921,3158.584,"Just a ceiling, and... so in each case it's going to have to be decided which of the eight units are going to be--"
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3158.584,3160.145,--Depending on what is sought.
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3161.955,3162.526,--Depending on what?
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3162.526,3163.297,--On what is sought.
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3163.297,3173.943,"So it... and, I take it that the Board just isn't automatically going to agree with... every time with what is sought?"
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3173.943,3182.819,"Well, I think the Board has indicated, Your Honor, that if a... let's take a hypothetical."
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3202.343,3203.432,Will they listen to that?
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3203.432,3211.119,"--Not if that's all that the employer says, unless there is some, as the Board has said, very extraordinary circumstance."
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3222.285,3228.97,Wouldn't it be the case that sometimes there will be more than one union involved in the case?
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3228.97,3241.438,"Well, if they're, if they're competing unions which are seeking different formulations, I must say one important question I'm not sure of the answer of, if you have one union that comes into--"
1990.90-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3241.438,3244.1,"Well, at least in each case they're going to have to decide, aren't they?"
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3244.1,3257.739,"--Cases involving rival claims where one union wants a broader unit than another union, my reaction to that is that would be a case that the Board would necessarily have to resolve."
1990.90-97,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3272.828,3274.789,Why wouldn't it?
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3280.623,3281.294,--That may be.
1990.90-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3299.387,3301.387,Wouldn't it be pretty unlikely that they would both have a majority--
1990.90-97,1,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3301.387,3308.623,"It's not inconceivable, particularly if the skilled maintenance workers are a very small number of the larger unit."
1990.90-97,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,3371.314,3371.935,Yes.
1990.90-97,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3415.844,3418.906,Will the Board inevitably accept the union's choice?
1990.90-97,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,3418.906,3420.876,The Board will accept the union's choice.
1990.90-97,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3421.356,3421.907,Inevitably?
1990.90-97,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,3421.907,3427.681,The only time when the Board will not accept the union's choice is if it's inconsistent with these eight units.
1990.90-97,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3429.802,3434.327,What if they... what if the union... what about the question I just asked Mr. Shapiro?
1990.90-97,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,3441.422,3448.427,"--The second notice of proposed rulemaking, and the second rule said that we will assume that these are always appropriate."
1990.90-97,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3462.949,3466.72,"Even though they group these, what would otherwise be separate units?"
1990.90-97,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,3466.72,3467.181,--Right.
1990.90-97,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3477.949,3481.378,So at least to this extent it has to be case-by-case adjudication?
1990.90-97,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,3481.378,3484.191,"That one issue, where they decide to combine units, yes."
1990.90-97,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3570.01,3571.443,"Thank you, Mr. Holzhauer."
