1997.97-1374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.936,"We'll hear argument now in Number 97-1374, William J. Clinton v. The City of New York."
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,10.498,13.841,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-1374,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,122.822,128.335,Is this more constitutionally defensible than what we might call a pure line item veto in which he--
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,128.335,128.615,It is.
1997.97-1374,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,128.615,134.919,"--In which he can veto the minute that... before the bill ever becomes law, and is the reason for that because for a moment in time, at least, there's a little law?"
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,134.919,135.59,No.
1997.97-1374,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,135.59,136.241,Or a big law?
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,136.241,136.852,No.
1997.97-1374,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,248.356,255.162,"Well, so far as the locked box is concerned, this bill is the same as a line item veto."
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,261.357,298.272,"Well, I think the... I think it's... the lockbox feature of this, which is the feature that gives the President a single binary choice, tends to make this much less of a delegation problem under separation of powers than might otherwise exist, because in contradistinction to cases in which the Court has upheld, for example, delegation of authority to the FCC or the SEC to essentially create an entire code of conduct for the securities industry, the Line Item Veto Act is not... and in this respect I think it's unique and uniquely constrained."
1997.97-1374,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,320.117,324.462,But that's... that also sounds to me the same as what we might call the pure line item veto.
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,324.462,325.173,"Well, the--"
1997.97-1374,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,325.173,327.272,"A single, simple binary choice."
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,329.282,356.01,"--The problem... the constitutional deficiency in the line item veto, the... a pure, a true item veto, is that it violates the Presentment Clause, which provides, among other things, that the bill that the President signs making it a law has to be the bill that each... a majority of each House of Congress enacted, and if the President can excise a provision before he signs the law, that's violated and, as this Court has indicated--"
1997.97-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,356.01,368.698,"But Mr. Waxman, you wouldn't... General Waxman, you wouldn't say that that's remedied if, by the simple fact that it only applies to later laws where Congress says he can do that."
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,371.401,371.821,--Well--
1997.97-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,371.821,381.288,"Your argument that, after all, he cannot exercise this function on any legislation, but only later legislation where Congress chooses to let him exercise it."
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,387.702,394.908,--I... if... there are two bases for a constitutional challenge to this authority.
1997.97-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,418.164,427.821,"Right, but what I'm suggesting is, I don't see how the fact that it only applies to later legislation where Congress lets it apply has any bearing upon either of those questions."
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,427.821,431.454,"--Well, if it... it has a bearing on the Article I issue."
1997.97-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,461.214,471.171,"That's fine, but once it decides that it will, you have the same problem, that the... I mean, you may argue that it's no problem on other grounds, but I don't see how it becomes--"
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,471.171,471.391,--Well--
1997.97-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,471.391,475.125,--no problem simply because Congress has said the President can do it.
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,475.125,488.505,"--There are many historical examples where Congress has given the President authority to, if you will, repeal the effect of a prior enacted statute, but--"
1997.97-1374,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,488.505,491.217,"Yes, but not to repeal the statute, and I mean, that's the difference."
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,491.217,491.467,--Well--
1997.97-1374,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,491.467,506.576,"The examples that you give are sort of the kind of fact-finding examples in which, if the President finds a given fact to be the case, then a consequence follows and he must declare that consequence and implement it, but that's not what we've got here."
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,506.576,512.841,"--Well, I... with all due respect, Justice Souter, this is not a repeal of a provision."
1997.97-1374,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,518.785,522.698,"Well, but I mean, that's the... you say it's not, but that's one of the questions."
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,522.698,524.88,--I... let me try and explain why it--
1997.97-1374,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,524.88,527.702,"Well, is the effect is... in effect, is it... it says the law is no longer there."
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,534.286,537.798,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, let me try and respond to these two questions in two ways."
1997.97-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,584.692,587.683,"Well, that's just an effect on Congress' own internal rules."
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,587.683,587.934,--No.
1997.97-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,587.934,588.404,Is it?
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,588.404,588.775,No.
1997.97-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,588.775,589.116,Isn't it?
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,589.116,589.406,It is not.
1997.97-1374,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,699.565,720.649,"What's the... I don't want to cut you off because you're giving other examples, but I'd like an example that is the closest you can come to the following, that Congress passes a law that says next year Mr. Smith, Mr. Jones, and 18 other people will not have to pay taxes amounting to $18 million."
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,749.749,749.999,--Well--
1997.97-1374,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,749.999,764.822,"Now, what example is there that's the closest, in the past, to the President having that kind of authority to pick and choose whom to tax, whom not to tax, with the standard of the national interest being the only control?"
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,764.822,772.268,"--Justice Breyer, the question that you're raising is raising a question not under Article I but under the delegation doctrine."
1997.97-1374,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,772.268,772.378,That's right.
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,772.378,773.16,I want to make sure that I understand--
1997.97-1374,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,773.16,773.851,That's exactly right.
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,776.582,777.483,--I'll bank that.
1997.97-1374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,866.099,872.163,"But those were based on factual determinations that the President was entitled to make under the statute, weren't they?"
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,872.163,887.32,"--They were, and the issue... sometimes the determinations were specifically outlined, as in Field v. Clark, where it was very specific, and sometimes they were very, very general, and the issue then is only whether the President has a sufficiently intelligible principle."
1997.97-1374,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,908.105,916.853,"Well, in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, you and he seemed readily to agree that we can just look at this as a delegation problem."
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,933.062,933.292,No.
1997.97-1374,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,933.292,937.035,I don't think that larger problem goes away with Justice Breyer's hypothetical.
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,937.035,938.567,I didn't mean to suggest that it would.
1997.97-1374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1007.444,1009.847,How does that affect a constitutional question?
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1009.847,1023.637,"Well, it... what it demonstrates, Chief Justice Rehnquist, is that what the President is doing is not repealing a provision of a law that Congress has enacted, but executing a discretionary authority that Congress has given him."
1997.97-1374,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1064.625,1069.11,"Well, if the factors are not factual, someone would suggest that."
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1069.11,1069.798,--They--
1997.97-1374,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1069.798,1094.334,"If the... if in your example the factors that the Congress specified were straight fact as opposed to normative factors, we'd be back in the old cases that you and I referred to earlier, but if the example is a normative example, as in the public interest, then those cases are not authority, and you have, it seems to me, a very different Article I problem."
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1094.334,1094.614,--I--
1997.97-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1094.614,1101.29,"Or at least if you make some of those 10 not simply refusal to spend money, but elimination of taxes."
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1118.932,1138.643,"--Well, again, this Court in Skinner stated that the standard for separation of powers analysis with respect to tax provisions is no different than it is with respect to spending provisions or any other provision in the Constitution under Article I.--"
1997.97-1374,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1180.412,1186.287,"Is there anything like, here's a laundry list of items, Mr. President."
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1215.949,1226.076,"And what's troublesome about your example, Justice Ginsburg, relates not to Article I, because the law has been passed and signed by the President, but to the separation of powers."
1997.97-1374,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1255.949,1261.252,What is the constitutional distinction between what you call law-making and law-repealing?
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1263.693,1265.416,--Between law-making and law--
1997.97-1374,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1265.416,1271.391,"In Justice Ginsburg's example an appeal is being effected, and that is law-making."
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1271.391,1282.599,--If Congress... there is... it is not our contention that a repeal of a law can be effectuated by any means other than those specified in Article I.--
1997.97-1374,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1312.33,1318.965,"Well, of course, that... this case is different, because it says you have... you can either implement both, one, or neither."
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1318.965,1319.626,--But--
1997.97-1374,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1319.626,1320.657,That's what this case is.
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1320.657,1349.495,"--Well, first of all, the Line Item Veto Act applies to three very, very specifically defined provisions relating to spending and revenue that account for a very small portion of the Federal budget deficit, and it provides that before an item will be cancellable it must satisfy each of three criteria, and even if it does, the President must make three different... make certain determinations."
1997.97-1374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1360.064,1370.001,"Well, General Waxman, you say it applies only to a very small amount of spending, but if we uphold it here, it could then be extended to a vast amount of spending."
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1372.174,1390.806,"I think there would be a different question... we might be prepared to defend it, but there would be a different question if the President was given the authority to cancel existing items of direct spending, which would be the equivalent of the repeal of the effect of a prior law."
1997.97-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1416.615,1416.825,This is--
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1428.144,1429.516,"Well, I'm not suggesting that there is--"
1997.97-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1429.516,1441.404,"Appropriations bills have always been treated differently, and when you extend it from simple appropriations and say the President, even though it's been appropriated, doesn't have to spend it, to... to the fact he can be given the option, you know--"
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1441.404,1443.267,"--No, Justice Scalia, I... I was--"
1997.97-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1443.267,1443.797,"--It's your choice, enforce the tax or not."
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1443.797,1445.33,--We're not saying that.
1997.97-1374,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1487.13,1493.304,"But throughout on that, on the particular... it's the same point, that I want to get something you almost said, and you stopped--"
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1493.304,1493.795,Thank you.
1997.97-1374,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1493.795,1512.238,"--just before you said it, and that is the reason that the... to uphold the tax provisions, you say, is not to give the President total authority under the Constitution to rule by decree, should Congress want him to do it, because there's an intelligible principle."
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1512.238,1513.019,Yes.
1997.97-1374,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1513.019,1518.932,"And the intelligible principle, you say, is not just, do what's in the public interest, it is...?"
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1518.932,1554.926,"The intelligible principle is that... first of all, in order for there to be a targeted tax cut, there has to be a baseline tax, but the President must determine, number 1, that cancellation will reduce the Federal budget deficit, and this is not, by the way, as the other side contends, an ipso facto claim, because many tax provisions are enacted on the notion and on the budgetary assumption that they will generate additional economic activity and raise taxes, and in that instance the President would not be able to make that determination... raise money and provide more taxes."
1997.97-1374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1575.33,1577.881,How much time does he have to make these determinations?
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1577.881,1582.494,"--He has 5 days after he signs the bill, which would give him a maximum of 10 days."
1997.97-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1621.281,1624.463,"General Waxman, would you give... I'm coming back to Justice Breyer's question."
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1645.959,1647.489,"--Well, they must--"
1997.97-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1647.489,1647.759,What is the criterion?
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1652.624,1653.844,--Are we talking about tax benefits here?
1997.97-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1653.844,1657.346,"--Anything, the tax benefits or the elimination of spending."
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1657.346,1658.768,The President... the only--
1997.97-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1658.768,1660.719,What is the criterion when he selects it?
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1665.604,1673.15,"--He must determine, number 1, is this a cancellable item, which in the case of tax provisions, he's helped with by the legislation he's considering."
1997.97-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1673.15,1673.381,All right.
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1673.381,1674.56,Because Congress tells him that.
1997.97-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1674.56,1675.171,That just limits the universe.
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1675.171,1675.451,Right.
1997.97-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1680.697,1681.605,All of which just limit the universe.
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1681.605,1682.196,"Right, and--"
1997.97-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1682.196,1682.937,The universe is limited.
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1683.668,1684.429,"--That's right, and--"
1997.97-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1684.429,1685.411,"Now, how does he make the decision?"
1997.97-1374,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1689.514,1690.426,--May I answer?
1997.97-1374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1708.787,1709.999,"Thank you, General Waxman."
1997.97-1374,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1712.331,1720.088,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-1374,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1750.311,1760.046,"Well, technically the President has to sign it, so it goes into effect, so you're really having to deal with what happens after that."
1997.97-1374,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1760.046,1776.137,"--Yes, but what we have here, Justice O'Connor, is a device of saying, sign the bill first and then you can immediately cancel the parts you don't approve."
1997.97-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1791.066,1791.647,They say no.
1997.97-1374,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1811.033,1822.601,"My response is that in my case, the Snake River case, where we're talking about cancelling a provision of the Internal Revenue Code, I don't think there is any lockbox effect, but even in the spending--"
1997.97-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1822.601,1823.931,The lockbox applies only in he spending area?
1997.97-1374,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1823.931,1839.19,"--I think that's right, but even in the spending context a lockbox is simply a congressional declaration that it won't otherwise spend money pursuant to a provision that Congress... that the President has cancelled."
1997.97-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1839.19,1842.033,"That it won't, but it can, can't it?"
1997.97-1374,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1842.033,1844.136,"Well, it can by passing a new law."
1997.97-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1844.136,1845.916,"Well, which the President has to sign."
1997.97-1374,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1845.916,1847.258,Which the President has to sign.
1997.97-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1847.258,1848.047,"I mean, it can do anything by passing a new law."
1997.97-1374,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1848.047,1849.259,Yes.
1997.97-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1935.549,1940.033,"Suppose they add to it, and the cut must be in the public interest, convenience, and necessity."
1997.97-1374,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1940.033,1944.816,"Well, I said not contrary to the national interest."
1997.97-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1945.647,1945.817,"Oh, you think that's--"
1997.97-1374,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1945.817,1946.829,"No, I think that's the same."
1997.97-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1946.829,1948.63,"--Well, gee, we let the FCC do that."
1997.97-1374,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1953.374,1963.002,I think what we let the FCC do is regulate in the public interest as defined in a statutory context.
1997.97-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1963.002,1969.697,"There are many judgments that the FCC makes that are really constrained by nothing except public interest, convenience, and necessity, quite a few."
1997.97-1374,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1969.697,1975.623,But the public interest itself has a historical and a statutory context.
1997.97-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1987.604,1987.915,It isn't running riot.
1997.97-1374,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1999.267,1999.487,--That's right.
1997.97-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1999.487,2000.859,But... it's very limited.
1997.97-1374,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2003.464,2004.993,"No, it's 70--"
1997.97-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2004.993,2005.194,--of a certain sort.
1997.97-1374,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2005.194,2008.706,"--It's 79 provisions, 79 tax provisions."
1997.97-1374,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2044.489,2062.051,"Well, does your argument rest on our determining that somehow we look at it all together and decide that the Article I requirements were never met in the first place, or that, okay, it went into effect and it's an unconstitutional repeal?"
1997.97-1374,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2062.051,2064.364,"--Justice O'Connor, I think I win either way."
1997.97-1374,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2114.227,2119.102,"Is the locked box provision in all respects constitutional, in your view?"
1997.97-1374,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2140.727,2141.538,Well--
1997.97-1374,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2141.538,2142.63,Is the Government right about that?
1997.97-1374,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2142.63,2142.87,--No.
1997.97-1374,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2172.752,2177.146,"Well, they say it's now going to have legal effect because it's in the locked box, and that's just a... that's another legal effect."
1997.97-1374,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2177.146,2180.518,--It's no--
1997.97-1374,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2180.518,2182.431,"It's different, say, from simply vetoing."
1997.97-1374,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2182.431,2197.732,"--Well, it's no different from the legal... I don't think it's any different from the legal effect of cancelling any other appropriation which Congress would therefore have to reappropriate if it wanted particular money spent."
1997.97-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2197.732,2199.865,"Mr. Cohen, are you going to address the jurisdictional issues?"
1997.97-1374,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2203.077,2204.279,Yes.
1997.97-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2204.459,2205.611,--what's it to you?
1997.97-1374,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2212.606,2217.24,"--Yes, they do, and I really think our standing case is quite straightforward."
1997.97-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2236.637,2239.939,It helped you to buy them by helping the seller to sell them--
1997.97-1374,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2239.939,2240.149,Yes.
1997.97-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2240.149,2240.369,--right?
1997.97-1374,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2240.369,2240.81,Yes.
1997.97-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2240.81,2243.384,But what it did immediately was to help the seller to sell them.
1997.97-1374,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2267.416,2275.941,I think somebody who had taken sufficiently concrete steps toward... toward--
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2591.155,2594.127,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1997.97-1374,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2666.165,2670.239,"I'm wondering, on your indemnity example, it would be at least premature to bring it."
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2681.786,2697.117,"--Your Honor, when I leave this Court I'll get in my car, and the chances are extremely slim that I will run into you, but I won't get into my car without liability insurance, and I've paid a lot of money for that liability insurance, Your Honor."
1997.97-1374,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2703.23,2707.704,"Oh, but it's different, because your conduct is affected by knowing you have the insurance policy, and that's not true here."
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2713.158,2713.749,"Well, Your Honor--"
1997.97-1374,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2713.749,2719.165,It's as if there were already an injury and there might not be a lawsuit.
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2719.165,2724.64,"--No, there was an injury before we received section 47229(c)."
1997.97-1374,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2753.178,2755.319,"It belongs to your clients, or does it belong to New York State?"
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2757.83,2764.435,"Your Honor, New York State has enacted State laws that pass through that loss."
1997.97-1374,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2766.678,2767.917,"--Ah, but that's the problem in New York law."
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2774.355,2775.685,"That's true, Your Honor."
1997.97-1374,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2775.685,2786.593,"You're saying that because there is this other thing, res inter alia... inter alius acta, right, something that pertains to somebody else, you won't get the money."
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2796.089,2798.56,"Your Honor, I doubt the wager could be enforced--"
1997.97-1374,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2798.56,2802.431,"Oh, no, this is in a State that allows... encourages wagering, as a matter of fact."
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2803.613,2807.275,"--Your Honor, we have much more than a wager here."
1997.97-1374,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2830.391,2839.928,"So the only contingency on your argument is whether the Secretary is going to act to bail you out, and your point there is, the President in effect has said that she won't, is that it?"
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2839.928,2841.741,"Your Honor, that's not the only contingency."
1997.97-1374,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2841.741,2843.501,What's... what else?
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2843.501,2844.933,"Well, Congress could pass--"
1997.97-1374,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2844.933,2847.324,"Okay, under existing law."
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2847.324,2847.504,--another law--
1997.97-1374,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2847.504,2848.125,Under existing law.
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2848.125,2848.566,--Under existing law--
1997.97-1374,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2848.566,2862.417,"You know, New York could change it's law, too, but under existing law, there's the one contingency left, right, and you're saying that does not count against us for standing because the President in effect has said that's not going to happen, otherwise I wouldn't be reducing the deficit."
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2862.417,2863.827,"--Your Honor, that's true."
1997.97-1374,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2889.375,2891.908,"Mr. Cooper, I don't know why you didn't accept the wager hypothetical."
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2901.164,2902.777,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-1374,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2902.777,2906.781,"So I think a wager's a very good example, is what I'm suggesting."
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2907.499,2911.863,And I certainly accept your vast improvement over my answer.
1997.97-1374,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2911.863,2912.184,Can I ask you one--
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2913.416,2914.634,Excuse me?
1997.97-1374,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2914.634,2916.577,"If you're hurt, you can sue, right?"
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2916.577,2917.967,If you're injured in fact--
1997.97-1374,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2917.967,2918.427,Injured in fact.
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2924.972,2925.392,--Your Honor--
1997.97-1374,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2925.392,2931.267,"No matter how many intervening actors, New York State, you know, the agricultural coop, whatever."
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2931.267,2943.955,"--Your Honor, I wouldn't be making this argument if I were here to say that New York might pass laws that would then shift this burden onto my shoulders."
1997.97-1374,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2960.177,2963.332,"Why didn't the State join this lawsuit, Mr. Cooper?"
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2967.613,2975.848,"Your Honor, the record isn't revealing on this, and I have nothing other than rumor and speculation to offer to you on that issue."
1997.97-1374,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2975.848,2976.479,"Well, then, don't."
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2976.479,2977.19,But--
1997.97-1374,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2977.19,2978.812,"It's disappointing though, you know."
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3002.758,3007.221,"--Well, that answer definitely has some seriousness to it."
1997.97-1374,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3013.268,3013.405,Can I ask you one--
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3013.405,3016.648,"--but we're injured, and that's the issue, perhaps downstream, but--"
1997.97-1374,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3016.648,3040.904,"--With respect to the... another piece of this threshold issue, you have no individuals in this group unless... you have a couple of unions, and they have members, so what is the harm to the unions and their members that would give them standing to be in this assemblage of plaintiffs?"
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3040.904,3045.658,"--Their harm is one step farther downstream, I will grant you."
1997.97-1374,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3115.214,3118.346,"Can I ask you one question on the merits, if you're finished with the standing?"
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3118.346,3118.906,I certainly am.
1997.97-1374,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3120.086,3125.411,"I've one... the question I have, which is really my only question here, is this."
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3224.905,3233.791,"Your Honor, we don't tell the FCC that it can rescind a law, that it can render a law of no force and effect."
1997.97-1374,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3248.24,3249.309,What about the lockbox effect?
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3257.617,3266.933,"Let me answer this, what different effect would there be if the statute, instead of using the term cancel, and defining it to mean repeal, had said repeal?"
1997.97-1374,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3304.892,3311.818,"No, but the lockbox puts into effect, as I understand it... correct me if I'm wrong... certain mechanisms under the Budget Deficit Reduction Act."
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3311.818,3312.378,Yes.
1997.97-1374,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3312.859,3322.634,"So that here the President is making one of two choices, each of which alter the situation from where it was before the law was enacted in the first place."
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3322.634,3347.091,"--Your Honor, I have to confess I've never met anyone who understood entirely the operation of the lockbox, but it... one thing that simply cannot be escaped or blinked is the fact that when the President cancels a provision, under the act itself, it extinguishes the authority."
1997.97-1374,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3366.37,3384.502,"May I ask you, Mr. Cooper, because I frankly am troubled with this lockbox idea, but is it any different if, after the particular item is put in the lockbox, than if it had never been enacted in the first place and, if so, what is the difference, the particular provision that goes into the lockbox?"
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3384.502,3403.533,"Your Honor, I honestly am not entirely sure, but I will grant the Solicitor General that it may well be that that money is treated differently than if it had never--"
1997.97-1374,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3403.533,3406.146,It's counted against what expenditures have been made.
1997.97-1374,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3412.21,3428.271,"--Yes, but I think it's a function of fact that the money came into existence, the authority to spend the money came into existence, which is the only difference between that and a true line item veto, so that reality is what gives rise to the necessity--"
1997.97-1374,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3428.271,3429.473,"Thank you, Mr. Cooper."
