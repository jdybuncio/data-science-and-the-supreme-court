1984.83-1944,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.67,We will hear arguments next in Jensen against Quaring.
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,12.158,20.663,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here on the State of Nebraska's petition for certiorari to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals."
1984.83-1944,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,198.112,200.329,"Age, is that not another factor?"
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,200.329,201.581,Age?
1984.83-1944,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,201.581,202.314,Age.
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,202.314,203.933,"Yes, Your Honor, age is a factor."
1984.83-1944,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,203.933,205.416,What are the limits in Nebraska?
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,205.416,208.718,At the age of 16 you may obtain a regular driver's license.
1984.83-1944,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,208.718,211.337,"On the other end, is there a limit?"
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,211.337,217.741,"You must demonstrate a proficiency and knowledge of the rules of the road, traffic regulations."
1984.83-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,228.498,231.083,But there is no cutoff on the age?
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,231.083,240.772,"--At the present time, no, but there are repeated examinations for dexterity, visual ability, and so on, particularly for elderly drivers."
1984.83-1944,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,240.772,245.01,When does the examination... at what age does the examination begin?
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,245.01,248.878,Depending upon what type of license you are applying for--
1984.83-1944,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,248.878,249.445,Just an ordinary--
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,249.445,251.83,--The ordinary driver's license is age 16.
1984.83-1944,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,253.364,255.032,"--No, but on the other end."
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,255.032,257.151,You are reexamined every four years.
1984.83-1944,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,257.151,260.436,A medical examination?
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,260.436,262.32,The visual.
1984.83-1944,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,262.32,263.738,"I know, but how about the medical?"
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,267.689,269.125,"No, we do not."
1984.83-1944,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,282.683,286.92,What is Mrs. Quaring's faith?
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,286.92,292.324,Mrs. Quaring believes a... her belief is a personally held one.
1984.83-1944,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,302.513,306.548,But I gather the state concedes that it is Christian in nature.
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,307.681,310.533,The state has conceded that it is a religious belief.
1984.83-1944,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,310.533,313.119,"Well, Christian?"
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,313.119,317.273,A Judaic Christian belief founded in the Old Testament.
1984.83-1944,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,321.941,325.509,"There is no issue whether the belief is sincerely held, is there?"
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,325.509,329.961,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,329.961,341.769,"May I ask, Ms. Galter, if you could explain a little bit more to me about the administrative burden the state alleges to be present."
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,362.098,370.538,"In response to your first question, the administrative burden that we set forth would be that the applications are made on a local basis."
1984.83-1944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,477.99,496.019,"Well, I suppose in considering exemptions from the draft, for example, based on sincerely held personal beliefs, the same kind of determination is made at a variety of localities, is it not?"
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,496.019,496.721,That's correct.
1984.83-1944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,554.473,560.227,"That hasn't prevented the extension of a similar privilege in the case of the draft, has it?"
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,560.227,560.944,No.
1984.83-1944,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,562.496,567.733,When did Nebraska begin to require a photograph on the driver's license?
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,567.733,569.3,I believe in 1977.
1984.83-1944,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,569.3,575.637,And when did they first begin to require an automobile driver's license?
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,577.506,578.706,I don't know the answer to that.
1984.83-1944,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,653.839,662.479,"Couldn't you respond to that by just limiting the exclusion for this purpose to adults, I mean, to those over 21, saying you have a special interest there?"
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,664.579,665.481,"No, it does not."
1984.83-1944,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,665.481,666.647,"She is older, I gather."
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,666.647,668.516,"Yes, she is."
1984.83-1944,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,685.81,694.5,"Surely if you say that interest is sufficient to deny everybody the right not to be photographed, it ought to be at least sufficient to deny those under 21 the right."
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,694.5,697.233,I am saying you could pass that legislation.
1984.83-1944,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,703.656,713.711,"Exactly what is the state... spell out for me if you would, please, in a practical sense what function does the photograph serve?"
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,713.711,719.131,The photograph serves... its primary function is instantaneous identification.
1984.83-1944,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,747.416,755.204,"Counsel, why is the state interested in the financial transactions of cashing checks?"
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,755.204,764.394,"The state offers its protection in terms of criminal statutes, in terms of theft by deception, forgery, passing bad checks, and so on."
1984.83-1944,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,769.031,771.416,"Yes, but what has the driver's license to do with that, really?"
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,775.202,778.82,--The driver's license serves as a secondary piece of identification.
1984.83-1944,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,778.82,780.106,Because of the photograph.
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,780.106,781.672,The photograph serves as the identification.
1984.83-1944,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,781.672,784.408,"A passport would do the same thing, wouldn't it?"
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,784.408,792.163,"Yes, another photograph would, if it were properly validated by a state or a federal regulatory authority, so that it had validity."
1984.83-1944,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,794.714,805.804,I will confess I am a little puzzled by your reliance on financial transaction integrity to support the photograph on a driver's license.
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,805.804,811.022,I think the main emphasis is for law enforcement and the identification of drivers.
1984.83-1944,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,820.897,831.353,Am I not correct that in some parts of Asia there are sects who will not permit people to photograph them?
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,831.353,832.705,--I am not personally familiar.
1984.83-1944,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,834.338,844.345,"And if you had a large number of people in Nebraska, would that create additional problems for you, or would you be here making the same argument?"
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,844.345,848.214,"I would be here making the same argument, because, yes, I think it does create problems."
1984.83-1944,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,929.951,949.097,Would this same rule in your view be applied if Nebraska or some agency of the federal government in Nebraska or in the Eighth Circuit required a photograph for identification for government employment or for a passport?
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,952.132,954.434,"Yes, I believe they would."
1984.83-1944,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1096.692,1105.215,"What would happen if somebody applied for a driver's license, chauffeur's license?"
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,1105.215,1106.648,--And did not want their photograph taken?
1984.83-1944,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1106.648,1108.4,Yes.
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,1112.736,1139.788,"Yes, it would, most definitely, but we also do not have a problem in lifetime revocations of licenses, and I would agree with you that the analysis is different, but I think if we look at the interest of the license, and as we pointed out in Dixon versus Love in indicta, it has been indicated that perhaps a driver's license is not so important as our social welfare benefits, which is a subsistence question."
1984.83-1944,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1153.563,1156.465,What happens when you are arrested?
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,1158.6,1163.486,"No, and that was one of the things that we would point out."
1984.83-1944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1216.288,1224.542,"Well, Ms. Galter, it really isn't Ms. Quaring's driving privilege that is being infringed, is it?"
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,1228.596,1230.696,That is the respondent's claim.
1984.83-1944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1230.696,1235.0,Isn't that quite a valid point?
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,1235.0,1242.154,"The burden on Mrs. Quaring, if you will... we submit that there is not a right to drive, but yes--"
1984.83-1944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1242.154,1245.205,The burden is on her free exercise.
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,1245.205,1255.327,"--The burden is on her free exercise, but what we are urging the Court to examine is how much, how much are we interfering with the actual practice?"
1984.83-1944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1256.727,1265.033,"Well, but you are asking the Court to do something that I don't think it has been doing in earlier cases."
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,1280.795,1288.282,"--I believe the test would be... the initial question is, is there a burden, and then--"
1984.83-1944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1288.282,1289.315,On what?
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,1289.315,1289.567,--The burden on--
1984.83-1944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1289.567,1291.534,On her free exercise of her religion.
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,1291.534,1294.019,--On free exercise of her religion.
1984.83-1944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1316.885,1323.389,"Well, what is the state's interest in denying the exemption?"
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,1334.346,1348.689,"It is the administrative burden as the state's broader interest in achieving universal application and extending that rationale into social security numbers, signatures, and so on."
1984.83-1944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1348.689,1368.234,"Well, but of course the state doesn't have a uniform photo identification system now because it has already been demonstrated that the state has exceptions today, for temporary learner's permits and other... out-of-state permits and the kind of thing that don't require a photograph today."
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,1368.234,1369.186,We have exceptions.
1984.83-1944,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1450.571,1478.491,"Ms. Galter, is any part of the state's argument based on the idea that where you have a fairly minimal time period of confrontation between the licensing authority and the applicant, that the state may find itself in a position of just having to give in on a lot of claims that are either spurious or borderline spurious?"
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,1478.491,1480.658,--I am not sure I understand your question.
1984.83-1944,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1480.658,1502.023,"Well, if people who perhaps have ulterior motives and really aren't all that interested in religious claims find out that you can get a driver's license with no photograph on it, that you will get a lot of applications based on stated religious belief that in fact doesn't exist but may be very difficult to disprove."
1984.83-1944,0,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,1502.023,1502.506,Exactly.
1984.83-1944,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1536.41,1538.529,Very well.
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,1542.348,1559.36,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in answer to the question from Chief Justice Burger with regard to when the licensing photograph requirement took effect, that began in January of 1978."
1984.83-1944,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1595.449,1604.355,Then it is pretty clear she considered violating the law less important than violating her subjective religious belief.
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,1604.355,1606.424,"--I think, Your Honor, that--"
1984.83-1944,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1606.424,1607.691,Is that a fair statement?
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,1607.691,1608.293,--Excuse me?
1984.83-1944,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1608.293,1610.325,Is that a fair statement of the situation?
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,1610.325,1624.435,I think that what I would draw from that is that she had such a high level of concern about the situation in which she was placed that she went to the trouble of doing the next best thing in her mind.
1984.83-1944,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1724.668,1735.808,Would you agree that... what is your view on whether Nebraska's need for photographs on these licenses is a compelling state interest?
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,1735.808,1743.895,We have... my personal position on that is that I find it difficult to see that that is a compelling state interest.
1984.83-1944,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1746.397,1753.187,You think it would not make it easier for people to have fraudulent licenses?
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,1753.187,1775.516,"--I think it is a step that... the photograph makes it more difficult to create fraudulent licenses, but the testimony by the superintendent of the Nebraska State Patrol at trial indicated that that event still happens, that there are still fraudulent licenses that are being made."
1984.83-1944,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1813.308,1818.212,"On the identification, is there any faster one than a photograph?"
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,1818.212,1822.914,Is there any faster method of identification?
1984.83-1944,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1822.914,1824.799,Yes.
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,1824.799,1826.066,I think that probably there is not.
1984.83-1944,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1839.976,1841.043,We are not talking about that.
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,1843.828,1844.447,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1944,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1844.447,1850.934,And you do agree that that is the best way to facilitate identification?
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,1850.934,1853.468,I think that it is probably the fastest way.
1984.83-1944,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1860.056,1864.308,"Well, would you mind physically describing me?"
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,1868.812,1871.097,"In that situation, I think I would prefer a photograph."
1984.83-1944,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1871.097,1871.997,Right.
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,1874.049,1877.501,But I don't think that a preference for a photograph--
1984.83-1944,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1877.501,1880.536,Has Mrs. Quaring ever applied for a passport?
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,1880.536,1882.653,"--No, she has not, that I am aware of."
1984.83-1944,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1882.653,1885.774,And you know a photograph is required for those.
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,1894.629,1907.187,"If she were to make application for a passport, my suspicion is that her position with regard to the photograph on that document would be the same with regard... as it is with regard to the driver's license."
1984.83-1944,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1907.187,1914.424,--How about for federal employment which required in a particular agency a photograph?
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,1914.424,1924.149,"For Mrs. Quaring, as the individual, particular individual who is involved in this case, her position would be that she cannot allow herself to be photographed."
1984.83-1944,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1969.928,1988.989,"Well, Mr. Lansworth, do you concede that the government's interest in obtaining a photograph or passport or some ready identification for security reasons in a secure area might be weighty, or weightier than the state's interest for driver's license purposes?"
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,1988.989,1989.941,I think it would be different.
1984.83-1944,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2003.732,2010.838,"Well, those are the suggested circumstances, the passport or the photograph required for employment in a secure area."
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2010.838,2015.991,--It is my understanding that there is a possibility of an exemption to a photograph on passports.
1984.83-1944,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2041.274,2044.076,You have your Sack Air Force Base in your state.
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2044.076,2045.928,--That's correct.
1984.83-1944,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2045.928,2049.963,What is your response to that situation?
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2049.963,2053.331,If a photograph was required for entrance at Sack Air Force Base?
1984.83-1944,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2053.331,2054.865,I don't think it's if.
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2056.117,2057.033,I think that may be the case.
1984.83-1944,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2057.983,2067.239,"Let me ask another question, if you place a great deal of weight on the existence of other exemptions in the Nebraska system."
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2067.239,2090.271,I think that the weight that I place on that is because of the reason that that indicates to me that the addition of Mrs. Quaring to that group of people who is on the highways and streets of Nebraska without a photograph on their driver's license is not going to have any impact upon the achievement of the state's interests that are being served by that photograph.
1984.83-1944,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2090.271,2093.306,"Of course, aren't each and every one of those exemptions rather minor?"
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2095.189,2104.162,"I think generally speaking most of them would fit that description, except there is a category--"
1984.83-1944,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2104.162,2108.316,"--There is a certain element of impossibility with respect to some of them, anyway."
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2108.316,2117.589,--I think with regard to... the temporary permit I believe is the one that is issued to persons who are outside of the state at the time that their renewal comes due.
1984.83-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.908,2124.742,How about a learner's permit?
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2125.694,2130.079,"--The learner's permit, Your Honor, I believe, is issued for a year at a time."
1984.83-1944,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2149.457,2154.127,"Well, it is shorter than the period of time that a normal Nebraska driver's license runs, though, isn't it?"
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2154.127,2155.16,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1944,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2158.662,2171.22,"If she were here today, or in the courts in Nebraska, and newspaper photographers took a picture of her as she was leaving the courthouse, could she enjoin the publication of that in your view?"
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2171.22,2171.839,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1944,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2226.891,2245.37,"In other words, you are saying that her religious belief, her rights under the religion clauses are subordinate to the First Amendment rights of others to take her picture if they want to?"
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2245.37,2257.845,"I think that in the question that you posed with regard to a news photograph being taken of her, you don't have involved in that situation any governmental action that is burdening her exercise."
1984.83-1944,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2269.836,2291.765,"Mr. Lansworth, what about a person whose religious, sincerely held religious belief is that one should not have one's social security number used for identification purposes, or should not have a social security number at all, and wants a symbol substituted?"
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2297.736,2300.688,"Your Honor, I would think that it could fall in the same category."
1984.83-1944,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2337.896,2351.671,--Do you think that part of the balance that the Court must make is the presence or absence of economic or other motives to cause people to claim the exemption?
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2351.671,2362.096,"I think that the decisions of the Court certainly in recent years have indicated a concern with that motivation, and I think that is a legitimate concern."
1984.83-1944,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2400.671,2409.327,"Well, I think Ms. Galter suggested one, which is young people who want to buy liquor under age."
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2411.01,2429.573,"I think that might be one, and I would agree that she has suggested that, but there is certainly no evidence to suggest that that is a real possibility in this case, and there is certainly no evidence in this case to suggest that Mrs. Quaring presents any law enforcement difficulty."
1984.83-1944,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2459.509,2461.042,That is the way you worked it?
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2463.211,2481.506,"--that retailers usually were very strict about requiring identification, and if there was anything fishy or questionable about someone's identification, they would refuse to do business with them, particularly in a young person purchasing alcohol situation."
1984.83-1944,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2625.066,2626.682,Is that your approach to the case?
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2636.624,2638.724,We have taken that position in this court.
1984.83-1944,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2652.734,2656.602,So the case gets down to a less restrictive alternative then.
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2656.602,2657.121,--That's correct.
1984.83-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2657.121,2659.121,All right.
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2674.397,2691.592,"It is not served equally well without the photograph, but what we are talking about here is an overall program of identification, and the overall program of identification can be served equally well and achieved equally well with a limited number of exceptions."
1984.83-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2691.592,2694.627,That then turns on the number of people accepted.
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2700.129,2711.82,"I think that the fewer the number, the less problem you have with continuing the programmatic interest, but I wouldn't make that the test if that is your question."
1984.83-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2711.82,2716.021,"Well, it seems to me that that is the test under your argument."
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2741.939,2743.639,Mrs. Quaring's particular faith?
1984.83-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2743.639,2745.041,Yes.
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2745.041,2756.431,The record in this case indicated that one of the career persons in this Motor Vehicle Division was aware of her claim and perhaps one other one during his tenure.
1984.83-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2768.172,2770.272,"Well, I know the Court hasn't said it, but I think that is what you are saying."
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2775.576,2787.401,--I think numbers... the number of exemptions which might be possible is one measure of whether or not the impact will be so great upon the state's ability to achieve its interests that--
1984.83-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2787.401,2791.17,"I suppose another thing is, she is a law-abiding citizen, you say, so it is not very important."
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2791.17,2796.89,"--That's correct, but I think there are situations where numbers are not the only situation or the only consideration."
1984.83-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2840.418,2846.822,Do you think the exemption for the Amish in the Lee case would have been more or less burdensome than the exemption here?
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2849.624,2854.862,I think it could have... that the... in terms of the numbers involved?
1984.83-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2854.862,2864.901,"Well, actually, there they contributed their own social security system, so... I had some difficulty understanding how that was really all that burdensome in that case."
1984.83-1944,1,42937,thomas_c_lansworth,,2864.901,2906.813,"I think that my reaction to the facts in the Lee case was similar to what I in fact remember you writing, Your Honor, which is that it was difficult to see how this was going to impact in any negative way upon the social security system, but I think that the Court had another consideration in mind in that opinion, which was that if you begin to make exceptions to any kind of national tax system in a nation such as ours where tax systems operate on a primarily voluntary payment system, that you are leading into a very troubled area."
1984.83-1944,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2950.926,2953.276,"Do you have anything further, Ms. Galter?"
1984.83-1944,2,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,2953.276,2956.128,"Briefly, Your Honor."
1984.83-1944,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3041.649,3049.053,"May I ask again, does your case, do you think, depend on there being all these other problems around the corner, numbers and signatures and so forth?"
1984.83-1944,2,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,3068.967,3070.752,--Concentrating on photographs alone--
1984.83-1944,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3070.752,3071.085,Yes.
1984.83-1944,2,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,3071.085,3071.652,"--yes, we would."
1984.83-1944,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3091.832,3101.038,"Couldn't you solve that by saying no exemption shall be granted except by the governor or somebody, you know, have a special... one person to grant the exemption?"
1984.83-1944,2,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,3105.223,3110.341,"I don't think they are rare enough, and I think the incentive for an increased number is going to be present."
1984.83-1944,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3116.662,3130.504,"Well, say no exemption until you fill out the following 97 forms and take a visit through your house to show you have got no pictures at home, and about 19 different things you have to do to get the exemption, and until you fulfill all those requirements you don't get the license."
1984.83-1944,2,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,3132.723,3134.908,--One could.
1984.83-1944,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3164.262,3168.296,What if you required them to bring in their high school yearbook and show that their picture wasn't in it?
1984.83-1944,2,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,3170.498,3172.798,One could post a number of requirements.
1984.83-1944,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3172.798,3174.967,It seems to me this one is singularly easy to prove.
1984.83-1944,2,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,3185.341,3198.733,"It would be possible on one or two or three, but to implement that kind of a program in 93 counties presents a tremendous cost to the State of Nebraska, and it is a tremendous intrusion of government into people's lives."
1984.83-1944,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3198.733,3208.089,"Ms. Galter, in hindsight, if you had just granted this one exception, you wouldn't have had any of this trouble if nobody knew about it, would you?"
1984.83-1944,2,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,3209.172,3210.255,I am afraid there are more coming.
1984.83-1944,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3211.688,3213.04,"Well, they are not here yet."
1984.83-1944,2,39368,ruth_anne_e_galter,,3213.04,3214.64,"--They are not here yet, Your Honor."
1984.83-1944,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3216.442,3217.542,"Thank you, counsel."
