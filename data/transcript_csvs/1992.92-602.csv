1992.92-602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,5.842,We'll hear argument next in No. 92-602.
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,55.588,60.835,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,137.056,138.508,Can I ask you one thing?
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,155.188,164.45,"--In the usual case he is, Your Honor, because in the usual case, there's no evidence at all of any nondiscriminatory reason for the discharge."
1992.92-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,164.45,185.254,"Well, and if the employer offers on its face a neutral reason and the plaintiff fails to prove that it's a farce, the case is over."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,185.254,186.833,"Well, if the employer--"
1992.92-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,186.833,188.972,That would mean the employer then is entitled to judgment.
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,188.972,193.501,--If the plaintiff fails to prove pretext--
1992.92-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,193.501,193.813,Yes.
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,193.813,195.079,"--yes, of course, the case is over."
1992.92-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,195.079,202.326,But if the plaintiff proves pretext--
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,202.326,204.014,The case is not over.
1992.92-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,204.014,206.279,"--Well, you think he's... it's not over."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,212.104,213.885,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
1992.92-602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,239.529,250.292,"Well, supposing the employer, after the prima facie case is made, testifies that my reason for firing the person was not discriminatory."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,264.364,269.081,"No, he's not, and he's not required to believe the employee."
1992.92-602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,284.293,295.945,"Does your opponent agree, do you think, that the district court in this case found as a fact that the reason for the discharge was not discrimination on the basis of race?"
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,295.945,301.38,I believe my opponent does not agree with that finding of the district court.
1992.92-602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,301.38,304.691,But does he agree that the district court made that finding?
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,304.691,305.613,"Yes, he does."
1992.92-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,331.087,340.036,But he... did he... did the district trial court find pretext that the offered reason was pretextual?
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,340.036,340.864,"Yes, he did."
1992.92-602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,353.0,359.591,"So, then an employer is really well advised to come up with a pretextual reason as your opponents says in his brief."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,359.591,360.45,"Not so, Your Honor."
1992.92-602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,360.45,362.106,"Well, if you stand silent, you lose."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,366.463,367.947,In the usual prima facie case.
1992.92-602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,367.947,368.353,Right.
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,368.353,368.932,But an employer's--
1992.92-602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.932,372.992,"So, better to come up with... once you come up with some pretext, you don't necessarily lose."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,386.58,389.063,--An employer should never come up with a pretextual reason.
1992.92-602,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,392.172,392.797,Why not?
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,394.686,395.468,"--Yes, he does."
1992.92-602,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,395.468,395.95,What?
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,395.95,403.074,An inference of improper motive discrimination can be drawn from the finding of pretext.
1992.92-602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,407.634,408.602,But at least you'd have a finding.
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,419.443,427.235,"Well, that's in the situation of the usual prima facie case which eliminates all or most common reasons for an action."
1992.92-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,446.04,446.493,Let me--
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,446.493,448.992,--a third explanation for the employment decision.
1992.92-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,448.992,450.523,"--May I interrupt you for a moment, Mr. Gardner?"
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,462.658,464.047,"I'm saying that, yes."
1992.92-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,464.047,471.139,"So, does that not mean that your client was entitled to a... have the case dismissed at the end of the plaintiff's case?"
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,475.638,478.714,"No, Your Honor, because there was a finding of pretext."
1992.92-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,480.698,481.057,No.
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,497.238,508.28,"--I agree with you if we were able to... if we are able to distinguish in these trials when the prima facie case stage ends, when the rebuttal of that begins, and when that ends."
1992.92-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,508.28,510.061,"Well, it ends when the plaintiff's evidence is in."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,511.169,515.918,"Well, when the plaintiff's evidence is in, it usually contains the evidence of pretext also."
1992.92-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,530.741,533.146,Did you make a motion to dismiss at the close of the plaintiff's case?
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,533.146,533.615,I did.
1992.92-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,534.879,540.347,"And it was denied, but then eventually you won because it should not have been denied is what you're saying."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,540.347,544.296,--If we can distinguish in the steps of the case.
1992.92-602,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,544.296,566.148,"Well, Mr. Gardner, even though... when you proceed here... when a plaintiff proceeds and makes out a prima facie case, the plaintiff does that by showing the plaintiff was fired, that he was qualified as an employee, and that someone of another race was hired instead."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,566.882,567.335,Right.
1992.92-602,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,567.335,568.319,"I mean, that's what we have here."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,569.475,571.146,That's the usual prima facie case.
1992.92-602,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,571.146,597.776,"Now, at the so-called end of the plaintiff's case, even if this other evidence may emerge that, well, there was some animosity here, even though it isn't a mandatory presumption at that stage, there still are inferences to be drawn, are there not, from the plaintiff's evidence that he was fired, that he was qualified, that someone of another race was hired instead?"
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,597.776,598.635,That's correct.
1992.92-602,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,598.635,604.679,"So, I mean, how would he ever be entitled to summary judgment even though some other evidence had emerged?"
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,609.599,610.692,I agree with you.
1992.92-602,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,610.692,618.861,And there's some evidentiary value to that evidence whether or not it's applied in a mandatory sense.
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,618.861,619.721,I agree with you.
1992.92-602,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,635.214,642.976,"So, you weren't entitled to summary judgment or to a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the plaintiff's evidence because these other things were in the case."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,642.976,645.211,--I think so because we tried it all at once.
1992.92-602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,649.13,661.392,"You just take witnesses to tell kind of a chronological story I suppose, and it isn't necessarily parsed out as to this shows the McDonnell Douglas burden and then we get to another."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,664.406,665.219,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1992.92-602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,680.182,683.633,"Mr. Gardner, what is the effect of the prima facie case?"
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,724.257,725.538,"--That's interesting, Your Honor."
1992.92-602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,729.022,734.223,"Well, I understand that, but we wouldn't be faced with this dilemma, would we?"
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,734.223,735.299,That's true.
1992.92-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,738.315,738.501,No.
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,741.797,749.403,"Well, I'm not here today asking you to promulgate that rule because it's not necessary to resolve this particular case."
1992.92-602,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,749.403,756.228,"Well, I take it the concomitant of the rule is that the presumption would not drop out of the case altogether."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,765.583,767.396,That sounds very reasonable.
1992.92-602,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,767.396,775.909,"And we could also say I suppose, if we're just making up rules, that the burden continues to rest on the employer."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,775.909,784.999,"To come forward with an articulation of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, but--"
1992.92-602,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,784.999,787.951,Or the ultimate burden of proof once a prima facie case has been shown.
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,787.951,792.933,"--Again, I would say the same thing as I said to Justice Scalia."
1992.92-602,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,805.928,815.956,It seems to me there's an undercurrent in this case that the employer is not bound by what it says.
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,826.935,831.199,"Well, that is an unremarkable principle."
1992.92-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,863.935,875.54,"How can you call it a failure of proof if what you're really saying is that there was a third reason, not the racial reason, not the defendant's reason, but this antagonism?"
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,880.274,885.63,"Well, it's a failure of proof of racial motivation."
1992.92-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,885.63,890.286,How can there be a failure of proof if you have a prima facie case of racial motivation?
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,890.286,894.534,"Well, because that has been rebutted by the nondiscriminatory reason."
1992.92-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,894.534,895.393,"Well, but no, it wasn't--"
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,895.393,895.862,It does not--
1992.92-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,895.862,897.298,--rebutted by the nondiscriminatory reason.
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,903.295,916.102,"--Well, the pretext... the finding of pretext was rebutted by the personal animosity, but once the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason has been proffered, there's no more presumption which operates."
1992.92-602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,925.816,946.652,"Well, if you wanted to fit this more tightly into the McDonnell Douglas framework, if that were thought necessary, I suppose you could say that the judge's finding that the discharge resulted from personal animus was a finding of a nonpretextual reason for the discharge."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,950.244,959.412,"It would be a nonpretextual reason in the sense that if one equates pretext with intentional discrimination, it would be a nonpretextual reason."
1992.92-602,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,975.204,986.339,"Well, Mr. Gardner, now the court of appeals didn't really review the district court finding of personal animosity as a reason."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,993.259,993.9,That's right.
1992.92-602,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,998.742,1007.645,"So, we don't know if there's enough evidence in this record presumably to support that district court finding of personal animosity or not I guess."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1007.645,1011.065,I think you do know that for two reasons.
1992.92-602,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1038.819,1045.083,"Well, but the court of appeals hasn't evaluated that, and I guess there's no reason why we have to."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1049.721,1050.94,That's true.
1992.92-602,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1055.375,1071.651,"Just so that I understand your position, though, may I ask were those two items of evidence that you mentioned, the Hicks testimony and I think the employee's own testimony... were they adduced as part of the plaintiff's case before the plaintiff rested?"
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1071.651,1073.368,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1081.35,1092.705,"So, your position is that before the plaintiff's case rested, there was testimony that the firing was due to personal animosity for reasons other than racial antagonism."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1092.705,1093.75,That's true.
1992.92-602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1093.75,1094.625,But we don't really know that.
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1168.44,1169.737,"No, but--"
1992.92-602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1169.737,1170.752,--of all of these decisions.
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1171.221,1171.688,--No.
1992.92-602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1181.841,1182.497,Against Hicks.
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1192.243,1202.645,"Also, this particular supervisor did not initiate any discipline against Mr. Hicks' subordinates who actually committed the violation who were also black."
1992.92-602,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1215.842,1230.43,"Mr. Gardner, you have said that you're not asking the Court in this case to adopt the view that the prima facie case should be regarded merely as a case sufficient to get to the factfinder."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1233.71,1234.648,That's right.
1992.92-602,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1235.57,1254.826,"Is the alternative then necessarily that what you're asking us to do is to hold that the reasons given by the employer, once the burden of going forward shifts, need not be ultimately the exclusive reasons that he relies upon to defend the case?"
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1270.227,1271.805,Approximately fair.
1992.92-602,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1271.805,1274.757,That's usually as close as I get.
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1275.507,1281.864,It's always in the employer's interest to not present a pretextual reason.
1992.92-602,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1315.21,1327.549,"Then I think you are saying that the employer is not confined to the reasons he gives even though all of those reasons may, in fact, turn out to be pretextual, the reasons he raises in his defense when the burden shifts to him."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1329.751,1333.172,I would say the trier of fact is not confined to those reasons so long as there's--
1992.92-602,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1333.172,1334.467,"Well, why do you split them up?"
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1373.171,1380.403,"--It's legitimate... he doesn't sandbag the court and say if you're going to find this, this is the real reason."
1992.92-602,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1387.867,1396.598,"Yes, but if that's the case, then why don't we go right back to the point that I guess Justice Scalia made and say the real error in this case is that there was never a prima facie case made?"
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1396.598,1399.895,It can be looked at that way.
1992.92-602,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1399.895,1412.796,"Let's not monkey with the standards for raising defenses if, in fact, the very first stage, even that is the predicate for shifting to the... or raising the burden of going forward is not satisfied."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1412.796,1418.527,"It can be looked at that way, Your Honor, because the evidence of the third motive came out in the very first witness."
1992.92-602,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1418.527,1420.933,"And if we look at it that way, what have we got here in this case?"
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1430.538,1434.458,"If it's looked at in that way, that would be the district court's error."
1992.92-602,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1434.458,1437.739,"Well, Mr. Gardner, I tried to question you here."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1488.467,1489.014,"Your Honor, I think--"
1992.92-602,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1489.014,1492.434,The factfinder didn't have to go off on a personal animosity.
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1504.274,1510.865,--I think the difficulty is trying to pin down exactly at what stage the third explanation came in.
1992.92-602,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1517.254,1519.596,"But whenever it comes in, the trier of fact doesn't have to believe that."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1528.608,1529.249,--That's true.
1992.92-602,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1529.249,1539.76,"The prima facie case is not dissipated because there is evidence that if believed might require a ruling in favor of the employer, is it?"
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1539.76,1540.963,"No, it's not."
1992.92-602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1551.317,1556.955,"Well, in Aikens, we said that after all the evidence is in, the presumptions are much less important."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1565.14,1570.654,I think that's the way the district court looked at it rather than seeing it as a failure of the prima facie case.
1992.92-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1570.654,1577.26,You... what do you object in the court... to in the court of appeals judgment?
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1588.708,1590.38,I think that's it in a nutshell.
1992.92-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1601.359,1606.483,How is it if there's a third explanation that was so obvious to the judge that the defendant never mentioned it?
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1608.717,1612.2,--Plaintiff never mentioned it either.
1992.92-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1615.947,1620.009,"The defendant's real reason for firing him was there was animus there, but the defendant didn't tell the judge that."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1620.009,1621.836,--Nor the plaintiff.
1992.92-602,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1621.836,1623.602,And what's your... what's--
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1645.857,1652.839,Because the falsity of the justification does not necessarily mean that there has been discrimination.
1992.92-602,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1654.074,1654.776,"Well, that may very well be."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1692.979,1696.18,--The problem I see with that is it might straitjacket factfinders.
1992.92-602,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1700.648,1702.303,"Look, the factfinder is not an independent party here."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1719.812,1721.874,I don't know really.
1992.92-602,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1721.874,1723.03,Then you lose.
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1725.202,1725.499,Not--
1992.92-602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1725.499,1730.105,--the employer is not likely to come up with some of these answers because they are not rational answers.
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1750.909,1761.233,"--Like I said, Mr. Powell initiated all of the employment actions and the supervisors' and Mr. Powell mistake was was not perceiving it at that time, that it was personally motivated then."
1992.92-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1761.233,1764.794,"The thing that concerns me, Mr. Gardner, is what does the plaintiff do on rebuttal."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1785.239,1789.987,"I don't think we have to cover every conceivable reason, only those that had sufficient evidence."
1992.92-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1789.987,1790.658,Suggested remotely by the evidence.
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1797.093,1799.561,"Not suggested remotely, Your Honor."
1992.92-602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1801.233,1803.716,"--Thank you, Mr. Gardner."
1992.92-602,0,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1803.716,1804.31,Thank you.
1992.92-602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1804.31,1805.341,Mr. Oldham.
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,1805.341,1808.949,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1822.599,1825.254,"But, of course, we're reviewing the court of appeals judgment."
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,1825.254,1826.846,"--I understand, Your Honor, but he--"
1992.92-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1826.846,1828.565,And you're defending that judgment.
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,1828.565,1829.58,--I'm defending that judgment.
1992.92-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1829.58,1830.298,"Yes, all right."
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,1830.298,1840.014,And I just wanted to point out just one fact that what the district court held that plaintiff had failed to prove that personal animus was not the true reason.
1992.92-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.515,1875.875,Do you think pretext means it's a lie?
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,1875.875,1877.858,It's false.
1992.92-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1881.638,1891.79,"Well, do you think it would be... is it... or does pretext really just mean that there was another reason?"
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,1891.79,1897.912,"As I understand pretext, the way we use pretext it's false."
1992.92-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1932.632,1943.581,Do you think a trial judge in a case like this could reserve his judgment on... reserve his ruling on a motion to dismiss at the close of the plaintiff's case?
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,1943.581,1946.627,"--They often do that, Judge."
1992.92-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1955.545,1976.085,"And do you think that... don't judges sometimes rule on the motion although they think we really are going to... we really don't think it's much of a prima facie case, and we may ultimately decide the case because the plaintiff's case was deficient?"
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,1976.085,1980.582,"The answer to that is yes, Your Honor, because usually in a jury trial case--"
1992.92-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1980.582,1987.829,"So, making just a ruling that there's a prima facie case doesn't necessarily end the factfinder's task."
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,1987.829,1994.95,"--No, it does not necessarily end the factfinder's task when the person comes forward with an articulated, nondiscriminatory reason."
1992.92-602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2004.181,2015.147,"Well, isn't there something to what Mr. Gardner was saying about the way a trial proceeds, that you don't say now we're going to call three witnesses to make out our prima facie case?"
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2028.327,2029.951,"That's right, Your Honor."
1992.92-602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2055.786,2059.643,"And you can call the employer as a witness if you want to, can't you?"
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2059.643,2060.784,I can call the employer as a witness.
1992.92-602,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2107.436,2109.014,What about Aikens?
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2112.933,2117.277,Did that modify Green and Burdine in this specific area?
1992.92-602,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2117.277,2124.413,"Well, it certainly said that after the evidence is in, the presumption drops out of the case and you go on."
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2126.147,2127.459,"That's true, Your Honor."
1992.92-602,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2137.112,2137.487,The presumption drops out.
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2137.487,2140.439,"--That rebuts the presumption, and that presumption drops from the case."
1992.92-602,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2205.225,2220.36,"Your rule is, I take it, that if... once a prima facie case is made, then the court must rely on the employer's explanation if there is to be a ruling for the employer."
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2220.36,2226.076,--He must rely upon the articulated legitimate and nondiscriminatory reasons.
1992.92-602,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2237.884,2241.101,Does this sort of rule exist in any other area of the law?
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2241.101,2267.466,"--I think that this is fairly unique, Your Honor, because of the prodigy of Green, Burdine, Furnco, and all the cases that have followed, which are a product of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 where the Congress declared it was one of the highest priorities that we had was to eliminate discrimination, both overt and subtle."
1992.92-602,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2288.77,2292.626,"So, this is really shifting the ultimate burden of proof it seems to me."
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2292.626,2295.032,"--No, Your Honor."
1992.92-602,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2295.703,2299.733,"Despite the fact that Green says that that's not what happens, it seems to me that that's what's happening here."
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2310.042,2328.269,"Your Honor, if the State or the employer doesn't project or articulate the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons, it is our position that the trier of fact shouldn't search the record and come up with his own articulated reasons, that the articulation is the responsibility of the employer."
1992.92-602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2328.269,2342.17,"What if the plaintiff, in the course of his testimony, had offered evidence of a fact which would have justified a conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for his firing?"
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2342.17,2349.963,If the plaintiff makes an admission that the reason for the discharge was nondiscriminatory--
1992.92-602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2349.963,2354.555,But he doesn't... I'm not saying he makes an admission as if these were pleadings.
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2380.155,2390.008,"--Your Honor, I think the answer to that is that the Burdine test requires the employer to articulate the reasons."
1992.92-602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2405.565,2408.908,"Well, but I joined the Burdine opinion."
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2429.025,2434.273,"That's true, Your Honor, and you can have evidence come from the defendant that's favorable for the plaintiff."
1992.92-602,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2434.273,2451.422,"But in your view, under the Chief Justice's submission, he could not... the trier of fact could not take into account adverse inferences from the employee's own testimony so long as the employee makes out a prima facie case."
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2451.422,2456.592,"Your Honor, I still go back to the requirements in Burdine--"
1992.92-602,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2456.592,2457.982,"That's correct, isn't it?"
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2457.982,2459.201,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-602,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2461.825,2463.028,It seems to me very strange.
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2463.028,2474.459,"--the plaintiff is going to have a full and fair opportunity to meet the allegations of the employer, the nondiscriminatory reasons announced by the employer, unless he has a full and fair opportunity to meet those."
1992.92-602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2481.098,2483.127,"Well, why should this be different than a negligence case?"
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2506.525,2509.727,"Your Honor, this is different from a negligence case."
1992.92-602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2520.549,2531.015,"Yes, but do you think Congress intended that the factfinding process in these cases should be different than the factfinding process in all other sort of civil litigation was?"
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2531.015,2544.665,"--All I know is, Judge, is that in Green and versus Burdine... Green and Burdine, the Court did set up a method of indirect proof and a specific process which this Court has recognized for long periods of time, and I think that it is unique."
1992.92-602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2546.961,2561.454,"Well, it's unique in the... perhaps, although I'm not so sure it's that different than res ipso loquitur or something like that in negligence cases, that if the plaintiff shows certain elements, he's entitled to have the finder of fact make a determination in his favor."
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2572.514,2573.06,Well--
1992.92-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2573.06,2587.789,"Well, what if in the course of cross-examining the defendant's witnesses, in order to prove pretext, the... it turns out that there was personal animosity?"
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2612.95,2618.198,--I think that the court is bound by the issues that are projected by the parties.
1992.92-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2620.494,2622.229,"So, your answer is yes, the court--"
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2622.229,2622.494,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2622.494,2623.524,"--Yes, all right."
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2623.524,2624.367,The answer is yes.
1992.92-602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2624.367,2631.569,"May I ask in this case, did the defense counsel argue to the judge that the real reason was personal animosity?"
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2631.569,2633.786,"Judge, he did not."
1992.92-602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2662.54,2664.258,Did you try the case for the plaintiff?
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2664.258,2665.023,"Yes, I did, Your Honor."
1992.92-602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2665.023,2668.131,Did you try to put in any evidence that there was no personal animosity?
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2672.724,2686.811,"No, I didn't, Your Honor, because I felt that the... under the McDonnell Douglas/Burdine test that the employer was required to articulate the nondiscriminatory reasons to give me a fair opportunity to meet those."
1992.92-602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2693.121,2709.802,"--Do you think it would have been permissible as a matter of procedure for the defendant's counsel at the end of the cross-examination to say now our witnesses have said reasons are A and B, but the cross-examination has brought out the fact that it's a... animus was the real reason and we're going to rely on that in closing argument?"
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2711.302,2712.363,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1992.92-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2712.363,2718.531,You have to say that I think to support your theory of the case.
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2718.531,2732.09,"I've had cases, Judge, where we've tried it and we fully tried a issue other than the issue that was originally focused, and there was a motion made to amend the pleadings after the trial."
1992.92-602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2739.352,2748.989,"Well, the Federal rules have a provision that if an issue not in the pleadings is tried by consent of the parties, they're... the pleadings are deemed amended, don't they?"
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2748.989,2749.614,"That's true, Your Honor."
1992.92-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2753.175,2767.06,"Well, I... if we reverse the court of appeals on its theory, it sounds to me like it... you would all... you would still win because there wouldn't be enough evidence to support the finding of animus."
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2767.06,2776.088,"Well, I will point out to the Court that we did raise issues of a fact that one of the complaints had to do with retaliation, and that wasn't ruled upon."
1992.92-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2781.975,2791.363,"Well, did you argue in the court of appeals that the district court was wrong in... that... in ruling on the basis of animus because there wasn't enough evidence of it?"
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2791.363,2800.969,"--That's correct, and actually the court of appeals looked at that and said it was wrong for the district court to assume, without any evidence to support it, that there was animus involved."
1992.92-602,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2814.884,2822.631,"But if we disagree with you, the court of appeals on remand would address that and you might still prevail."
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2822.631,2824.194,"That's possible, Your Honor."
1992.92-602,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2852.9,2856.742,"Well, you still would have the inferences to be drawn from that evidence."
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2858.82,2859.476,"--That's true, Your Honor."
1992.92-602,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2859.476,2864.567,"So, of course, can you rely on the inferences to be drawn from that evidence."
1992.92-602,1,19744,charles_r_oldham,,2864.567,2866.489,That is correct.
1992.92-602,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2890.886,2900.023,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
