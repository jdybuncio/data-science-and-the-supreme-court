1992.91-767,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.88,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-767, Republic National Bank-of Miami v. United States."
1992.91-767,0,40971,stanley_a_beiley,,54.928,60.554,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-767,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,107.053,125.666,"I suppose, would its position also be that if pending the, pending the decision of the district court the property was sold and the proceeds were transferred to some other place the district court would lose jurisdiction too, I suppose?"
1992.91-767,0,40971,stanley_a_beiley,,125.666,128.247,I believe that would follow from the Government's position.
1992.91-767,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,204.098,221.401,"Well, this would be your view even in a classical admiralty action, Mr. Beiley, where everybody agrees it is a prototypical in rem action, nonetheless the Government there would submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the court?"
1992.91-767,0,40971,stanley_a_beiley,,221.401,241.283,"It's not only my position, Your Honor, but it has been adopted by this Court in several of the cases cited in our brief in a pure admiralty case, the Feckler case, the British transport case, and several prize cases where the Government has intervened in admiralty in rem cases and then objected to cross claims being filed against it."
1992.91-767,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,249.139,254.084,"Well, is that the same thing though as an admiralty action say initiated by the Government?"
1992.91-767,0,40971,stanley_a_beiley,,254.084,266.583,"Our position would be it would be the same, Your Honor, that the Government by initiating an action, as well as any plaintiff that initiates an action, submits itself to the court's in personam jurisdiction."
1992.91-767,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1687.161,1695.066,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-767,2,40971,stanley_a_beiley,,3490.401,3495.977,I would like to conclude with a very brief statement.
