1983.82-1577,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.519,We will hear arguments next in Michigan Canners Association against Agricultural Marketing Board.
1983.82-1577,0,32973,joseph_g_scoville,,97.156,100.516,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.82-1577,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,182.7,189.423,"Mr. Scoville, the same might be said of the legislation in California."
1983.82-1577,0,32973,joseph_g_scoville,,199.6,208.106,"The California Act, Your Honor, is well distinguishable from the Michigan Act in two very important respects."
1983.82-1577,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,216.992,226.288,"Well, they all have to contribute a certain amount of the produce, and they are bound by certain determinations of the group, are they not?"
1983.82-1577,0,32973,joseph_g_scoville,,226.288,227.28,"Perhaps, Your Honor--"
1983.82-1577,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,227.28,228.819,Whether they have joined or not.
1983.82-1577,0,32973,joseph_g_scoville,,228.819,231.642,--Perhaps we are not talking about the same California Act.
1983.82-1577,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,240.757,243.368,"Well, you can address both."
1983.82-1577,0,32973,joseph_g_scoville,,243.368,261.15,"The California bargaining Act, which is the one that is analogous to the Michigan Act, the one that directly regulates agricultural marketing and bargaining, is not at all like the Michigan Act in the two particulars that I mentioned."
1983.82-1577,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,384.781,394.639,Have you identified any other state agricultural marketing Acts which you feel have the same problems as Michigan's?
1983.82-1577,0,32973,joseph_g_scoville,,394.639,395.69,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-1577,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,472.65,477.465,Is asparagus raising in Michigan concentrated in any one geographic area?
1983.82-1577,0,32973,joseph_g_scoville,,477.465,480.026,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1577,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,483.379,485.219,Like the deciduous fruits?
1983.82-1577,0,32973,joseph_g_scoville,,488.872,489.403,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,913.27,925.94,"Mr. Scoville, I thought their answer to that argument was, it is not the handler, even when you define it broadly, but rather the state of Michigan that has applied the coercion when they talk about that specifically."
1983.82-1577,0,32973,joseph_g_scoville,,925.94,928.491,"--Your Honor, the Supreme Court of Michigan went further than that."
1983.82-1577,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1004.62,1014.866,"Mr. Scoville, will you state again what you think the definitional mistake that the Supreme Court of Michigan made was and where that occurs in its opinion?"
1983.82-1577,0,32973,joseph_g_scoville,,1014.866,1016.579,"Footnote Number 7, Your Honor."
1983.82-1577,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1016.579,1028.928,"And their error in Footnote Number 7 at Page A-5 of the jurisdictional statement was to use the term ""handler"" and ""processor"" interchangeably?"
1983.82-1577,0,32973,joseph_g_scoville,,1028.928,1036.591,"Yes, sir, without also recognizing there and then throughout the opinion that ""handler"" also means ""cooperative""."
1983.82-1577,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1312.222,1324.441,Mr. Garvey.
1983.82-1577,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1324.441,1332.566,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, let me begin by saying a word about Justice Stevens' concern."
1983.82-1577,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1553.478,1560.921,"Mr. Garvey, is the federal statute here kind of a branch of the antitrust laws?"
1983.82-1577,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1560.921,1562.183,"No, it is not."
1983.82-1577,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1586.62,1590.641,And you say Parker against Brown analysis just doesn't apply to this sort of thing?
1983.82-1577,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1590.641,1592.461,--It has very little to do with this case.
1983.82-1577,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1592.461,1594.093,"Well, you say it has very little to do with it."
1983.82-1577,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1595.383,1596.154,I perhaps overstate it.
1983.82-1577,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1620.51,1628.285,"Well, you say it is not decisive, but does it have some role to play in deciding whether or not the Michigan law is preempted?"
1983.82-1577,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1628.285,1630.318,"Well, let me try and explain it this way."
1983.82-1577,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1820.01,1839.415,"Mr. Garvey, what about a state requirement that the farmers even if they haven't joined the co-op have to contribute a certain percentage of their crop, or a requirement that there is a floor on prices that will affect even those who haven't joined?"
1983.82-1577,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1839.415,1843.345,"Well, you are talking about a different sort of state arrangement."
1983.82-1577,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1869.652,1876.247,"Well, would that pose problems, in your view, under the Federal Ac?"
1983.82-1577,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1876.247,1881.469,"I think not, so long as it is the state that is doing it and not a cooperative association."
1983.82-1577,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1881.469,1891.447,"Well, then you are back to the state action argument, aren't you, that you just said I thought we didn't need to consider?"
1983.82-1577,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1891.447,1901.044,"Well, it's not simply the fact that the state has passed... simply because the state has passed this law does not immunize it from preemption."
1983.82-1577,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1961.652,1968.016,Mr. White.
1983.82-1577,2,33492,james_a_white,,1968.016,1990.483,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.82-1577,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2041.795,2044.737,"Well, at least to the extent of existing state law."
1983.82-1577,2,33492,james_a_white,,2044.737,2045.799,--That's right.
1983.82-1577,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2045.799,2049.849,And the Michigan Act was not existing at the time.
1983.82-1577,2,33492,james_a_white,,2049.849,2053.312,"That's right, Justice Blackmun."
1983.82-1577,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2074.126,2077.519,"Why do you think the Congress used the word ""existing"" then?"
1983.82-1577,2,33492,james_a_white,,2077.519,2096.672,"I think it looked at the statute certainly that existed, and found nothing in those statutes that was contrary certainly to the statute, or they would have built in their own contradiction."
1983.82-1577,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2291.338,2302.385,"Mr. White, certainly there is some analogy, I suppose, to the Section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act and the right to work states versus the non-right to work states."
1983.82-1577,2,33492,james_a_white,,2316.777,2346.844,"--As I understand what you are talking about there, Justice Rehnquist, is the... I guess the argument of the Solicitor General that under NLRB versus General Motors, that that somehow indicates that there was a Congressional intent somehow not to require anyone to join or not to join when he states that there was... one was the financial equivalent of the other."
1983.82-1577,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2422.926,2441.767,"--Yes, but then certainly the result of that holding is that Section 14(b) does permit states to include within the proscription of a right to work law not only an actual union shop but an agency or agency fee state."
1983.82-1577,2,33492,james_a_white,,2455.457,2456.206,That's right.
1983.82-1577,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2456.206,2459.037,"Well, that's really why most people don't want to join the cooperative, isn't it?"
1983.82-1577,2,33492,james_a_white,,2466.674,2511.293,"I think that even... that may be, although Justice Stewart pointed out in NLPE v. General Motors that there may be some valid reasons for a person not wanting to join, and he was only talking in the financial sense of them being the equivalent, but it seems to me that this case... or this Court in the Knight case made it clear in the case that the mere payment of a fee to a sole and exclusive bargaining representative is not coercive of the right to not join or not to be a member."
1983.82-1577,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2511.293,2514.095,What is the fee that is paid here?
1983.82-1577,2,33492,james_a_white,,2517.037,2521.198,"Yes, it is... at the current time it is 1 and a half percent."
1983.82-1577,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2521.198,2522.5,But is that what members pay?
1983.82-1577,2,33492,james_a_white,,2522.5,2523.92,That's right.
1983.82-1577,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2523.92,2529.615,"So these people who don't want to become members, they just have... but they pay the same amount as other members."
1983.82-1577,2,33492,james_a_white,,2529.615,2532.675,"Not necessarily, Justice White."
1983.82-1577,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2566.62,2570.291,What is excluded from the charge to them?
1983.82-1577,2,33492,james_a_white,,2576.746,2583.409,"Well, our particular organization is not particularly involved in a lot of those types of activities, but other types of activities that would--"
