1978.77-69,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.133,The case is submitted.
1978.77-69,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,62.216,68.771,"Mr. Attorney General, before you begin, is this the only brief you filed in this Court?"
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,71.408,72.284,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,72.284,72.902,Sir?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,72.902,78.004,"No, sir."
1978.77-69,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,78.004,80.649,"Now, I know where I am."
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,94.604,96.912,"I'm -- I'm at a lost, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,100.336,104.451,Is it -- is it this script at the top here?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,104.451,105.669,"No, sir."
1978.77-69,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,108.109,109.133,Fully --
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,109.133,110.419,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,110.419,112.604,"Apparently, it didn't reach some of us."
1978.77-69,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,112.604,119.583,And -- becuase I never did get page 17 -- 17 (a) I don't have.
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,123.465,133.391,I apologize to the Court.
1978.77-69,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,133.391,136.1,"It doesn't have the page, it's incomplete."
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,136.1,136.943,Yes.
1978.77-69,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,145.009,150.729,"We'll make inquiry also but we do, perhaps, need that page which is missing from all of the copies here."
1978.77-69,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,150.729,152.576,This is opinion to the Court.
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,152.576,156.404,This isn't the -- what we have here as printed.
1978.77-69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,156.404,157.611,It's printed.
1978.77-69,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,157.611,160.224,This was filed away back in July.
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,163.884,170.869,That's actually a jurisdictional statement.
1978.77-69,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,174.597,175.844,"Very well, we'll pursue it."
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,177.602,179.528,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.77-69,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,238.137,241.717,Do you say dispute the refusal to take the test?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,241.717,244.53,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,244.53,254.415,It was my understanding from the record though I realize I may be wrong but the appellee in this case had actually requested the test himself.
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,254.415,262.522,"He requested it subsequent to refusing it upon his arrival initially, at the station."
1978.77-69,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,262.522,267.37,"He refer -- he refused first and then about 50 minutes later asked for it, wasn't that?"
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,267.37,267.657,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,267.657,267.821,(Voice Overlap)
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,267.821,270.522,"About 22 minutes later, he asked for it."
1978.77-69,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,270.522,272.784,But it's 50 minutes after the event.
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,272.784,277.903,"That's correct, 52 minutes after the accident, 22 minutes after the arrival at the station."
1978.77-69,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,287.631,294.637,How much do you lose in 22 minutes making the effectiveness of the test?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,294.637,295.677,"It's hard to say, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,317.973,324.173,So what about any time spent from the time of the accident?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,330.519,331.218,"I don't, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,331.218,331.685,I see.
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,331.685,332.234,I don't.
1978.77-69,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,339.151,343.717,"In the second time, the State refuse to give him the test, is that right?"
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,343.717,345.582,That's correct.
1978.77-69,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,345.582,348.694,Why?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,348.694,360.365,The police officers apparently made a judgment that the time spent now between the moment of arrest and the moment of request had become too long for an accurate reading.
1978.77-69,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,362.386,369.916,I thought my Brother Blackmun's question was as to how long is it before reading would not be any good?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,369.916,379.611,I don't think we can say with any scientific objectivity to the Court that are with any information from the record that we know of a precise time.
1978.77-69,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,386.073,394.831,"So that the final judgment in this case were 52 minutes after the Government said, ""We will give you the test."""
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,394.831,398.237,"52 minutes after the accident, the police refused the test."
1978.77-69,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,398.237,402.136,If he refused a test and as a result of that he lost his life.
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,402.136,403.134,That's correct.
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,408.915,416.474,Does the record tell us whether the police will delay long enough to let the driver call an attorney and ask for advice?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,416.474,420.449,"The record does not, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,431.834,446.974,"Well, would it be a refusal for example for driver to say, ""I'd like to call my lawyer before I take the test,"" then say maybe take 25 minutes talking with lawyer on the phone then come back and say, ""Yes I'll take it"" and could the police officer then say, ""It's too late now, you've already refused?"
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,458.882,461.245,"Pretty much what happened here, isn't it?"
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,461.245,464.492,"No, he outright refused the test at first."
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,464.492,469.062,"If he just say, well, I don't want to do it till I talk to my lawyer, and it takes 25 minutes to get the legal advice."
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,469.062,469.823,I see.
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,476.147,479.845,So that if it takes 25 minutes to get legal advice that's a refusal?
1978.77-69,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,481.216,494.156,Is it possible that it is a medical matter or scientific matter that it might make a difference not only in the lapse of time but rather even to have a plaintiff Bourbon or a quarter Bourbon or only two ounces of Bourbon?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,494.156,494.24,I would --
1978.77-69,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,494.24,505.579,"Two ounces reasonably might, the manifestations of two ounces might disappear from the bloodstream much more quickly than a plaintiff would?"
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,505.579,510.217,"My instinct is just to agree with that assessment, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,534.531,539.369,Is there anything that record where the police explained this?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,539.369,540.255,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,540.542,542.437,"He is not given the second time, isn't he?"
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,544.29,545.072,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,787.469,790.602,"Well, what sort of administrative appeal did he take?"
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,790.602,807.839,"Within 10 days from any action of the Registrar, a driver may appeal for a de novo evidentiary hearing before a board of appeal presiding over the Registrar's actions, that board in turn will schedule a hearing."
1978.77-69,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,814.894,816.991,Did he ask for that surrender hearing?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,816.991,818.435,He did.
1978.77-69,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,818.435,823.93,And the -- is there any review of that board's findings?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,823.93,824.536,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,828.635,830.182,In a superior court?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,830.182,831.838,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,831.838,835.65,And what was the Board's decision on the appeal?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,835.65,836.997,"The Board never reached it, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,836.997,838.783,Not because this lawsuit.
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,838.783,839.466,That's correct.
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,839.466,843.153,"Well, I don't mean asking if he questioned."
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,847.059,847.578,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,847.578,854.712,Would that have result at almost automatically in the administrative appeal was holding in the restoration of his license?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,854.712,856.208,We think so.
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,871.976,874.763,He preferred just to be a hero on the lawsuit.
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,874.763,875.011,"Well, after --"
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,875.011,879.141,"Knockout the statute lock, stock and barrel."
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,879.141,886.604,I believe my -- I don't want to impute motives to my brother's reason for bringing the suit.
1978.77-69,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,886.604,888.082,"Perhaps, we'll ask him."
1978.77-69,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,888.082,898.688,"Mr. Sikora, this may be irrelevant but is there any period of time between actual form of suspension and formal surrender of the license?"
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,898.688,899.359,There is Your Honor.
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,899.359,906.828,So that a man could be driving with a license as been suspended even though it's still in his possession?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,906.828,907.735,That's correct.
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,927.289,929.262,"Mr. Sikora, I missed something."
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,939.355,940.016,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,940.016,943.161,"Well, why would he still have to give it up for 90 days for refusing to take the test?"
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,944.508,955.861,"Well, the finding of the state criminal trial court would have been binding upon the Registrar we say and it is the kind of relatively simple --"
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,955.861,956.519,"No, no."
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,958.673,959.176,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,972.365,978.915,"Well, I still don't understand why -- it was the night that they refused to let him take it but he had still previously refused to take himself?"
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,982.961,984.194,I see.
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,991.043,992.626,"Well, how do we know that?"
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,992.626,998.596,"Well, that is the law in custom in Massachusetts if I may represent it that this is --"
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,998.596,1005.463,The law in custom is that when there's an initial refusal and then a request to take it and it's turned down and then that vitiates the initial review?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1005.463,1005.914,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1005.914,1007.725,Do you think that happens very often.
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1007.725,1019.473,"If there is a finding by a state trial judge that the individual had been denied a fair chance to take the test, then his initial refusal washes out."
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1019.473,1026.652,And there's a custom that happens often enough so you can tell us there's a custom that happens often enough so you can tell us there's a custom that that kind of finding is regularly uttered by the clearing officer?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1026.652,1029.521,"By -- yes, yes Your Honor, by the Registrar."
1978.77-69,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1038.337,1041.991,And what precisely was the court disposition?
1978.77-69,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1055.562,1057.404,And what was the charge?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1058.437,1059.69,"Yes, among several others."
1978.77-69,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1059.69,1060.675,Driving to endanger.
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1060.675,1063.991,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1064.157,1067.017,Do you think driving to endanger or under the influence --
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1067.017,1074.104,"Yes, there was driving under the influence -- driving to endanger and driving without a license."
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1074.104,1076.012,"Well, we just follow this up for a moment."
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1091.384,1092.2,"Well, --"
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1092.2,1093.067,That's what you're telling me.
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1094.733,1100.5,"The custom, -- the custom, I think Your Honor, is that if a judge decides in the circumstances that a driver has been denied --"
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1100.5,1104.286,"Well, but he presumably is interpreting the law of your statement is so deciding."
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1104.286,1116.219,"Well, we don't have -- we don't have an absolute time spent incorporated into a statute so that there is discretion deciding in the trial judge's judgment."
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1120.573,1128.931,"Are you telling me that as a matter of Massachusetts law on this record, there was no refusal and that's why the statute is unconstitutional as applied in this case?"
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1140.776,1147.17,"Well, I hesitate to say as a matter of Massachusetts law, as a matter of the trial judge's application."
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1147.17,1153.187,But you told me that that is a consistent application that we can be sure that the administrator would have recognized as the law?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1153.187,1155.094,That's correct.
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1155.094,1161.922,So the -- the question of when a refusal takes place is not really just a yes or no question on all circumstances.
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1161.922,1164.046,"No, it's a very circumstantial question, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1164.046,1170.248,It's a question that's left entirely the discretion of the police under the -- as a pre-suspension matter.
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1170.248,1173.767,Initially to the police and ultimately to a trial judge.
1978.77-69,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1173.767,1174.314,"Well, are you saying --"
1978.77-69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1174.314,1180.076,"In this case, are you telling that there was no refusal?"
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1180.076,1180.966,That's correct.
1978.77-69,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1180.966,1181.326,"Well, when --"
1978.77-69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1181.326,1184.55,Then why do we have a case of controversy here?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1184.55,1189.91,Because instead of and as an applied attack upon the statute we have here a facial attack.
1978.77-69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1189.91,1202.551,"Well, when he attack -- if this -- if there was no refusal in this case by the respondent, as has been found by the magistrate court, why can't he make any attack in the statute on its face where he has applied anything else?"
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1202.551,1206.175,Suppose the answer is just a statute resulting to denial of his license.
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1206.175,1218.826,"As a practical matter, because he forwent the same day hearing, he did not give his license back and continued to be inconvenience by 28 days."
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1218.826,1222.304,Is the statute -- is his license in the state of suspension is still or not?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1222.304,1223.572,"No, no, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1226.067,1237.171,"So that the question presented in your brief, whether a statute imposing a uniform temporary suspension of the driver's license for his refusal to take a chemical test or so on?"
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1249.442,1250.461,It was.
1978.77-69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1251.366,1255.419,In fact was it that his license suspended for 90 days?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1255.419,1258.168,It -- it was by the Registrar?
1978.77-69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1258.168,1261.114,"The fact it wasn't on that ground, was it?"
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1263.224,1265.11,"Yes, as a result of this lawsuit."
1978.77-69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1265.11,1272.321,"As a result of the finding that he did not in fact refuse to take the test, isn't that correct?"
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1275.263,1282.667,"No, I think that the federal district court view the statute almost initially as unconstitutional."
1978.77-69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1282.667,1285.778,I'm not talking about the Massachusetts courts in this case.
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1285.778,1286.337,I see.
1978.77-69,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1286.337,1291.086,Did the Registrar act in conformity to the District Court's order or the Massachusetts' court's order?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1291.086,1292.563,The District Court's order.
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1292.563,1297.608,Did the District Court ordered the reinstatement at the end of that so that he got to pack it 28 days?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1297.608,1301.457,"Yes, Your Honor, it's part of a temporary restraining order in this case."
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1301.774,1305.961,"The issue I gather on the filing of the complaint, next party or what?"
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1305.961,1314.53,"I think it, yes, that they should shortly after the filing of the complaint and the Registrar at our suggest and assented to the return of the license."
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1314.53,1316.424,"Well, he was ordered the return it was it?"
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1316.424,1320.81,"Yes, the --"
1978.77-69,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1320.81,1325.929,But the order of the court and the statute unconstitutional on its face.
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1325.929,1326.606,It did Your Honor.
1978.77-69,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1326.606,1328.219,And that's what's before us?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1328.219,1329.037,That's correct.
1978.77-69,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1329.037,1332.891,"But it's your position that's all that's all before us, that's your position?"
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1332.891,1342.821,That's correct.
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1481.527,1494.402,What was there about the appellee's conduct at the time of the accident that prompted the officers to say you should take a test?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1494.402,1497.003,"There were four symptoms, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1509.685,1516.999,"Now, does the statute require some kind of probable cause before the officer may require and suggest that he take the test?"
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1516.999,1517.503,It does.
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1522.961,1532.557,"Yes, but I what I mean, must it -- must it be something in the way of the showing of probable cause to believe that he's under the influence of driving to endanger or something in fact?"
1978.77-69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1532.557,1535.145,Or he could -- either that or you couldn't arrest him?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1535.145,1535.846,That's correct.
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1543.772,1552.398,"What if they just arrest him for speeding and there was nothing about and that suggested one way or another on being drunk, could they make him take the test then?"
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1552.398,1553.575,"Not properly, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1553.575,1556.289,It must be probable cause I believe he was under the influence?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1556.289,1557.254,That's correct.
1978.77-69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1557.254,1561.166,But there must be a valid arrest for driving under the influence.
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1561.166,1561.658,That's correct.
1978.77-69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1567.446,1577.519,And if the witness has required that he has to be a witness to the refusal like he does and to the refusal to take the test or to the behavior at the time of the accident?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1577.519,1580.289,"I think only to the refusal, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1592.231,1597.74,And the only offenses charged here were related to victim?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1597.74,1598.005,That's correct.
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1598.005,1600.478,And not to connect it with the accident was only.
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1600.478,1601.069,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1604.351,1614.488,Because driving to endanger is not only an offense as I know of Massachusetts for driving while under the influence.
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1616.562,1619.141,You can be sober and be driving to endanger --
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1619.141,1619.553,That's true.
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1619.553,1622.524,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1648.719,1660.754,"So, I gather really the state's argument here is certainly he is entitled to due process when he gets it all since he -- in order to beyond probable cause in the first instance."
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1670.572,1671.201,That's correct.
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1671.201,1672.497,Within the reasonable ground.
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1672.497,1672.785,That's correct.
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1672.785,1673.495,Is that it?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1673.495,1674.04,That's correct.
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1674.04,1677.846,"And that all adds up, you submit to upon the due process?"
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1677.846,1678.677,Circumstantially yes.
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1697.561,1699.4,And how soon can he get that?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1699.4,1701.541,On the day of surrender typically.
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1701.541,1707.216,And the notice of suspension tells him what? As to the day of surrender?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1707.216,1708.985,That he must surrender his license.
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1708.985,1710.21,How and what day?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1710.21,1710.554,Oh!
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1711.492,1712.564,Does it fix the day just as suppose not?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1712.564,1713.061,It does not.
1978.77-69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1717.189,1718.793,And where does he get the hearing?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1718.793,1721.878,He gets the hearing at the registry office.
1978.77-69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1724.124,1727.814,If he has a chance sir to tell his side of the story?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1727.814,1732.203,But he can't get witnesses if it is going to take any time.
1978.77-69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1746.648,1748.242,But his license will be suspended?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1748.242,1750.263,In the meantime.
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1777.251,1784.186,"Of course the difference is in Dixon against Love, you'd already had your judicial determination that may have violated the loss over time?"
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1784.186,1784.72,That's correct.
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1822.366,1825.225,Does the statute require to be completed in 7 to 10 days?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1827.65,1830.178,"It -- it does not, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1842.214,1849.46,And the 7 to 10 days results from the fact that sometimes there's a lot time for the police officer to come in to tell the other side of the story.
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1849.46,1851.031,That's correct.
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1886.391,1887.906,"Can I ask you, rather basically."
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1912.422,1930.885,We think that very few people would take the test and that everyone would seek the hearing when the statute was enforced approximately one out of three people arrested for drunken driving still resisted the test and we think that that presented to us --
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1930.885,1937.552,Why -- do you mean they would refuse the test because of the fact they are going to keep the license for five days instead of having suspended forthwith?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1937.552,1943.511,"No, I think there is a reflexive reaction to the inculpatory nature of the test."
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1957.062,1959.88,"Well, but you say that you've given that hope now."
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1964.274,1966.003,That's right.
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1966.003,1970.149,But why wouldn't it be equally definite as far as the 90-day suspension?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1979.086,1982.847,I think it's the immediacy and the certainty of the suspension.
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1982.847,1984.659,Immediately in three days later?
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,1984.659,1987.298,"Well, hopefully three days later."
1978.77-69,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2004.305,2007.873,Maybe -- the hearing officer may be more lenient to the police officer --
1978.77-69,0,36747,mitchell_j_sikora_jr,,2007.873,2014.67,"Possibly, but it's the immediacy, it's the fact that you are suspended immediately that we think is crucial."
1978.77-69,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2016.225,2017.349,Very well.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2024.033,2038.527,Thank you.
1978.77-69,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2038.527,2044.733,"Mr. Hagopian, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2044.733,2048.9,"Good afternoon, Your Honor, may it please the Court."
1978.77-69,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2095.125,2099.527,"I calculated on the record, it is precisely 30 minutes but it doesn't make all that difference."
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2099.527,2100.085,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2134.856,2140.89,How is that before us when you only are interested on the face?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2140.89,2143.529,"Well, I don't think it is Your Honor."
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2147.628,2151.376,"In a case, you are withdrawing anything except on the face?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2151.376,2151.544,Oh!
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2156.265,2157.972,Where did you reserve it?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2157.972,2175.558,"Well, when we brought our original motion for summary judgment, I believe we asked the Court to examine both questions the issue of constitutionality on its face because it was a class action and as applied to Mr. Montrym."
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2206.192,2214.965,Do you question the fact that he -- the State refuse to give him the test?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2214.965,2217.764,"No, he was refused that State did."
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2217.764,2220.861,"Well, do you abandon that point or not?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2225.114,2225.932,He initially refused.
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2225.932,2232.387,"Because the opinion of the lower court, the judgment, says the statute is unconstitutional on its face."
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2232.387,2233.213,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.77-69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2242.891,2243.46,"Well, this --"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2243.46,2244.563,Whether he was innocent or not is irrelevant.
1978.77-69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2244.563,2251.237,"Mr. Hagopian, if I'm -- unless I wholly misapprehended the issue on this case."
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2258.115,2258.9,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2258.9,2259.906,Nothing about guilt or innocence.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2259.906,2260.742,That's correct
1978.77-69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2260.742,2261.479,Just that fact.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2261.479,2264.374,"Well, when I say innocent, I didn't mean innocent of the substance of crime."
1978.77-69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2266.652,2274.63,"Well, if he didn't refuse to take the test then the statute is wholly inapplicable to him."
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2274.63,2275.819,That's corr --
1978.77-69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2275.819,2276.428,"That's correct, is it not?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2276.428,2277.501,"That's correct, yes it is."
1978.77-69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2277.617,2280.116,I'm right.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2280.116,2282.924,"Well, I'm not -- excuse me, I take that back Your Honor."
1978.77-69,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2297.998,2306.344,"But that was the whole point of your attack, isn't it that even if he did not refuse it, the police officer says he does and he never gets a hearing at the statute caused him to lose his license?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2306.344,2306.845,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2306.845,2308.347,That's why you say it's unconstitutional.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2308.347,2309.622,That's right.
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2309.622,2311.796,This was decided on summary judgment?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2311.796,2313.131,"Yes, it was Your Honor."
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2313.131,2314.538,In your favor?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2314.538,2315.736,Yes.
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2315.736,2324.735,So that all doubts as to facts have to be resolved in favor of the state I take it and not it's affidavits and filed on your behalf had to be disbelieved.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2324.735,2333.505,"That's correct, except to the extent that there was an agreed statement of facts that was filed by parties and that's in the appendix and that's quite extensive."
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2333.505,2336.777,And those are the facts then that we should go by?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2336.777,2336.927,Oh!
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2337.47,2349.522,"But anything outside the agreed segments of facts that's contained only in an affidavit submitted -- in support of your client, we must treat as having been resolved adversely to your client."
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2349.522,2350.276,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2370.52,2373.375,That's why I was curious as to why you referred to an affidavit.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2373.375,2377.0,"Well, the affidavit was in the state court pleadings."
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2377.909,2378.781,"Well, was that in the agreed statement of facts?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2378.781,2379.06,Oh!
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2391.897,2399.193,"Well, was it agreed in the sense that the state agreed that that's what transpired in the state court?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2399.193,2402.725,"No, that certainly was not."
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2402.725,2403.558,The state didn't agree?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2403.558,2421.51,But they agreed that the records -- they agreed that we have the record from the state court proceedings and they agreed to the veracity instead of submitting certified copies but there were affidavits in the pleadings in the state courts and I don't believe that they have agreed to the truth of the allegations in the affidavits.
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2439.187,2442.876,Is there any other statement of facts aside from the one of page 28?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2442.876,2444.052,"No, I don't believe."
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2444.052,2447.383,There was no word or any about Breathalyzer.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2447.383,2448.96,"That's -- that's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2453.282,2459.029,But you said it was all that the agreed statement of facts and I don't see Breathalyzer in here at all.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2459.029,2461.22,"Well, Your Honor if you look at the --"
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2461.22,2463.617,Where is it that it says what happened when he was arrested?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2463.617,2475.663,"Well, if you look at exhibit B which is referred to in agreed statement of facts, exhibit B is on page 33 and that is the face of the complaint in the state court proceedings."
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2475.663,2479.44,"Well, I see exhibit A referred to the statement of facts."
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2479.44,2487.111,"Well, I'm sure exhibit D has too, Your Honor and --"
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2487.111,2493.455,"Well, do you question as applied or not?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2493.455,2497.074,"Well, I think it's clearly the statute is unconstitutional as applied to Montrym's case."
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2497.074,2498.468,You -- you still maintain that?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2498.468,2499.578,"Yes, I certainly do."
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2501.307,2503.221,They didn't abandon it in the lower court?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2503.221,2504.785,"No, absolutely not Your Honor."
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2504.785,2517.369,What we -- what do we do if we disagree with the District Court's conclusion that's unconstitutional on its face but think that you should have the right to assert your claim that it's unconstitutional as applied?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2519.097,2521.41,"Well, I think you have to decide as applied here."
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2539.305,2543.402,You wouldn't then enjoin state officials for -- from applying the statute.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2545.319,2546.713,Right.
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2567.493,2568.882,What is the class?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2568.882,2580.647,Classes of -- it comprises all those motorists in Massachusetts who have driver's license who refused to take the Breathalyzer test.
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2580.647,2582.196,Where is it in this record?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2582.196,2583.647,"It's in the opinion, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2583.647,2586.895,It's in 16 (a) and it isn't at all what you say.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2607.172,2608.058,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2608.058,2620.652,"Now, I take it at the time you filed this action of the District Court, Montrym had already had an opportunity to have a hearing."
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2620.652,2622.008,"No, that's not correct."
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2623.1,2629.553,I thought he went into the District Court after he had had his opportunity for hearing before the Registrar.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2629.553,2631.307,"Yes, yes that's correct."
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2631.307,2634.891,Then how can this be a class in this action?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2634.891,2637.775,"Well, Your Honor, if the point is -- let me see if I can point to you."
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2760.373,2760.431,You also appealed --
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2760.431,2766.529,The only time he returned to this when the United States District Court ordered him to and then it took him seven days to return after the date of the order.
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2766.529,2770.076,You also appealed from the Registrar to the state administrative?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2770.076,2771.767,"That was, -- that was -- that's right."
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2788.347,2793.585,But why didn't you file your action in district court before you filed your notice of appeal to the state of administrative agency?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2793.585,2795.382,"I wasn't involved in the cases, I believe --"
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2795.382,2799.75,"Well, but your client is bound by it as his previous attorneys that before he (Voice Overlap)."
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2799.75,2807.366,"Yes, I understand that Your Honor but the going through the Board of Appeals was an exercise in futility."
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2820.22,2832.144,"You mean the law of Massachusetts says that if the state refuses to give the man a Breathalyzer test, they'll take his license and everything?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2832.144,2833.672,"That's correct, Your Honor, 90 days."
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2833.672,2836.193,But the law does not say that.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2836.193,2839.752,It says that if the motorist refuses to --
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2839.752,2841.117,You did hear what I said?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2841.117,2841.82,"Yes, I stand corrected, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2841.82,2850.54,"If the state refuses to give him the test, he then loses his license."
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2850.54,2851.077,No.
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2851.077,2853.24,"No, he didn't say it, but that's this case, isn't it?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2853.24,2854.1,No.
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2854.1,2856.685,Isn't that this case?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2856.685,2858.46,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2881.306,2891.501,I understood that the state court said that this man was not -- did not violate the statute because it was the state and not here --
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2891.501,2893.152,I don't think that's true Your Honor.
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2895.61,2897.291,"Well, where is the state courts?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2897.291,2904.255,"Well, the only thing in the state court that's in the record in the appendix, Your Honor, which is on page 33."
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2904.255,2907.796,Is there anything else in the record other than that?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2907.796,2909.391,"It's not on the state court record, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2909.391,2914.285,Is there anything in the record in this Court other than that?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2914.285,2919.658,None.
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2925.485,2933.441,"It says here, Breathalyzer refused when requested within the half hour of arrest of the station, see affidavit and memorandum."
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2933.441,2934.597,Yes.
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2934.597,2941.022,Where is the “affidavit and memorandum?”
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2941.022,2954.825,"The affidavit is on pages 38, 39 of the appendix."
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2957.869,2959.956,And on the basis of that it was dismissed.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2959.956,2960.862,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2962.022,2963.555,"Well, what are you doing now?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2964.571,2966.278,That's right.
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2972.509,2975.388,I should have wish I knew what was here.
1978.77-69,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2975.388,2980.797,But if he had taken a copy of this dismissal and --
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2980.797,2982.443,He did for that first hearing.
1978.77-69,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2982.443,2986.823,"And then he did do that, for the first hearing that it was available to him?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,2986.823,3005.075,"He sent and it's stipulated in the agreed statement of facts, Your Honor that the record in the District Court proceedings was sent to the Registrar before he revoked Mr. Montrym's license and the Registrar totally ignored it and in fact he wrote back -- well, Mr. Harris sent him a copy of the District Court record."
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3113.875,3115.906,But your client had a lawyer.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3118.216,3119.132,"Pardon, Your Honor?"
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3119.132,3122.678,Your client had his own lawyer.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3122.678,3124.262,He knew.
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3124.262,3128.771,"Then why does he need other notice, he's got lawyer to tell him what the law is?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3128.771,3131.982,"Well, I don't even know if he's own counsel knew about that fact, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3140.211,3142.795,You aren't required to know the law.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3145.307,3145.834,I don't believe --
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3145.834,3149.395,That the lawyers are not required to know the law then I agree with you.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3149.395,3149.685,Yes.
1978.77-69,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3172.138,3174.473,"But they're bound to it, aren't they?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3174.473,3175.343,Are they bound to know that?
1978.77-69,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3175.343,3176.042,They are bound to know that.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3176.042,3180.269,"Well, it's a custom Your Honor, I don't, you know I --"
1978.77-69,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3180.269,3184.708,It must have changed that ancient action of the law.
1978.77-69,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3184.708,3188.644,"If the law provided for notice, would that meet your complaint?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3188.644,3190.4,"Well, it certainly would help, no."
1978.77-69,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3190.4,3191.004,Wait a minute.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3192.14,3194.326,"No, I want something else besides that."
1978.77-69,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3194.326,3196.203,What else do you want?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3196.203,3198.412,I think they're going to give the hearing before they take the license.
1978.77-69,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3198.412,3210.465,"Well, I understood you to say that by custom at least, if one knew about the opportunity, the Registrar would allow him to appeal until the State decided the case."
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3210.465,3212.346,"Yes, but why should he lose his license first Your Honor?"
1978.77-69,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3213.126,3215.923,"Well, that he loses license before the Registrar acts?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3215.923,3217.069,That's right.
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3220.378,3220.484,He lose --
1978.77-69,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3220.484,3223.994,I thought the Registrar was the one who deprived him of his license.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3223.994,3229.131,He does but -- and I'm saying that he should have a hearing before the Registrar takes that action.
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3234.831,3238.24,I think you should really move until the question is asked.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3238.24,3239.069,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3239.069,3248.958,"Because his question was, could the Registrar relieve him of his license immediately?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3248.958,3252.088,He does in fact take his license immediately.
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3252.088,3254.083,"When he refused to take the test, the Registrar takes it?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3254.083,3255.464,That's correct.
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3256.125,3258.253,How in the world can he do that?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3261.035,3262.348,He sends a notice as soon as he gets the notice from --
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3262.348,3265.22,"Yes, what I mean he can't do it unless he gets the notice, can he?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3265.22,3265.98,That's right.
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3265.98,3267.109,That was the question.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3267.109,3268.825,"Well, I'm sorry I didn't understand it that way Your Honor."
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3268.825,3272.471,"Well, you should wait and then get into it."
1978.77-69,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3272.471,3274.13,The Registrar gets the notice.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3274.13,3275.042,Yes.
1978.77-69,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3275.042,3282.787,"Then he's in the position to act unless the individual tried, appears and gives him reasons why that shouldn't be done."
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3282.787,3285.115,"I know by statute, he is required to act, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3285.115,3293.38,"Well, I thought you said that custom accorded the individual a right to be heard before the Registrar."
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3293.38,3300.398,"After the revocation, after the notice goes out then he by custom he can get an immediate hearing but --"
1978.77-69,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3300.398,3302.544,"Still Mr. Hagopian, I don't think you made it clear."
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3314.263,3317.554,That's right and he can't drive in the meantime either Your Honor.
1978.77-69,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3317.554,3320.286,"That's the heart of your case, and you're not making it at all clear."
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3320.286,3325.678,"Yes the -- he cannot drive, the minute he gets the notice, he has to cease and desist."
1978.77-69,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3327.412,3335.034,"And you also, are you not contending that before he gets the notice he has absolutely no right to appear before the magistrate or whatever is called?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3336.707,3339.604,"That's correct, Your Honor, has absolutely no right."
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3347.438,3352.646,I understand you to alledge traffic violation.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3360.113,3361.516,I'm not sure I understand that question.
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3362.227,3366.203,When you are arrested for violation of traffic code --
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3366.203,3366.329,Right.
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3366.329,3367.305,-- of Massachusetts.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3367.305,3367.834,Yes.
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3367.834,3374.736,"Can't you go directly before magistrate, then and there if one is available?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3374.736,3376.799,"You mean to trial, Your Honor on the criminal charges?"
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3376.799,3380.493,"But you say how to do to it, you said you can't even go to it?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3380.493,3381.996,You can't go to the Registrar.
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3381.996,3383.394,I said the magistrate.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3385.224,3389.122,"We can go to a lower court and criminal court, that's correct Your Honor."
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3396.047,3396.792,Are you sure of that?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3396.792,3397.883,Yes.
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3397.883,3398.505,How are you sure?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3398.505,3403.783,Because it's inadmissible as grants for mistrial for fact that the police introduced the fact that he refused --
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3403.783,3408.833,"Even if the magistrate says, I don't think this man is drunk and turns him loose."
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3410.226,3411.071,Yes.
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3411.071,3411.76,He can do that.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3411.76,3412.234,Yes.
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3412.234,3412.729,I thought so.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3412.729,3414.936,But the Registrar will still revoke his license.
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3416.853,3417.592,I'm not talking about --
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3417.592,3418.489,"Yes, I understand that."
1978.77-69,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3418.489,3419.632,-- while if you say he could do.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3419.632,3426.583,"Well, let me say in general Your Honor, the criminal proceedings do not come before the registry action."
1978.77-69,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3440.697,3442.765,"Mr. Hagopian, let me ask the question."
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3466.713,3468.44,"No, in fact that's a procedure that you can --"
1978.77-69,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3468.44,3478.809,All you're really talking about is the suspension that the fact that there's an automatic suspension for the interval of time between the notice to the magistrate and the time he can go in and demand hearing.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3482.511,3488.95,That's correct and that procedure is inexistence in Massachusetts by the registry in several other statutes.
1978.77-69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3502.658,3504.915,"Well, he should be -- give the ground upon which he proposed to do it."
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3504.915,3505.074,Oh!
1978.77-69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3506.749,3510.796,And in this case would be because of your refusal to take a Breathalyzer case in such and such a date.
1978.77-69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3510.796,3520.954,And I thought also the hearing that you would require would be more than what custom here would afford.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3524.959,3526.295,"I don't take that position, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3534.013,3535.255,Let me ask you.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3550.886,3551.14,Yes.
1978.77-69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3551.14,3554.079,"And if you want a full hearing some other time, we'll give it to you."
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3554.079,3554.946,Right.
1978.77-69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3554.946,3555.976,That would satisfy you?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3555.976,3556.861,It certainly would.
1978.77-69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3556.861,3569.059,"So you don't think, you don't think then just a police report furnishes probable cause to suspend the license even for a day?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3569.059,3570.021,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3580.5,3580.91,"Well, when you say --"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3580.91,3584.15,It must be covered by the due process clause and that's totally absent.
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3584.15,3592.276,"When you say the opportunity to respond, you say you don't want an evidentiary hearing but you want an “opportunity to respond.”"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3595.917,3598.879,"Well, I don't think that this Court have resolved that issue."
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3598.879,3600.95,Or you're the one that --
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3600.95,3602.508,"Well, I certainly think he has an opportunity."
1978.77-69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3607.861,3610.568,"i.e.and what would be the issue be, that he did refuse?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3610.568,3611.077,Right.
1978.77-69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3613.039,3614.94,"Just a minute, would that be the only issue?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3614.94,3618.797,"No, because there's three other issues under the statutes before the registry can revoke."
1978.77-69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3630.656,3631.662,There would be three issues.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3631.662,3632.75,Yes.
1978.77-69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3635.631,3637.167,And those would be the only issue.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3637.167,3638.075,That's correct.
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3638.075,3649.533,"And then what if the Registrar after a hearing that he had contested all three of those by an affidavit saying the police were wrong and all three said, fine you can have your opportunity to respond, and your license is suspended."
1978.77-69,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3652.437,3656.203,"You'd say no problem if there was probable cause for that, is that your position?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3656.203,3656.753,Yes.
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3656.753,3658.827,"Well, but the whole (Voice Overlap)."
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3658.827,3664.567,They've got -- they've got to find that this is at least the prima facie evidence that the government has met there burden improving the --
1978.77-69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3664.567,3666.379,"Well, that's a little more than probable cause?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3666.379,3667.982,"Well, I suppose it is Your Honor."
1978.77-69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3667.982,3671.381,"Well, of course it is, most probable cause of termination to ex parte?"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3671.381,3672.468,Yes.
1978.77-69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3674.081,3674.56,Yes.
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3674.56,3675.012,Yes.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3675.012,3678.871,In criminal proceedings Your Honor that may be true.
1978.77-69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3698.465,3708.657,I'm just suggesting to you that there are an awful lot of important probable cause if terminations that involved loss of liberty that are made ex parte and made only by one person in writing.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3708.657,3710.36,"In a criminal sense, yes."
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3711.836,3712.356,Are you saying this Court --
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3712.356,3718.62,-- that the Court has ever held were an ex parte that could be a deprivation of a property interest in the civil sense.
1978.77-69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3718.62,3721.025,You can deprive a person of liberty --
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3721.025,3721.828,But not property?
1978.77-69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3721.828,3724.773,-- but not property ex parte?
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3726.568,3729.61,"Not in -- in a criminal sense, yes."
1978.77-69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3763.668,3767.66,"Well, I am hunting around, a little I'm sure I could find --"
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3767.66,3770.515,"Well, I know that there are number of old cases."
1978.77-69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3804.825,3808.937,They are not for 90 days if they refuse to take the Breathalyzer test under the present act.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3808.937,3810.499,That's -- that's correct Your Honor.
1978.77-69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3816.161,3821.729,"Well, the Massachusetts by enacting this legislation said there yes, there is."
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3824.074,3829.139,"Well, I submit to you, Your Honor that they have enacted it because they feel that instant punishment."
1978.77-69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3830.835,3832.652,Suspension of license --
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3832.652,3835.254,-- is a deterrent for people who refuse to take the Breathalyzer.
1978.77-69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3835.254,3837.26,"Precisely, because they thought there was a need for it."
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3839.014,3839.934,Yes.
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3839.934,3845.653,"That's what Judge Campbell said, wasn't it that purpose was to deter people from refusing to take the Breathalyzer."
1978.77-69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3845.653,3849.224,And I think that's important to our system of justice.
1978.77-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3862.109,3862.289,Maybe you should.
1978.77-69,1,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3862.289,3863.713,I don't think that deters crime.
1978.77-69,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3864.442,3868.166,Maybe we should do away with oral argument.
