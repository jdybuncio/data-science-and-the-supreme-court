1991.91-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.4,"We'll hear argument next in 91-453, David H. Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,54.336,60.111,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,99.559,110.776,"Mr. Lewis, is it perfectly clear from the opinion of the majority in the supreme court of South Carolina that they accepted the hypothesis that he was denied all economically viable use of his land?"
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,110.776,112.035,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-453,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,112.035,115.177,So you feel it was completely worthless.
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,115.177,116.81,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-453,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,116.81,119.11,Would you be willing to give it to me?
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,119.11,124.885,"I don't own it, but with the taxes that are owed on it I would be willing to give it to you, yes, sir."
1991.91-453,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,128.556,151.432,"On the subject of concessions, do you, or did you concede that discouraging construction... and I'm referring, by the way, to the findings set out on page 16 of the red brief... that discouraging the construction near the beach dune area is necessary to prevent a great public harm?"
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,151.432,153.222,"No, sir, we did not concede that."
1991.91-453,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,178.21,195.461,"Does that always require, in your view, the payment of compensation if all economically viable use of the land is gone, or is that not applicable if there's a nuisance?"
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,195.461,200.803,"I think it is always applicable, and I don't think that--"
1991.91-453,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,200.803,209.419,"So even if this were a nuisance, compensation would be required if the restriction on the land took away all of its economic viability."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,209.419,210.17,"--Yes, sir."
1991.91-453,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,237.628,239.158,Is land different from--
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,245.163,245.653,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,248.054,250.816,Is land different from other property in that regard?
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,250.816,251.407,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,263.095,264.126,"Well, it happened to be land."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,264.126,265.145,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,266.858,271.379,"I mean, if it had been a cow, we would have said a cow, I assume."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,272.731,273.66,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,273.66,274.781,That doesn't seem to be very remarkable.
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,294.317,295.929,"Well, I think first of all--"
1991.91-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,295.929,296.801,It's totally useless.
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,300.241,301.152,"--No, sir."
1991.91-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,301.152,303.774,Because that's a building and not land.
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,303.774,306.355,That is... the building and the land go together as a unit.
1991.91-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,345.621,347.742,It's not a fundamental right to own personal property.
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,347.742,349.515,"--Yes, sir, it's a fundamental right to own it."
1991.91-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,358.169,362.592,What's your authority for the proposition that the ownership of property is a fundamental right?
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,362.592,375.761,"I think if you go back to the fact of the Fifth Amendment, when they say that you can't take property without paying just compensation, that's a right to own and use property."
1991.91-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,375.761,380.126,It's a right not to be deprived of property without being paid compensation.
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,380.126,380.434,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,380.434,386.949,But that's a much more careful statement of the proposition than the statement that ownership of property is a fundamental right.
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,388.909,389.29,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1991.91-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,396.935,399.216,"Well, why do you say it's a fundamental right?"
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,399.216,411.505,I say it's a fundamental right because if you have property and you go back and see that the uses of property are what makes up property.
1991.91-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,425.875,434.98,"Well, the fact that property is jus made up of uses does not necessarily prove that the ownership of it is a fundamental right."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,443.125,443.516,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,443.516,446.688,You don't have to expound on whether property is a fundamental right.
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,452.802,453.523,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-453,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,457.845,487.954,"Mr. Lewis, could we change direction here a moment, and may I inquire, there was a law passed subsequently that... under which South Carolina provided that a property owner affected by this earlier regulation could apply for a permit to build nonetheless with certain conditions attached, right?"
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,487.954,491.007,That was two years between the first enactment--
1991.91-453,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,491.007,491.788,Yes.
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,491.788,493.438,"--And then this amendment in 1990, yes, ma'am."
1991.91-453,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,493.438,498.992,Did the petitioner ever apply for such a permit?
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,498.992,500.184,"No, he did not."
1991.91-453,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,500.184,525.201,"Don't... to the extent that you are arguing there is a permanent taking here, regulatory taking, don't our cases indicate that perhaps it's not right unless and until the application for an exemption has been sought?"
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,525.201,527.112,"Not in this case, no."
1991.91-453,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,539.2,548.527,But did that finding determine the effect of this new exemption permit?
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,548.527,553.833,"--What we have is, it's interesting in the stipulations in the court below."
1991.91-453,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,585.483,587.313,"Well, slow down a minute."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,593.387,597.18,"--It had not been enacted, but it was in the process... Senate Act Number 391."
1991.91-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,616.723,619.656,"Well, that doesn't settle the rightness for us."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,619.656,621.479,"--No, sir, it is just a consideration."
1991.91-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,622.607,626.951,But do you still have a right to apply for the exemption?
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,626.951,627.991,--I do not think so.
1991.91-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,645.882,654.829,"Well, you're asking us to decide that, but we don't really know if you applied for an exemption whether you'd get it or not."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,654.829,663.184,"I think that under the... if you look at the findings of the Supreme Court and you look at the law and you compare the two, which is section 48.39 290(d)--"
1991.91-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,663.184,664.456,What if you looked at the dissenting opinion?
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,668.569,669.559,"--No, sir."
1991.91-453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,678.995,687.259,They said I would remand to the Coastal Council its decision as to whether to issue the permits in view of the recent 1990 amendments.
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,687.259,688.391,Or to pay the money.
1991.91-453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,688.391,693.094,"Yes, but certainly one of the options was to consider it under the 1990 amendment."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,695.244,701.168,"I cannot say that one of the options in this case, because there has been--"
1991.91-453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,701.168,701.769,I know you don't say that.
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,707.225,718.431,"--They also said that it wasn't detrimental to the health, welfare and safety, so once they take... there you have to look at their opinion, dissenting opinion as a whole."
1991.91-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,733.639,743.747,"Well, there's no doubt, is there, Mr. Lewis, that there was a period from 1988 until 1990 when there was no permit for which you could have applied for?"
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,743.747,744.298,Absolutely.
1991.91-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,744.298,748.54,And you simply... the situation described by the supreme court of South Carolina did obtain.
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,748.54,749.301,Absolutely.
1991.91-453,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,754.283,762.54,We're throwing around the term no economic viability of this property.
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,762.54,763.218,Yes.
1991.91-453,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,763.218,770.975,"Viable is a good medical term, it isn't a legal term, but the lawyers have taken it over and the judges too."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,774.337,780.96,"What I'm saying by that, that this property is worth 0, $0."
1991.91-453,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,794.37,795.861,So it's a matter of valuation.
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,795.861,799.173,"Well, valuation is, of course, one of the keys in it."
1991.91-453,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,814.924,819.455,That's hardly the medical definition of an old-time term of being viable.
1991.91-453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,819.455,824.15,"Mr. Lewis, can I ask you a factual question that perhaps isn't in the record?"
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,829.072,829.743,"--No, sir."
1991.91-453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,829.743,831.013,"This is on the Isle of Palms, is it?"
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,831.013,835.147,"This is on the Isle of Palms, and, well it is--"
1991.91-453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,835.147,840.059,I thought that whole island was virtually desolated by the hurricane.
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,840.059,842.713,"--Most of the homes, believe it or not, on that island made it."
1991.91-453,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,867.492,879.059,"Counsel, suppose there's a residential subdivision and a person owns lots that are zoned for residential improvement, but they're vacant lots."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,899.473,903.346,It is not taking for the following reason.
1991.91-453,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,919.846,936.297,"Well, why, why can't the State say here that the finding was that this coastal zone, because of new and detailed studies with reference to erosion, is now a very dangerous place to build; dangerous for the owner, dangerous for the neighbors."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,936.297,952.256,"Because if look... if you go out there and if you look at the land, and you go out there and see it, you have a big house on the left, you have a big house, a four story house in the middle, and on the other side you have a big house, and you have houses all around it."
1991.91-453,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,957.069,959.891,Well then it's just a factual matter we're arguing about.
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,967.137,967.708,"--Yes, sir."
1991.91-453,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,968.996,979.354,"And it seems to me that there are instances in which all economic viability can be deprived because of an urgent safety reason, and that there's no taking."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,979.354,980.684,Well this is--
1991.91-453,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,980.684,982.967,And I don't think your answer has refuted that proposition.
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,982.967,1001.04,"--Well, what I'm saying in that case, if there's an urgent safety reason, the urgency of that, whatever it is, if it's a fire coming down on you, if it's a fact that there's a bomb underneath of you, the exigencies of that situations are what demands that."
1991.91-453,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1020.182,1022.513,But that wasn't challenged in this case.
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1030.089,1031.489,"No, sir."
1991.91-453,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1045.8,1047.871,"Well, I assume the legislature can make a finding, can't it?"
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1047.871,1050.022,--They never said anything about it being a great public harm.
1991.91-453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1134.888,1142.424,"May I ask, Mr. Lewis, on that question, the South Carolina supreme court thought you'd conceded that, at least they said that in their opinion."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1146.578,1151.57,I don't--
1991.91-453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1151.57,1154.954,It seems to me we took the case on the assumption that you had made such a concession.
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1154.954,1155.752,--Yes.
1991.91-453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1155.752,1157.735,"Now you're telling us you really didn't, and I'm not saying you did, obviously."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1157.735,1158.486,We--
1991.91-453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1158.486,1162.808,But were we on notice that that was going to be one of the things we'd have to decide?
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1162.808,1163.549,"--Yes, sir."
1991.91-453,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1178.348,1182.159,"Mr. Lewis, may I ask you two factual questions."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1193.288,1200.752,"There is something in the record, and I don't remember how long back, that there was a pond on one of our lots."
1991.91-453,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1210.22,1212.2,And that has disappeared naturally in the meantime.
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1212.2,1212.67,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-453,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1241.638,1241.999,All right.
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1286.969,1291.602,"I think, well first of all if I used the word finding I want to withdraw that."
1991.91-453,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1299.006,1300.378,"I may have used that, you may not have."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1324.964,1329.167,It is a shorthand for the legislature and a labeling of the legislature and has no basis.
1991.91-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1333.96,1352.753,"Okay, counsel, I see that your opponent at one point says the issue of temporary taking was preserved at trial by stipulation, and hence that it too is not right."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1352.753,1362.089,I don't believe the stipulation said that the argument on the temporary take is reserved.
1991.91-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1366.531,1379.52,"Let's assume that... let's assume that we disagree with you that, that your overall claim is not right because of your right to apply for an exception."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1394.919,1404.626,"--Yes, it's... we say the temporary taking would be the same standard so that all of the facts, everything is in this record with reference to temporary take."
1991.91-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1409.631,1409.968,"Well, I don't know."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1420.125,1420.517,That's it.
1991.91-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1428.28,1429.262,Well I know he was going to build a house.

1991.91-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1433.524,1437.407,"Well I know plans are in the record, but you never did apply for a building permit, I guess."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1445.332,1451.186,"There was evidence that he was going to build the house that's in the record, and there's a stipulation that they wouldn't let him."
1991.91-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1451.186,1454.859,"Well yes, but we still... you still haven't answered my question."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1459.861,1461.163,Was there specific evidence--
1991.91-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1461.163,1461.623,Was it?
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1461.623,1462.562,"--as to the starting date, no sir."
1991.91-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1468.618,1472.481,"Well I don't know, you could say I intended to build right away, I suppose--"
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1472.481,1474.514,"Oh, I think that is definitely within the record, that he intended to build right away."
1991.91-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1474.514,1477.306,"--If you were going to build two houses, one of them for speculation."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1477.306,1478.536,No question.
1991.91-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1480.619,1489.872,"Well, then if you're building... if you're going to build a spec house, you don't always just build right away, you try to figure out what the market is."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1489.872,1492.226,"Oh, that is exactly right."
1991.91-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1496.076,1497.328,"Well, I think it does."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1497.328,1499.82,It only goes to the quantum of the damages.
1991.91-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1499.82,1504.531,"Well, I don't know."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1510.135,1515.52,"Oh, yes, sir, I think that is in the record already, as to at least one house."
1991.91-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1515.52,1550.283,"Mr. Lewis, the Respondent's brief contends that the South Carolina supreme court understood you to be advancing a very narrow argument, to whit, that any use of the police power that takes away the total economic value of your land is a taking, no matter what nuisance or no nuisance, no matter what, the basis of the use of the police power."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1553.545,1573.007,"No, sir, my argument is that... and I think you will look at the order of Judge Patterson and you will find that what we said was that when we are denied, under the Tiburon test, we are denied an owner economically viable use of the land, we get paid for a taking."
1991.91-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1574.058,1576.66,No matter what the reason for the statute was?
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1576.66,1577.331,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1579.792,1581.963,"So your answer is yes, that is a fair characterization?"
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1581.963,1582.344,"--Yes, sir."
1991.91-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1608.463,1612.275,"You want the per se rule, and you argued it below."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1628.385,1629.876,"--I deny that, yes, sir."
1991.91-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1629.876,1631.228,You denied it below and you continue to deny it here.
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1631.228,1646.668,"That's right because if I take the Tiburon test, I have to read out the word ""or"" to make that test work because that is an ""or"" test in Tiburon and it says, substantially advanced legitimate State interest or denies an owner economically viable uses."
1991.91-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1672.003,1673.105,But that is a fall-back position.
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1673.105,1673.475,Yes--
1991.91-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1673.475,1675.316,You don't think you should do it at all--
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1675.316,1676.969,"--No, sir, absolutely not."
1991.91-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1676.969,1680.96,"--You always have to pay even if it is to save the city, right?"
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1680.96,1687.645,"Well, to save the city, now then you are going to get into factual information as to what your before use was, your after use was--"
1991.91-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1687.645,1688.586,"No, you have to just pay, just pay."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1693.468,1693.869,--Right.
1991.91-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1693.869,1695.78,"--You pay, no matter what the reason."
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1695.78,1697.211,If it had value before--
1991.91-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1697.211,1697.572,Right.
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1697.572,1699.041,"--And you took it away, you pay."
1991.91-453,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1699.041,1703.485,"But, Mr. Lewis, you do have a fall-back position, do you?"
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1703.485,1703.964,"Yes, ma'am."
1991.91-453,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1703.964,1713.44,"That if we don't agree with that and think there is a nuisance exception, that this doesn't fall within it, is that it?"
1991.91-453,0,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1713.44,1732.415,"We call it a public necessity exception, if there is such one, and that is has to be imminent danger of such a magnitude to justify denial of just compensation and that the action's purpose is to control the imminent danger, not in this case... and that this case would not meet that test whatsoever, and I would reserve the rest for rebuttal."
1991.91-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1732.415,1734.425,"Very well, Mr. Lewis."
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,1736.088,1744.813,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1812.307,1832.923,"Well, if you say there is no constitutional right to harm others and link it to your argument... what about Justice Holmes' opinion in Mann against Pennsylvania Coal Company, where there was no question that the sub-surface mining would very likely to cause the subsidence of some residences, and yet the Court said that the compensation had to be paid."
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,1832.923,1838.796,I think what Justice Holmes was looking at was the balance between the degree of harm.
1991.91-453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1855.627,1878.561,"Well, but don't you think then your proposition that there is no right to harm others in support of your idea of the nuisance exception is perhaps too broad, that sometimes there will be some actions of property owners that may cause some sort of harm to others and yet, perhaps they may not be totally proscribed without paying compensation?"
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,1878.561,1879.722,I would concede that.
1991.91-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1897.465,1901.176,"Well, it seems to me we have two extreme positions here."
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,1916.517,1918.798,I think what the... no--
1991.91-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1918.798,1929.677,"Did they find that this was an enormous amount of harm, that it was something that rose to the level of a threat to life and limb or even a public nuisance?"
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,1929.677,1933.648,"--I think if I might answer, they did two things."
1991.91-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1966.619,1969.173,Did it say highest type of police power activity?
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,1969.173,1985.562,"No, sir, it does not say that, but I think that that has been the position taken by the solicitor general and by this Court, that if there is a great threat to life and property, that certainly would fit within the commonly called nuisance exception."
1991.91-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1999.541,2002.353,What was the great threat to life or property?
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2012.13,2015.082,I think that the threat is very real.
1991.91-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2054.759,2062.704,"--And that is enough to prevent all building entirely, not necessary precautions, just say you can't build?"
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2062.704,2074.641,"--If I follow your question, I think that the answer is that there is clear evidence that the closer you build to the ocean and if you build upon the beach dune system, that you run--"
1991.91-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2074.641,2075.581,"This is behind the dunes, isn't it?"
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2079.966,2098.188,"--Currently, the property is behind the dunes, but the evidence presented by the South Carolina Coastal Council said 20 percent of the time in the last 40 years, the shoreline has been landward of the road behind him, and 50 percent of the time this lot has either been on the active beach or under water."
1991.91-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2105.845,2111.347,Apparently not unstable enough and not often enough to stop people from building houses all up and down the same street.
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2111.347,2128.09,"People, before the passage of this act, built up to the highest up-rush of the waves on our coast with no consideration at all for what threat they would create for themselves and others."
1991.91-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2135.717,2140.87,Is there any indication that this property was ever in front of the dunes?
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2144.513,2145.354,Completely.
1991.91-453,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2169.791,2177.545,"Well, Mr. Harness, with reference to the adjacent homes, the homes that have been built on adjacent property."
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2198.649,2203.291,"My theory would not take me that far for two reasons, I think."
1991.91-453,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2213.899,2216.881,"No, I know that's typical."
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2230.169,2231.571,Again--
1991.91-453,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2231.571,2234.643,Wouldn't your theory go that far?
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2234.643,2238.186,"--No, I don't think it would, for two reasons."
1991.91-453,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2238.186,2239.676,Then what's the difference?
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2239.676,2240.928,For two reasons.
1991.91-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2253.043,2255.306,"Excuse me, I don't understand."
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2263.752,2266.944,--These people had already built--
1991.91-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2266.944,2270.607,And he had already bought the property.
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2270.607,2272.938,--These people had already built--
1991.91-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2272.938,2274.728,"He spent several million dollars, didn't he?"
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2276.91,2278.512,--About a million dollars.
1991.91-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2284.404,2287.097,"Yeah, and they probably didn't even spend a million dollars."
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2287.097,2289.347,"Probably not, yeah."
1991.91-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2290.98,2292.75,"When they built, there was nobody else who had houses."

1991.91-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2310.554,2313.937,"Well, I am sorry, I interrupted you on reason one."
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2323.294,2324.293,Excuse me.
1991.91-453,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2370.374,2381.741,"Well, it seems to me you're talking policy issues that could be addressed by a legislative body, but you're not addressing the limits of the Constitution at all, by that response."
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2391.258,2404.168,"--I think that the answer to that question, first of all... let me get some clarification."
1991.91-453,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2410.321,2425.872,"Well, I'm trying to have you describe for us what limitations there are under your view of what the Constitution requires with the takings clause."
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2438.421,2457.885,"At least as it relates to public health and safety, if there is a great threat to public health and safety, as there is at least from the legislators' point of view in this case, I think that there is insulation given to the activity of the State."
1991.91-453,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2471.483,2503.503,"Well, suppose the danger is to the property owner himself or herself as to construction on a particular site, either because it's too steep and the house will slide away with the next rain, or because it's on an earthquake faultline, or because it's on a shoreline, not concerned with the neighbors or other people, just with the safety of the people who would build on it."
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2503.503,2524.207,"--I think even in those circumstances, I think I would agree with the solicitor general that even in circumstances where there is construction upon unstable or very dangerous land, that even there, it is for protection of that house, and those people that the State could pass a law to prevent that such construction, even though it may not have the--"
1991.91-453,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2524.207,2525.95,You could prevent new construction.
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2525.95,2527.38,--That is correct.
1991.91-453,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2527.38,2532.844,"Now, can you require the person living in an unsafe dwelling to totally remove it?"
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2545.1,2546.001,No compensation.
1991.91-453,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2576.594,2589.802,"How do you explain an alternative statement in the Agins case in which we do, it seems to me, indicate that there is a taking, if the owner is denied all economically viable use of his land."
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2591.873,2595.806,"The court has never, to my knowledge, applied that test."
1991.91-453,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2628.137,2632.44,There is no doubt that there was an investment expectation here.
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2634.431,2644.92,"Well, yes, but the court below has never asked to reach that point because it was never an issue before them."
1991.91-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2680.783,2691.109,"But do you think... I didn't understand the South Carolina court to go on that basis, that he didn't have any valid expectation."
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2691.109,2695.101,The supreme court did not discuss that because it did not have to reach it.
1991.91-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2695.101,2721.329,"Well, if it comes here, I think if the case comes here, I thought the California court... or your State court said that even if there is a valid investment expectation, even if the law deprives the landowner of all economic value, even if this law is valid, and no pay."
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2721.329,2723.339,That is not the way I read it.
1991.91-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2760.956,2776.634,"Am I right at least to this extent, that if... that your State court's opinion would bar also any claim of a temporary taking?"
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2776.634,2779.248,That's correct.
1991.91-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2867.698,2870.59,I'm not talking about reasonable investment-backed expectations.
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2908.354,2909.573,That is--
1991.91-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2909.573,2912.295,Isn't that a fair characterization of the opinion?
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,2912.295,2912.986,"--No, sir."
1991.91-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2946.799,2950.791,"I agree that they didn't have to get to it, but I'm not sure I agree that they didn't get to it."

1991.91-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2996.211,2999.424,Is that the position you're defending?
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,3010.229,3011.551,"No, my position is not that."
1991.91-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3013.351,3017.786,Well then again I don't understand why Carter would have been overruled by acknowledging the claim here.
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,3017.786,3025.74,"--In Carter, there was no question raised about the degree of harm."
1991.91-453,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3091.797,3116.183,"But we can't assume that that purpose applies in this case, can we, because the... isn't the effect of the... what was it, the 1990 amendments, indicates that that purpose is in fact not going to be realized in every case, otherwise they wouldn't have made provision for exceptions, so we can't assume that that is necessarily a fact that applies to this case, can we?"
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,3116.183,3117.933,I think that you can.
1991.91-453,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3143.679,3151.536,"Sure, but the rare and unusual circumstances would be circumstances in which building on a given lot would not pose a threat of harm to the public."
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,3155.409,3159.721,--That it is possible that--
1991.91-453,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3159.721,3160.793,It may be possible on this lot.
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,3160.793,3162.733,--It may be possible from a cumulative sense.
1991.91-453,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3172.15,3174.751,"Well, who issued... maybe I'm just playing with words here."
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,3179.504,3182.536,--It would be issued by a 14-member commission.
1991.91-453,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3182.536,3192.703,"Okay, so it's the 14-member commission that can go up and down the coast if there's a request for a permit and decide whether in a given case there would be harm to the public in building."
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,3192.703,3193.534,That is correct.
1991.91-453,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3193.534,3196.506,"And that hasn't been done here, so we can't assume what the result would be."
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,3196.506,3200.537,I don't think you can at all assume what a 14-member council will do.
1991.91-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3200.537,3206.852,"Mr. Harness, and you say the claim is not right because application to that council hasn't been made."
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,3241.694,3246.63,"No, sir, but could I tell you why the South Carolina supreme court did what they did?"
1991.91-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3286.594,3291.168,"Well, whatever the reason, they went ahead, and they did not consider it unright."
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,3309.609,3338.5,"Let me say that... let me try to answer that question, and I'm not attempting to avoid it, but it seems to me that what we are asking for first of all is that you uphold the South Carolina Coastal Council decision because of the narrowness of its argument, but if you're going to remand it, if you consider remand I think the remand should go to whether or not they can rely upon the petition's concessions, and whether they incorrectly rely upon the findings--"
1991.91-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3338.5,3368.28,"It seems to me that you've already conceded that the opinion of your State court bars any claim of a temporary taking, even if the rest of the case is not right, in which event, then the legal issue about the correctness of the judgment of the State court is before us and we have to... we can't say the temporary takings claim isn't right."
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,3368.28,3379.807,"--Well, it seems to me that you can say that the temporary takings claim is not right because no evidence was presented below at all about--"
1991.91-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3379.807,3395.866,"Well, I know, but that just assumes... but let's just assume that under the State court's opinion and judgment there could be no temporary takings claim for the same reason that it decided there couldn't be any claim at all."
1991.91-453,1,19150,c_c_harness_iii,,3407.126,3412.872,"--Well, it seems to me that the appropriate remedy... and I agree with the Solicitor General."
1991.91-453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3437.987,3440.638,"Thank you, Mr. Harness."
1991.91-453,2,16419,a_camden_lewis,,3443.77,3446.683,I will entertain any questions of the Court.
1991.91-453,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3446.683,3452.136,Apparently the Court has no questions.
