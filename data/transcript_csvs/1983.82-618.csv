1983.82-618,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.326,We will hear arguments first this morning in Kosak against the United States.
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,8.826,12.183,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-618,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,139.975,141.772,What has that got to do with democracy?
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,151.079,159.842,"Well, there are certain principles that come into a democracy of providing for the common good."
1983.82-618,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,159.842,166.23,"Well, how does the the principle... Up to the time of the Federal Tort Claims Act that they could not sue."
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,166.23,176.524,"That is correct, but you could bring a private bill before the Congress, which was the second reason why the Act came into being, because--"
1983.82-618,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,176.524,192.844,"Yes, but, Mr. Naftulin, isn't your difficulty here with the language of the Tort Claims Act as far as any claim... this is the language of it... arising in respect of detention of any goods or merchandise by any officer of Customs."
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,193.594,195.061,"--Exactly, Justice Brennan."
1983.82-618,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,195.061,204.088,"On the face of it that seems... What happened here was there was a detention of your client's goods or merchandise by an officer of Customs, wasn't there?"
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,204.088,204.792,That is correct.
1983.82-618,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,204.792,208.932,Then why doesn't that preclude recovery under that Act?
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,208.932,219.707,"Okay, for the following reasons: First of all, the exemption should be narrowly construed."
1983.82-618,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,523.631,533.315,"But, there the Court held that what the Plaintiff was suing on was not a misrepresentation, so it simply wasn't covered by that exception."
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,533.315,541.686,"That is right, but it is still arguable that it is any claim arising out of the misrepresentation."
1983.82-618,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,552.136,554.384,Why should they be very narrowly construed?
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,554.384,562.834,--Because of the reasons for the exemptions themselves.
1983.82-618,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,574.205,577.359,"Well, that really doesn't make much sense to me."
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,597.321,601.631,"Well, I am not trying to tell you to take it out of the exemption."
1983.82-618,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,642.927,663.92,"Mr. Naftulin, generally speaking, if you view the Federal Tort Claims Act as a whole, hasn't this Court interpreted the waiver of sovereign immunity narrowly so that it is a little inconsistent to argue that you should view the exemption narrowly."
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,673.242,679.162,"No, I don't think that this Court has given the waiver a narrow interpretation."
1983.82-618,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,718.289,722.521,"Well, maybe it is time for us to narrow it then."
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,722.521,723.724,"--I am sorry, I didn't hear that, sir."
1983.82-618,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,723.724,729.471,Maybe it is time for us to narrow it so people like you won't misunderstand it.
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,729.471,732.328,Well--
1983.82-618,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,732.328,740.606,I never understood that when you waive sovereign immunity you do it on the broadest terms.
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,760.818,764.223,--I don't think that--
1983.82-618,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,764.223,767.925,Sovereign immunity just says that you can't sue on anything.
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,771.094,772.858,--That is correct.
1983.82-618,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,772.858,783.074,"Well, now, when you waive that... They could have passed a law and said you can sue on anything, but Congress didn't."
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,803.503,805.846,"I don't agree with you, Justice Marshall."
1983.82-618,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,805.846,808.19,You think we can rewrite statutes?
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,808.19,809.611,I agree with you on that principle.
1983.82-618,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,818.388,821.746,"You want us to do something about two words, in respect... three words."
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,824.432,826.947,"--No, I don't want you to rewrite them."
1983.82-618,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,879.301,883.909,Where do we get all these cases on sovereign immunity if they waived it?
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,889.813,895.685,--Because sometimes these acts have to be interpreted by this Court.
1983.82-618,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,895.685,908.476,"Do I correctly understand, Mr. Naftulin, in essence what you are arguing is that the exception against any liability applies only to the fact of the tension of the group and--"
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,908.476,908.835,That is correct.
1983.82-618,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,908.835,912.365,--And that harm is done while they are detained the exception doesn't apply.
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,912.365,912.99,That is correct.
1983.82-618,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,912.99,922.94,"And, you arrive at that primarily by emphasis on in respect of as distinguished from arising from?"
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,922.94,924.721,That is one of the ways I do it.
1983.82-618,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1031.489,1038.736,"On that point, may I ask you this question."
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,1064.383,1068.115,I agree that there is that common-law remedy.
1983.82-618,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1112.098,1116.502,"But, you could have sue one of them for that one item then?"
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,1116.502,1117.252,Correct.
1983.82-618,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1117.252,1124.421,"And, you couldn't possibly in discovery in that case have asked questions about the handling of the other items?"
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,1124.421,1134.995,"Well, we thought about that, but I am sure... We felt certain at that time that the answers that we would have gotten were that we know nothing about this."
1983.82-618,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1257.304,1284.34,"Mr. Naftulin, the government also noted, I think, in its brief that Judge Holtzoff, who was apparently the drafter of this section, had analogized the draft to a provision in the British Tort Claims Act and patterned it after that under which very clearly damage caused by negligence of the Customs officers would not be covered."
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,1291.213,1293.993,I think it is to some extent.
1983.82-618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1352.031,1357.482,Is there... Why was the seizure made in this case initially?
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,1357.482,1367.057,The Customs agents accused Mr. and Mrs. Kosak of smuggling their collection into the country.
1983.82-618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1367.057,1377.115,I suppose that you might say that in some cases an initial seizure would be negligently made in the sense that there really wasn't any basis for it.
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,1380.067,1388.33,"It doesn't go to the legality of the seizure, okay?"
1983.82-618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1390.062,1401.872,"Well, if the agents had acted carefully, they wouldn't have seized the goods."
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,1414.43,1418.336,"No, I wouldn't in that situation."
1983.82-618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1423.552,1432.063,"So, in any event, in some instances at least you would concede that the government would be immune from claims for negligence?"
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,1432.063,1437.639,"Well, I don't... You have thrown the word ""negligence"" in there."
1983.82-618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1438.295,1439.123,You are quite right.
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,1439.123,1442.886,--I don't think that that is really a case of negligence.
1983.82-618,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1467.189,1472.453,"The case Justice White poses, as I understand it, the test is probably cause, isn't it?"
1983.82-618,0,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,1480.872,1484.106,"--I agree with that, Justice Stevens."
1983.82-618,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1487.354,1493.007,Ms. Oberly?
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1493.007,1499.677,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-618,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1520.747,1522.168,"Can you raise your voice a little, Ms. Oberly?"
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1522.168,1522.729,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-618,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1552.123,1573.209,"Isn't it possible to read that language though, Ms. Oberly, as dealing in kind of a common-law notion of detinue, intentional detention by the Customs agent and not reaching just negligent mishap while it is in the process of being detained?"
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1573.209,1592.499,"--It is our position, Justice Rehnquist, that there is just nothing in the wording of the statute or in its grammatical construction that supports a distinction between the fact of detention alone, such a delay damages, and damages that happen to property while it is in the possession or while it is being detained by the Customs Service."
1983.82-618,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1592.499,1595.434,"The language would certainly allow that distinction, don't you think?"
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1597.684,1605.665,"If the Court were to construe the language as allowing that distinction, it would simply be reading something into the language that is not there."
1983.82-618,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1614.818,1623.111,"But, you are reading it as if instead of it saying in respect to it said in the course of, and, those are two different phrases I think."
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1623.111,1637.51,"--Justice Rehnquist, one Petitioner's main arguments was that there is some special significance to the phrase ""in respect of"", and that somehow limits detention to damages caused by the fact of detention alone."
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1696.004,1698.925,It is true though that there is a difference in the language.
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1698.925,1713.433,"There is, but it is negated in this case by the fact that Congress in every committee report described this exemption, which is phrased ""in respect of"" as barring claims arising out of the detention of property."
1983.82-618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1713.433,1724.335,"You mean in effect that Congress, in saying ""in respect of"", in fact, is simply using another way of saying from."
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1724.335,1725.46,Or arising out of or--
1983.82-618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1725.46,1728.538,Arising out of or from.
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1728.538,1729.864,"--Or from, that is correct."
1983.82-618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1732.332,1737.909,"Is there any other subdivision or section where ""in respect of"" appears?"
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1737.909,1747.795,"--No, there isn't, Your Honor, but it is clear, we think, from the legislative history that Congress had no special intention in mind when it used the phrase ""in respect of""."
1983.82-618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1761.57,1764.756,"And, some people used ""from"" rather than either ""arising out of"" or--"
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1764.756,1765.881,"I don't believe that any of them use ""from""."
1983.82-618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1768.645,1774.081,"--Well, if you have to go to the legislative history, it is hardly a plain-language case, is it?"
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1774.081,1794.728,"I don't think... I think ""in respect of"" is virtually identical to ""arising out of"" and I think it is quite a hypertechnical dictionary construction for the Court to conclude that ""in respect of"", without regard to the legislative history, really has this special, limited meaning."
1983.82-618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1804.522,1810.113,What would be the case if there were an intentional damage to the goods.
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1810.113,1820.281,"--It would depend on the facts, but it is possible that it would be beyond... It would be possible that it would not be covered by the Tort Claims Act at all."
1983.82-618,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1829.652,1833.26,Or he might be subject... The agent might be subject to suit.
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1833.26,1839.336,He obviously would be subject to civil suit in any event just for negligence or for intentional damage.
1983.82-618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1839.336,1846.192,"I know, but I want to know what would you say about it in light of the ""respect of"" language?"
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1855.486,1866.794,"Well, the United States only generally waives sovereign immunity for the acts of its employees acting within the scope of their employment."
1983.82-618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1878.383,1878.898,That may be so.
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1910.917,1924.754,"--The plain meaning of the statute would, in my view, be broad enough to cover the example you are giving, but that is not necessarily a reasonable construction and there would be other ways of dealing with an agent's misconduct in those circumstances."
1983.82-618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1924.754,1939.936,--You wouldn't have to get into all those other difficult questions if this is a plain meaning of this statute at issue here is that it would also foreclose any actions for intentional torts.
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1942.778,1951.556,"Congress, Your Honor, specified the situations in which it was willing to assume the common law liability of the Customs collector."
1983.82-618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1981.95,1991.79,I just assume that if it was a proper seizure the only thing is the Custom officers... one of them deliberately damaged the goods.
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1991.79,1999.614,I think the most appropriate remedy in that case would be to sue him personally.
1983.82-618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1999.614,2010.454,"But, you would purport to... I take it you think the statute we are talking about here would bar an action for intentional torts as well as negligent."
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2010.454,2016.42,As well as Subsection (h) of the Tort Claims Act exemptions which also bars intentional torts.
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2016.42,2020.685,May I ask a question on the legislative history.
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2033.132,2040.597,"I can give you cites to a Senate report and a House report, senate Report No. 1400--"
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2040.597,2042.269,Is it quoted in your brief?
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2042.269,2043.862,"--No, it is not, Your Honor."
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2043.862,2045.19,So this is a new argument.
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2045.19,2046.533,So you should write it down.
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2046.533,2049.484,I was wondering because I hadn't seen the argument before.
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2049.484,2068.461,"Senate Report No. 1400, 79th Congress, 2d Session, at page 33 of the 1946 Report and House Report No. 1287, 79th Congress, 1st Session, at page 6, a 1945 Report."
1983.82-618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2075.975,2076.553,Can you quote one?
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2076.553,2082.471,--I don't have the reports with me.
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2082.471,2092.795,"This is really your principal argument though, because the language is different."
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2109.29,2110.461,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2114.772,2121.253,What is the force to your argument in the brief that one of the purposes of the exemption was to avoid all this kind of litigation?
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2121.253,2124.469,--It wasn't just to avoid litigation.
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2131.467,2137.528,"Well, do you think the existing remedy is adequate if there is some difficulty in identifying which officer caused the damage?"
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2137.528,2143.822,"I think there would be no problem in Petitioner suing the Customs Director for the Port of Philadelphia, who was clearly the superior--"
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2143.822,2147.883,"So, what your case really boils down to is that they filed the wrong kind of complaint."
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2153.553,2155.005,--That is correct and it makes a difference.
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2155.005,2156.177,So what is all the fight about?
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2156.177,2161.22,It is not an academic distinction between our position and Petitioner's.
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2172.06,2173.357,Namely that there was probable cause for the seizure.
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2173.357,2176.636,That there was probable cause or he was acting on the orders of a superior officer.
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2176.636,2180.51,"Which is true in 99 percent of the cases, isn't it?"
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2184.086,2186.741,I don't know whether it is 99 percent.
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2187.991,2191.631,"Well, certainly they don't seize property without probable cause very often."
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2191.631,2194.005,Most Customs searches are without warrants.
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2202.425,2210.312,"But, am I correct in believing that the practical significance of the government's position relates only to those cases where the seizure itself was unjustified?"
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2210.312,2232.475,"--Yes, Your Honor, but it is significant because Congress has provided one remedy and attached a condition to it and it is... Under those circumstances we think it is inappropriate for the Court to wipe those conditions or those restrictions out of Congress' earlier statute by providing Plaintiff with an additional remedy."
1983.82-618,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2232.475,2235.412,"Well, under 2006 do you get a jury trial?"
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2235.412,2237.364,The Customs collector would.
1983.82-618,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2237.364,2241.221,So that is an additional difference between the Tort Claims Act and--
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2241.221,2241.846,That is true.
1983.82-618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2377.448,2379.464,--Was that remedy available to this Petitioner?
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2379.464,2393.537,"--Yes, it was, if he was willing to waive $11,000 of his claim, because there is no judicial review under that statute and acceptance of the settlement under that statute constitutes final settlement of the claim."
1983.82-618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2393.537,2394.74,"The limit here is $1,000, is it?"
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2394.74,2395.066,Yes.
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2434.176,2437.91,"May I ask again, this is 31 U.S.C. 3723?"
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2437.91,2438.143,Right.
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2439.361,2442.08,Is that statute cited in your brief?
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2442.08,2443.094,"--No, it is not, Your Honor."
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2443.094,2444.047,This is another new argument?
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2444.047,2448.857,"Yes, although I called Petitioner's counsel on Friday and told him about the statute."
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2504.164,2508.63,May I ask one other question about 2680(c)?
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2514.752,2519.767,It is the government's position that it applies to any seizure by any law enforcement officer.
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2533.449,2546.194,"Well, does that mean that if there is an... An FBI agent executes a warrant and gets custody of some physical objects and they are negligently damaged while in his custody, is there any remedy in that situation?"
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2546.194,2547.928,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2548.896,2552.455,"That is unlike the other, there is no common-law remedy of any kind there?"
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2552.455,2557.454,"--Well, there might be a Bivens action or something against the agent, but I don't think--"
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2557.454,2563.014,"No, no, I am assuming that there was probable cause, but he just dropped the clock or something like that."
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2563.014,2581.351,"--The Ninth Circuit, which is the only court to address this, originally in a concurring opinion by Judge Tang... Judge Tang expressed the view that it did not include any other law enforcement officer, that it was limited to Customs or Revenue officers or other officers acting in that capacity."
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2600.858,2611.026,"It would clearly protect them for the delay and the alleged conversion, but it also has been held that it protects them from damage to the proper--"
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2611.026,2611.354,Yes.
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2629.8,2632.267,"--And, drawing the distinction between conversion and property damage."
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2632.267,2633.501,That is correct.
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2690.604,2694.898,"Yes, but they will be liable under the common-law theory in all of those situations, won't they?"
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2703.098,2712.142,Except that the government has protected itself to some extent by imposing limitations on when it is willing to shoulder the Customs collectors' common-law liability.
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2712.142,2718.185,"But, in all the cases in which the seizure was lawful, the problem is identical?"
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2718.185,2718.951,That is correct.
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2718.951,2720.326,Which is most cases.
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2720.326,2720.809,That is correct.
1983.82-618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2720.809,2732.726,"Well, your answer to Justice Stevens indicates that if this suit had been brought against the individual Customs officer in this case, it would not have been affected by this statute."
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2732.726,2735.6,"By the Tort Claims Act, that is right, it would not have been."
1983.82-618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2735.6,2737.413,"And, he might have won it?"
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2737.413,2744.628,"If he could have proved negligence, he might have won and almost certainly the United States would have paid the judgment in this case."
1983.82-618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2744.628,2746.768,Is that action still open?
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2746.768,2750.454,"No, it is not open to him because the Pennsylvania statute of limitations has expired."
1983.82-618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2756.044,2757.888,It hasn't been tolled by this suit.
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2757.888,2762.432,--I would see no basis on which it could be considered tolled.
1983.82-618,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2767.088,2770.663,The filing of one suit doesn't toll another of the statute of limitations.
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2770.663,2771.226,No.
1983.82-618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2771.226,2778.381,"But, the suit, you say, would be under Pennsylvania law?"
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2778.381,2788.329,"Pennsylvania seems the logical place to me because the seizure occurred there, Petitioner lives there, the Customs agents responsible are there from the Philadelphia Customs office."
1983.82-618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2788.329,2793.141,"So, it wouldn't be state law barred for federal law or anything?"
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2793.141,2794.281,No.
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2813.538,2821.894,"Well, it is no justification for rewriting assuming this is what Congress intended, of course, but Congress did use different words in this section than used in any other section."
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2826.017,2832.858,--It came to my attention through a student note on this case and which the student said he submitted to the Court.
1983.82-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2836.872,2838.948,What is the student's bottom line in that note?
1983.82-618,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2843.619,2848.367,--Students tend to sympathize with Mr. Kosak.
1983.82-618,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2884.571,2887.976,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Naftulin?"
1983.82-618,2,32162,jeffrey_l_naftulin,,2887.976,2890.226,"I have nothing further, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-618,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2890.226,2891.71,"Thank you, counsel, the case is submitted."
