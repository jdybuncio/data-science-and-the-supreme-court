1995.95-719,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.797,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 95-719, William Gasperini v. The Center for Humanities, Inc.--"
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,12.709,14.031,"Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-719,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,14.031,14.552,You may proceed.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,14.552,17.752,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-719,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,64.584,73.74,"Mr. Abady, I guess you agree that the Federal district court had to look to New York substantive law--"
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,73.74,74.749,Well--
1995.95-719,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,74.749,79.614,--for the cause of action and what recovery was allowed.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,79.614,80.143,--Yes.
1995.95-719,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,86.377,93.493,Has the law in New York been determined to limit tort recovery to amounts that are reasonable?
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,93.493,95.483,Not--
1995.95-719,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,95.483,99.727,It's my understanding that that's the case law in New York.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,99.727,103.848,--Not as a matter of substantive law at least with respect to--
1995.95-719,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,103.848,105.46,"Well, why isn't that a matter of substance?"
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,105.46,107.49,"--Well, at least as to the--"
1995.95-719,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,107.49,113.394,"I mean, if New York said, no tort recovery can exceed $100,000, would that be a substantive--"
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,113.394,113.865,"--Yes, that would--"
1995.95-719,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,113.865,114.216,--requirement?
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,114.216,115.177,--That would be a substantive--
1995.95-719,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,115.177,117.768,And what if the New York law says it has to be reasonable?
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,120.139,129.595,"--Not if the determination of reasonableness is a judicial determination by a reviewing court, as it is in New York under CPLR 5501(c)."
1995.95-719,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,135.449,141.042,"Okay, but what if it is coupled with New York cases that say it must be reasonable--"
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,141.042,142.835,--Well--
1995.95-719,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,142.835,144.134,--as a matter of substantive law?
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,144.134,147.828,"--Well, I think that the critical issue there is who defines what is reasonable."
1995.95-719,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,154.801,160.986,I suppose initially the trial court judge has to review that question and decide it.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,165.339,174.946,"--Well, under the Seventh Amendment, a Federal appellate court is not permitted to reexamine facts found by--"
1995.95-719,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,174.946,176.285,That doesn't answer my question.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,193.607,209.488,"--Well, most of the circuits are... many of the circuits are employing an abuse-of-discretion standard, but the Seventh Amendment does not permit a Federal appellate court from exercising review where the claim is that the jury's verdict was excessive, or--"
1995.95-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,209.488,215.942,"Mr. Abady, do you know of any State that does not have a rule that damages must be reasonable?"
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,222.447,227.05,"--Well, there is something distinctive about 5501(c) in New York law--"
1995.95-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.05,227.731,What is that?
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,227.731,233.483,"--and that is that under New York law as articulated by the New York court of appeals, which is the highest court in the State of New York--"
1995.95-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,233.483,233.834,Right.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,233.834,239.288,"--The appellate division has the ""final word"" on--"
1995.95-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,239.288,245.212,"I understand, but that is a question of how the New York law rule of law is enforced."
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,256.438,257.199,--No--
1995.95-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,257.199,259.709,It was my impression that every State has such a rule of law.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,259.709,260.38,--I think... I think--
1995.95-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,260.38,263.504,"And the Federal Government as well, and all causes of action under Federal law."
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,266.085,274.28,"--I think that the substantive law in most States, without knowing it precisely and exactly in every State, I presume that the--"
1995.95-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,274.28,275.602,You're not willing to say in all States?
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,275.602,277.492,--I'm sure it is in all States.
1995.95-719,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,277.492,287.12,"But Mr. Abady, didn't New York specifically change its law for the express purpose of getting a lid on damages?"
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,287.12,290.532,"Well, not a lid, and that's I think a critical distinction."
1995.95-719,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,307.292,328.416,"In this very field, what we've seen is a lowering of excessive verdicts, and what's startling to me about this case is going back to guarantee the basic Erie message that you are not to get dramatically different outcomes in State and Federal courts."
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,341.693,344.815,"--Well, I mean, I think you're raising an interesting point."
1995.95-719,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,370.094,372.636,"Mr. Abady, is this a State-created right?"
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,372.636,374.925,Is what a State-created right?
1995.95-719,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,374.925,378.358,"The suit, the claim in suit is based on State law."
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,378.358,379.22,That's correct.
1995.95-719,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,380.779,389.395,"And yet you're arguing that because of Federal procedure, you can get a remedy in the Federal court much larger than you could get in State court on the State-created right?"
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,389.395,389.886,--No.
1995.95-719,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,418.373,421.846,"Mr. Abady, you never got a chance, really, to answer Justice O'Connor's question."
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,423.627,438.417,"Well, the... what I'm saying is, where a new trial motion has been based on a claim for excessiveness or weight of the evidence, the Seventh Amendment prevents a Federal appellate court from reviewing that determination."
1995.95-719,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,438.417,444.27,Your point is that as a matter of constitutional law there is no... the Federal appellate court has no power to set aside the--
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,444.27,445.031,That is correct.
1995.95-719,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,449.455,450.315,--Do you think that's what Browning-Ferris held?
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,450.315,474.901,"--Well, I think Browning-Ferris addressed a slightly different issue, but interestingly, Browning-Ferris did indicate that this Court has never held expressly that a Federal appellate court can exercise review where weight of the evidence and excessiveness is the claim and, in fact, it's been the precedent of this Court for more than a century and a half, and a precedent that has never been repudiated, that a Federal appellate court cannot exercise that type of review."
1995.95-719,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,474.901,476.752,And what precedent is that you're referring to?
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,476.752,484.177,Specifically the cases begin with Parsons v. Bedford up through Fairmount Glass.
1995.95-719,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,489.15,489.521,"Well, Mr.--"
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,499.518,508.494,"--Not ""no possible review"", but the Seventh Amendment imposes a division on the review responsibilities of the district court and the court of appeals."
1995.95-719,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,523.784,529.856,"But there's nothing in the Seventh Amendment that says the district court, the trial court shall do one thing and the appellate court shall do another."
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,529.856,531.148,"Well, I actually think that there is."
1995.95-719,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,531.148,531.949,Well--
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,531.949,540.984,"The Seventh... the Reexamination Clause says, states, no fact found by a jury may be otherwise reexamined than according to the rules of the common law."
1995.95-719,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,559.127,568.842,"--Well, Mr. Abady, you do agree that at common law there was a group of judges that reviewed the trial court... trial jury's findings."
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,568.842,571.825,--But it's important to look precisely at what that... what--
1995.95-719,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,571.825,572.566,But that is true.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,575.546,578.188,--There was judicial review at the trial level.
1995.95-719,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,578.188,579.369,Right.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,579.369,590.657,"The only way that a new trial motion, where excessiveness or weight of the evidence was the claim, could be granted was with the authorization of xx nisi prius judge, who was the judge present during the trial proceedings."
1995.95-719,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,592.858,599.273,But sometimes that review was conducted without the judge who was present at the trial.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,599.273,599.553,--No.
1995.95-719,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,613.331,614.233,Let me ask you this.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,634.875,636.807,--A court of appeals is--
1995.95-719,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,636.807,638.88,No reasonable juror could have done it?
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,638.88,645.863,"--A court of appeals is not in a position, based on the restrictions of the Seventh Amendment, to exercise that type of review--"
1995.95-719,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,645.863,657.89,"Mr. Abady, the district judge is, however, and if you're stressing Federal procedure and the Seventh Amendment, we have a tension here between the award one can get in a State court and Federal procedure."
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,672.669,679.665,"--A district court judge is empowered to review that claim for excessiveness, and may look to State law for guidance."
1995.95-719,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,680.725,691.293,This district judge wasn't aware that he was to take as his standard for reviewing the verdict what the appellate division would have done in a similar case.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,695.906,697.898,--I don't think that's necessarily true.
1995.95-719,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,729.618,740.474,"Is there anything to indicate that he compared, as the Second Circuit did, this verdict with the cut-down that the appellate division had done in similar cases?"
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,740.474,744.748,"--No, because Judge Brieant didn't issue a formal written opinion, but the case was--"
1995.95-719,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,744.748,756.285,"So at least it's possible that he didn't know he had the obligation, in effect, to take the place of the appellate division when he reviewed that verdict for excessiveness."
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,756.285,758.847,"--Well, Judge Brieant's a very experienced Article III judge."
1995.95-719,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,760.247,766.151,"He might have thought, just as you did, that everything that has to do with judge and jury is Federal procedure."
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,774.686,782.492,"--Well, that's correct, he might have, but there's no indication that he exercised his discretion and authority in reviewing the new trial motion improperly."
1995.95-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,796.601,824.36,"Mr.... do I understand your argument... are... is it your argument that what the Seventh Amendment prohibits is only appellate review, and you concede, it seems to me, in this colloquy with Justice Ginsburg that the Seventh Amendment does not prevent the trial judge from being more liberal in setting aside a jury verdict than the common law would be--"
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,824.36,824.811,No--
1995.95-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,824.811,830.863,--simply because New York decides that judges should be more interventionist than the common law has allowed them to be.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,830.863,833.416,"--No, I don't want to be misunderstood for saying that--"
1995.95-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,833.416,834.285,"Well, I thought--"
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,834.285,835.096,"--exactly, Justice Scalia."
1995.95-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,835.096,851.587,"--Isn't that the premise of the question, though, that Justice Ginsburg was asking you, that if New York chooses to allow its judges to be more interventionist than the common law allowed judges to be with regard to jury verdicts, Judge Brieant, here, must follow New York law, regardless of the Seventh Amendment."
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,851.587,857.212,Judge Brieant is free to look to New York law to some extent in exercising his discretion under--
1995.95-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,857.212,857.411,Why?
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,857.411,858.472,"--the Rule 59 motion, but he is--"
1995.95-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,858.472,859.253,It seems to me he must look to the common law.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,859.253,871.05,"--He is constrained, in fact, by the common law, and this standard of a district court judge in reviewing a Rule 59 motion is a properly deferential standard."
1995.95-719,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,871.05,872.71,"Mr. Abady, there's no general common law here."
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,899.498,902.209,"I'm not sure, Justice Ginsburg, what your question to me is."
1995.95-719,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,902.209,905.391,"--My question is, suppose that is the New York law."
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,926.887,934.461,"Well, I think the determining factor is not how it's labeled but what, in fact, is the actual nature of a substantive law."
1995.95-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,943.535,958.746,"Suppose that that limit required either the trial judge and the appellate court to look at verdicts in order to make them comparable, including verdicts that have been rendered after the verdict in question."
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,973.166,977.51,That cannot be squared with the Reexamination Clause of the Seventh Amendment.
1995.95-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,979.27,984.522,So then you would have a substantive standard that could not be implemented in the district court.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,984.522,1002.465,"--I... the Seventh Amendment requires, I think, that the jury's findings of fact be accorded great deference, and that they cannot be altered based on an assessment of what other juries have done in other cases where the parties in this particular proceeding have not been a party to."
1995.95-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1002.465,1005.527,We use comparable sales all of the time in condemnation suit.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1015.685,1023.548,Because the Reexamination Clause of the Seventh Amendment imposes a powerful and definitive restriction on how a jury's findings of fact--
1995.95-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1023.548,1027.101,So then there are certain substantive standards that cannot be implemented in the Federal system?
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1027.101,1030.835,--Not substantive State law standards.
1995.95-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1032.334,1037.347,"This... in fact, the question I put is very close to, is it Cortini, Corsini?"
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1037.347,1038.94,"--Consorti, I believe."
1995.95-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1038.94,1039.49,"Yes, Consorti."
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1046.854,1047.244,Yes.
1995.95-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1047.244,1049.416,--that were rendered after the date of the verdict in question?
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1049.416,1050.727,"Yes, and I think that's incorrect."
1995.95-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1051.088,1053.589,Let's assume that it's correct as a matter of State law.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1055.709,1058.123,--But not as a matter of State substantive law.
1995.95-719,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1068.308,1077.114,"But Mr. Abady, for Erie purposes a lot of things that are categorized as procedural in other contexts are substantive for Erie purposes."
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1077.114,1077.605,--Yes.
1995.95-719,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1077.605,1083.468,"Because the idea is, you're not supposed to have a different outcome in the Federal court on a State-created right."
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1085.55,1085.88,Yes.
1995.95-719,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1087.322,1089.904,"So the statute of limitations, which sometimes is typed procedural--"
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1089.904,1105.063,"--But... but Justice Ginsburg, no Erie analysis, no policy analysis under Erie and Hanna v. Plummer can displace a constitutionally mandated allocation of responsibilities between judge, jury, and an appellate court."
1995.95-719,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1105.063,1108.383,"--Mr. Abady, your position, I take it, would apply equally to punitive damages."
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1108.383,1109.525,Yes.
1995.95-719,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1109.525,1115.269,And how do you reconcile it with our decision in Honda that due process required excessiveness review?
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1116.22,1116.721,No.
1995.95-719,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1127.517,1127.888,Right.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1127.888,1132.03,In this case there was judicial review at the district court level.
1995.95-719,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1147.028,1151.704,So that you're saying the appellate jurisdiction of this Court is limited by the Seventh Amendment.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1151.704,1152.264,Yes.
1995.95-719,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1152.264,1153.423,How is it--
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1164.841,1165.702,Not consistent--
1995.95-719,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1165.702,1175.329,"And if the standard that we established for Federal review were no reasonable juror could find... could have reached this verdict, would that be reviewable?"
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1175.329,1182.515,--The only review that is consistent with the Seventh Amendment by a Federal appellate court is review that goes to a legal issue.
1995.95-719,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1182.515,1203.478,"Well, but that's, I think, what I'm getting at, because I would have thought that the abuse-of-discretion standard, and review of a rule which pegs the permissible amount to, or limits the permissible amount to what a reasonable juror could have found, raised issues of law, rather than the kind of issues of fact which the New York rule does issue... does raise."
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1219.448,1225.953,"I believe, Justice Souter, that the Seventh Amendment, the Reexamination Clause of the Seventh Amendment is saying exactly that."
1995.95-719,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1225.953,1227.285,I thought the point... I'm sorry.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1227.766,1237.409,"Well, because ultimately an abuse-of-discretion standard would require a Federal appellate court to engage in de novo for review of facts found by the jury--"
1995.95-719,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1237.409,1238.15,"Well, but only--"
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1238.15,1239.552,--in order to make the determination.
1995.95-719,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1239.552,1247.356,"--Only in the limited sense, I suppose, that we engage, or an appellate court engages in a review of the facts on a directed verdict motion."
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1247.356,1248.237,"Well, again--"
1995.95-719,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1248.237,1249.019,They can do that.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1249.019,1250.118,"--Again, this issue--"
1995.95-719,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1250.118,1261.188,"I mean, you... they can do that under the Seventh Amendment, and I'm not... I don't see the essential difference between doing that and engaging in either of the two avenues of review that I've thrown out as hypos here."
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1261.188,1265.098,"--Well, the key in the command is contained in the Reexamination Clause, and the--"
1995.95-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1265.098,1268.861,"Mr. Abady, does the Reexamination Clause speak to punitive damages?"
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1278.328,1279.69,"--Some of them do, yes."
1995.95-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1280.691,1282.211,They do involve punitive damages?
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1282.211,1284.314,"Yes, some of them involve exemplary damages."
1995.95-719,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1284.314,1293.489,"Can you explain a little... I'm not certain how you... at the district court level, everybody agrees it's up to the jury to decide reasonableness, right?"
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1313.023,1314.532,A district court?
1995.95-719,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1314.532,1315.974,Yes.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1317.053,1317.524,Yes.
1995.95-719,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1317.524,1322.767,"And everybody also agrees that if New York is doing the same thing here, the district judge should do the same."

1995.95-719,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1332.284,1340.619,Which says that no jury will be... no... which says that no plaintiff can get more than what materially deviates from what is reasonable.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1340.619,1341.31,"--No, I think that--"
1995.95-719,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1341.31,1357.512,"If that... if I believe that that's like saying, no plaintiff gets more than a million, I know there's disagreement on that, but if I were to think you'd lose on that, and it is substantive, then you would say that the district judge is supposed to decide where that's so."
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1357.512,1382.098,"--Well, I want to be clear that there's a distinction between an authentic State substantive cap which is binding in a diversity action and which is actually reviewable by a Federal appellate court as a matter of law not only by a district court judge, but this standard that we're talking about which requires an appellate court to substitute its judgment for that of the jury, which is not--"
1995.95-719,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1382.098,1388.541,I think they made a mistake in thinking that the comparable thing was the Federal appellate with the State appellate.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1412.217,1446.06,"--If I understand your question correctly, if there is a State substantive cap, and if we assume for the sake of argument that what we're dealing with is actually a State substantive provision, a State, for example, that the cause of action, that under New York law on a particular cause of action a plaintiff is not entitled to more than $200,000 and the jury awards $500,000, and for some reason the district court judge is asleep at the wheel and he lets that verdict go through, a Federal appellate court would have as a matter of law review power to overturn that verdict because it is a question of law."
1995.95-719,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1446.06,1451.864,"The reason, then, that that is not this case is because you think it isn't a soft cap."

1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1523.291,1524.65,I believe it is a question of fact--
1995.95-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1524.65,1525.301,It is.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1525.301,1525.982,"--Justice Scalia, yes."

1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1559.775,1560.343,"Yes, Justice Souter."
1995.95-719,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1560.343,1561.225,--on review of the law.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1567.049,1573.974,"Well, this Court has indicated that if there is any standard consistent with the Seventh Amendment, it would be an abuse-of-discretion standard."
1995.95-719,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1573.974,1580.349,"Okay, but why shouldn't your answer, then, be the same on abuse of discretion as it was to Justice Breyer's question?"
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1580.349,1589.682,"Well, because I think the strict, proper correct reading of the Reexamination Clause is one that precludes any review by a Federal appellate court of issues of fact."
1995.95-719,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1589.682,1601.08,"All right, but my premise was, and maybe this is where we disagree, my premise was that review for abuse in effect is review for an error of law."

1995.95-719,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1629.159,1629.449,Okay.
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1629.449,1631.07,--inconsistent with the Reexamination Clause.
1995.95-719,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1631.07,1632.752,"Well, let me go to the other example I tried."
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1675.449,1676.039,Yes.
1995.95-719,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1686.347,1698.296,"So the Seventh Amendment precludes any appeal, any litigation of a legal issue on appeal which arises out of a mixed determination, then."
1995.95-719,0,28823,jonathan_s_abady,,1699.515,1707.5,"--I think that any time the appellate court is required to engage in factual review, the Seventh Amendment does not permit that."

1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1938.293,1938.663,--answers it.

1995.95-719,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2044.211,2045.242,Or appealed.
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2050.176,2052.516,"--What the... that's correct, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2052.976,2054.929,"In other words, it meant where appropriate."
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2054.929,2055.759,--It... no.
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2055.759,2056.821,So it gets you nowhere.
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2056.821,2057.492,What it meant--
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2057.492,2062.744,"It just says every judge can do it where appropriate, and the issue is whether it's appropriate when he's not the trial judge, so--"
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2062.744,2063.496,"--No, the decision--"
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2063.496,2066.167,--the words of the 1789 act get you nowhere.
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2066.167,2089.482,"--What I'm saying is, it does not in any way refute the process that was going on concurrently at common law where a decision was made by a separate group of en banc judges that an excess of judgment had been rendered, and then that decision that a new trial should be granted was sent back to the place where the case was tried originally, or to where the record was returned, in the exact words of Blackstone."
1995.95-719,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2113.108,2125.155,"Mr. Olson, if we were back in the era of Swift v. Tyson, when there was common law to apply, and Federal courts could divine it, you would never be making this kind of argument, because the Reexamination Clause would control."
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2148.941,2152.004,"--Well, I agree with everything that you said, and I was going to discuss the Erie question."
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2196.483,2200.854,"Mr. Olson, that's contrary to what we've at least said in the past the court's empowered to do."
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2233.636,2246.925,"Well, what this Court said in the Browning-Ferris case is that the court of appeals was to review the decision of the district court to see whether the court of appeals came to the conclusion... this is a unanimous decision of this Court 6 years ago."
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2255.581,2257.872,Did that involve compensatory damages?
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2257.872,2261.575,--This case involved punitive... the Browning-Ferris case involved punitive damages.
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2261.575,2268.548,"Am I permitted to think that punitive damages do not involve a question of fact, whereas compensatory damages do?"
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2268.548,2286.32,"I think both types of damages under the decisions of this Court, and the decisions of the courts that have considered them and sanctioned them, say that punitive damages and compensatory damages do involve some element of fact-finding and some element of the application of the law to the facts."
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2293.485,2295.486,You think both are equivalently factual.
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2306.653,2309.485,"--I think it is more factual, but we're on a spectrum here."
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2343.638,2344.988,It doesn't seem to me at all a question of fact.
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2344.988,2345.869,Pardon me?
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2345.869,2350.221,"It doesn't seem to me at all a question of fact, how much somebody should be punished."
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2350.221,2367.594,"In this Court's decision in Pacific Mutual v. Haslip, the Court said that appropriate considerations may be given both by the jury and the judge and the trial court and the appellate courts of how much other punishment existed, what was the degree of the egregiousness of the wrong, and things of that nature."
1995.95-719,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2377.329,2385.045,"What if you have a negligence action, a diversity, tried in Federal court, and a jury returns a verdict for the plaintiff."
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2398.704,2400.326,I believe it can.
1995.95-719,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2401.164,2402.586,Without violating the Seventh Amendment?
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2402.586,2403.625,"--Yes, I believe it can."
1995.95-719,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2417.656,2426.382,And I suppose you would say that the substance of the common law or the law today is that there is a large element of law in a damage award.
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2431.295,2433.235,I totally agree with that.
1995.95-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2451.006,2453.47,So where does the standard abuse of discretion come from?
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2474.362,2476.556,"--Well, I'm not sure exactly where it came from, but I--"
1995.95-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2476.556,2486.46,"What's the standard... if it is a legal matter, a legal cap, district judge applies it like any other legal matter, appellate court reviews it, by what standard?"
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2490.102,2494.788,"--Well, of course it is, if that's the characterization that you accept of what is going on here."
1995.95-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2495.596,2498.167,"But if that isn't the characterization, then it's procedural."
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2498.167,2498.698,--No.
1995.95-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2502.452,2507.614,"On mixed questions, like any other mixed question on the legal part, probably, but not always the--"
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2507.614,2513.228,"Well, what was very clearly going on here in New York was that New York wanted to change its substantive law."
1995.95-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2539.174,2546.63,"--In this particular case, Judge Brieant might not have thought he was supposed to apply the standard of New York, and the appellate court did it for him."
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2549.842,2566.222,"No, I think what the appellate... I think it is possible to assume, it's possible to assume anything with respect to what the district judge did here, because he didn't say anything about what he was doing, although it's clear that he did say on the record that he felt that $1,500 per slide was not something that was possible."
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2581.713,2585.726,"But Mr. Olson, you describe the history as though it's all or nothing at all."
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2625.111,2635.639,"The common law is very clear that the supervisorial function by the court above was to be considered in the matter of the sound discretion, though it's the words of Blackstone, of the court above."
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2646.304,2649.076,"You're considering the en banc court the court above, and I just--"
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2649.076,2649.737,--That's what he--
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2649.737,2650.919,--I don't walk with you that far.
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2650.919,2651.717,--Those are the words he said.
1995.95-719,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2670.431,2683.769,"Mr. Olson, I could understand your argument better if we were a unitary system, as was England, with one law, but that has to be... that system has to be put together with the Federal system."
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2697.419,2708.045,"--Well, certainly, I don't... I'm not personally familiar, I think, with the Court's jurisprudence on FELA cases and whether... the extent to which the Seventh Amendment would impact that decision."
1995.95-719,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2708.045,2711.398,There has been extraordinary deference to jury verdicts in FELA cases.
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2711.398,2718.423,"Well, I'm... what I'm saying is that the answer to your question depends upon whether we're talking about Erie or the Seventh Amendment."
1995.95-719,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2740.526,2759.99,"May I ask a question about whether... do you concede that the words, common law, in the Seventh Amendment, refer to the common law of England at a particular time, or is it possible... say there was a different rule in the State of New York in 1790, so they even let legislatures sometimes reexamine verdicts at that time in our history."
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2761.991,2771.587,"--I think the better view is as cited in both of the briefs and cited by petitioner, that Justice Story articulated, that it was the Federal common law which the Framers of the Constitution were referring--"
1995.95-719,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2771.587,2772.546,--The Federal common law?
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2772.546,2787.557,"--I mean, excuse me, the English common law, rather than the law... the common... as this Court has pointed out, and particularly in Galloway, the common law was... and Hamilton writes about this in Federalist 81 and 82 and 83, that the common law in each particular State differed."
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2794.762,2796.074,"It didn't differ, Mr. Olson."
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2803.408,2806.24,"Well, part of the common law, Justice Scalia... in fact, I'm glad that you made that point."
1995.95-719,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2828.085,2843.693,"--Well, wasn't it assumed, and haven't we consistently assumed that if there was no clear exemplification in American practice of what the common law rule was, that the default rule was English common law in 1791."
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2844.975,2845.286,Yes.
1995.95-719,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2845.286,2847.037,"And to that extent, there is a locking in."
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2847.037,2858.743,"Well, a locking in, but a locking into the... what this Court has said is the elemental principles of the jury trial, the fundamental basics of the jury trial, not the forms of procedure."
1995.95-719,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2865.198,2865.539,"Well, we--"
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2865.539,2867.699,"--corrective verdicts, when it's upheld partial summary judgments."
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2867.699,2870.481,"--In the first part of the Seventh Amendment, yes."
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2887.515,2887.841,This--
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2887.841,2889.644,That means you can't add or take away.
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2889.644,2890.044,--That is--
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2890.044,2893.076,And the first half of it doesn't suggest that you can't add and take away.
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2893.076,2919.973,"--When this Court has considered things like JNOV, partial new trials, the Court has been referring to the Reexamination Clause, and not the first part of the... and this Court has never said that its jurisprudence with respect to taking the spirit of the trial by jury and not the forms of practice and procedure that existed in 1791 applied only to the first half of the Seventh Amendment but not somehow to the second half of the Seventh Amendment."
1995.95-719,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2961.37,2962.041,Mr. Olson--
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2966.495,2968.466,This was the rules... the rules--
1995.95-719,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2968.466,2970.646,"Well, that doesn't sound like the rule of common law."
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2974.218,2977.591,--It suggests exactly why there were new trials.
1995.95-719,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2993.923,2994.041,Well--
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2994.041,2995.093,--and there would be a series of--
1995.95-719,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2995.093,3004.82,"--that maybe a concern that led them to adopt the second part of the Seventh Amendment, but we go by what they said, and what they said was, and according to the rules of common law."
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3004.82,3016.537,"--And I'm suggesting there's no better chronicle of the rules of common law that existed at that time than Blackstone's Commentaries, written in 1768, and he describes the rules of common law--"
1995.95-719,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3016.537,3024.231,"Well, I'm sure that may be very valuable, and perhaps that's governing, but we don't need all this hype about how great it all is."
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3024.531,3032.286,"--Well, the reason that I mention that is that Blackstone had a reason for putting that hype, as you put it, in Chapter 24."
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3045.366,3052.011,"The issue is whether he believed it was action by an appellate court or not, and I believe he said that once, and elsewhere he suggests the opposite."
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3052.88,3053.15,Under--
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3053.15,3055.932,We have no doubt that he approved it and thought it was excellent.
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3055.932,3056.673,--And he thought--
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3056.673,3057.714,But the question is whether he thought--
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3067.081,3077.727,"--He felt... he felt first, and this is the most important point of all, is that he felt that a rehearing before another jury, to use his words, was as little prejudice to either party as if it had never been heard before."
1995.95-719,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3110.588,3117.722,"Mr. Olson, may I just detract you from that for a moment and ask the kind of question that Justice Scalia asked of Mr. Abady."
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3145.821,3161.192,"--I agree with that, and this Court said it best, it seems to me, in the Guaranty trust case, where it said the intent of the Erie decision was to ensure that all cases of Federal court in diversity jurisdiction, the outcome of the litigation in the Federal court should be substantially the same as far as--"
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3161.192,3161.513,I see.
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3180.213,3192.461,"--It would under no circumstances change, or make the Seventh Amendment a dead letter unless the judges were given the power to substitute their judgment for that of the jury with respect to the amount of damages."
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3192.461,3193.293,--But they are.
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3210.384,3216.287,"I don't believe that that's correct, Justice Scalia, based upon what happened in this case."
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3226.274,3227.023,Suppose the State abolishes the jury.
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3227.023,3227.614,--Pardon me?
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3227.614,3231.848,"Suppose the State abolishes the jury and says, we're going to have no more juries."
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3231.848,3233.699,"The Seventh Amendment would not tolerate that, and this Court has said--"
1995.95-719,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3233.699,3236.22,But we've never held the Seventh Amendment applies to the States.
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3237.892,3238.951,--I'm talking in terms of--
1995.95-719,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3238.951,3239.222,Okay.
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3239.222,3241.825,--I'm assuming that Justice Scalia was asking about diversity--
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3241.825,3242.504,"Now, would the Federal court have to abolish the jury?"
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3242.504,3242.914,--No.
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3242.914,3244.766,"It couldn't abolish the jury, could it?"
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3244.766,3245.276,No.
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3245.276,3253.511,"And you get vastly different results... don't you believe you get vastly different results if you have the Federal courts in the State sitting with juries, and the State court sitting without juries?"
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3255.233,3256.843,It's entirely possible--
1995.95-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3257.604,3259.587,And do you think that Erie permits that?
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3259.587,3268.871,"What the Court has said is that to the extent the legal rules can determine the outcome, the differential in the Federal court should not be different than the State court."
1995.95-719,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3279.81,3285.314,Are you arguing that you're not reexamining a question of fact that's tried by a jury--
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3285.314,3285.684,--We are--
1995.95-719,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3285.684,3289.865,--but you are reexamining a mixed question of law and fact?
1995.95-719,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3289.865,3298.27,"--Exactly, and that the grant of a new trial in the first instance is not a reexamination, and Blackstone did not consider that, and he said that in so many words."
1995.95-719,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3299.061,3301.594,"Thank you, Mr. Olson."
