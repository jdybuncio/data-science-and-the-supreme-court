1986.85-1088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,60.867,"Mr. Stabler, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1986.85-1088,0,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,60.867,64.599,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-1088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,215.774,217.165,"Well, Mr. Stabler--"
1986.85-1088,0,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,217.165,217.571,Yes.
1986.85-1088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,217.571,232.129,"--wouldn't the first inquiry in point of logic be whether or not a federal court sitting in Alabama should apply this Alabama rule in this particular proceeding, which arose out of diversity jurisdiction, rather than whether the statute is unconstitutional?"
1986.85-1088,0,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,235.19,238.939,"Well, I'm arguing the other way to try and induce you to go the other way, Your Honor."
1986.85-1088,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,309.489,310.598,That's always the case.
1986.85-1088,0,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,320.452,322.592,"--Well, Your Honor, there's another side to it--"
1986.85-1088,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,322.592,325.077,"Since we're going to have to face it tomorrow, we may as well face it today?"
1986.85-1088,0,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,325.077,336.853,"--Well, there's another side to it, too, that you don't have to reach the question of the federal-state relations question if you decide the constitutional question."
1986.85-1088,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,383.443,387.675,"I suppose it's your argument, Mr. Stabler, but I just put my vote with the Chief Justice's."
1986.85-1088,0,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,392.533,393.549,"--Well, I certainly want to do what you want me to do."
1986.85-1088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,393.549,403.295,"--Well, there are nine members of the Court and I'm sure we would like to hear argument on both points, and by all means take your choice."
1986.85-1088,0,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,403.295,408.465,"Well, I guess I'll take the coward's way out and follow your suggestion."
1986.85-1088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,523.59,544.786,"Well, you know, I think you have a hard time, going back to the result that the Court reached in Cohen versus Beneficial Loan, if you say that so long as the federal rules are kind of internally consistent and seem to deal with all the things these people thought about there's no place for a state statute."
1986.85-1088,0,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,548.487,553.798,"--Well, I've got two distinctions from what you've said, Your Honor."
1986.85-1088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,720.371,725.383,"Of course, the substantive policy was to discourage strike suits."
1986.85-1088,0,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,734.943,744.908,"Your Honor, I don't even think you go to that question until there is a determination of the scope of the appellate rules."
1986.85-1088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,746.75,754.842,I thought your most recent argument was that Alabama has no substantive policy; it's just a point of appellate procedure.
1986.85-1088,0,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,762.135,764.275,--I agree with you.
1986.85-1088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,888.166,892.367,"Well, I disagree with you, as I guess I've made myself clear."
1986.85-1088,0,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,907.486,911.844,"Your Honor, you're leading me back to the other part, I believe."
1986.85-1088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,927.386,933.226,But I thought... I understood you to say there is no substantive policy behind the Alabama--
1986.85-1088,0,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,933.226,934.413,I do not think it is a substantive policy.
1986.85-1088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,947.33,949.548,"--Well, what about the policy I mentioned."
1986.85-1088,0,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,959.716,970.603,"--Your Honor, I don't think that the policy as you have stated it is anything more than a policy designed to protect the court system."
1986.85-1088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,972.18,977.289,"Well, you can say the same thing about the New Jersey provision in Cohen against Beneficial Loan."
1986.85-1088,0,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,977.289,995.514,"--Well, the case that comes to my mind, to respond to you, Your Honor, is the Gulf, Colorado case, which we cite, in which it was determined that when a railroad, bless them, was sued they had to pay attorney's fees."
1986.85-1088,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1060.427,1077.78,"Mr. Stabler, technically I suppose this affirmance penalty of Alabama is not a direct burden on the right to appeal, but rather a burden on obtaining a stay on a judgment pending appeal, right?"
1986.85-1088,0,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,1077.78,1102.097,"--Well, I submit that the two can only... can be separated no more than a steering wheel can be separated from a car, because if the defendants do not have some way to protect their litigated property in the event that they win it is a right that is... the appeal right is of little value."
1986.85-1088,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1110.173,1117.482,Do you think that the statute calls for anything more than a rational basis test?
1986.85-1088,0,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,1117.482,1122.574,I'm not sure I fully understand your question.
1986.85-1088,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1122.574,1136.007,You've made an equal protection challenge and I assume that in most instances the Court has to apply some kind of test to evaluate an equal protection challenge.
1986.85-1088,0,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,1143.581,1161.793,"Well, we submit that... and we base it upon several cases, Rinaldi versus Yeager being the first... that the right to appeal free of unreasoned distinctions, which brings equal protection into it, is a fundamental right."
1986.85-1088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1161.793,1170.883,"Mr. Stabler, I think your quote from Rinaldi against Yeager on page 16 of your brief belies that contention."
1986.85-1088,0,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,1200.888,1203.621,"That was a point I was attempting to make, Your Honor."
1986.85-1088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1203.621,1205.307,"Well, I didn't think that was the point you were attempting to make."
1986.85-1088,0,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,1205.307,1207.385,"No, it clearly is the point."
1986.85-1088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1207.385,1208.665,"Well, what is the point?"
1986.85-1088,0,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,1208.665,1220.254,The point is that if access to any court... and I don't think it matters whether you are talking about the police court or you're talking about the circuit court or to an appellate court.
1986.85-1088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1230.984,1234.53,"Well, that doesn't respond at all, I don't think, to my question."
1986.85-1088,0,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,1243.246,1260.598,"I think that the right to an appeal free of unreasoned distinctions, that is a right to a fair and equal access to an appellate court, is a fundamental right."
1986.85-1088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1260.598,1264.346,"Well, certainly Rinaldi does not support your statement at all."
1986.85-1088,0,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,1264.346,1266.534,"Your Honor, well, I would disagree with that."
1986.85-1088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1306.782,1312.341,xxx did you think was left after our opinion in United States against Crass?
1986.85-1088,0,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,1312.341,1315.106,"Your Honor, I'm sorry, I don't know."
1986.85-1088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1357.622,1359.029,"Thank you, Mr. Stabler."
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,1362.355,1365.76,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1088,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1467.612,1486.324,"Well, if the purpose of the penalty is to discourage frivolous appeals, I'm not sure I understand why you think that wouldn't conflict with Rule 38 of the Federal Appellate Rules."
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,1486.324,1489.447,"To that limited extent, it might, to that limited extent."
1986.85-1088,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1492.556,1510.112,"Well, if the purpose is also to compensate for delay in obtaining the judgment, then it serves as some kind of a supplement to post-judgment interest in that regard, is that right?"
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,1510.112,1517.953,"No, ma'am, it does not, because we do have a provision for post-judgment interest."
1986.85-1088,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1517.953,1522.67,"Yes, and so this penalty is a supplement to that in effect."
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,1522.67,1523.186,Right.
1986.85-1088,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1523.998,1524.576,Is that right?
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,1524.576,1531.214,--the purposes of it is to give to a winning plaintiff some additional compensation.
1986.85-1088,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1533.635,1546.005,"Then why wouldn't it conflict with appellate, federal appellate procedure Rule 37(n), Section 1961 of Title 28 combined?"
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,1546.005,1557.188,I don't believe that the Federal Rules have preempted completely the state affirmance fee.
1986.85-1088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1669.066,1673.83,"Well, you want us to carry over the affirmance fee into federal court."
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,1676.782,1679.141,"Well, we did not ask for that, Your Honor."
1986.85-1088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1680.297,1682.094,That's the next case?
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,1682.094,1684.233,"Well, not from us, no."
1986.85-1088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1685.966,1690.73,"But in theory, you think that's just as supportable?"
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,1701.508,1709.021,"You can look at my hair and see that this is not the first time that I've ever stood before a court, but I'll have to admit that you threw one at me that I haven't thought about."
1986.85-1088,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1910.659,1913.112,"Mr. Haley, may I interrupt you right there for a moment."
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,1926.154,1931.556,"Justice, I would never say that Alabama can tell a federal court what it's got to do, no, sir."
1986.85-1088,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1933.713,1946.912,"So that if the federal judicial system did not itself authorize stays and it doesn't authorize supersedeas in quite the same way that Alabama does, then there would be no basis for a ten percent penalty, even though there were appeals and unsuccessful appeals?"
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,1974.167,1983.1,"Well, I will readily admit that their position is much stronger on that issue than on the due process issue."
1986.85-1088,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2484.572,2486.602,May I ask this question?
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,2491.273,2493.694,Your Honor?
1986.85-1088,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2493.694,2499.004,Was it a due process decision?
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,2500.893,2502.737,He doesn't say.
1986.85-1088,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2502.737,2504.487,He doesn't mention equal protection?
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,2504.487,2505.19,He does not.
1986.85-1088,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2505.19,2517.109,"Then I suggest it may have been decided on the basis of substantive due process, that had not been rejected in 1916 to the extent that we are now very careful about applying it."
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,2517.109,2524.106,"Well, I realize that, but this has never... our Supreme Court has relied on it."
1986.85-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2564.575,2566.262,"It was a money judgment, wasn't it?"
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,2566.262,2567.979,"Yes, it was a money judgment."
1986.85-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2607.136,2610.15,What about the equal protection issue in this case?
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,2610.15,2624.285,The equal protection issue is that this applies to every defendant against whom a money judgment is obtained.
1986.85-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2644.713,2646.448,What about non-money judgments?
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,2646.448,2654.665,"Well, we've got two other statutes that bring that into play, Your Honor."
1986.85-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2656.274,2660.741,"Well, neither one of them put a ten percent charge on for losing."
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,2660.741,2661.226,"--Yes, sir, they do."
1986.85-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2661.929,2662.569,What do they say?
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,2662.569,2674.752,"We've got one that provides a ten percent penalty if you... it's a different statute... if you are sued for possession of real property and lose and you keep it over, sort of like your Lindsey case."
1986.85-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2674.752,2675.143,Yes.
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,2675.143,2686.965,"And the other is that if you are sued for personal property and you don't surrender it and take your chances on appeal, it does... you're talking about does it... well, there are--"
1986.85-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2686.965,2702.913,"What about I sue to prevent my neighbor from keeping... trespassing on my property, and I lose and I appeal and I lose?"
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,2707.801,2711.925,"--Well, if you appeal that would be an injunction proceeding, of course."
1986.85-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2711.925,2712.393,Yes.
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,2718.22,2724.467,But he has to give a bond to indemnify the other party against damages.
1986.85-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2724.467,2732.761,"Well, that may be so, but he hasn't got... he doesn't have to do anything more than to satisfy the supersedeas requirements."
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,2732.761,2738.838,"That's right, and I cannot conceive how your damages could be determined in an injunction."
1986.85-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2738.838,2741.04,"Well, you could just say there will be a penalty."
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,2741.04,2741.805,Sir?
1986.85-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2741.805,2747.725,A penalty could just be provided for taking what might be considered a frivolous appeal.
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,2747.725,2753.708,"Well, it would have no relationship whatsoever to the damages involved, if it did."
1986.85-1088,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2753.708,2763.235,"Well, can one get a stay as a matter of right from an injunction in Alabama, the same way one can get a stay as a matter of right by posting a bond and superseding a money judgment?"
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,2763.235,2764.25,"No, you cannot, you cannot."
1986.85-1088,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2899.26,2901.509,"Mr. Haley, may I ask this question."
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,2914.317,2917.347,"Yes, you can appeal from a ruling on a motion."
1986.85-1088,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2917.347,2918.16,Yes.
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,2918.16,2919.723,A ruling on a motion for a new trial.
1986.85-1088,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2919.723,2929.297,"But that plaintiff also would have had his day in court, and you seem to be arguing that if one has a day in court at the trial level that that's all that's necessary."
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,2929.297,2931.641,"No, sir, I didn't mean to say that."
1986.85-1088,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2954.585,2961.238,"Right, so that both sides may appeal, but a losing defendant pays a penalty if his appeal is not successful?"
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,2961.238,2962.143,Well--
1986.85-1088,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2962.143,2967.782,Suppose the Supreme Court of Alabama had decided this case four to three.
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,2975.186,2976.903,--That's right.
1986.85-1088,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2979.792,2980.761,I was wondering whether you--
1986.85-1088,1,30859,james_o_haley,,2980.761,2983.416,"--Yes, sir, I think it's fair, yes, sir."
1986.85-1088,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3115.505,3120.098,"Thank you, Mr. Haley."
1986.85-1088,2,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,3123.081,3124.127,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1986.85-1088,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3315.16,3319.002,"Still, interest on a voluntary loan is one thing."
1986.85-1088,2,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,3341.9,3343.024,"--Yes, sir, I quite agree."
1986.85-1088,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3371.341,3380.604,"Well, is this case really much different from, say, a provision that the loser on appeal has to pay the other side's attorneys fees?"
1986.85-1088,2,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,3380.604,3384.554,"Well, it could be the same or it could be different, Your Honor."
1986.85-1088,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3387.741,3392.771,"Well, at least that's one of the hazards you have to, an appellant has to watch out for."
1986.85-1088,2,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,3395.598,3412.028,--Attorney's fees statutes are attached to specific substantive laws and are upheld when they support a substantive policy represented by those particular acts.
1986.85-1088,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3412.028,3415.793,"Well, the substantive policy might be we want to discourage frivolous appeals."
1986.85-1088,2,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,3415.793,3427.788,"Well, I would cite to you the Gulf, Colorado case, which said that it is indeed unconstitutional just to say because you are a railroad you have to pay attorney's fees."
1986.85-1088,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3427.788,3431.256,"Well, that's a different case."
1986.85-1088,2,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,3431.256,3443.345,"Well, it is the only case that I know of where attorney's fees are assessed, not because of the substance of the claim, but because of the identity of the parties."
1986.85-1088,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3443.345,3444.095,"Well, I agree with that."
1986.85-1088,2,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,3444.095,3450.89,"And that's what we have here, is that the penalty is related to the identity of the parties."
1986.85-1088,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3453.655,3454.608,Why the identity of the parties?
1986.85-1088,2,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,3454.608,3455.514,Pardon?
1986.85-1088,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3455.514,3457.216,Why the identity of the parties?
1986.85-1088,2,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,3457.216,3466.088,"Because it relates not to any particular case, but relates to the mere fact that you're a defendant in a suit dealing with money or property."
1986.85-1088,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3466.088,3466.557,And you lose.
1986.85-1088,2,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,3466.557,3467.588,And lose.
1986.85-1088,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3467.588,3469.102,And you got a stay.
1986.85-1088,2,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,3469.102,3470.586,And you got a stay.
1986.85-1088,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3470.586,3471.18,Yes.
1986.85-1088,2,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,3486.19,3489.423,I can't--
1986.85-1088,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3489.423,3490.126,It's like a bail bond.
1986.85-1088,2,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,3490.126,3491.579,--see the constitutional problem there.
1986.85-1088,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3499.044,3501.621,"Well, you know, the ten percent is a fairly customary figure, I guess, with bail bonds, isn't it?"
1986.85-1088,2,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,3501.621,3508.572,"--I'm happy to say I've never had to get a bail bond, and I don't--"
1986.85-1088,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3508.572,3510.82,"Well, my practice was more diverse than yours."
1986.85-1088,2,35100,l_vastine_stabler_jr,,3514.287,3521.114,"--Well, there's precious few things I can say on my own behalf, but that's one of them."
