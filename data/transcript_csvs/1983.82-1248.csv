1983.82-1248,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.126,We'll hear arguments next in Schall against Martin and the consolidated case.
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,40.328,43.761,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1248,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,143.184,150.35,"What are the conditions on which an adult offender, given all the same factors, could be detained before a trial?"
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,150.35,154.081,"--In New York, Your Honor?"
1983.82-1248,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,154.081,155.033,"Yes, in New York."
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,155.033,161.717,In New York... New York provides bail for adults and does not have a preventive detention statute.
1983.82-1248,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,216.993,229.922,In your view what constitutional limits are there on a state's authority to detain people who are not accused of any crime to prevent them from committing future crimes?
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,229.922,233.943,--People who are accused of a crime to prevent them from committing a crime?
1983.82-1248,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,233.943,234.715,Who are not.
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,237.126,242.151,"No, Your Honor, you cannot detain somebody that has not been accused of a crime--"
1983.82-1248,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,242.151,242.448,All right.
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,247.032,251.945,"--We would suggest, Your Honor, that there are two separate constitutional limits."
1983.82-1248,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,267.876,270.147,"Do you think that is a requirement, probable cause?"
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,270.147,291.682,"I think that probable cause in the sense of Gerstein, which we believe is met under this statute, and in the sense of New York's further requirement that there be an adversarial probable cause hearing for these juvenile, which the prosecution has the burden, that that probable cause requirement is well met in this case."
1983.82-1248,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,313.575,315.548,Is there any other constitutional limitations?
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,315.548,324.773,"Yes, Your Honor, absolutely, and that arises from the existence of the detention or perhaps if you want to call it conversely, the release statute itself."
1983.82-1248,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,497.117,500.12,Is the probable cause standard the same?
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,500.12,502.48,"The probable cause standard is exactly the same, Your Honor."
1983.82-1248,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,574.097,582.663,Do you think there are stronger reasons to apply this restraint on juveniles than on adults?
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,582.663,583.535,Absolutely.
1983.82-1248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,661.613,664.746,"You are suggesting that liquor store owners shoot people, I think, who are 18 but not 14?"
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,665.467,668.038,"--I am sorry, Your Honor."
1983.82-1248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,727.038,733.202,"But, the trouble is if you have got a hardened criminal, you can deny him bail."
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,747.821,750.413,"--No, Your Honor, not quite."
1983.82-1248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,750.413,751.645,I said he could go.
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,751.645,753.095,"Could go, right."
1983.82-1248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,757.539,759.68,"Well, why that difference?"
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,766.425,776.59,"--Well, it is equally true, Your Honor, that a first offender, if that is the point, who comes up for bail may be denied bail."
1983.82-1248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,782.334,784.575,A first offender can be denied bail?
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,784.575,786.047,A first offender may be denied bail--
1983.82-1248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,786.047,787.118,In New York?
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,787.118,788.818,--In New York except for--
1983.82-1248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,788.818,790.631,For petty larceny?
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,790.631,791.29,--No.
1983.82-1248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,791.29,792.291,"Well, all right."
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,792.291,793.052,Petty larceny--
1983.82-1248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,793.052,800.887,"But, an infant can be held in jail for petty larceny, first offense."
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,800.887,802.277,--That is correct.
1983.82-1248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,802.277,803.899,"There is a difference, isn't there?"
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,806.741,807.692,That is correct.
1983.82-1248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,808.54,810.783,On that one hypothetical.
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,810.783,830.435,"--There is a further difference which I think follows from my elaboration to the Chief Justice and that is New York has a stronger interest, I think, in preventing that juvenile from committing any further crime than it perhaps has in the adult."
1983.82-1248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,837.882,850.851,Are you sure that a juvenile in the average juvenile home is better off on not committing another crime and not learning how to commit another crime?
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,850.851,853.351,--Do you mean--
1983.82-1248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,853.351,866.279,"The average juvenile home is not as conducive to good living as a home is, the average home."
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,866.279,875.107,"--It depends a lot, as our detention specialist said, and indeed the detention expert for the City of the trial below, it depends a lot on the home, Your Honor."
1983.82-1248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,912.3,924.288,"Well, I do assume that in the City of New York you have found at least one first offender juvenile."
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,924.288,925.09,Who was detained?
1983.82-1248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,925.09,927.14,"Well, are there any?"
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,927.14,929.394,These are Appellees' exhibits.
1983.82-1248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,930.593,937.137,Do you say there are no... How do you get the second offenders up there if you don't have any first ones?
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,952.107,955.409,--First offenders are considered for detention.
1983.82-1248,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1127.212,1137.217,"I guess there are no statutory requirements in that require under the New York scheme, is that right, for what the judge has to consider?"
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1137.217,1138.589,No.
1983.82-1248,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1151.188,1155.871,What review is there of the Family Court decision to detain a juvenile?
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1155.871,1165.136,"The decision is reviewable by several routes, generally by writ."
1983.82-1248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1213.707,1215.469,Does the New York... Go ahead.
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1220.522,1224.235,There is an appeal by commission to the Appellate Division.
1983.82-1248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1229.278,1231.87,What about the probable cause hearing?
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1237.694,1238.845,--Correct.
1983.82-1248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1238.845,1241.947,That is reviewable.
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1241.947,1243.177,That is reviewable.
1983.82-1248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1243.177,1248.682,"Wouldn't that always be... If probable cause isn't found, there is a release, isn't there?"
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1248.682,1249.16,That is correct.
1983.82-1248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1249.16,1258.026,"So, really what is going to be reviewed in all these proceedings by a writ is the finding of probable cause, isn't it?"
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1258.026,1258.807,No.
1983.82-1248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1258.807,1266.063,"Well, why... I would think by then the probable cause... By the time you can get a writ, the probable cause hearing will go on."
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1266.063,1268.524,"Well, that is exactly what Appellees are saying."
1983.82-1248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1281.562,1286.306,"Well, by the time you could get a writ wouldn't the probable cause hearing have been held?"
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1286.306,1288.406,"Yes, but the probable cause--"
1983.82-1248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1288.406,1291.478,"And, then there would have been a release if there isn't probable cause."
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1291.478,1297.853,"--Yes, Your Honor, but as I was indicating, these are two separate notions, one the Fourth Amendment notion, and the other the detention standard."
1983.82-1248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1310.642,1313.745,"But, it would mean that it couldn't happen without probable cause."
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1313.745,1315.024,--Certainly that is true.
1983.82-1248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1325.333,1326.09,"But, it helps."
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1326.09,1327.953,"--Yes, it does."
1983.82-1248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1335.988,1336.489,Right.
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1343.933,1344.724,Yes.
1983.82-1248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1344.724,1345.535,Okay.
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1345.535,1347.115,"And, often a fact-finding, a conviction."
1983.82-1248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1347.115,1348.177,Yes.
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1355.951,1356.502,Yes.
1983.82-1248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1356.502,1358.733,For what purpose?
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1358.733,1361.264,To establish the appropriate detention--
1983.82-1248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1361.264,1363.588,Just for the guidance for the future?
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1363.588,1364.877,--Pardon me?
1983.82-1248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1364.877,1367.02,Because of the guidance for the future?
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1367.02,1372.333,"Exactly, guidance for the future and because it is an issue capable of repetition, yet evading review."
1983.82-1248,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1526.284,1529.416,"Attorney General, may I ask this question?"
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1529.416,1530.374,Surely.
1983.82-1248,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1530.374,1548.266,What do we do about the fact that both courts below found as a fact that the law was carried out with unfettered discretion by the Family Court judges and they decided against you on due process grounds?
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1548.266,1554.39,"Well, that I don't find a problem with."
1983.82-1248,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1554.39,1554.981,You do?
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1554.981,1556.792,Because there was a question of law.
1983.82-1248,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1565.437,1578.346,"Well, they... If I may interrupt you again, it seemed to me that they concluded that whatever might be said under Gerstein against Pugh which was a Fourth Amendment probable cause case--"
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1578.346,1578.947,Right.
1983.82-1248,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1578.947,1591.945,"--that under the Fourteenth Amendment there were no standards so that the Family Court judges, in their own unfettered discretion, determined when to detain these young people."
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1591.945,1598.209,I was about to... Let me turn to that argument and pick up with you and Justice O'Connor.
1983.82-1248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1790.765,1795.909,How can you measure due process without guidelines?
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1795.909,1798.43,"What do you mean, Your Honor, guidelines?"
1983.82-1248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1799.652,1805.635,"How can you... Any kind of guidelines, written, oral."
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1811.098,1816.681,--I have to have a relatively certain standard.
1983.82-1248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1816.681,1819.352,"Well, don't you have to have a standard?"
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1819.352,1822.114,I have to have a standard and I have a standard here.
1983.82-1248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1822.114,1823.837,What is the standard?
1983.82-1248,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1823.837,1827.049,"Risk, serious risk of pre-trial crime."
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,1971.795,1977.258,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1248,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2036.888,2039.528,Why is it worse for young offenders?
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2039.528,2050.227,"As the record supports, it can traumatize them... Actually I used the wrong phrase when I said offenders... young persons accused of crime."
1983.82-1248,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2068.808,2080.796,Does the record show how many first offenders or at least persons brought for the first time before the juvenile court are detained on that basis?
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2080.796,2084.147,"There were two kinds of record, two parts of the record that are relevant."
1983.82-1248,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2106.514,2116.75,Is there a report in the nature of probation report presented before the decision is made?
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2116.75,2117.511,Yes.
1983.82-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2178.219,2184.073,"When you say minor offenses, Mr. Guggenheim, can you give us some example of what specifically you are talking about?"
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2184.073,2184.434,--Yes.
1983.82-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2197.123,2204.037,What was the character of the New York offense which he violated?
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2204.037,2205.049,--Gambling law.
1983.82-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2205.049,2205.607,"What, a misdemeanor?"
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2205.607,2207.558,"Yes, a misdemeanor."
1983.82-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2235.448,2239.482,"Now, what is the upper limit of the punishment of an adult on a B misdemeanor?"
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2239.482,2240.731,Six months.
1983.82-1248,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2240.731,2241.773,Six months.
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2247.155,2249.076,"Well, my clients is the whole class."
1983.82-1248,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2249.076,2254.461,The named class representatives.
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2254.461,2260.184,"They were accused of more serious offenses, but they were only--"
1983.82-1248,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2260.184,2262.225,Armed robbery and what else?
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2262.225,2264.676,--One was armed robbery.
1983.82-1248,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2268.449,2269.729,Yes.
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2269.729,2286.04,"But, of course, they only represent the class... The class, as the briefs clearly show, are all juveniles in the state who were eligible for detention and all juveniles in the state who were accused of being delinquent are eligible for detention."
1983.82-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2286.04,2299.649,"One wouldn't have to reach out to the unnamed class member, the ""Three Card Monte"" defendant, to adjudicate the cases of your clients, would they, an armed robber potentially and an attempted murder?"
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2299.649,2304.223,One would not have to reach out to them to what end?
1983.82-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2307.396,2324.626,"But, underlying the presentation of your case to the Second Circuit, I gather, was the assumption that there couldn't be any sort of an individualized consideration or whether this statute as applied to certain people might be constitutional and unconstitutional as to others."
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2330.941,2343.797,"Several things, but before I give an answer, I would like to point out that that is only a third or a half of the question about the case, because the case--"
1983.82-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2343.797,2346.752,Why don't we try it with that third or that half?
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2346.752,2374.879,"--The broadest issue raised before this Court is whether detaining and individual accused of even serious offenses before he or she has had a day in court, presumptively innocent, because of a belief that the individual will commit more crime if released, thereby assuming the individual has already done something wrong, violates the due process clause."
1983.82-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2374.879,2375.818,The Second Circuit didn't answer that question.
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2375.818,2376.409,That is right.
1983.82-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2377.33,2378.82,"So, why is it before this Court?"
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2378.82,2388.237,"--It is before this Court, in answer to your question, because it is an issue in the case which goes to this point."
1983.82-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2415.686,2434.048,"Well, you are saying then that because the standards may be unsuitable or perhaps unconstitutional for a ""Three Card Monte"" defendant, your clients were armed robbers and attempted murders can't be detained under it because of some overbreadth concept?"
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2434.048,2434.548,No.
1983.82-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2441.161,2442.523,Who are the named parties in the case?
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2442.523,2444.043,"--Martin, Rosario--"
1983.82-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2444.043,2445.616,What are they charged with?
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2445.616,2448.897,"--Justice O'Connor identified charges correctly, but--"
1983.82-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2448.897,2449.847,Okay.
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2449.847,2451.078,--they are not my only clients.
1983.82-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2451.078,2459.724,"Well, you are saying that the named parties can't be held under this statute because it is unconstitutional as to a ""Three Card Monte"" defendant."
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2460.505,2460.976,No.
1983.82-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2470.3,2474.073,What rights of the named plaintiffs in this case have been violated?
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2474.073,2495.768,"Well, if this were not a class action, the question would be could Mr. Martin challenge this statute because arguably it could be invoked or permits detention for crimes that he hasn't been accused of."
1983.82-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2501.352,2519.033,"Well, it certainly doesn't prevent us from addressing the question of the standing of the named plaintiffs to represent the rest of the class and to at least determine... I would think you at least start out with the status of the named members of the class."
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2525.117,2527.278,"Well, I think that once a class--"
1983.82-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2527.278,2529.741,Let me put the question to you another way.
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2556.637,2558.978,"--That may be right, Justice White."
1983.82-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2558.978,2559.709,"Well, is it right or not?"
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2559.709,2567.226,"Well, my point is that the inquiry as applied includes the as applied in this record."
1983.82-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2574.118,2575.129,"Well, we might--"
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2575.129,2577.0,--who is already over 16.
1983.82-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2577.0,2588.019,"--Well, we might come out with completely different answers as to how... as to its constitutionality as applied to the named plaintiffs and as applied to the ""Three Card Monte"" plaintiff."
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2588.019,2590.861,"But, both were detained under the same statute, so I--"
1983.82-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2590.861,2591.6,"Oh, all right."
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2591.6,2592.401,--would now answer--
1983.82-1248,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2592.401,2594.652,Then you are attacking the statute on its face.
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2594.652,2596.565,"--And, that is exactly the action."
1983.82-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2596.565,2597.444,We don't have to do that.
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2607.811,2614.005,This isn't an overbreadth attack in the way that it is in the classic First Amendment case.
1983.82-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2632.886,2637.651,"Well, that argument goes just as well to your clients as to the other members of the class."
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2639.141,2659.964,I can finally answer the question Justice Rehnquist put to me by saying that even the named plaintiffs have a proper attack on this statute by arguing that the absence of standards in this scheme render the statute unconstitutional on its face and as applied to them.
1983.82-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2685.533,2686.422,Okay.
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2708.637,2713.149,This statute contains no precisely drawn standards.
1983.82-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2713.149,2713.98,"Well, so what?"
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2723.247,2724.326,"Well, okay."
1983.82-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2739.228,2740.537,"Well, Martin is getting it right now."
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2740.537,2742.538,I would respectfully disagree.
1983.82-1248,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2758.66,2760.27,"You used the word ""convicted""."
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2762.283,2762.842,No.
1983.82-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2779.613,2781.363,"--Well, I suggest to you you may not want an adjudication."
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2809.914,2812.653,"But, they are part of the record in every sense."
1983.82-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2812.653,2822.34,I understand that part of your argument certainly goes to a facial challenge even with respect to the named plaintiffs and everybody else like them.
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2827.673,2835.54,This statute is a textbook example of a statute without standards.
1983.82-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2847.53,2859.278,"What if a state... What if the federal government or the state, in order to implement its constitutional requirements of bail, says unreasonable bail shall not be required?"
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2862.95,2865.022,--The--
1983.82-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.022,2870.645,Sometimes you just adjudicate individual cases under that standard.
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2876.279,2881.021,--The question of bail is a very different one.
1983.82-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2939.059,2947.465,"With your argument I would take it would go to adults as well as juveniles, to the same statute, the same vagueness."
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2947.465,2952.55,Not with bail but with preventive detention.
1983.82-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2952.55,2953.268,Yes.
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2953.268,2966.086,"It is inconceivable to me, as this Court said in Kent against the United States, that a court of justice dealing with adults with respect to a similar issue would proceed in this manner."
1983.82-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2968.337,2970.731,"Kent wasn't a constitutional case, was it?"
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2970.731,2971.539,--No.
1983.82-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2992.234,2998.799,You mean you don't know of any jurisdictions around that are considering prevention statutes for adults?
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,2998.799,3001.17,"Yes, I do, but to contrast that--"
1983.82-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3001.17,3001.821,What do you mean you do?
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,3002.862,3007.173,"--I know of one in this district, for example."
1983.82-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3033.333,3044.439,"Well, wouldn't you be here making the same argument if the judge or the officer in the first instance before he had to make a finding of probable cause?"
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,3045.999,3048.55,"Well, yes, it is."
1983.82-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3050.681,3053.803,"Well, would you be here making exactly the same argument?"
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,3053.803,3055.415,I would for this reason.
1983.82-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3058.317,3060.06,"The answer is, yes, you would be making the argument."
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,3060.06,3061.439,"--But, only in this sense."
1983.82-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3123.852,3127.801,"But, very quickly it has it."
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,3127.801,3139.061,"Yes, but the limit of detention in no way mitigates the massive curtailment of liberty that this Court finds to be at the heart of the due process clause."
1983.82-1248,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3162.316,3165.877,"But, there is no possibility of conviction here."
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,3165.877,3170.24,I am using the word not in its technical sense.
1983.82-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3215.989,3228.788,"Well, the first example may simply vindicate your opponent's view that New York regards its parents' patria role with the children as being involved to a certain extent in the detention."
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,3228.788,3234.121,I cannot explain the irrationality of the scheme I have just described.
1983.82-1248,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3384.77,3386.403,How about habeas?
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,3386.403,3419.083,"Habeas is available as a theoretical remedy, but when a judge has before him or her a case in which the other side, the state, says, Your Honor, the statute says that the court may detain when it finds a serious risk and it has found so in this case and stated its reasons and facts on the record, that ends the inquiry."
1983.82-1248,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3446.062,3454.457,"What happens in the counties outside of New York where the judge is not a juvenile court judge, he is a regular judge?"
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,3454.457,3457.098,"--No, he is a juvenile court judge."
1983.82-1248,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3465.233,3467.114,Is that the judge that is going to get a writ of habeas?
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,3467.114,3469.657,I don't know--
1983.82-1248,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3469.657,3471.738,Against himself?
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,3471.738,3475.371,"--I doubt that, but I frankly don't know."
1983.82-1248,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3495.342,3501.436,"Mr. Guggenheim, you made an equal protection claim below as well."
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,3502.367,3513.915,"We believe as a basic point that if this Court does not find that this statute violates due process of law, it almost certainly does not violate equal protection of the law."
1983.82-1248,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3565.389,3571.494,Is it possible also that a class action was not the appropriate way to approach this problem?
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,3571.494,3575.585,"Frankly, Your Honor, it is the only way to approach this problem."
1983.82-1248,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3575.585,3577.358,Not a case by case?
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,3577.358,3581.349,There is no Article 3 case or controversy.
1983.82-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3735.119,3738.391,"Could bail be required, reasonable bail be required?"
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,3738.391,3738.842,Yes.
1983.82-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3747.498,3753.692,It may be that my question is would it be constitutional to require bail before there is release?
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,3753.692,3755.175,--I think it would be constitutional.
1983.82-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3755.175,3756.834,Reasonable bail?
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,3756.834,3759.977,"Well, now you are asking me the same question as before."
1983.82-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3762.909,3771.173,I thought you were making an argument that... bordering on an argument that you shouldn't be able to detain juveniles at all.
1983.82-1248,1,35904,martin_guggenheim,,3771.173,3772.766,"No, I am not making that argument."
1983.82-1248,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3833.064,3835.407,"Thank you, counsel, the case is submitted."
