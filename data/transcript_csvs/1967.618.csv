1967.618,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,42.902,"Number 618, Fortnightly Corporation, petitioner, versus United Artists Television, Incorporated."
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,44.22,48.948,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.618,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,427.947,430.474,I guess there was an installation fee and then a monthly fee?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,430.474,432.16,"That's correct, sir."
1967.618,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,432.16,438.035,Would you mind telling me how you do this when you get the antenna on the telephone poles?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,439.995,445.103,"There's a connection by coaxial cables strung along telephone poles on the streets, sir."
1967.618,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,457.832,461.743,But you do is to make it possible by supplying an antenna of that kind.
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,461.743,462.132,That's correct.
1967.618,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,462.132,469.01,For them to receive communications from further away?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,469.01,472.022,"I would like to come to that point right now, sir."
1967.618,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,514.313,525.39,"Where without the services of your antenna, the reception in some cases in the householders in the valley might have been impossible and in all cases, it might have been inferior."
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,525.39,527.292,I -- it's conceivable it would have been inferior.
1967.618,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,531.223,535.204,"And the five stations were what, three Pittsburgh stations and a Wheeling station, and Steubenville --"
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,535.204,537.792,And Steubenville and Wheeling.
1967.618,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,537.792,539.509,"And then, the five others were what?"
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,539.509,541.032,"They're all the same here, sir."
1967.618,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,544.989,548.23,And one was then the B contour and the other was just on the --
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,548.23,555.524,"In the Fairmont case, in four instances, it was within the B and in one instance, it was just outside, and Clarksburg it is the reverse."
1967.618,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,559.764,563.016,There's a need for it brought about by the hilliness of the country?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,563.016,574.96,Partly by the hilliness and it's with -- it's certainly within the area where reception would have been expected if it were not for the ruggedness of the area.
1967.618,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,578.872,579.621,There is no what?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,579.621,581.17,Sight or sound.
1967.618,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,599.956,604.001,"May I ask you, is this widespread throughout the nation now?"
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,604.001,623.352,"There is -- there are about 1,800 systems as I understand it, 1,800 community antenna television systems throughout the nation and of course, there are many thousand apartment house antennas which provide service for the people who live in the apartments and use equipment substantially like that which is used by the community antenna systems."
1967.618,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,623.352,627.016,Either done by small companies or as yours are large?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,627.016,629.847,"In general, it's done by small companies, sir."
1967.618,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,644.289,647.465,Do you do this business over the country or just in this section?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,647.465,651.922,We did business just in these sections here.
1967.618,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,652.428,661.19,Was it that the thought that all these systems do is enhance the efficiency of the receiver?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,661.19,663.947,"I believe that's correct, sir."
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,674.584,678.851,"And if every subscriber could have afforded it, they could have put up their own antenna."
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,678.851,685.01,They could certainly have filed over with the antenna service because it is available in the community by coops or other ways.
1967.618,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,685.01,697.112,Did I understand you to say that something -- I live in the section of Washington where I don't get some stations very well.
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,711.328,719.987,"Yes sir, it provides a more efficient antenna service and the higher the -- the more -- the better the location of the antenna, the better your reception will be."
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,728.502,734.357,But you do give a -- don't you give the signal a little more power?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,734.357,740.828,"We amplify the signal as it goes down the line, Mr. Justice White, because it loses strength as it passes through a cable."
1967.618,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,745.045,748.151,We'll recess now.
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,751.339,752.239,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,752.239,757.562,"Mr. Barnard, could you just address yourself one more moment to -- what you actually do?"
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,765.195,766.093,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,787.769,793.119,You do considerably more with your antenna system than the ordinary set owner does with his.
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,797.676,800.072,"It depends on what you mean, Mr. Justice White."
1967.618,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,815.417,826.707,"You told us how many thousand of these community antennas are were in the country I think you said something like 3,000, I'm not sure."
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,826.707,828.996,"I believe it's closer to 2,000, Your Honor."
1967.618,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,828.996,830.797,"2,000."
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,835.052,840.252,"I'm sure that many of them do because the equipment is reasonably standard, Your Honor."
1967.618,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,840.631,842.485,They have a cable -- a cable coming from --
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,842.485,847.221,"Normally, they have a cable which connects from the antenna to the -- into town."
1967.618,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,863.877,866.945,Do they boost the power as you do?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,866.945,880.351,"As a signal is received, it is amplified near the antenna site in order to maintain strength down the cable as the cable -- as it moves down into town because it loses strength as it passes through the cable."
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,920.445,924.606,Including that you can't amp -- you say you can strengthen the signal.
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,924.606,928.488,That -- but you couldn't improve it if it had snow or distortion that there's nothing you could do about it.
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,928.488,929.478,But you could strengthen it.
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,929.478,930.129,You could strengthen.
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,930.129,931.556,Which you do.
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,931.556,938.427,"Yes, Your Honor, just as every television set does, too."
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1229.106,1250.035,"I suppose Mr. Barnard, you will deal with the situation where there is a licensed television station in a city, and that licensed television receives a network program and does nothing with the signal it receives by microwave relay or whatever it is."
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,1273.456,1275.319,"Yes, Your Honor, it does."
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1275.319,1277.455,And what are they doing that you aren't doing?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,1277.455,1279.162,They're doing several things.
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1317.143,1327.498,"That is both the originating station and the, say originates in New York it would be that the station of New York has to pay and the station of Pittsburgh?"
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,1327.498,1329.272,"The network doesn't originate, Your Honor."
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1339.496,1340.684,Who pays?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,1340.905,1342.432,The stations.
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1342.432,1343.152,Just the stations?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,1343.152,1351.819,"The stations pay or in the instance of the network, the network provides the clearance in advance for the stations, but it is not the network which is the broadcaster."
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1351.819,1369.47,"Well what if there's -- the programs originate in the station and is carried to another station, and that station in other words -- will both stations pay in other words?"
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,1369.47,1375.711,"Yes, Your Honor because the station which is, as you say, retransmitting is also engaged in broadcasting."
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1385.254,1392.291,"Yeah, but then in terms of the physical activities that he goes through, he gives it very difficult use."
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,1392.291,1393.458,"Yes, there are."
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1420.499,1429.124,-- one for sound and the -- doesn't have to be in this -- it would be the licensed station that it's consummate?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,1429.124,1432.028,But he is procuring a performance in another location.
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1446.556,1449.607,What I get to say is the same thing about your client.
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,1449.607,1452.705,Because we're making no arrangements for our programs.
1967.618,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1468.851,1472.963,Which is to have a sponsor isn't it?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,1472.963,1475.904,To sell advertising and association with them.
1967.618,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1475.904,1478.105,Just crossed my mind.
1967.618,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1515.213,1521.508,"Well -- well, let's just say 150, like Los Angeles."
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,1521.508,1521.759,Your Honor --
1967.618,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1521.759,1523.083,Or San Diego?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,1523.083,1529.9,The critical issue is what is the public entitled to receive off the air.
1967.618,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1592.693,1598.268,Could you use it in any way other than to just do what you do here?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,1598.268,1600.897,We certainly could not transcribe it or record it.
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1713.109,1716.805,"If your client owned all the television sets, it would be like the hotel case."
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,1716.805,1726.586,"There is only one instance -- well, Your Honor, that case has come up in Canada where they -- the system provided something called radio diffusion."
1967.618,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1837.199,1875.484,"Well, on the other hand, I suppose it's arguable that the substance of the situation is that by your facilities, you to some extent exhibit that you're responsible for making the motion picture available in homes where it would not otherwise be available, take your facilities that are on the outer -- that are outside of the -- the band they expect from here, the service area."
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,1924.058,1931.402,May I suggest Your Honor that this mixes up the electromagnetic energy which we receive and the copyrighted work.
1967.618,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1932.079,1935.756,"Well, they do get kind of mixed up don't they?"
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,1935.756,1944.078,"Well, I suppose they get mixed up in the argument but they don't get mixed up in fact because there's no doubt that the copyright is not on the electromagnetic energy."
1967.618,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1951.44,1956.886,"Well, what's that thing I see on the screen when I go to the movies?"
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,1956.886,1959.211,When you go to the movies?
1967.618,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1963.263,1966.491,"That was my point, yes sir."
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,1966.491,1972.244,"Well, I suppose Your Honor that everything could be reduced to electromagnetic energy because I guess that's all we are."
1967.618,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1975.435,1983.529,"Well, I could say speak for yourself but --"
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,1983.529,2004.201,"Well, I don't feel very electromagnetic but it does seem to me, Your Honor, that it does confuse what the statute is talking about, the copyrighted work and electromagnetic energy because all we deal with or conduct or amplify or convert is electromagnetic energy, and there is no claim that there is a copyright on that."
1967.618,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2018.07,2030.967,Do you know whether there's any claim that these individual companies that put up aerials for us are liable for infringement of the copyright?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2030.967,2049.726,"Within the theory which was just suggested here, yes, they would be liable and one of the points which we have made is that the various theories of performance urged in this Court sweep within the scope of the copyright statute not only community antennas but the apartment house antenna which is so common in this area."
1967.618,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2065.387,2071.449,"I assume there would be no difference between the apartment house antenna and yours, would they?"
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2071.449,2090.291,"Your Honor, that case -- that point came up specifically in the record and it is no doubt that the function of the apartment house antenna is exactly the same as ours, respondent's expert so testified, and the equip -- we offered to prove that the equipment was the same."
1967.618,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2095.356,2100.9,"Well, did you all approve whether it would help to collect from the apartments?"
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2100.9,2108.166,I think that that was conceded but no effort had been made to collect from anyone prior to the time they brought suit against us.
1967.618,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2108.166,2109.045,From anyone?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2109.045,2112.204,"I believe that's correct, sir."
1967.618,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2115.881,2116.534,Talking about what?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2116.534,2118.463,Community antennas or apartment house antennas.
1967.618,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2118.463,2119.489,"Yes, that's what I was talking about."
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2119.489,2120.493,Yes.
1967.618,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2120.493,2125.59,"By the way, what are your charges? What are your charges for this service?"
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2125.59,2133.017,"It's -- well, there are two varying in charges depending on whether they paid a so-called installation fee or a rental fee."
1967.618,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2138.682,2139.218,A month?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2139.218,2142.235,A month.
1967.618,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2142.235,2143.775,Then -- and that's the total charge?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2143.775,2148.863,"That's the total charge, Your Honor."
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2148.863,2169.31,"Mr. Barnard, I suppose that under those decisions below that if you just -- if your equipment has made a mistake and you then put out a perfectly good signal but it just had to be a signal that your subscribers did receive in their sets, somebody else might have been able to receive it that there would still be infringement."
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2169.31,2170.193,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2202.675,2215.806,"What if you -- what if you have to comply with the FCC rules, you taped a program for delayed delivery to your customers in a couple of days."
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2215.806,2217.841,"Well, there are no such FCC rules, but I --"
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2217.841,2224.68,"Well, I thought -- I thought they -- I thought that they prevented duplicating local programs?"
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2224.68,2225.431,That's correct sir.
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2230.573,2236.966,But do the CATV people ever taped and -- for delayed delivery?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2236.966,2240.556,"If they do, it's not in this case and I know of no one in this practice to do it."
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2240.556,2243.517,"But if they did, I suppose then you have it over a different question."
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2243.517,2250.805,The statute reads specifically on the making of a transcription or a record of a copyrighted at work.
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2255.376,2257.844,I understand.
1967.618,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2257.844,2263.092,Are there any such community antennas in this metropolitan area?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2263.092,2267.86,I don't know -- there are great many apartment house antennas in Washington and Baltimore.
1967.618,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2284.646,2290.672,Do I understand Mr. Barnard that merely pick up local signals if that's the reception of local signals?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2290.672,2291.616,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.618,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2647.779,2648.476,The what?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2648.476,2653.005,The license implied in law to receive broadcasts off the air.
1967.618,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2771.334,2779.134,"I suppose it would be a charge on the people that use the radio or television, wouldn't it?"
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2779.134,2780.073,"That's correct, sir."
1967.618,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2782.378,2788.91,Are there any claim made that they have to pay a copyright infringement or else --
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2788.91,2789.401,No.
1967.618,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2789.401,2791.074,-- if they put up their own antenna?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2791.074,2791.254,No.
1967.618,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2794.449,2794.911,Why?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2797.36,2811.278,"Well, they claim that the principle is do-it-yourself, that you must put up your own antenna, that you're not entitled to go to others to assist you in reception of your program a reception of the broadcast."
1967.618,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2811.278,2813.964,"You'd be getting the performance, wouldn't you?"
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2813.964,2818.935,It's on the -- you're getting exactly the same performance on a private antenna as you're getting on the community antenna.
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2818.935,2828.937,But perhaps the basis for say that the private set owner is not liable for an infringement.Is it on the implied license theory?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2828.937,2831.607,"If I underst -- in my view, yes."
1967.618,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2855.477,2872.371,"Did you say that the position was that when I hire someone as I did and paid a lot of money for it to put up one of these fancy antennas that runs by electric clocks, that that was the do-it-yourself kind?"
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2872.371,2874.673,"Your Honor, I don't think it's do-it-yourself."
1967.618,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2882.155,2888.789,"That probably costs me a lot more than if I got one of -- subscribe to one of your community antenna services, wouldn't it?"
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2888.789,2890.457,"I think it quite possibly may, Your Honor."
1967.618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2891.277,2897.086,"Do you suppose that if the gentleman has sold him and installed the antenna, he's subject to the rule below?"
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2897.086,2917.361,"Under -- I think that under the construction of the rule below and certainly under the respondent's theories here, the gentleman is maybe within the scope of the copyright monopoly because he was contributing, he was providing -- making it possible for you to view what otherwise you wouldn't view."
1967.618,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2979.528,2986.415,Suppose that were technologically possible and you sold your service to --
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,2986.415,2987.373,I'm sorry I didn't hear the first one?
1967.618,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2987.373,3003.597,"Suppose that were technologically possible and you sold your service to a theatre, and the theatre exhibited a motion picture that came in over there and exactly the way you described charged admission for it."
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,3006.519,3010.143,I would have no doubt that the theatre was performing within the meaning Buck case.
1967.618,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3011.461,3013.946,But you would not be.
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,3013.946,3020.205,It's conceivable that we would be liable as a contributory infringement but we would not be liable as a performer because we are not giving a performance.
1967.618,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3020.205,3024.941,But you would be liable -- you would be infringing the Copyright Act?
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,3024.941,3039.027,"We might be liable as a contributory infringement and need the respond that has said that it's going to make such a contention but so far as we can see, the performance is done by the theatre in your illustration and not by us."
1967.618,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3039.027,3051.845,The difference being that then you would be providing this service or facility or whatnot for a public performance as distinguished from a private performance.
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,3051.845,3052.401,That's correct Your Honor.
1967.618,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3052.401,3054.977,For a private viewing or whatever.
1967.618,0,38648,robert_c_barnard,,3054.977,3061.402,That's correct Your Honor.
1967.618,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3061.402,3064.029,"As I say, we believe the public has the right to receive."
1967.618,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3320.441,3322.586,Yes you may.
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,3324.165,3330.796,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3468.426,3470.906,You misunderstood Mr. Nizer.
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,3484.574,3486.756,"It isn't Your Honor, I'm sure."
1967.618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3495.667,3498.537,But you are going to get around and then telling us why it isn't done.
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,3498.537,3499.197,Yes Your Honor.
1967.618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3499.197,3499.963,Yes.
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,3499.963,3515.157,"Right now, it's function is not to send out to thousands of subscribers or less a picture through a treatment and change of channel in this complex, sophisticated equipment."
1967.618,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3847.971,3850.997,What was the criminal offense?
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,3850.997,3851.501,What?
1967.618,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3851.501,3855.845,What was the charge and what was the conviction in that trial case?
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,3855.845,3859.287,The evidence –-
1967.618,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3859.287,3859.671,I don't care what he evidence –-
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,3859.671,3872.266,The testimony was they claimed it was a trespass and that they have blown out the service but actually of course it isn't trespass to take a line that was taking their property which was really involved.
1967.618,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3872.412,3875.491,I just want to know what the charge was and what the conviction was.
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,3877.093,3884.109,I think the only testimony in the record is by a manager who didn't know the law that he thought it was a trespass charge.
1967.618,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3884.109,3884.874,How about the judge?
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,3890.231,3893.347,"Alright, there is nothing in the record to substantiate it Your Honor."
1967.618,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3894.801,3904.651,"I just wanted how much that had to do with the issues in this case and it would depend upon -- if it has any relevance, it would only have it in the event that it was a certain kind of a conviction."
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,3904.651,3914.511,It was a testimony given in a deposition by a manager in Fairmont who characterize that he believe that's a trespass charge.
1967.618,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4000.187,4006.526,"Mr. Nizer, is there anything in the pending Copyright Bill that deals with this situation?"
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,4006.526,4025.946,"Yes Your Honor, there has been an attempt made and that is where the attempt should be made to amend the Copyright Act so as to create certain -- either compulsory licenses or involved provision with respect to CATV."
1967.618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4074.743,4076.157,I don't understand Mr. Nizer.
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,4081.915,4086.387,"Yes, to the effort is being --"
1967.618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4086.387,4088.598,Is it -- I didn't quite get you.
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,4094.951,4095.933,No.
1967.618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4106.962,4108.988,"Well, that's the issue we have to decide."
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,4108.988,4112.531,That's right.
1967.618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4124.368,4128.917,"Yes but what I'm trying to get to is what is this Bill, it's proposal --"
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,4128.917,4132.091,By the CATV to get some kind of --
1967.618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4132.091,4133.303,-- explicitly is that it?
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,4133.303,4133.591,Yes.
1967.618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4135.09,4138.911,"When someone else is trying to get something explicit to include them, is that it?"
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,4138.911,4141.569,"No, we don't need any inclusion of CATV."
1967.618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4143.702,4148.807,"Yeah, that will depend on how we come out here."
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,4148.807,4151.354,Of course Your Honor.
1967.618,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4151.354,4152.117,Mr. Nizer.
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,4188.118,4189.441,No.
1967.618,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4189.441,4190.055,No?
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,4190.055,4208.155,"No Your Honor because as an individual company, we may refer as we do today with local broadcasting companies to give one rather than another license for commercial reasons.We may think it's a better station and to that extent, each individual company and indeed that's true of every copyright owner or patent owner has some choice."
1967.618,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4216.763,4219.045,I'm not asking you that Mr. Nizer.
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,4229.691,4232.891,Of court Mr. Justice we can --
1967.618,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4232.891,4257.14,"Now how much is any instrument in this record or can you give us any idea about how much of a station's programming, daily programming handled by CATV system would be subject to copyright if it's -- if we decide in your favor?"
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,4266.314,4267.276,I understand sir.
1967.618,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4296.828,4304.071,So you have two questions facing CATV if we should agree with you.
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,4314.586,4315.413,That's right.
1967.618,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4342.301,4349.74,And just assume not a picture like a history of motion picture distribution with which we're all familiar.
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,4349.74,4360.263,"And that is why any anticipation of any repetition of past sins is unlikely a view -- as Mr. Justice Holmes says, “Not as long as we're here.”"
1967.618,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4464.139,4467.882,"Mr. Nizer, I hope you will indulge me of one further thing."
1967.618,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4927.957,4952.001,"Isn't that quite -- that is -- I don't understand his position but as well as I can understand it, the Solicitor General's position is that a television station duly licensed and to -- and duly authorized to broadcast the copyrighted material."
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,4992.681,4994.445,That is a correct statement to this proposal.
1967.618,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4994.445,4995.526,"That is his position, isn't it?"
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,4995.526,4997.269,That is his position that the --
1967.618,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5014.593,5015.125,No.
1967.618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5143.947,5148.183,"Well Mr. Nizer, I don't follow this if you're talking within the A area."
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,5164.778,5164.879,Yes.
1967.618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5164.879,5167.824,That's one show -- that's one performance.
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,5179.32,5184.03,Because whoever else intervenes to perform even within the --
1967.618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5184.03,5185.31,He is not performing.
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,5209.079,5214.292,"Your Honor, if isolated to an individual home, what you say is true."
1967.618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5215.222,5221.304,What difference does it matter if in New York City there are million homes would perceive the same performance?
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,5221.304,5223.633,I should like to explain.
1967.618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5254.485,5258.767,"Well, I guess that's really the knob of this case isn't it?"
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,5260.822,5262.584,Yes and it has been held repeatedly.
1967.618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5308.79,5319.194,"Yes but Mr. Nizer, the hotel also own the equipment at the end of the line that which actually made the sounds or the pictures of what it was."
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,5319.194,5330.501,"It did in that case but in this upward case, it was held specifically that once the equipment the radio wouldn't make the slightest difference and it doesn't because that's really the reception."
1967.618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5344.853,5357.217,Well could you tell me what your basis is for saying that the home owner that turns on his set and invites the people in to watch some show is that --
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,5357.217,5358.253,That's not infringement.
1967.618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5358.253,5359.509,"Yes, it's not an infringer."
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,5359.509,5364.11,"Well, clearly that the statute does not make reception ever in infringement."
1967.618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5366.447,5368.736,I know but why isn't that a performance?
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,5368.736,5370.147,Because the --
1967.618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5370.147,5372.724,You can't just say it's because of the reception.
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,5372.724,5374.133,"Yes, that's right."
1967.618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5406.825,5425.324,"Well, what would you say if I had a television -- a large television screen in my house and I made a regular practice of charging to come over and watch a -- watching programs and people did."
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,5433.144,5435.037,The -- it would make it --
1967.618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5435.037,5437.119,Did that reception come to be a performance?
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,5437.119,5437.879,No Your Honor.
1967.618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5453.345,5455.477,Even though all you did is turn on and switch.
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,5455.477,5456.306,That's right.
1967.618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5456.306,5457.226,And receive.
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,5457.226,5457.692,That's right.
1967.618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5468.129,5471.525,"Well, it doesn't even mention reception, isn't it?"
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,5471.525,5478.239,"No, the authorities have held that reception for profit is a violation of the Act."
1967.618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5478.239,5479.908,Has this Court said that?
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,5479.908,5480.178,Pardon.
1967.618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5480.178,5481.019,Has this Court said that?
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,5481.019,5482.138,There was no occasion to it.
1967.618,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5676.013,5680.687,Where is that clearly declared?
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,5680.687,5683.917,This is a quotation of it Your Honor.
1967.618,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5684.569,5686.339,From the Statute?
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,5686.339,5693.297,"No, no this is the regulations to repeatedly and rules announced can the first and second order?"
1967.618,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5694.596,5696.937,That's what we have before us in the proceeding case?
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,5696.937,5703.442,"Yes Your Honor, that's the case."
1967.618,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5984.78,5986.71,Why do you refer to this exemption?
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,5992.834,6017.054,"Well, the implied in law theory contrary to the precise language giving us exclusive rights for every public performance without limitation is a misnomer and as a semantic, wittingly or unwittingly a semantic device to put a good color on an impossible concept in this case."
1967.618,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6036.615,6041.081,"Of course, this is all on the -- on the premises Mr. Nizer."
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,6047.706,6054.997,Yes and I am able to persuade you but the briefs and the clarities will make it rather clear.
1967.618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6227.757,6237.309,"Mr. Nizer, I think that those stations that you suggest are -- have began to originate programs if they use a copyright at work, they do pay their royalties."
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,6237.309,6238.058,Pay them.
1967.618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6255.528,6264.824,I think that if you do – I gather you don't see any difference though between the station that originates and the station that doesn't?
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,6264.824,6265.746,None at all.
1967.618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6286.7,6294.739,But the station it originates is doing a lot of things different in addition to what the non-originated Act.
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,6294.739,6309.007,It is arranging the program and it pays license fees for everything that it engages and then sends it out by this -- the same way and the only difference is they send it over the air and they send it by wire.
1967.618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6325.556,6337.565,Doesn't the CATV system such as the petitioners here -- don't they actually make a selection of the program that they're going to give to their subscribers?
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,6337.565,6339.426,They do only in this sense Your Honor.
1967.618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6346.281,6350.276,Stations that's within the range of their equipment.
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,6350.276,6351.725,Yes but you go very far.
1967.618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6372.507,6379.123,"But they simultaneously on their cable have more than one program, I gather don't they?"
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,6379.123,6379.666,Oh yes.
1967.618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6397.977,6407.94,"How many programs if I will subscribe with their service and say in the primetime in the evening, how many different programs could I get off with their cable."
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,6407.94,6412.102,"Well, if they have 20 channels."
1967.618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6412.528,6414.892,"And if they chose to send you 20 different stations, you have 20."
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,6414.892,6421.785,"If they chose to you have, yes, on the UHF band particularly and I suppose on the VHF 13 would be the limit."
1967.618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6423.067,6439.138,"And so if there were.Let's assume there were 20 stations within the range of this CATV system and they just -- but they just chose to retransmit or whatever they do, three of them."
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,6440.89,6442.347,"Yes, they quite so."
1967.618,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6459.987,6474.92,But you're not suggesting -- are you suggesting Mr. Nizer that they can -- CATV can pick an individual program such as an individual football game from a station and not carrying the entire station program?
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,6474.92,6475.875,Oh yes.
1967.618,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6508.887,6523.869,"What you're saying is that if I understand, it is that -- they can hold of a particular CATV system it does not customarily carry the programs of television station X."
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,6532.07,6533.045,Yes Your Honor.
1967.618,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6658.56,6674.496,"That's really just a letter in it because let's assume that a television station who is your licensee completely saturated an area, you don't get anymore for your copyright, do you?"
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,6674.496,6676.264,"No, there isn't -- that's quite right."
1967.618,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6816.847,6872.38,"But on the other end, it maybe that the question is, that didn't quite shape up that way Mr. Nizer because I would assume that it should be established that your product and the product of these artists is being disseminated not only by a television station but also by some other instrumentality that your fees would take that into account just as I should think that maybe the advertisers on the television station are more concerned about the number of people to whom their advertising is exposed and whether it's exposed to the potential consumer and picks it up directly from the station or through the intervention of CATV."
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,6872.38,6876.519,That would go to the implied license in fact that we've been paid.
1967.618,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6876.519,6879.516,So it goes to a lot more than implied licensing.
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,6879.516,6890.628,"Well -- double payment thus it is argued that will be for a trial and since my time is limited, I would like to -- if Your Honor will excuse me, just very briefly reply."
1967.618,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6896.931,6898.435,You may have two or three minutes.
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,6898.435,6898.553,Thank you sir.
1967.618,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6898.553,6901.785,And counsel may have the same time.
1967.618,1,34896,louis_nizer,,6901.785,6903.193,I appreciate it Your Honor.
1967.618,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6959.575,6961.428,Mr. Barnard.
1967.618,2,38648,robert_c_barnard,,6961.428,6965.329,Your Honor.
1967.618,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7224.779,7227.293,"Well, let's see."
1967.618,2,38648,robert_c_barnard,,7231.328,7236.894,"Have we ever picked in a specific program and receive for our subscribers, the answer is no."
1967.618,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7236.894,7239.84,Is your system capable of doing that?
1967.618,2,38648,robert_c_barnard,,7239.84,7243.689,"Well, I suppose you could take a switch and turn it off and on, yes."
1967.618,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7243.689,7256.639,"No, I mean suppose that you irregularly providing your subscribers with the service of -- from three stations, could you pick a program from the fourth?"
1967.618,2,38648,robert_c_barnard,,7256.639,7260.988,Only by cutting off the reception of one of the three.
1967.618,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7260.988,7262.664,So that would be possible?
1967.618,2,38648,robert_c_barnard,,7262.664,7265.639,"Technically, you could switch from one station to another."
1967.618,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7265.639,7266.965,But you say you've never done it?
1967.618,2,38648,robert_c_barnard,,7266.965,7267.653,No.
1967.618,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7276.653,7283.03,"By the entire broadcast, you mean the entire programming of a station for the entire day?"
1967.618,2,38648,robert_c_barnard,,7283.03,7283.877,Yes sir
1967.618,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7283.877,7285.771,And for seven days in a week?
1967.618,2,38648,robert_c_barnard,,7285.771,7290.523,"Yes sir, subject going to shutdown for failure of equipment."
1967.618,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7290.523,7292.406,But in fact to five different stations.
1967.618,2,38648,robert_c_barnard,,7292.406,7293.315,"Five different stations, yes sir."
1967.618,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7293.315,7295.921,And nearly the homeowner has his choice among the five?
1967.618,2,38648,robert_c_barnard,,7295.921,7297.945,That's correct sir.
1967.618,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7300.22,7301.527,Yes or not to listen any of it.
1967.618,2,38648,robert_c_barnard,,7301.527,7313.161,At or were not to listen to any which I'm sure many of them elect.
1967.618,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7330.312,7332.224,-- to that if we agree with you.
1967.618,2,38648,robert_c_barnard,,7332.224,7332.782,I beg your pardon?
1967.618,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7332.782,7336.519,We don't ever get to that if I agree with you --
1967.618,2,38648,robert_c_barnard,,7336.519,7337.565,I agree sir.
1967.618,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7400.327,7401.521,Thank you Mr. Barnard.
