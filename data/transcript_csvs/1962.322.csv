1962.322,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,12.05,-- versus State of Florida on the relationship of the Florida Bar.
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,13.711,17.235,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1962.322,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,97.753,105.318,It's your argument -- you're (Inaudible)
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,105.318,126.757,"He can theoretically call himself a patent attorney because he was admitted to practice before the Patent Office prior to 1938 at which time even though he was a nonlawyer, he was entitled to call himself a patent attorney."
1962.322,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,144.441,160.164,(Inaudible)
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,160.164,162.767,"Well, he can't call himself a patent lawyer."
1962.322,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,171.569,173.246,How can he be described?
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,173.246,180.975,He can describe himself as a patent agent or as -- as a patent attorney.
1962.322,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,212.553,214.003,That issue is not before us.
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,214.003,215.74,That issue is not before us.
1962.322,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,215.74,220.77,"Or whether an attorney means agent, doesn't it, it doesn't necessarily mean lawyer although a good many people think."
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,220.77,230.512,"Well, my understanding is that originally attorney meant attorney in fact, and then as distinguished from attorney at law --"
1962.322,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,230.512,230.977,Right.
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,230.977,240.567,"And that I think that the normal interpretation of the word today, an attorney means an attorney at law."
1962.322,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,241.499,247.469,"If I give you a power of attorney because you're my attorney, you're not necessarily a lawyer although you have to be one."
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,247.469,251.849,"Well, that would be giving me an attorney -- power of attorney in fact."
1962.322,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,251.849,252.282,That's correct.
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,252.282,267.56,And I think that usually they qualify it to be an attorney of fact rather than a straight attorney which I think to the general public which he's really most interested in what they are called.
1962.322,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,269.27,269.666,An attorney has come to mean a lawyer.
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,269.666,271.776,-- person who says an attorney means he's an attorney of law.
1962.322,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,271.776,277.718,"Although the dictionary definition I'm sure without having looked it up which showed at least one meaning of the word, it's simply “agent.”"
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,277.718,283.531,"Well, I think that is correct but I don't think that's the -- what the public necessarily think."
1962.322,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,283.531,289.96,Does this record show one way or the other whether Mr. Sperry ever attempted to take the Bar -- the Florida Bar examination?
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,289.96,290.498,"No, the record doesn't --"
1962.322,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,290.498,292.468,Or any bar examination?
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,292.468,297.366,The record does not show that and I myself do not know.
1962.322,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,297.366,302.683,What does the patent bureau call them now since they no longer called them attorneys?
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,302.683,309.195,"Well, there are two classifications, 'patent attorneys' and patent agents."
1962.322,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,309.195,309.707,Patent agents.
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,309.707,320.138,The members who are registered with the Commissioner of Patents who are attorneys are entered on the list of 'patent attorneys'.
1962.322,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,323.933,326.597,I see.
1962.322,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,326.597,335.04,And the matters that the Court enjoined are listed on pages 67 and 68 of the record.
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,335.04,335.567,"Yes, correct."
1962.322,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,335.567,337.498,Which of those do you object to?
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,337.498,339.451,"Well, we object Your Honor to --"
1962.322,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,339.451,344.664,You don't object to the first using the term 'patent attorneys' do you?
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,344.664,348.011,"No, we don't object to that."
1962.322,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,348.011,350.861,Do you object to the second rendering legal opinions?
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,350.861,355.953,We object to the portion wherein it says including opinions as to patentability.
1962.322,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,373.747,377.257,You don't object to three?
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,377.257,386.651,"Well, three is -- as broadly stated preparing drafting and construing legal documents, he is not a lawyer."
1962.322,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,398.392,406.259,Do you take that this is broad enough to prevent him from drafting an application for a patent.
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,406.259,409.774,"Well, of course that is particularly covered in five."
1962.322,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,409.774,413.808,In five.
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,413.808,422.918,"And insofar as any activities which are restricted to state lawyers, we don't feel that he has any right to pursue those."
1962.322,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,422.918,425.148,Yes.
1962.322,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,425.148,428.358,Do you say you objected to three?
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,428.358,436.299,"No, Your Honor, three as stated strictly the practice of law which would we -- within the purview of the State."
1962.322,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,436.299,439.073,It depends what the documents are.
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,439.073,439.697,"Well, it does."
1962.322,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,453.371,459.737,But is -- is the patent application a legal document?
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,459.737,479.86,"Well, there is an answer -- our question would have to be answered yes in the sense that the patent application as it has been held by this Court is really a contract between the inventor and the Government."
1962.322,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,512.292,519.317,Would the preparation of an appeal to the Court of Patents – Customs and Patent Appeals be a legal document?
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,519.317,522.489,"Well, that would not be practiced before the Patent Office."
1962.322,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,523.591,524.144,It would be.
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,524.144,525.989,But we aren't contending that practice --
1962.322,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,525.989,528.759,"No, no, I'm not -- I'm not questioning what you're contending."
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,541.776,556.666,"Yes, I would say that there is no right in a patent agent to appeal to a court without becoming a member of the Bar of that court."
1962.322,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,556.666,558.221,The Court of Patent Appeals?
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,558.221,561.268,"Court of -- Customs and Patent Appeals, correct."
1962.322,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,561.268,563.887,You concede that there must be a lawyer to do that?
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,563.887,565.396,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1962.322,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,565.396,567.323,I see.
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,569.072,604.538,"Now, we contend that practice before the Patent Office consist of preparing a patent application after consulting with the inventor as to the scope of the invention then filing that patent application with the Patent Office, and then prosecuting it through the Patent Office until there is a final determination by the Patent Office, all of these to be performed within the rules and regulations of the Patent Office."
1962.322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,624.532,631.295,(Inaudible)
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,631.295,642.19,I would say that matters relating to infringement are matters of law relating to issued patents over which the Patent Office has no jurisdiction.
1962.322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,649.813,654.162,(Inaudible)
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,654.162,665.582,"By the rules of the Patent Office, agents and attorneys were treated alike within the conduct of interference proceedings."
1962.322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,665.582,679.798,Where the finding of possible facts (Inaudible)
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,679.798,681.735,"Well, the advise as to --"
1962.322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,681.735,685.794,(Inaudible)
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,685.794,690.001,"No, that's -- that would be another problem."
1962.322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,710.164,720.501,(Inaudible)
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,720.501,721.837,That is correct.
1962.322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,722.507,726.674,(Inaudible)
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,726.674,744.531,He is rendering opinions as to whether the particular invention concerned is new and inventive in relation to the disclosures of those other patents.
1962.322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,772.645,806.742,(Inaudible)
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,806.742,809.515,"Well, it's very conceivable that he might."
1962.322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,809.515,820.708,(Inaudible)
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,820.708,830.186,"Well, I think that when you get to matters like that, that that is beyond the rights of a patent agent but --"
1962.322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,830.186,831.908,He required a patent (Inaudible)
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,831.908,832.379,You would have to --
1962.322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,832.379,839.141,(Inaudible)
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,839.141,839.718,I would say so.
1962.322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,839.718,844.325,(Inaudible)
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,844.325,846.642,Yes.
1962.322,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,846.642,849.504,(Inaudible)
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,849.504,859.551,An interference proceeding is a proceeding within the Patent Office to determine which of two applicants is actually the first inventor.
1962.322,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,859.551,861.038,How was it initiated?
1962.322,0,19691,carlisle_m_moore,,861.038,871.62,It's initiated by -- usually by the Patent Office because there are two conflicting applications in the Patent Office which are claiming the same subject matter.
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2012.166,2016.607,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.322,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2241.274,2242.174,Qualification.
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2242.174,2245.731,"Yes, sir, I used the wrong word, patent applications."
1962.322,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2245.731,2266.827,"In short, is it correct to say that the issues now are narrowed so that all the petitioner is claiming is what the -- what the rules of the Patent Office gives him, by which do not include the right to hold yourself out as a lawyer in the general practice of law."
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2266.827,2269.548,"Yes, sir, I think that is a fair statement."
1962.322,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2269.548,2280.701,"So now that -- it's boiled down to all -- he is claiming against infringement by Florida of the rights, you say, which the Patent Office gives him, isn't that right?"
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2280.701,2291.05,"Yes, sir, and here we're coming so closer to the -- to the fine point of case because the petitioner contends in this Court, his brief as replete with statement to this effect that what the court below did was to enjoin him “from practice before the Patent Office”."
1962.322,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2326.166,2333.355,"Well, is that your point, Mr. vom Baur that all that he's been enjoined from doing, he's doing it -- doing these things in Florida."
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2333.355,2335.893,This is part of my point.
1962.322,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2337.247,2343.799,"Well, but I thought one of his arguments was that he's practicing before the Patent Office when he's doing these things in Florida."
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2343.799,2346.338,This is what he says and this is what I am endeavoring to rebut.
1962.322,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2356.424,2359.555,"So they specifically said that, is it not, on page 68?"
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2359.555,2362.018,"Yes, sir, the Court specifically said the contrary of that --"
1962.322,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2362.018,2362.46,That's right.
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2362.46,2370.741,They say -- the Court said the issuance of this injunction and I think I can quote it will not in any sense interfere with the right of the petitioner to practice before the Patent Office in Washington D.C.
1962.322,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2370.741,2373.909,"That is if he comes to Washington and does these things, couldn't it?"
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2381.804,2389.223,"If it is a practice before the Patent Office, I deny, Mr. Justice Brennan, that it is and I would still like to try to get out my reasons as to why if I may, sir."
1962.322,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2389.223,2403.171,"Well, doesn't the -- doesn't the regulation of the Bureau provide that they shall not do it by public appearance in Washington that they shall -- they shall deal with the Bureau by mail?"
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2403.171,2407.222,"That is an interesting question, Mr. Justice Warren, Mr. Chief Justice."
1962.322,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2421.152,2428.572,"Now, let's talk about -- let's talk about the normal practice and what they -- what they ask their agents to do."
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2436.549,2439.15,I cannot answer as to whether they encourage it but I can say is --
1962.322,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2439.15,2439.593,But don't they suggest it in their --
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2439.593,2441.746,"-- the rule of the Patent Office -- excuse me, sir."
1962.322,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2441.746,2443.961,Don't they suggest it in their rules?
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2443.961,2468.284,"Well, they say something about all correspondence should be carried on by mail, but the point I would like to make in answer to your question is, that the Patent Office rules which is a fairly voluminous document here provide specifically for a number of personal appearances in the Patent Office, such as interviews with examiners under Patent Rule 133, an oral hearing or oral argument before the Board of Patent Appeals."
1962.322,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2468.284,2471.303,"Well, he admits that he can't go before the Patent Appeals."
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2471.303,2474.15,"No, this is the Board of Patent Appeals in the Patent Office, sir."
1962.322,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2474.15,2474.366,In that --
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2474.366,2479.034,And these are things which take place in the Patent Office in which I think constitutes practice before the Patent Office.
1962.322,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2479.034,2481.46,"Yes, yes, yes, I agree."
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2481.46,2488.638,"Now third, there are -- there is oral argument on motions in the Patent Office and interference cases."
1962.322,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2503.439,2504.21,Mr. vom Baur --
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2504.21,2504.615,"Yes, sir."
1962.322,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2504.615,2506.613,Let's just get down with the facts.
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2512.452,2514.417,And hold himself out as a patent lawyer.
1962.322,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2514.417,2516.43,"No, I haven't said that."
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2524.608,2526.104,I think he can have an office there.
1962.322,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2526.104,2526.809,Alright.
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2538.947,2542.106,"He cannot practice law in Florida, Mr. Justice Goldberg."
1962.322,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2542.147,2547.96,Considering any patent application to the Patent Office from his office in Florida?
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2547.96,2550.282,He cannot prepare a patent application.
1962.322,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2550.302,2556.305,"Well, what do you do outside to pay rent?"
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2556.305,2563.436,"Justice Goldberg, most -- the great bulk of patent app -- of patent agents do not hold themselves out to the public."
1962.322,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2582.207,2585.411,"So, what you're saying now (Inaudible)"
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2599.742,2602.535,He cannot hold himself out to practice law in the patent field.
1962.322,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2602.535,2624.573,"Suppose he says -- now supposedly, I am not a lawyer and I am an agent of the Patent Bar and owning to both to -- by applications before the Patent Office, not every lawyer (Inaudible) what's your view there?"
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2624.573,2629.548,The court below held that the preparation of patent applications constitutes the practice of law.
1962.322,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2632.166,2649.637,"In other words, he could not have (Inaudible) within the Patent Office within Florida, in this area unless -- regardless of the statute that followed on what might be fully advised unless he operates under the (Inaudible) of a lawyer."
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2649.637,2651.781,"Yes, sir, if he is practicing law, that is correct."
1962.322,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2651.781,2654.965,"Well, then your statement concludes it, but I am trying to get to the facts."
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2671.283,2672.973,"I think that is right, sir."
1962.322,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2672.973,2681.805,Was that -- say Mr. vom Baur that he -- he might take employment with a Florida law firm in general practice and do their patent application work for them?
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2681.805,2683.334,"Working under the supervision of a lawyer, yes sir."
1962.322,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2683.334,2687.454,But what would -- what would the lawyers in general practice know about -- especially in patent applications.
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2687.454,2695.668,"Well, and -- very frankly, lawyers in general practice don't practice patent law unless they are also admitted to practice before the Patent Office."
1962.322,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2702.228,2712.529,Well is that to say then that the only employment he could take would be with some law office doing a patent law of business.
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2712.529,2716.921,"Or with a corporation or within the Government, there are a number of faculties in the Government."
1962.322,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2716.921,2720.314,Not with some firm in general practice.
1962.322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2720.314,2734.447,"Well, Mr. vom Baur, that doesn't quite follow does it really -- it seems to me that anything that the Patent Office want it done or that not wanted done, permitted to be done by a nonlawyer, he could do it."
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2748.643,2749.449,Under the law of Florida?
1962.322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2749.657,2750.528,Yes.
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2760.079,2765.86,"With one condition, Mr. Justice White, and that is that the lawyer also be admitted to practice before the Patent Office."
1962.322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2765.86,2767.708,"Well now, how far does the --"
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2767.708,2768.079,Because the rules of the --
1962.322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2768.079,2770.412,I'm just talking about the laws in the State of Florida?
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2770.412,2773.355,"No, sir, there's a federal statute which requires --"
1962.322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2773.355,2778.195,"I understand this but anything that goes to the Patent Office, he signs."
1962.322,1,23653,f_trowbridge_vom_baur,,2786.83,2787.447,Perhaps so.
1962.322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2787.447,2787.921,Yes.
1962.322,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2787.921,2807.247,"In other words, in preparing an application for a patent, he would have to do it under the supervision of a Florida lawyer and when it came to presenting it to the -- the Patent Office, the Florida lawyer would have to do it under the supervision of this man."
