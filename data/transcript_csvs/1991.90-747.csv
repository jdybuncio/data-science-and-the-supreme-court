1991.90-747,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.939,"We'll hear argument next in No. 9747, United States Department of State v. Michael B. Ray."
1991.90-747,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,57.67,67.525,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-747,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,200.445,203.73,Are you urging the abandonment of the balancing test?
1991.90-747,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,203.73,210.717,--There are applications for the balancing test that we still of course recognize.
1991.90-747,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,379.553,386.207,Your view is that what you describe as a categorical view... rule is not a workable rule?
1991.90-747,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,386.207,398.598,"Well, I don't want to belabor the point, but as I understand the Court's decision, for example, in Reporters Committee, which of course wasn't a redaction case, it was a disclosure case."
1991.90-747,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,457.017,475.479,Were there... aren't there situations such as the names or donors or participants from governmental contracts that might well be revealed to the benefit of the country?
1991.90-747,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,475.479,477.014,"Yes, sir."
1991.90-747,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,534.283,536.219,Give me some assurance.
1991.90-747,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,544.075,548.693,I am not aware of what you might have in mind.
1991.90-747,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,554.481,556.716,You think they are entirely consistent?
1991.90-747,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,556.716,561.335,"--I'm not aware of an inconsistency, Your Honor."
1991.90-747,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,765.553,774.491,"Mr. Jones, what is the invasion of privacy here that is unwarranted, caused by the disclosure?"
1991.90-747,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,783.478,812.045,"No, sir, the disclosure... by comparison the FOIA... litigation generally, this is an exceptionally unusual type of disclosure because it involves, as you would look at the interview reports, it involves details about their personal lives, their living conditions, their poverty, their ambitions to leave their country, their frustrations with their present living situation."
1991.90-747,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,839.363,855.972,"What I was interested in finding out is whether you were indeed deciding that it was a substantial invasion of privacy upon the basis of something that it will cause, such as a commercial solicitation."
1991.90-747,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,858.572,858.924,"No, sir."
1991.90-747,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,878.135,882.503,What if they had asked for the names of the people first?
1991.90-747,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,892.775,894.727,"Well, the... I believe the--"
1991.90-747,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,894.727,896.393,"I mean, you know, this happened in the reverse way."
1991.90-747,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,904.547,910.201,"--Well, just to put this in context, FOIA requires disclosure of documents, not lists."
1991.90-747,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,915.439,915.972,Okay.
1991.90-747,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,915.972,928.162,"And our... and I offer that as a preface because in that context, the name then has a location, has a context."
1991.90-747,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,928.162,932.816,"But it's up to you whether you choose to redact the name or redact the contents, right?"
1991.90-747,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,935.018,937.202,Not at all.
1991.90-747,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,938.054,943.339,"What if they said, we want those documents and what we are interested in is the names of the people."
1991.90-747,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,952.412,957.948,"--Well, that may be their desire, but exemption 6 was cleary intended to work just the opposite result."
1991.90-747,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,972.608,981.964,"Yes, but you are not identifying... producing identifying personal information if you give none of these personal details; all you give is the name of the person."
1991.90-747,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,985.166,987.666,It is personal information.
1991.90-747,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,992.486,998.972,"And you think that would be an unwarranted invasion of privacy, to say that so-and-so was interviewed by the Government?"
1991.90-747,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,998.972,1001.841,"Yes, particularly in this context."
1991.90-747,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1047.953,1054.19,"Mr. Jones, can I ask you a question I want to be sure that I get out before the time is up?"
1991.90-747,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1072.633,1082.071,"I think that passports as the... I mean, the similar files case was The Washington Post case."
1991.90-747,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1082.071,1085.273,"Right, but that they asked for the information about identified people there."
1991.90-747,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1085.273,1085.673,Okay.
1991.90-747,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1112.775,1118.328,"It isn't immediately apparent to me that this fits within the definition of the statute, that I just thought I should let you know that it's probably--"
1991.90-747,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1118.328,1124.065,"--Your Honor, I think it is only immediately apparent after reading the Washington Post case."
1991.90-747,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1124.065,1130.152,"--Which involved files that were maintained under the names of the person named in the request, which is not the case here."
1991.90-747,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1130.152,1142.194,"That's correct, but the standard that the Court drew on was from the House and Senate reports which describe generally documents that contain personal identifying information."
1991.90-747,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1251.98,1264.12,"Although you do use the individual needs for determining whether there's a public interest, I presume."
1991.90-747,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1264.12,1268.191,"I don't follow your question, but I--"
1991.90-747,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1268.191,1287.319,I don't know how you can decide whether the invasion of privacy is unwarranted in the sense that there is no sufficient public interest in the disclosure without inquiring into what use would be made of the information.
1991.90-747,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1294.138,1300.459,"--I don't believe so, but even if that were correct, it wouldn't have implications for this case."
1991.90-747,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1326.11,1338.833,"But the character of the information... it's important information or unimportant information on the basis of what... you know, whether it can cause the public to do something that it would not otherwise do."
1991.90-747,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1360.247,1371.305,"Well, Justice Scalia, the stage of the discussion that you're addressing isn't reached in this case because this is a redaction case."
1991.90-747,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1423.487,1434.443,I must say that I don't see the distinction you're drawing between redaction and refusal to disclose the document in its entirety.
1991.90-747,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1445.549,1446.149,"Yes, sir."
1991.90-747,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1495.147,1498.349,I don't understand this.
1991.90-747,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1498.349,1503.753,"Well, if I knew exactly how to help you, I certainly would, but--"
1991.90-747,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1530.82,1532.856,"Very well, Mr. Jones."
1991.90-747,1,36510,michael_dean_ray,,1534.622,1542.045,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-747,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1725.778,1728.564,Mr.... go ahead.
1991.90-747,1,36510,michael_dean_ray,,1734.968,1736.284,"Yes, I do."
1991.90-747,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1736.284,1740.787,I'll ask you the question I asked Mr. Jones.
1991.90-747,1,36510,michael_dean_ray,,1746.441,1751.477,"I'm not sure what you mean by that question, so I'm not sure how to answer it."
1991.90-747,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1781.448,1791.32,"Mr. Ray, I'm concerned about whether there is any limiting principle in the Eleventh Circuit's holding here."
1991.90-747,1,36510,michael_dean_ray,,1813.051,1829.179,"--I believe that the Eleventh Circuit performed the balancing test here, and in doing so, the limits are, as in this case, when the Government uses the information that is requested for public purposes, then the public interest is heightened."
1991.90-747,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1920.985,1930.275,"Well, so is the census data used daily in all sorts of contexts by Congress, by the executive branch, and so forth."
1991.90-747,1,36510,michael_dean_ray,,1942.35,1952.622,"But the Government I don't believe has not used the census information to send back 22,000 people on the high seas or to deport them or to deny their asylum claims."
1991.90-747,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1952.622,1967.231,"Not for that particular purpose, but for other purposes that are just as important, such as deciding where Government funds will be allocated, where more poor people are located, where... you know, all sorts of important matters."
1991.90-747,1,36510,michael_dean_ray,,1969.167,1970.267,I don't distinguish it.
1991.90-747,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1971.933,1973.802,"You think you would be able to get the tense of the census material, too?"
1991.90-747,1,36510,michael_dean_ray,,1973.802,1986.527,"If they were equally as important, then the public interest and the balancing test would... that is the workable formula that Congress intended that has worked fine ever since 1966 when the Freedom of Information Act was enacted."
1991.90-747,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1986.527,1989.329,Because it's important that you be able to double-check the Government?
1991.90-747,1,36510,michael_dean_ray,,1989.329,1996.316,It's important to know whether or not these people are being mistreated and that asylum claims are being decided fairly.
1991.90-747,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2003.403,2011.842,So you have to double-check... the public has the right to double-check the work that the Government has done in assembling any information that is important information?
1991.90-747,1,36510,michael_dean_ray,,2011.842,2013.027,Not any information.
1991.90-747,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2022.9,2030.839,"Mr. Ray, on that point, isn't that apparent from the text of the documents that have been provided to you, even if you don't know the names of the people who were involved?"
1991.90-747,1,36510,michael_dean_ray,,2030.839,2040.595,"No, it's not because as the Eleventh Circuit said, there's also a great public interest in knowing whether or not the Government is telling the truth about fulfilling its obligations."
1991.90-747,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2040.595,2054.271,"Well, if you make two assumptions, one, that the Government is telling the truth, and secondly, that you don't really have an opportunity to interview... re-interview these people, will the names add anything at all to your knowledge about what the Government is doing?"
1991.90-747,1,36510,michael_dean_ray,,2054.271,2054.853,Yes.
1991.90-747,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2063.19,2077.016,"In other words, your entire purpose is to verify the accuracy of the information and to... also to re-interview to find out if they would have had a different result if they had conducted additional interviews?"
1991.90-747,1,36510,michael_dean_ray,,2077.016,2078.033,"Well, no."
1991.90-747,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2095.206,2112.235,"Mr. Ray, if you could make the same argument you're making about the Government's preparation of affidavits for search warrants, that you want to go around and make sure the Government is truthfully quoting these people who are supplying probable cause."
1991.90-747,1,36510,michael_dean_ray,,2120.155,2121.255,I'm sorry.
1991.90-747,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2124.523,2124.89,Yes.
1991.90-747,1,36510,michael_dean_ray,,2130.844,2138.95,"Well, there have been many cases where names have been released, specifically in reference to the release for monitoring Government compliance."
1991.90-747,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2325.716,2334.555,"Well, the State Department commonly uses very gentle terms when referring to other regimes, do they not?"
1991.90-747,1,36510,michael_dean_ray,,2340.559,2367.46,"Well, I think it's very important in the context of the Freedom of Information Act, especially because in the past, the Government has gone before Congress and has unsuccessfully attempted to have Congress write out the (b)(6) exemption requirement and to allow the Government to only have to show that a privacy interest could be infringed upon, rather than that it would be or clearly would be."
1991.90-747,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2417.974,2430.282,"Mr. Ray, do you agree with the Government that the criterion for withholding an entire document is different from the criterion for withholding a portion of it, for redacting?"
1991.90-747,1,36510,michael_dean_ray,,2433.567,2434.817,--I don't believe so.
1991.90-747,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2603.243,2607.195,Let me interrupt there because I want to be sure I understand your argument.
1991.90-747,1,36510,michael_dean_ray,,2613.283,2621.788,"I cannot tell that because at some points there are several pages that are left blank, and I have no idea what is included in there."
1991.90-747,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2866.779,2872.75,"Mr. Ray, let me be sure I understand the point you are making about the Haitian police and the Haitian executive have all of this information."
1991.90-747,1,36510,michael_dean_ray,,2881.903,2888.307,"The Haitian military, Red Cross, police, and executive have the names of the 22,000 Haitians who were brought back on the boats."
1991.90-747,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2897.163,2903.149,But we don't have any reason to believe that the Government of Haiti knows which one of the 500-some odd were interviewed?
1991.90-747,1,36510,michael_dean_ray,,2903.149,2921.694,"Well, we do, I believe, based on the fact of the manner in which these interviews were conducted totally out in the open, in the hamlets and in the villages, where these interviews were done so publicly that many, many people in those villages know who they are and it's no secret."
1991.90-747,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3200.501,3206.155,"Was this the basis for the Ninth Circuit's decision, that there hadn't been any commitment on confidentiality?"
1991.90-747,1,36510,michael_dean_ray,,3206.155,3209.29,--Which decision are you referring to?
1991.90-747,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3209.29,3219.332,"Was the basis for the decision of the court below... Eleventh Circuit, I'm sorry... was the basis for the decision that there had not been a pledge of confidentiality?"
1991.90-747,1,36510,michael_dean_ray,,3219.332,3219.415,No.
1991.90-747,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3226.902,3228.771,And they accepted that as being true?
1991.90-747,1,36510,michael_dean_ray,,3228.771,3230.404,They accepted that.
1991.90-747,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3230.404,3233.639,"Well, I don't think that we are going to go back and review whether there was or wasn't."
1991.90-747,1,36510,michael_dean_ray,,3247.065,3269.681,"I don't believe they disbelieved it, but they felt that the... they stated specifically that they felt that the question as to whether or not the Government's conclusion to the contrary was true or not was certainly or great or significant public interest, and that the release of the names and other identifying matter in this case would lead to the truth in that matter."
1991.90-747,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3269.681,3273.883,Did they disbelieve that the interviews were at least private?
1991.90-747,1,36510,michael_dean_ray,,3278.668,3282.036,I don't believe they ever mention that anywhere in their opinion.
1991.90-747,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3296.996,3298.664,"Thank you, Mr. Ray."
1991.90-747,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3300.248,3304.252,Just one item.
1991.90-747,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3318.16,3318.793,xxx.
1991.90-747,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3318.793,3327.581,"--But apparently on an ad hoc basis, did not think it was significant enough here."
1991.90-747,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3327.581,3348.126,"Mr. Jones, would you comment on your opponent's argument that the 22,000 names are available and therefore, unless one of these reports described mistreatment, there really isn't much concern about the identity getting back to the Haitian Government, as I understand it."
1991.90-747,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3361.683,3371.241,"Separate and apart from the personal interest in the privacy associated with the intimate detail, is there an interest in protecting this information from the Haitians?"
1991.90-747,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3371.241,3371.574,Right.
1991.90-747,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3371.574,3374.943,Keeping the information from the public including the Haitian Government?
1991.90-747,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3388.667,3389.5,So they of course know who those people are.
1991.90-747,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3389.5,3393.369,"They certainly do, just as we would now who's returned on our shores."
1991.90-747,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3393.369,3399.606,"And the concern about mistreatment would be that if you had fled the country and tried to get over here, you might be disloyal, and so forth, to Haiti?"
1991.90-747,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3399.606,3405.759,The purpose of the interviews was simply to find out whether they were being mistreated.
1991.90-747,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3432.66,3442.515,If you only gave the names of those who provided... all of the reports show that they weren't mistreated?
1991.90-747,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3442.515,3446.884,"--There was one reported, confirmed instance of mistreatment."
1991.90-747,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3446.884,3454.24,"So you could withhold that name, I guess, and provide the others."
1991.90-747,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3454.24,3485.627,"Well, Your Honor, in addition to the private nature of the information, which exists with respect to all 500, we also believe that with respect to all 500 there is an undeniable wisdom in the caution that he State Department exercises in conducting these interviews in a confidential matter, because we cannot guarantee the safety or assure that a composition of future governments in Haiti or in other countries."
