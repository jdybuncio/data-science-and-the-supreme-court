1998.97-1927,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,18.045,"We'll hear argument now in two cases that have been consolidated for argument: No. 97-1927, Rodney C. Hanlon, et al. v. Paul W. Berger; and 98-83, Charles H. Wilson v. Harry Layne."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,19.528,22.08,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1927,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,114.09,117.792,"Well, let's... let's get to the help that you claim was provided here."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,118.958,126.897,"Your Honor, as reflected in the Justice Department policy in the U.S. Attorneys' Manual in effect at the time of the Hanlon search and--"
1998.97-1927,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,126.897,129.848,It has since been... that section has since been repealed.
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,130.332,130.931,--Since been amended.
1998.97-1927,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,132.115,134.067,Amended out of existence as I recall.
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,134.067,134.867,No.
1998.97-1927,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,138.069,139.205,How does it read now?
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,139.205,151.178,It... it still is the case... this is set forth in the appendix to the blue brief in the... in the Hanlon case... that law enforcement officers may assist the news media in reporting on and observing and videotaping--
1998.97-1927,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,151.178,155.647,"Does it say that they may take members of the media into people's houses, into private places--"
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,155.647,163.17,"--It doesn't speak to that, but it has now specified that they should not facilitate media accompaniment in the execution of a warrant, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,181.132,188.786,"--Well, why do you have to take photographers into someone's house to aid law enforcement in that respect?"
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,197.157,203.813,This Court has held that the Fourth Amendment doesn't require a least intrusive means test as long as the conduct is reasonable.
1998.97-1927,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,203.813,204.18,No.
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,211.101,224.042,"Well certainly, Your Honor, to the extent that the media are permitted to give a firsthand objective account of the actual events, that facilitates accurate reporting on law enforcement functions, and it may be quite helpful in preventing abuses in instances."
1998.97-1927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,224.042,225.894,"But why just the media, Mr. Cordray?"
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,237.618,241.336,"No, Your Honor, and no one contends that the media should have special privileges here."
1998.97-1927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,241.336,245.724,"So, they could have brought in maybe their sister-in-law to... to watch the thing too as well."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,246.79,253.777,Many law enforcement departments around the country do have a public ride-along program that will permit public to ride along with officers and observe--
1998.97-1927,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,253.777,255.177,Do they drive right into the house?
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,265.335,268.953,"--Well, there are a variety of such programs, and I'm sure that in various circumstances--"
1998.97-1927,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,268.953,275.023,Do you know of any that allow private citizens to accompany officers inside dwellings to execute a search warrant?
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,275.023,275.59,"--Well, yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,282.027,290.282,"No, but your argument was that there were... there were... throughout the country, there was a practice of ride-along, and our question is do they ride right into the house."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,290.282,291.116,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,292.282,294.584,Do you have specific instances in which this is going on?
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,294.584,307.494,"--We have... we have cited to the Court the Fletcher case from the Florida Supreme Court which recognized, as a matter of common usage and custom at the common law as of 1972, that it was common practice to allow media to accompany police--"
1998.97-1927,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,307.494,307.844,No.
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,307.844,309.394,--even into private property or residence--
1998.97-1927,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,309.394,310.463,I think the question... excuse me.
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,349.071,350.605,--That's where I beg to differ.
1998.97-1927,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,361.063,361.479,All right.
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,370.068,372.019,"I... I can't speak to that one way or another, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,372.019,373.12,Do you have any instances?
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,373.12,380.524,"I can speak to the fact that it was recognized at the common law as of 25 years ago, that it was common practice around the country for the media to accompany--"
1998.97-1927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,380.524,380.607,Mr. Cordray--
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,395.45,397.817,"--I... I can't speak to that one way or another, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,397.817,399.736,Can you answer my question?
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,402.687,405.739,"I believe that's right, but I wouldn't want to concede that--"
1998.97-1927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,405.739,408.091,Do you know... do you know of any... do you know of any such practice?
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,408.091,410.126,--I know that there are public ride-along programs.
1998.97-1927,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,418.197,421.665,May I... may I ask you specifically about the law school program?
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,443.264,449.668,"I'm certain that they are, just as a matter of common sense practice and to avoid potential lawsuits and the like."
1998.97-1927,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,455.572,461.309,"In the... in the Montana case, there was no entry into the house by virtue of the warrant."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,462.076,462.492,That's correct.
1998.97-1927,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,467.213,468.03,By consent?
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,468.03,471.432,--By consent to explain the situation to his wife so there wouldn't be a misunderstanding.
1998.97-1927,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,471.432,476.319,"But there was an entry into sheds and outbuildings, as I understand it."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,476.319,477.252,Correct.
1998.97-1927,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,477.252,490.245,"With regard to those, does the evidence disclose whether those buildings had open doors or anything like that or... or what do we know about those sheds and outbuildings?"
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,490.245,500.951,"The search in the Hanlon case was executed in two different places, in open areas on the ranch, which I think fairly clearly would fall within the open fields doctrine, although it is private property, and at the same time in outbuildings."
1998.97-1927,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,510.257,517.063,"And that issue wasn't resolved below because it was a... pretty much a per se rule applied, I take it."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,517.063,520.765,"--I think that's right, both ways, by the district court in our favor and by the court of appeals--"
1998.97-1927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,520.765,522.299,"Well, do you understand the open--"
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,532.838,535.624,"--I don't believe the Court has specified all the details of that, no."
1998.97-1927,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,535.624,543.713,"But you don't understand the... or maybe you do... the open fields doctrine to permit a police officer to stay on an open field if the owner tells him to leave, do you?"
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,543.713,552.652,"As I understand the open fields doctrine, it would because the Court has said that searches of open fields, even though they may be private property, do not implicate the Fourth Amendment."
1998.97-1927,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,557.371,569.178,"But in the... in the Oliver case, the Court was referring to the fact that officers happened to be in an open area and they were concerned with viewing something in an open field from a highway."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,580.653,581.421,That's correct.
1998.97-1927,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,581.421,586.873,--and... and threatened the owner with... with imprisonment if... if he obstructed their search.
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,593.313,602.352,"I think it's an open factual issue in this case, and I think what's germane to the issue that the Court has framed is that there was no execution of a warrant in a home in that case."
1998.97-1927,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,608.822,616.576,"Well, supposing there's a policeman that's standing out on your front lawn, and you tell him, get off, and he says, no, I want to look in your window."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,623.165,631.252,"As here, the police are operating pursuant to a valid warrant, and it's been determined in both cases that they were properly executing the warrant."
1998.97-1927,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,637.592,640.544,I think that bears on the open... open fields question.
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,640.544,641.06,--It may.
1998.97-1927,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,643.246,645.246,Why do you need a warrant under the open fields doctrine?
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,645.246,655.469,"--I think you would not need a warrant, although perhaps in an abundance of caution to avoid any problems that might arise in later litigation or motion to suppress, certainly the better practice would be for the police to obtain a warrant, as they did here."
1998.97-1927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,657.569,664.509,"Of course, just because the police can... can play around in open fields, it doesn't mean that they can bring along anybody else they want to play in the open fields."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,664.509,665.459,"--No, but certainly--"
1998.97-1927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,665.459,677.817,"So, I mean, even if you resolve the open field question, there's still the further question of whether whatever open fields immunity from the Fourth Amendment the officers have extends to the... the officers bringing along somebody else as well I assume."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,677.817,684.905,"--I think that's correct, but that's why I thought it was important to emphasize the Court should not erect a per se rule against media accompaniment in all circumstances where a warrant is involved."
1998.97-1927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,708.188,712.14,"But as you put it, we shouldn't adopt a rule regarding media accompaniment."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,712.14,712.656,Correct.
1998.97-1927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,712.656,723.614,"So, it is... it is part of your case that... that... that there's a... a different rule for media, and that... and that it's... it's better to bring media along than to bring your sister-in-law."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,723.614,728.934,I think it's... it's more... more beneficial in certain respects and it's more of a concern in certain respects.
1998.97-1927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,729.384,732.469,Personally I'd rather have your sister-in-law along than--
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,732.469,733.103,--Perhaps.
1998.97-1927,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,756.835,767.892,"--It's fairly common, isn't it, Mr. Cordray, to bring along the claimant to stolen property with the search so that he... it's his property presumably if they're successful, and he should identify it?"
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,767.892,768.542,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,777.248,784.169,"But those are to aid in the specific search, not for some more systemic purpose of criminal administration."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,784.169,788.806,"In many cases, that's true, but there are also a number of instances in which that really can't be maintained."
1998.97-1927,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,810.035,818.14,"Well, wouldn't there be... wouldn't there be some purpose too to take along someone who was a lawyer in case you run into some uncertain Fourth Amendment situation?"
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,821.925,828.846,"I think that certainly be reasonable, although it's not contended that that was the case here in this case."
1998.97-1927,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,846.458,854.663,"Well, does it then all boil down to the value that the media provide to law enforcement when they go into the house."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,857.765,859.384,I think that's an important factor.
1998.97-1927,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,859.384,862.002,That's what we have to value against the privacy intrusion.
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,862.002,865.204,I think that... that is the one side of the balance in all of these cases.
1998.97-1927,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,872.025,888.154,Do you say here that the value of having media coverage of this particular execution of a search warrant outweighs the privacy interests of the ranchers who were searched?
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,888.154,888.954,"--Again, we think--"
1998.97-1927,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,888.954,889.937,Whose property was searched.
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,889.937,896.473,"--We think in the Hanlon case that's... that's correct, in particular because they were merely searching outbuildings and open areas."
1998.97-1927,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,901.377,912.602,"Well, let's... let's assume for the moment, since it hasn't been decided, that some of these outbuildings were within the curtilage and therefore the same rules would apply as... as to the home itself."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,919.023,927.112,--I think that there the fact... the fact of entering a residence is a... is obviously an important consideration.
1998.97-1927,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,933.698,952.227,"So, how... how do we weigh the balance where maybe there is in some broad sense a value to having public information about it but, on the other hand, is a very weighty interest on the part of the homeowner to have privacy within the home?"
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,952.227,952.627,--Yes.
1998.97-1927,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,952.627,954.279,We have valued that very highly.
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,954.279,954.796,That's correct.
1998.97-1927,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,954.796,957.464,"So, how do we weigh that balance in your view?"
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,957.464,969.356,"In our view, we would suggest that in any case where we're talking about execution of an arrest warrant, not involving a search that's going to be into private papers or personal effects, we can pretty much adopt a general rule--"
1998.97-1927,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,969.356,970.222,But inside the home.
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,970.222,970.808,--That's right.
1998.97-1927,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,976.794,979.061,"Well, but I... I didn't pose arrest warrant."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,987.65,995.189,"I think that it... it's fairly clear that as we proceed along a spectrum here, a search warrant in the home is more problematic than an arrest warrant."
1998.97-1927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1000.96,1006.045,"Mr. Cordray, could... could I pursue the value to law enforcement that... that having the media along is?"
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1006.045,1006.564,--Yes.
1998.97-1927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1006.564,1009.616,I... you say in assistance of law enforcement.
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1018.738,1020.055,That's certainly much of it.
1998.97-1927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1021.322,1023.757,What is it beyond that other than PR which--
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1023.757,1024.709,"--Well, the PR itself is very important."
1998.97-1927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1036.433,1043.087,"--Just photographing them going into the building saying these officers are, you know, going in and... and they're going to do a search."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1045.539,1047.039,"--No, not necessarily."
1998.97-1927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1050.274,1059.03,It seems to me the principal value you're appealing to is the value of making sure that... that law enforcement is conducted fairly and properly.
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1079.443,1081.628,"--They could do that, and certainly they could--"
1998.97-1927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1081.628,1084.497,It seems to me they ought to if that's the principal value of--
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1084.497,1086.366,"--Perhaps, but... but it's not a silly... it's not a silly point."
1998.97-1927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1097.488,1100.44,--My... my point is why don't you ask the homeowner if he wants that protection?
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1106.844,1109.496,They certainly could do that.
1998.97-1927,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1115.116,1124.222,"Well, I... I suppose too that some sort of photographic presence might uphold the validity of the search against complaints by the... the person who's being searched."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1124.222,1126.491,"--In fact, that was true in the Hanlon case here."
1998.97-1927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1126.491,1128.959,Are there no photographers other than those in the media?
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1131.645,1132.728,There are police photographers.
1998.97-1927,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1144.453,1151.475,I take it you're not arguing here that the photographers were brought along because there was no available police photographer.
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1151.475,1152.975,--We don't know that one way or another.
1998.97-1927,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1161.831,1185.529,"Mr. Cordray, as I'm listening to your argument and you keep saying no per se rules and it depends on what the particular facts and circumstances are, I have a certain deja vu feeling, and it relates to the old days when this Court was trying to draw a luggage line, telling the police they couldn't search the... the green suitcase but they could search the paper bag, and then finally they decided in Ross, no."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1205.258,1206.876,"Yes, Your Honor, I think there is."
1998.97-1927,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1255.773,1266.481,"Now, we also have an issue I guess in the Hanlon case concerning audiotapes that were made that... while the officers and the media were in the house."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1266.481,1267.365,Correct.
1998.97-1927,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1274.601,1278.722,Should we make any distinction between audiotapes and videotapes?
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1278.722,1296.0,"--I don't think so, Your Honor, but certainly audiotapes have been directly addressed by this Court in terms of the cases of people wearing a wire, White v. United States, Lopez, more recently Caceres, in which the Court has ultimately found there's not a constitutional problem when an individual is speaking to a government agent, even if they don't know that person to be a government agent."
1998.97-1927,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1305.19,1315.296,Your argument so far lays the groundwork for you to talk about the second question which is whether or not these principles were clearly established.
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1316.247,1316.68,--Sure.
1998.97-1927,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1336.475,1342.379,"Well, the Fourth Amendment doesn't talk specifically about wiretapping, but it certainly talks about houses and personal effects."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1342.379,1342.815,That's right.
1998.97-1927,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1356.305,1360.692,"Well, isn't there a distinction between going into somebody's home and... and wiretapping?"
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1366.846,1368.013,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1376.302,1381.19,Do you think we can charge the officers with knowledge of Semayne's Case or the principle in Semayne's Case?
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1381.19,1384.975,"Yes, although we've... we've indicated that Semayne's Case is quite distinguishable in our brief."
1998.97-1927,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1431.623,1432.739,They might have questioned how frequently it's done.
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1435.258,1436.691,"--Not only that, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1436.691,1439.042,"Well, you do rely on that heavily, do you not?"
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1439.042,1440.228,"We do, but the Fletcher case--"
1998.97-1927,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1440.228,1441.844,"Well, let me just ask you a question about the Marshals--"
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1441.844,1442.261,"--Yes, sir."
1998.97-1927,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1442.261,1446.963,--Can you point to me the part of the policy that makes it clear they could take people into the home?
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1449.248,1454.735,Page 7 of the joint appendix in the Wilson case contemplates that there may be occasion.
1998.97-1927,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1470.994,1481.719,"Well, I thought the sheriff, the Montgomery County Sheriff, in his deposition testified that permitting civilians to enter a home during the execution of a warrant wasn't permitted there."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1481.719,1484.588,--That was... that was his view and that may be his policy.
1998.97-1927,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1486.79,1490.158,"Well, that might have been clearly established at least in Montgomery County."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1490.158,1497.562,"--Well, I... I don't think so, given that... given that the case law at the time did not clearly establish it, and judges since have... have disagreed, you know."
1998.97-1927,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1509.703,1516.642,"Well, in Wilson v. Layne, the facts were... were pretty extreme in terms of an invasion of privacy in the home."
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1540.091,1542.091,I think certainly the Court would be concerned.
1998.97-1927,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1544.477,1553.232,"But you think we should have a clear rule that in executing an arrest warrant, you can take outsiders in who aren't there to help with the execution of the arrest warrant?"
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1553.232,1558.719,"I would tend to suggest a more fact-specific approach to these cases, but if the desire is to draw some bright lines, that may be one that could be."
1998.97-1927,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1559.269,1561.504,That might be a very easy clear line to draw.
1998.97-1927,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1561.504,1562.071,--It could be.
1998.97-1927,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1564.14,1565.506,"Very well, Mr. Cordray."
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,1567.825,1573.646,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1608.485,1621.293,"May I ask... suppose it had been clearly established that it was a common law tort to bring the media into a home, but there had been no decision on interpreting section 1983 or the Fourteenth Amendment."
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,1625.446,1626.13,"--No, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1633.7,1637.921,"Well, assume that... assume that we on the first time we... we decide yes, it's a clear violation."
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,1649.729,1655.197,"No, because the... the doctrine of qualified immunity would operate only as to the constitutional principles."
1998.97-1927,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1676.11,1684.866,Don't you think it's a clearly established constitutional principle that it is unreasonable to commit a tort in... in the course of the search?
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,1699.06,1699.76,"No, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1699.76,1702.544,Wouldn't that make the search automatically unreasonable?
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,1704.129,1706.148,Let me give an... an illustration.
1998.97-1927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1727.479,1734.983,"Well, supposing you... you have... during a search or an arrest an officer commits what's later decided to have been an assault and battery."
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,1741.571,1742.138,That's correct.
1998.97-1927,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1757.348,1766.37,There occurs to me an even better answer than that which is that the open fields doctrine explicitly says that you can commit a tort and not violate the Fourth Amendment.
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,1766.37,1772.841,"Well, Your Honor, in many cases the... the tort issue and the constitutional issue are going to overlap very closely."
1998.97-1927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1787.183,1787.8,That's true.
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,1802.21,1802.877,That's correct.
1998.97-1927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1802.877,1810.899,He knows a police officer normally has to get a warrant... normally... before he can go into that house in order to protect that privacy.
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,1843.62,1859.649,"Your Honor, the... the thinking of the officers in this case is that, of course, it is a serious proposition to enter someone's house without consent to make an arrest, but these officers had, matching that issue, valid arrest warrants which they knew gave them clear authority to enter the house."
1998.97-1927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1859.649,1866.985,It couldn't... it couldn't be more important to broadcast this than it is to do the search in the first place.
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,1869.504,1870.037,No.
1998.97-1927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1874.658,1878.777,Does the warrant refer to the... they have a right under the warrant to bring in the press?
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,1880.229,1880.662,--No.
1998.97-1927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1881.679,1885.014,In fact... if I may interrupt... doesn't the warrant say just the contrary?
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,1892.62,1893.953,"--Your Honor, that's correct."
1998.97-1927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1895.739,1896.139,Okay.
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,1915.735,1922.139,"These officers could believe that because at the time they operated, they were operating under the direction of the Marshals Service."
1998.97-1927,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1923.389,1927.876,"Well, but there was a Federal statute I believe in effect at the time."
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,1959.681,1967.018,"--If applicable at all, that statute would be applicable only to the Hanlon case which was a search warrant and not to the officers here who were executing an arrest warrant."
1998.97-1927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1967.018,1978.243,"Well, I suppose it isn't the fact that the statute limits the number of people who can serve the warrant, doesn't in so many words say that nobody else can come along."
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,1978.243,1978.859,That's correct.
1998.97-1927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1991.116,2001.341,"Well, if... if... if we take the word serve to mean those who may in fact be present, then I take it you're... you're out of luck."
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,2008.578,2020.22,"Well, Your Honor, I think a great deal of authority has... has come down to... for the proposition that non-law enforcement personnel may be present during the service of both search warrants and arrest warrants without--"
1998.97-1927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2020.22,2032.877,"So, you're arguing that cases from... from other States which... which may have condoned this in the past override the terms of your warrant in deciding what it is reasonable for your officers to do."
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,2033.729,2034.095,--No.
1998.97-1927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2038.531,2039.047,Right.
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,2039.047,2042.149,And peace officers in this case in fact did execute the warrant.
1998.97-1927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2045.185,2058.445,"Well, I... I... if... if we... if it is reasonable to read it as excluding others from participating in the execution of the warrant, then I take it by its terms your... your argument would be excluded."
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,2058.445,2078.424,"It would exclude on the substantive violation, but I don't think it would exclude the issue of clearly established right because it would still be the case that these officers armed with those warrants would be operating under a Marshals Service policy arranged at the direction of others whom they did not have a reason to question and regular on its face, that is, the media participation--"
1998.97-1927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2078.424,2082.71,Their argument basically is the Marshals Service told us we could do it?
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,2082.71,2083.661,--No.
1998.97-1927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2092.701,2104.659,"Well, but when... when you say ride-along, are you saying that it was a common law enforcement practice to bring the media into the house in the execution of an arrest warrant?"
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,2104.659,2108.21,--I... I think the existence of a number of cases where exactly that happened--
1998.97-1927,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2108.21,2114.681,"Well, but in Wilson v. Layne, we know what the Montgomery County Sheriff said, and he said it wasn't the policy."
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,2114.681,2140.582,"--That's true, and I think if anything, those statements by Sheriff Kight illustrate the predicament of these officers because what Sheriff Kight also said was as to this operation, he understood his own officers to be operating under Marshals Service guidelines which did permit this activity, and he himself would not condemn the conduct of his own officers at... at this time in 1992 because they were on loan to the Marshals Service and not operating under his own office's policies."
1998.97-1927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2140.582,2145.467,"Well, were they on loan in the sense that they were required to follow orders from the Marshals Service?"
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,2155.674,2161.928,"In fact, two of them were... were deputized for purposes... as deputy U.S. marshals for purposes of this operation."
1998.97-1927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2161.928,2164.197,"So, they were subject to line authority."
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,2164.197,2173.303,"The... the authority under that program was directed from Mr. Layne, from Deputy U.S. Marshal Layne, as the supervisor in... in this geographic area."
1998.97-1927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2173.303,2174.77,"Thank you, Mr. Fletcher-Hill."
1998.97-1927,1,34541,lawrence_r_fletcher_hill,,2174.77,2175.588,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2175.588,2178.124,"Mr. Rossbacher, we'll hear from you."
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2179.957,2181.076,"Rossbacher, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2181.076,2182.076,Mr. Rossbacher.
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2182.076,2184.444,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1927,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2233.358,2244.149,Is it your position that if the warrant does not specifically authorize people other than peace officers to serve it that no such person can be brought along?
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2244.149,2246.101,"That is in part our position, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2246.101,2261.278,"Even if it were, for instance, a search warrant in connection with a... a theft ring and the owner of the property was brought along to identify the goods or some expert in fingerprinting was brought along or something like that?"
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2261.278,2261.678,We are not--
1998.97-1927,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2261.678,2262.644,You say absolutely not.
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2262.644,2263.278,"--No, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2287.126,2287.678,"Well, but--"
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2287.678,2289.528,--had signed a contract--
1998.97-1927,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2289.528,2290.028,"--Just a minute, Mr.--"
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2290.028,2290.713,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2290.713,2299.217,"--In... in answer to my question, you say that a person such as Justice O'Connor described could be brought along."
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2299.217,2300.252,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2300.252,2304.438,And that it's not... not necessary to authorize it in the warrant.
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2304.438,2318.113,"The warrant authorizes, as we understand it under section 3105 and the Fourth Amendment, law enforcement to bring along pursuant to that explicit authorization, which we believe is a constitutional authorization, people who are necessary."
1998.97-1927,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2318.113,2322.149,"Well, the warrant doesn't say anything about... typically it doesn't."
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2348.467,2352.251,"Yes, Your Honor, because the warrant is issued in the context of section 3105 being--"
1998.97-1927,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2352.251,2356.588,How about the attorney in the Hanlon case who went along?
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2356.588,2358.857,--We do not believe the attorney was authorized.
1998.97-1927,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2366.844,2369.696,"You say authorize, Mr. Rossbacher."
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2376.402,2376.919,--Either.
1998.97-1927,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2395.28,2400.184,"But if he had been there to perform a law enforcement function, it would have been all right?"
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2400.184,2405.653,If he had been designated as necessary by the executing agent under 3105--
1998.97-1927,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2405.653,2406.838,"Well, now, where... where does all that come from?"
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2410.79,2411.457,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2432.037,2442.194,"What about the law students in... in the clinic, in the law school clinic, as part of their educational program are riding along with the police, going in with the police wherever they go?"
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2442.194,2446.296,"I'm not aware, Your Honor, that they do go in with police wherever they go."

1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2467.21,2473.964,--They cannot enter pursuant to a search warrant or an arrest warrant into private property where the warrant is necessary.
1998.97-1927,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2480.951,2484.755,I'm giving you an example of a person who isn't there to identify anything.
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2492.675,2493.375,We believe that's--
1998.97-1927,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2493.375,2497.313,"And so, I'd like to know... he's in the squad car, such a person."
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2507.851,2509.386,--Presumably he can leave the car.
1998.97-1927,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2514.172,2517.157,Just a slight variation on Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical.
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2530.4,2531.986,"Not if they're just watching, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2534.419,2536.704,"No, they're not there... they're there just for training purposes."
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2536.704,2537.321,--Then it is our view--
1998.97-1927,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2537.321,2543.794,"So, the police have no way to train their... train their new recruits, their... their rookies."
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2543.794,2550.197,"--Not on private property, Your Honor, not in violation of the privacy rights and the core values protected by the Fourth Amendment."
1998.97-1927,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2550.197,2552.43,"Now, you say private property."
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2556.684,2558.334,"Your Honor, there was no--"
1998.97-1927,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2558.334,2559.469,Armed with a warrant.
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2572.377,2573.144,"--We believe so, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2573.144,2575.079,And what do you rely on for that?
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2581.05,2582.252,"I know you do, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2624.579,2643.29,"Well, I think the balance may well be different within a home or within closed structures in the curtilage than it is in open areas where presumably anyone, the mailman or anybody else, can drive up to the ranch house but can't enter the house."
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2643.29,2660.852,"Your Honor, there is a problem with that and that is that in this case, CNN asserts that it has an absolute defense to charges against trespass, charges against any kind of tortious conduct because of the permission given by law enforcement to enter."
1998.97-1927,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2664.387,2666.489,But we don't have that question before us.
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2666.489,2673.678,"No, but it... it is problematical in that what law enforcement is doing here is, in fact, facilitating a tort explicitly."
1998.97-1927,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2702.012,2710.034,The... the problem with that in your case is the open fields doctrine might mean that the rules here are not so well established.
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2710.034,2711.934,"Your Honor, let us look--"
1998.97-1927,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2711.934,2712.969,It's a murky doctrine.
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2712.969,2715.505,--But let us look at what happened here.
1998.97-1927,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2726.327,2727.479,The Ninth Circuit--
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2732.883,2734.817,There was no factual finding of consent.
1998.97-1927,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2736.669,2738.704,The court of appeals said there was consent.
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2740.571,2740.937,--I understand.
1998.97-1927,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2740.937,2741.989,--we're not interested.
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2741.989,2755.73,"Even if there was consent, the position is that they could not bring in the press with a microphone to seize conversations protected by Silverman and these cases and Katz in the house, which is what was done."
1998.97-1927,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2774.425,2783.113,"Do you agree, Mr. Rossbacher, that the agents did not search when they were in... when they were in the home?"
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2783.113,2783.797,No.
1998.97-1927,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2794.005,2798.223,"Well, apart from... apart from the recording, is it your--"
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2798.223,2798.973,We believe that there--

1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2801.242,2803.277,"--Your Honor, they entered the house and observed what was there."
1998.97-1927,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2803.277,2805.896,"Well, I mean, I... I have a lot of people come into my house."
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2808.613,2815.585,"Your Honor, when they say that they're entering pursuant to a search warrant and they assert their absolute right to do that, when they enter--"
1998.97-1927,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2815.585,2817.787,That... that's out of the case as the Chief Justice has said.
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2818.687,2819.271,--I understand.
1998.97-1927,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2819.271,2821.322,--that they entered pursuant to consent.
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2825.374,2826.642,"We believe so, Your Honor, yes."
1998.97-1927,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2826.642,2830.178,In... in any respect other than making the recording?
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2830.178,2832.796,"They went through the rooms, yes."
1998.97-1927,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2832.796,2834.663,I didn't ask whether they went through the rooms.
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2836.332,2837.398,"They did not tear the place apart, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2838.534,2839.367,They didn't search.
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2839.367,2852.258,"--I don't believe, Your Honor, it's fair to say that when a law enforcement officer enters your house pursuant to a search warrant and a claim of right, that in fact he's not searching when he observes what he observes there and was free to testify about it."
1998.97-1927,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2852.258,2866.267,"If it was a search, does your position imply that... suppose they had found something in the house... that that evidence would have to be suppressed?"
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2866.267,2873.421,"Absolutely, Your Honor, that in fact, under Bumpers and under Schneckloth, in fact, having asserted on the--"
1998.97-1927,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2873.421,2879.258,My assumption is that it would have been all warranted because they did have a warrant.
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2879.258,2880.525,--The warrant excluded--
1998.97-1927,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2880.525,2892.835,"Were it not for the media... so, in other words, I'm giving you a situation where the police had just gone in on their own, executed the warrant, they would have... they would have done everything according to law."
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2912.629,2919.069,"--If the media seized it, as they did with the recordings, we believe it is like the extra mikes installed in the house."
1998.97-1927,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2919.069,2919.385,Not the media.
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2920.535,2921.485,The police seized--
1998.97-1927,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2921.485,2925.973,--but they did it in the presence of the photographers who got it all live for CNN.
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2925.973,2935.079,"--We think it makes the search unreasonable, but we're not sure that it triggers the exclusionary rule because in fact what would be found would be found properly by the officers."
1998.97-1927,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2940.149,2943.934,"So, you're... so, you're now giving me a different answer than the one you gave me initially."
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2944.484,2945.636,"I hope not, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2945.636,2952.623,"--Well, you told me I thought initially... or maybe I didn't phrase the question so that you were able to answer it precisely."
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,2966.966,2972.37,"Captured on the press camera, the press tape we believe would be... would be suppressed."
1998.97-1927,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2992.681,2997.419,But the evidence found by the police might fall within the inevitable discovery exception.
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,3000.954,3001.571,"--It might well, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3012.995,3013.445,"Well, no."
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,3022.018,3027.254,"--We don't think that that per se triggers the exclusionary rule, but we think that it is a general warrant."

1998.97-1927,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3147.183,3148.85,--in a search warrant?
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,3148.85,3164.745,"And I think that... that to bring in... to expressly authorize private persons for their... for their private purposes, even as has been held by the Bills I court in the circuit to be inappropriate and constitutionally questionable; in addition, in the Sanusi case, by Judge Weinstein."
1998.97-1927,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3204.287,3211.31,"Your complaint is that they didn't actually concentrate on the... what the officers were doing, but simply conducted their own search?"
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,3211.31,3212.81,That is one of our complaints.
1998.97-1927,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3238.043,3240.01,"Well, you wouldn't... you wouldn't say that would be okay either, would you?"

1998.97-1927,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3247.666,3250.185,"But even if it were, your argument is exactly the same."
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,3250.185,3250.985,That's correct.
1998.97-1927,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3281.537,3287.708,I'm not sure 3105 really speaks to the issue because it talks about search warrants and it tells who's authorized to serve the search warrant.
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,3289.56,3302.551,But the cases in Schwimmer the... the circuit court decisions in Schwimmer and Clouston and the other cases that interpret it that are present in our brief do talk about the fact that the only justification for being along is because you're complying with 3105.

1998.97-1927,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3306.355,3308.889,You can argue as to the clearly established point.
1998.97-1927,2,27915,henry_h_rossbacher,,3308.889,3313.108,"--Well, that's what I am arguing and I also think the statute clearly established it itself."

1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,3693.104,3693.573,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3695.056,3699.108,Does the fact that they didn't even mention the Fourth Amendment help you or hurt you?
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,3699.108,3707.631,"--Well, it may be a... it may be a criticism of the lawyers in those cases for not raising it, but it doesn't show that the court squarely considered and decided the issue against us."
1998.97-1927,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3707.631,3709.599,Do you want to add anything in respect to the common sense bit?
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,3738.185,3742.07,"Well, Your Honor, I guess we don't agree the U.S. Marshals Service policy says it's okay."
1998.97-1927,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3773.275,3776.81,"--Mr. Willard, what about the law professor and her students?"
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,3776.81,3778.043,"I understand, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3787.016,3788.118,They're going along simply as a learning experience.
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,3789.368,3791.487,"--If that's all, then they wouldn't be allowed to do it."
1998.97-1927,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3828.943,3831.028,They didn't have any law students in 1603.
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,3831.562,3840.968,"--I understand, Your Honor, but it would have been... it would have been repugnant to the common law in 1603 and to the Framers at the time the Fourth Amendment was adopted."
1998.97-1927,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3840.968,3845.955,"Yes, but it's hardly hypothetical as of the 1970's, 1980's, and 1990's."
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,3848.157,3858.762,"That's correct, Your Honor, and our position would be unless they're... they're authorized, as they might be, to provide legal advice and assistance to the police officers, they wouldn't be allowed to go into private homes without the consent of the residents."
1998.97-1927,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3858.762,3863.666,What Justice Breyer and Justice O'Connor are asking is also what... what concerns me.
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,3880.711,3888.799,"Your Honor, the record... the record in this case does not establish that it was clearly understood in the law enforcement community it was okay."
1998.97-1927,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3897.154,3899.089,"Well, but you're putting the burden on the wrong side."
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,3922.872,3925.424,"Your Honor, I don't agree."
1998.97-1927,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3959.747,3986.045,"But the... I think the difficulty I have with your argument is that I think you will concede... I'm going to ask you in a second, but I think you will concede that there is... that there was at no time relevant here a clearly established line that no one but law... law enforcement authority in the strict, deputized, sworn sense of the word could come in to exercise... in the exercise of the warrant."
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,4008.494,4011.53,"Yes, Your Honor, and there were cases establishing that that was appropriate."
1998.97-1927,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4011.53,4034.211,"So, we... we can't start then, even if we accept your view of how the... the privilege... the burden on who has to establish what clearly... even if we accept your view on that, we can't start with the simple bright line that there was a clearly established principle that nobody but sworn law... law enforcement officers could go in."
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,4037.263,4039.782,"Well, Your Honor, I guess I don't agree that it's a murky line."
1998.97-1927,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4062.462,4062.945,But the--
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,4062.945,4063.78,They're not like the translator.
1998.97-1927,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4064.78,4083.894,"--That... that depends very much on an interpretation of section 35 which is... 05 which is perfectly permissible, but by no means the only one, that when it says how such a warrant should be served, that defines the number of... that defines the maximum number of people who may accompany the officer."
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,4087.18,4089.882,"Well, Your Honor, but that's not all we rely upon."
1998.97-1927,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4097.368,4104.991,"Well, they were committing a trespass unless they fall within this concept of being in aid."
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,4153.888,4157.006,"Yes, Your Honor, that is the nub of the problem."
1998.97-1927,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4185.593,4189.228,I'm still wondering about your answer to Justice Scalia.
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,4212.344,4228.455,"Well, Your Honor, going all the way back to the Entick case, which we cite in our brief, where Lord Camden explained that when you're entering into the home because of the high degree of protection even at the common law the home had, that it's not enough to have the silence of the books."
1998.97-1927,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4244.382,4247.184,Is the answer to this question no?
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,4261.843,4262.876,As a matter of fact we could.
1998.97-1927,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4272.651,4272.851,"No, no."
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,4281.923,4282.823,"No, Your Honor, we don't."
1998.97-1927,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4312.276,4319.18,Although... although he also knows that he can trespass in the open fields without violating the First Amendment I suppose.
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,4319.18,4324.934,"That's correct, Your Honor, because the Fourth Amendment has been held by this Court to protect houses and not open fields."
1998.97-1927,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4332.123,4336.392,Can I ask you about your interpretation of section 3105?
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,4373.35,4375.367,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4375.367,4384.388,"And it's your position that the mention of execution towards the end of that provision indicates that when they're talking about serving a warrant, they mean serving and executing."
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,4384.388,4385.24,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4399.917,4407.171,"It wouldn't do too much if it just specified who can deliver the warrant to the... or, I mean, you know."
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,4414.927,4416.86,"That... that... that's correct, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4422.846,4441.244,"Mr. Willard, what... what if the warrant says, so A, B, C, D, and E, F shall serve the warrant and accompany, and then a fourth law enforcement officer they decide to take along at the last minute because they hear there's some sort of a rumble out at the place where they're going to serve."
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,4442.944,4452.016,I think the law has established that would be implicitly authorized by the warrant even though he's not named by name if he's there to assist them to deal with possible violence or something like that.
1998.97-1927,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4488.373,4492.51,But a private purpose that... that helped the police or the police thought helped the police.
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,4492.51,4494.629,"Well, but only in this most nebulous sense."
1998.97-1927,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4505.15,4508.852,"But especially if we're in doubt, it's very close."
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,4512.606,4513.54,"No, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4513.54,4515.142,Can we distinguish this from the other?
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,4515.142,4519.844,"No, Your Honor, because what we're talking about here is media access at the sufferance of the police."
1998.97-1927,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4527.433,4528.05,--only thinking of--
1998.97-1927,3,40682,richard_k_willard,,4528.05,4529.466,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1998.97-1927,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4529.466,4530.902,"--Thank you, Mr. Willard."
1998.97-1927,4,38933,richard_a_cordray,,4533.337,4544.727,"First, Your Honors, on the qualified immunity issue, the fact that there's a regular practice that's occurred frequently around the country, the silence of the books there has to weigh in favor of qualified immunity."
1998.97-1927,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4562.104,4570.693,How do we know that... that not just ride-alongs but entering with the execution of a warrant was engaged in frequently?
1998.97-1927,4,38933,richard_a_cordray,,4572.545,4573.295,We speak to that.
1998.97-1927,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4593.975,4594.91,What did they base it on?
1998.97-1927,4,38933,richard_a_cordray,,4596.66,4597.027,There was.
1998.97-1927,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4599.362,4609.837,But I'm not sure of the relevance of that because there have been instances of police who have been doing things that... pursuant to clear policy where the policy was clearly unconstitutional.
1998.97-1927,4,38933,richard_a_cordray,,4609.837,4610.62,That's true.
1998.97-1927,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4610.62,4616.408,"So... so, are we supposed to give any weight to the fact that... that there's some book in which somebody has an interpretation--"
1998.97-1927,4,38933,richard_a_cordray,,4616.408,4617.191,"No, but when the--"
1998.97-1927,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4617.191,4617.774,--or even practice?
1998.97-1927,4,38933,richard_a_cordray,,4617.774,4624.68,"--When the practice is fairly widely engaged in, which is what was found in those cases, and it has not been ruled unconstitutional, it's very difficult to say officers should have known."
1998.97-1927,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4625.68,4626.163,Can we say--
1998.97-1927,4,38933,richard_a_cordray,,4626.163,4628.315,--the Moncrief case was a Fourth Amendment case specifically.
1998.97-1927,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4628.315,4636.237,--Can we say it is widely engaged in in execution of warrants as distinct from visiting crime scenes?
1998.97-1927,4,38933,richard_a_cordray,,4653.414,4657.168,As demonstrated by the Marshals Service and Justice Department policies in place at the time.
1998.97-1927,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4657.168,4658.001,No.
1998.97-1927,4,38933,richard_a_cordray,,4660.603,4661.037,Yes.
1998.97-1927,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4661.037,4664.155,Do they go beyond crime scenes to execution of warrants?
1998.97-1927,4,38933,richard_a_cordray,,4664.155,4667.94,They talk generally about a variety of circumstances where there had been a crime committed.
1998.97-1927,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4670.375,4670.892,"No, no, no."
1998.97-1927,4,38933,richard_a_cordray,,4675.946,4679.981,--They don't... they don't address that specific... I would think a warrantless situation might be more problematic.
1998.97-1927,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4688.104,4691.639,"--Well, you... you make that argument and you say it's a marginal intrusion."
1998.97-1927,4,38933,richard_a_cordray,,4702.114,4705.716,"It would be factors that would weigh in balancing the reasonableness is all, Your Honor."
