1996.96-842,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.748,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-842, United States v. James Herman O'Hagan."
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,9.857,12.77,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-842,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,110.774,113.474,"Mr. Dreeben, just by misappropriating?"
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,132.809,135.181,He would not have deceived his employer.
1996.96-842,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,140.043,143.315,And you say he would still have breached the securities laws.
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,143.315,145.906,"No, I do not think he would have breached the securities laws."
1996.96-842,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,145.906,146.247,So that's the line.
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,148.517,156.963,"That's absolutely correct, and the reason why that is significant is that section 10(b) prohibits deceptive devices and contrivances."
1996.96-842,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,190.545,202.073,"Well, Mr. Dreeben, then if someone stole the lawyer's briefcase and discovered the information and traded on it, no violation?"
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,202.073,203.645,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1996.96-842,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,203.645,226.789,"And if a partner perhaps in the law firm, the lawyer let his daughter know about the planned merger inadvertently and the daughter relied on the information and bought stock options, violation?"
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,229.992,250.045,"Correct, Justice O'Connor, and the answer to that is probably not, although there has been litigation about whether in particular circumstances a family relationship is sufficiently imbued with a business context that there is a duty that runs to it, but I accept the general thrust of your hypotheticals."
1996.96-842,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,266.675,280.603,"Well, Mr. Dreeben, where is... the thing that bothers me about the case here is, where is the connection between the deceptive device and the purchase or sale of a security?"
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,280.603,292.173,"--The connection, Chief Justice Rehnquist, lies in the fact that the misappropriation does not occur until the lawyer uses the information as the basis for his trades."
1996.96-842,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,302.109,306.282,But he didn't deceive anyone who sold him securities.
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,306.282,307.15,That is true.
1996.96-842,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,330.108,335.103,But you think of fraud being practiced on a person who is damaged by it.
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,335.103,348.671,"--I think that under the common law view of fraud, Chief Justice Rehnquist, that is an accurate statement, but the securities laws are not framed to pick up only those violations that are covered by common law fraud."
1996.96-842,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,379.552,383.575,"That's rather unusual, for a criminal statute to be that open-ended, isn't it?"
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,383.575,389.369,--I don't think that it's unusual to give the text of this statute its natural reading.
1996.96-842,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,409.762,418.227,What if Grand Met had its own strategy to purchase shares for some reason to make the price go up temporarily?
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,431.628,432.777,That--
1996.96-842,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,432.777,434.77,Would there be a misappropriation there?
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,434.77,435.511,"--Yes, there would."
1996.96-842,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,454.141,461.358,"But in the hypothetical you and I are discussing, if he came clean with the law firm and the whole law firm was doing it, then no violation?"
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,461.358,465.699,"--If he didn't deceive anyone by doing this, he would not--"
1996.96-842,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,465.699,466.42,What if he didn't tell the client.
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,466.42,469.274,"--Well, then the client would be deceived."
1996.96-842,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,505.726,521.618,"Well, I'm not so sure I agree with you on that point, at least as to the... the Wall Street Journal in Carpenter was said to have a property interest in the confidentiality, or in the use of the notes for the column."
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,524.88,529.412,"Well, the property interest here is exactly the same as it was in Carpenter."
1996.96-842,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,558.321,559.532,Mr.... I'm sorry.
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,560.524,567.979,"--So the deceptive conduct here is, in essence, indistinguishable from the deceptive conduct that the Court found in the Carpenter case."
1996.96-842,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,567.979,576.074,Do you take the position that every relationship of trust also implies the duty to disclose if the trust is to be breached?
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,576.074,579.388,"I don't, Justice Souter."
1996.96-842,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,580.199,583.587,"How do we know this is such a case and the others are not, then?"
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,583.587,595.047,"--Well, this is such a case because it involves a relationship right at the core of what has been defined as the principal agent-fiduciary trustee relationship."
1996.96-842,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,595.047,621.244,"Well, but so does a... I suppose a lawyer in a trust relationship with his client in the handling of funds, and yet if a lawyer... I presume that if a lawyer disclosed to his client that he was going to commingle, or he was going to borrow, as it were, the client's funds for personal reasons, that that would not be a defense either to a professional or a statutory charge against him."
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,634.202,634.853,The--
1996.96-842,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,634.853,636.482,--and the one would be a defense and the other wouldn't.
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,636.482,647.321,"--Justice Souter, the reason why it makes a difference is that the disclosure obligation is a prerequisite to obtaining the consent of the principal or the owner of the trust."
1996.96-842,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,647.321,649.902,But I thought... maybe I misunderstood your answer earlier.
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,662.141,669.584,"To satisfy the common law rule that a trustee may not use the property that's been entrusted with him, there would have to be consent."
1996.96-842,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,675.518,679.802,I thought that was what you answered Justice Scalia when he asked the question.
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,680.393,680.712,That's correct.
1996.96-842,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,680.712,684.915,And... but there would be in that case other sanctions immediately.
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,684.915,685.456,That's correct.
1996.96-842,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,685.456,693.611,"If you told the law firm, look, I'm going to do this, the law firm isn't going to consent but it's not likely he'll retain his job, and there might be other sanctions."
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,693.611,694.011,That's correct.
1996.96-842,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,694.863,696.002,In that case it's not 10(b)5.
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,696.002,696.833,--It's not 10(b)5.
1996.96-842,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,725.551,741.613,"There's one thing that I'm still not clear on, and that is, what is it that is peculiar about some breaches of trust, or some obligations of trust, that raise the disclosure obligation whereas others do not have a disclosure obligation that would at all be relevant?"
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,741.613,750.078,"The answer, Justice Souter, is that there are some things that a trustee cannot do even if he does disclose them."
1996.96-842,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,760.726,766.069,You rely on disclosure as just a reverse mechanism for defining deception.
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,766.069,767.379,Correct.
1996.96-842,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,793.117,799.161,If you read a horn-book on tort law does it say that the essence of deception is nondisclosure?
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,801.091,828.009,"I'm not asking the Court to do anything more than to reaffirm the basic principle that it adopted in Carpenter v. United States that an agent who misappropriates his principal's property by posing as a loyal employee when in fact he's reaping personal gain with that property has committed a form of deception, indeed, a form of fraud, and that fraud satisfies both the mail fraud statute and it satisfies section 10(b)."
1996.96-842,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,828.009,830.373,"May I ask you one question, Mr. Dreeben?"
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,844.341,848.815,"No, I think there is a duty to disclose to the client as well."
1996.96-842,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,852.886,861.061,"But supposing in this case he had disclosed to his partner, and his partner had just kept the information to himself, and then he had gone... the defendant had gone ahead with his trading."
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,862.603,867.265,"Yes, there would, but we would not have been able to charge it the same way as we charged this case."
1996.96-842,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,867.265,867.575,I see.
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,869.697,870.508,That's correct.
1996.96-842,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,890.31,891.301,Mr. Dreeben--
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,907.831,914.937,"Yes, and I say that there is an omission by the failure to disclose in exactly the same way as there was in Carpenter."
1996.96-842,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,953.031,955.034,"Well, any, any fraud is deception, then."
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,970.843,973.494,"--And the Court... yes, Justice Scalia, and the Court said--"
1996.96-842,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,973.494,978.078,What if I appropriate some of my client's money in order to buy stock?
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,978.078,981.77,--The fact--
1996.96-842,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,981.77,983.222,Have I violated the securities laws?
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,983.222,985.693,--I do not think that you have.
1996.96-842,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,985.693,986.354,Why not?
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,991.897,999.422,"It's not just as much as this one is, because in this case it is the use of the information that enables the profits, pure and simple."
1996.96-842,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1002.313,1003.054,Same here.
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1007.148,1007.749,--The difference--
1996.96-842,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1007.749,1011.439,And I got the money posing as an honest lawyer.
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1011.439,1014.961,"--The difference, Justice Scalia, is that once you have the money you can do anything you want with it."
1996.96-842,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1034.336,1042.8,Why isn't the client entrusted just as totally when he entrusts money as when he entrusts information?
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1044.751,1045.472,"He does, Justice Souter."
1996.96-842,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1045.472,1046.002,--the same as Justice Scalia's.
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1066.326,1070.23,"I perhaps was not clear in answering Justice Scalia, Justice Souter."
1996.96-842,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1097.055,1100.477,So that every breach does give rise to a duty to disclose.
1996.96-842,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1100.477,1108.852,Every breach that involves the misuse of information entrusted to a person or the misuse of property entrusted to a person--
1996.96-842,1,30274,john_d_french,,1769.118,1778.344,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1901.355,1916.704,"Mr. French, I gather you're trying to convince us that the doctrine would apply even if all the relevant information were in the public domain, and I'm assuming that we have a case that the jury found the relevant information was not in the public domain."
1996.96-842,1,30274,john_d_french,,1916.704,1950.725,"What I'm suggesting is that if a theory can be applied to result in a conviction of Mr. O'Hagan on the basis of facts which very clearly in the record indicated that he placed all of his orders for Pillsbury options before August 26, and the Government only indicts him, as the prosecutor says, for trades made from August 26 on, then the theory is grotesque."
1996.96-842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1952.498,1959.812,"The reason it's grotesque, as I understand your presentation, is because the relevant information was in the public domain at the time he made his purchases."
1996.96-842,1,30274,john_d_french,,1959.812,1973.84,"--The relevant information was in the public domain and, as Your Honor knows, you may only be convicted, even under the Government's theory, if you trade on the basis of."
1996.96-842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1973.84,1989.801,"Right, but I would like to try and address the question of what we do with a case in which the facts are the way the Government presents them and the way presumably the jury thought they were, namely that your client acted entirely on the basis of inside information that was not in the public domain."
1996.96-842,1,30274,john_d_french,,1989.801,1990.453,That's--
1996.96-842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1990.453,2004.41,"And in that connection I'd be curious to know your view on whether, if it was... instead of your client, if it had been the partner who was in charge of the matter within the firm who had done this, would you say he would also be... would he be covered or not, in your view?"
1996.96-842,1,30274,john_d_french,,2004.41,2013.978,"--In my view, we are dealing here with a statute that involves, as Mr. Dreeben said, disclosure."
1996.96-842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2042.736,2051.272,"Well, I'm... my question is, what if he had been the partner in charge of the matter within the firm, and had acted entirely on the basis of nonpublic information."
1996.96-842,1,30274,john_d_french,,2054.393,2059.417,"In my view, according to the Government's theory, the statute would apply."
1996.96-842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2063.29,2068.522,Even if this man were the only lawyer working on the matter in the firm for the client.
1996.96-842,1,30274,john_d_french,,2068.522,2069.864,--That's correct.
1996.96-842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2069.864,2072.835,And had a clear duty to his client not to disclose.
1996.96-842,1,30274,john_d_french,,2072.835,2074.034,"That's correct, Justice Stevens."
1996.96-842,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2076.068,2085.803,"But Mr. French, you would give a different answer, would you not, if the lawyer were in the firm that was assisting Pillsbury in this matter?"
1996.96-842,1,30274,john_d_french,,2085.803,2087.235,"--I certainly would, Your Honor."
1996.96-842,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2087.235,2107.379,"You have two lawyers, both with the same information, but one is working for the target company and the other is working for the potential takeover company, and you would distinguish those two cases."
1996.96-842,1,30274,john_d_french,,2120.007,2121.726,"I wouldn't be here today, Your Honor."
1996.96-842,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3627.575,3630.416,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.96-842,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3668.003,3691.147,"Mr. Dreeben, I hate to use up any of your short time, but there's a new point which came out in oral argument here which I don't recall in the briefs, and I want to know what your response to it is, and that is, assuming that 14(e), as I think is true, does allow this agency to make unlawful things that the statute itself does not, has it purported to do that in its regulation?"
1996.96-842,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3691.147,3692.459,Justice Scalia--
1996.96-842,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3692.459,3714.642,"And if it has not purported to do that, has not purported by that regulation to prescribe means reasonably designed, but rather in its regulation simply redefines what constitutes fraud or deception, then is that an exercise of the power that's given by that second sentence of 14(e)?"
1996.96-842,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3714.642,3716.152,"--I think that it is, Justice Scalia."
1996.96-842,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3718.375,3718.976,Yes.
1996.96-842,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3718.976,3743.932,"The ultimate question is whether the SEC's prohibition on trading, which is clearly described in the rule, is within its statutory authority which is a question for the court, and the court may determine that the SEC's prohibition does satisfy the statute based on either the defining prong or the means reasonably designed to prevent, and it's analysis of the reasons that are given."
1996.96-842,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3747.675,3748.606,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
