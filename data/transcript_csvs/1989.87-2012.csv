1989.87-2012,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,18.494,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in Number 87-2012, FW/PBS v. City of Dallas; 87-2051, M. J. R. v. City of Dallas; and 88-49, Calvin Berry v. the City of Dallas."
1989.87-2012,0,33573,john_h_weston,,20.136,23.925,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.87-2012,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,199.161,201.895,Would you accept a grudging rejection?
1989.87-2012,0,33573,john_h_weston,,201.895,210.919,"--If I can't get a resounding rejection I would accept a grudging one, Justice Scalia, as long as it is unequivocal."
1989.87-2012,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,221.868,225.879,"Well, these... these people are not, strictly speaking, engaged in speech."
1989.87-2012,0,33573,john_h_weston,,227.0,230.874,"--Well, I think that's... that's true, Your Honor."
1989.87-2012,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,251.19,261.135,"No, I am not suggesting the... the exchange of something for the performance makes it anything less than speech, but these... these people are engaged in a commercial business."
1989.87-2012,0,33573,john_h_weston,,269.459,270.4,"--Well, of course, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.87-2012,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,283.259,286.201,"--Well, why... why is it a prior restraint?"
1989.87-2012,0,33573,john_h_weston,,286.201,289.714,Because without the license one may not engage in the speech.
1989.87-2012,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,314.41,317.803,"So requiring a permit for a parade, then, is a prior restraint?"
1989.87-2012,0,33573,john_h_weston,,317.803,322.195,"Is a classical prior restraint, although it may be an adequate and a valid prior restraint."
1989.87-2012,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,353.748,365.976,"And you take the position that commercial sales of sexually explicit speech are entitled to exactly the same protection as, for example, a political rally."
1989.87-2012,0,33573,john_h_weston,,365.976,375.794,"We take the position that there is no justification, Justice O'Connor, for creating any sort of hierarchy for speech under our constitutional framework."
1989.87-2012,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,399.972,400.844,"Well, how about commercial speech."
1989.87-2012,0,33573,john_h_weston,,404.066,407.019,"--Well, the Court obviously has wrestled with the question of--"
1989.87-2012,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,407.019,411.272,Do you think our cases would support the position that they are entitled to the same protection?
1989.87-2012,0,33573,john_h_weston,,411.272,411.853,"--No, I think that--"
1989.87-2012,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,411.853,412.784,"Well, then there is some hierarchy."
1989.87-2012,0,33573,john_h_weston,,412.784,412.994,--No.
1989.87-2012,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,420.781,422.711,Is this at least commercial speech?
1989.87-2012,0,33573,john_h_weston,,422.711,431.189,"--No, Your Honor, this would not qualify as commercial speech any more than the sale of a book, the sale of a newspaper, the sale of a ticket to a lock concert or whatever."
1989.87-2012,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,462.453,463.862,What about obscene speech?
1989.87-2012,0,33573,john_h_weston,,465.294,476.091,"Well, we know, Justice Scalia, that at least up until the present a continuing majority of this Court has held that obscene speech is simply expression, but not speech in the First Amendment sense."
1989.87-2012,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,476.091,478.224,"Well, you can call it not speech, but it's speech, isn't it?"
1989.87-2012,0,33573,john_h_weston,,478.224,480.305,"Well, with all respect--"
1989.87-2012,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,480.305,481.516,"I mean, let's not play games."
1989.87-2012,0,33573,john_h_weston,,487.94,498.268,"--Again, not wishing to play games at all, but this Court's decisions have made clear that, for purposes of the First Amendment, obscenity is not speech."
1989.87-2012,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.188,536.775,"Well, but if we can say that there is a separate category of speech which is not speech, as we have done in obscenity, I suppose we could say there is a separate category of speech which is only partly protected speech, as we have already done in commercial speech."
1989.87-2012,0,33573,john_h_weston,,536.775,537.616,"--Well, again--"
1989.87-2012,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,537.616,542.121,"And indeed haven't we done that with respect to pornography, something just short of obscenity."
1989.87-2012,0,33573,john_h_weston,,546.254,549.346,"--But not on the basis... well, obviously."
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,1832.05,1841.477,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.87-2012,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1935.604,1946.693,Didn't those studies have to do with the problems arising from the concentration of such businesses?
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,1946.693,1960.562,"The studies looked at both areas, where there were concentrations of those types of businesses, and they looked at areas where maybe there was only one located, and I refer especially to the study from the City of Austin which looked at both--"
1989.87-2012,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1960.562,1971.097,I thought the studies basically... address... addressed the concentration or the location of the in neighborhoods or adjacent to schools.
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,1988.621,1988.921,--That is correct.
1989.87-2012,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1996.859,1998.779,That is not at issue here.
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2003.243,2004.255,"--Yes, but we do have--"
1989.87-2012,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2004.255,2016.031,Did the studies have to do with the effect of letting someone who has been previously convicted of any of these offenses go into business again?
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2016.031,2017.633,"--No, the studies did not address that, only--"
1989.87-2012,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2017.633,2020.695,"I mean, they really supported the zoning aspects, didn't they?"
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2020.695,2022.426,--They were--
1989.87-2012,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2022.426,2024.219,Not the licensing aspects?
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2024.219,2025.21,--Yes.
1989.87-2012,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2099.471,2104.834,Are you raising any question of standing here at all to attack that particular position?
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2104.834,2108.277,--We did not raise the question of standing at this level.
1989.87-2012,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2117.204,2120.158,Do you think there is standing here?
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2120.158,2130.833,I believe that there are one or two of the Petitioners that have had their licenses denied based on criminal conviction.
1989.87-2012,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2138.477,2139.539,"Before you leave that, would you refresh my recollection."
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2151.697,2152.558,"--No, just the licensee."
1989.87-2012,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2152.558,2153.249,Just the licensee.
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2153.249,2154.6,"Yes, the person operating--"
1989.87-2012,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2154.6,2160.323,"Well... well, the spouse of the licensee can be convicted of one of these crimes and that disqualifies the licensee, does it not?"
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2160.323,2161.575,"--Yes, it does."
1989.87-2012,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2164.918,2165.689,One other point.
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2175.705,2176.376,"--Yes, it is."
1989.87-2012,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2193.5,2197.691,Could you... I... I... I didn't quite realize what Justice Kennedy just pointed out.
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2212.28,2212.43,--No.
1989.87-2012,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2239.078,2243.513,The person has to have been operating a business at the time of the conviction.
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2254.148,2258.842,Then Mr. X would not be able to obtain a sexually oriented business license.
1989.87-2012,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2267.998,2273.074,"And what if they were not married, if he just lived with Ms. X and she was convicted?"
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2273.074,2276.597,You have hit on the basis for that provision being in the ordinance.
1989.87-2012,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2282.003,2282.591,"Well, say it's not a common law marriage."
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2287.526,2288.127,--That is correct.
1989.87-2012,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2288.127,2289.95,How... how can you justify that?
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2289.95,2298.995,"As I said, the... the base for including that provision in the ordinance is the prevalence of common law marriages in Texas."
1989.87-2012,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2310.243,2313.385,Or couldn't one say it is wholly arbitrary if you have those facts.
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2319.51,2319.94,"--No, it is not."
1989.87-2012,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2319.94,2324.644,"So to that extent you are conceding, I think, the ordinance is over broad."
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2327.457,2329.637,"Well, I won't concede that it is over broad."
1989.87-2012,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2343.195,2344.137,--What if they are brother and sister?
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2346.979,2349.189,"It still applies, and in that case--"
1989.87-2012,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2349.189,2351.612,"So, if the sister is convicted of something, the brother cannot get a license?"
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2351.612,2366.54,--In that case I think our... our argument would be that the close family relationship really means that the person who... who will continue to operate the business is probably the one that had the conviction in the first place.
1989.87-2012,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2366.54,2369.334,"Well, what if the facts are just the opposite?"
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2378.58,2384.137,"That disqualifies him if they are living together, from operating a sexually oriented business."
1989.87-2012,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2384.137,2385.986,"If it disqualifies her brother, I suppose it disqualifies her father, too."
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2385.986,2387.727,If they are living together.
1989.87-2012,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2387.727,2388.568,They live in the same home.
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2395.462,2408.842,"The best justification I can give is that the intimate relationship that they have from living together probably indicates that in the operation of the business, we'll have the same operator that we had before the new license was issued."
1989.87-2012,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2408.842,2410.913,"Well, I'm assuming there never was an operator before."
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2424.415,2425.124,I understand your question.
1989.87-2012,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2425.124,2429.969,"Mrs. Muncy, do we have somebody who has standing to challenge this particular provision of the ordinance?"
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2439.106,2444.299,"To my knowledge, none of the Petitioners has been disqualified on the basis of either of those provisions."
1989.87-2012,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2444.299,2446.62,"So, maybe that provision is not before us."
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2446.62,2448.082,It is possible.
1989.87-2012,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2448.082,2450.954,That goes back to my question.
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2470.316,2473.658,"I would... yes, he would, but that is certainly not--"
1989.87-2012,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2473.658,2480.263,"Since we are getting into this matter, counsel, I... I... I think there are two different provisions."
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2504.45,2505.472,--That is correct.
1989.87-2012,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2505.973,2517.28,"So the only... the only nonspousal disabilities are for persons who are residing with the applicant, if those persons themselves have been denied a license."
1989.87-2012,1,16615,analeslie_muncy,,2517.981,2520.711,"--That is correct, that is exactly correct."
