1986.84-6811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.153,"We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 84-6811, Warren McCleskey versus Ralph Kemp."
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,12.276,16.838,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,396.893,401.127,Who took the information from those sources?
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,401.127,404.89,They were taken under the direction of a coding supervisor--
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,404.89,405.608,I didn't ask you that.
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,408.951,411.388,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,429.66,430.364,Who went out and talked?
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,430.364,435.644,"We had one witness who testified, a Mr. Ware, who was one of these officers."
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,437.004,443.361,I thought there were... who read trial transcripts and purported to extract information from them?
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,443.361,446.282,"There was a first study and a second study, Justice White."
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,446.282,446.704,I understand.
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,446.704,453.952,"The first study, the procedural reform study, was coded largely from information in the files of the Supreme Court of Georgia."
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,462.043,463.636,"Well, I still want to know, who read them?"
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,463.636,470.071,"Students, law students, law graduates; and they read them and--"
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,470.071,471.211,Were any of them law graduates?
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,471.211,478.879,"--At some point, I believe Fred Kyle was a graduate of the University of Iowa Law School and had a political science degree."
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,478.879,479.629,Sooner or later.
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,479.629,480.239,That's right.
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,480.239,482.393,And how about the next study?
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,482.393,487.423,The next study was coded by law students from the Pardon and Parole Board files.
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,492.093,507.508,"And so Professor Baldus relied on their interpretation of trial transcripts, or on whatever records they were looking at, as to whether some factor was present in the case?"
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,507.508,514.957,"That's correct, although let me hasten to say, Justice White, there was an elaborate set of what are called protocols, there was an elaborate set of rules."
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,514.957,515.474,I understand that.
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,515.474,519.676,"So that in other words, it wasn't five law students turned loose to make their own judgments."
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,530.112,530.953,"Right, right, right."
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,530.953,533.232,But that was the way in which data was gathered.
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,550.944,553.865,"Well, I thought the trial court thought there was a serious question in that regard?"
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,553.865,556.848,"No, Your Honor, the trial court locked at a set--"
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,556.848,564.345,"I thought he, for example, I thought he thought all those... a great many of those ""U"" indications were erroneous."
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,564.345,565.814,"--Well, no."
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,576.263,579.09,"Well, let... he may have misunderstood it."
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,582.229,585.306,"No, what happened, Your Honor--"
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,585.306,586.181,"Well, did he or not?"
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,586.181,589.523,"--On the ""U"" codes, he simply noted that there were a lot of them."
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,596.505,599.411,And so he thought the coding had been wrong.
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,599.411,600.91,The coding had been incorrect.
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,601.847,602.939,And you think the District Court was wrong?
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,602.939,604.517,--I think it was clearly erroneous.
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,609.748,610.217,"Right, right."
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,610.217,620.573,"--because Professor Baldus took the suggestion of the District Court, said, I'll go back and recode these ""U"" s the other way, and I'll show you that when I do, as he did, the analysis doesn't change."
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,623.633,624.04,Right.
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,624.04,627.133,--that were raised in the District Court were resolved in this way.
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,646.251,649.219,Was your organization working with Professor Baldus?
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,649.219,652.952,We asked Professor Baldus to undertake the study.
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,656.731,657.81,Did you make some suggestions to him?
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,657.81,658.95,"We did, indeed."
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,669.241,669.616,Right.
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,669.616,670.382,--in the State of Georgia.
1986.84-6811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,684.424,685.877,"He was paid by your organization, though?"
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,685.877,687.564,--He actually received no salary.
1986.84-6811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,690.626,692.67,From your organization?
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,692.67,698.246,"Well, there were monies from a private foundation that had been given to us to allow us to conduct such a study."
1986.84-6811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,740.198,768.593,"Mr. Boger, getting away from the validity of the study as such, and to the constitutional issue, if the study is utilized to support your proposition, what does a petitioner of a defendant have to show for the constitutional violation under equal protection or Eighth Amendment?"
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,776.028,781.525,"Yes, I believe he does, Your Honor, and yet I believe that we have shown that in this case."
1986.84-6811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,790.476,796.91,"Well, you cited Bazemore, which of course was a Title VII statutory case."
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,808.78,813.028,"--Well, there are a number of different sources of that authority, Your Honor."
1986.84-6811,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,829.084,842.314,"But this evidence is addressed, of course, as I understand it, to the victim; discrimination in the sense of discrimination against the victim."
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,842.314,851.356,"--There's also evidence of discrimination against black defendants who've murdered whites, especially in the mid-range of moderately aggravated cases."
1986.84-6811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,866.741,872.068,But I'm not sure how that supports a claim of discrimination against the defendant.
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,872.068,895.825,"Well, if the question is one, if you would, of standing, a defendant... if I have two defendants at my right hand, and two at my left, and the two at my right have murdered whites in Georgia, and two at my left have murdered blacks, surely my defendants on the right hand would have standing if Georgia had a statute that made killing a white person a mere serious crime."
1986.84-6811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,911.802,915.207,"It's such a curious case, because what's the remedy?"
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,917.112,921.861,"Well, no, we've suggest that there are two approaches the Court can--"
1986.84-6811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,921.861,926.547,"Do you want the Court to provide, then, abolition of the death penalty altogether?"
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,926.547,929.171,"--Well, no, I don't think abolition is the outcome either."
1986.84-6811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,942.761,948.962,"But the statutory provisions, you don't allege that Georgia's death penalty statutes are unconstitutional?"
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,948.962,952.273,"--Not facially, Your Honor; they were proved of course in the Gregg case."
1986.84-6811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,969.096,974.264,"Well, Mr. Boger, don't you have to show that this particular jury discriminated?"
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,974.264,978.965,"--Your Honor, I think we have shown that it's more likely than not that this jury did."
1986.84-6811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,978.965,981.933,"Well, this particular jury was only convened once."
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,992.976,997.506,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, let me suggest to you why I believe we have made that showing."
1986.84-6811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1007.236,1009.204,But not a pattern on the part of this jury.
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1009.204,1013.578,"--No, this jury only assembles, as you say, for one decision."
1986.84-6811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1025.637,1030.446,"But was there any... did the constitutional holding in Bazemore support your position, do you think?"
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1030.446,1039.991,"I believe Bazemore assisted, as did the Batson case, which talked about simply having proof that makes it more likely than not that discrimination exists."
1986.84-6811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1058.437,1063.981,"No, but when you're... the institution that you're challenging is the jury here."
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1066.575,1069.229,"Well, of course, Your Honor, it's not simply the jury."
1986.84-6811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1078.603,1090.535,"Well, then, do you think your evidence supports a finding that this particular prosecutor, who prosecuted this case, discriminates as between blacks who've killed whites and blacks who've killed blacks?"
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1090.535,1097.533,"Not as between charging, but as between deciding who to plead out to a lesser defense or permit not to go to trial, and who to move on to penalty."
1986.84-6811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1097.533,1106.515,"Okay, you say your evidence supports a finding that this particular prosecutor, in doing what you say, discriminated in the manner I described?"
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1106.515,1111.184,"I don't believe we have to show that a particular prosecutor, as opposed to the prosecutorial office, Your Honor."
1986.84-6811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1112.278,1116.964,"Well, but do you think your evidence would support a finding as to this particular prosecutor?"
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1116.964,1124.351,--I think we could conclude under your Fernco rationale... you said that we looked to all of the rational reasons.
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1162.699,1163.854,How many were plea bargaining?
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1163.854,1174.757,"At least... let's see, out of the 7 who were, like Mr. McCleskey, the trigger person who were involved in an armed robbery, there were three plea bargains, and four went to trial."
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1174.757,1182.16,"Well, it's hard to claim discrimination against McCleskey at the plea bargaining stage in this case."
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1184.642,1186.642,"No, that's incorrect, Your Honor."
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1186.642,1187.781,"Oh, really?"
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1187.781,1190.453,That's an erroneous statement by the Court.
1986.84-6811,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1218.817,1224.222,"So there was no offer, but there was a reluctance on Mr. McCleskey's part to consider a plea bargain?"
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1224.222,1224.738,--That's correct.
1986.84-6811,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1243.839,1244.525,Before you go... Mr. Boger.
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1245.15,1246.275,"--Yes, Mr. Justice Powell."
1986.84-6811,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1246.932,1252.587,"Before you go ahead with your argument, what were the aggravating circumstances in this case?"
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1252.587,1261.006,"The aggravating circumstances were murder committed during an armed robbery, and the slaying of a police officer in the official course of his duty."
1986.84-6811,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1264.021,1268.098,"Would they fall in the upper, middle, or lower category of aggravating circumstances?"
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1268.098,1272.113,"--Well, they are mid-range in themselves."
1986.84-6811,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1272.769,1277.047,"They are mid-range, committing a felony and shooting an officer in the course of committing a felony?"
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1277.047,1279.234,"--That's what the evidence shows, Your Honor."
1986.84-6811,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1292.198,1292.589,Excuse me.
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1292.589,1293.37,I'm sorry.
1986.84-6811,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1293.37,1299.556,"You have to accept the jury verdict that the defendant shot the police officer, don't you?"
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1299.556,1301.837,"Well, we of course contended below that that was--"
1986.84-6811,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1301.837,1302.617,"Right, I understand that."
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1302.617,1303.804,"--But yes, at this point we are."
1986.84-6811,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1303.804,1305.005,But here you bound by that.
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1313.409,1314.096,That's correct.
1986.84-6811,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1317.422,1317.875,Right.
1986.84-6811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1317.875,1320.578,"There was an other aggravating factor too, wasn't there?"
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1333.058,1337.276,There certainly appeared to have been at least a flurry of shots toward the officer.
1986.84-6811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1394.66,1415.09,"Mr. Boger, I assume that this kind of statistical evidence, if valid, with regard to imposition of the death penalty, would also be valid with regard to conviction; so that if you showed that there is a disproportionate pattern of convictions of those who are accused of killing white victims, or of black defendants, the same problem would arise?"
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1415.09,1425.696,"I don't believe we saw a pattern of evidence like that, but I suppose that if one could show that prosecutors were deliberately seeking lesser charges, that the logic under the Equal Protection Clause would extend that far."
1986.84-6811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1428.336,1429.851,"Well, not just prosecutors, but juries."
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1435.583,1435.895,That's correct.
1986.84-6811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1435.895,1456.793,"Now, I also assume that it's wrong to discriminate on the basis of race but on the basis of any other unchangeable physical characteristic, so that you wouldn't say we can convict people more readily because they're ugly, or because they're shifty-eyed."
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1473.803,1481.441,"I don't think the Court has afforded the same kind of protection, constitutionally, to shifty-eyedness or those other characteristics."
1986.84-6811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1481.441,1483.098,How about females?
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1483.098,1484.909,There is some heightened protection for females.
1986.84-6811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1543.479,1571.077,"Well, Mr. Boger, at bottom the claim being made here is a curious one, in the sense that in many death penalty cases, what the defendant comes forward asking for is more opportunities for the exercise of mercy, and to allow juries, for whatever reason, not to impose a death penalty."
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1583.884,1585.915,"No, it's not necessarily a tension."
1986.84-6811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1601.441,1615.903,But we have a case pending this term in which we are asked to reinforce again in the death penalty context that juries have absolute discretion not to impose the death penalty for whatever reason.
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1615.903,1618.871,"--Well, I think that's where the Court has to draw a line."
1986.84-6811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1629.197,1642.488,"So this Court's cases that have, since Furman, opened up to allow more discretion, were wrongly decided, and we should move back toward less discretion?"
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1642.488,1643.145,--Not necessarily.
1986.84-6811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1663.794,1680.975,"How do you suppose... what procedure could have been inserted that would have solved that problem, other than the one that Justice O'Connor has suggested, that is, going back to a rigid system where a certain crime, felony murder, produces the death penalty?"
1986.84-6811,0,29041,john_charles_boger,,1684.786,1692.565,"Georgia, Justice Scalia, has one of the most unfettered, one of the loosest systems of capital sentencing that's come before the Court."
1986.84-6811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1743.918,1745.168,"Thank you, Mr. Boger."
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1748.51,1754.055,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.84-6811,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1850.174,1853.174,Were there any mitigating circumstances?
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1853.174,1857.126,"No mitigating evidence was presented at the sentencing phase in this case whatsoever, Your Honor."
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1925.02,1929.253,"May I ask you, General Westmoreland, do you agreement that it's a mid-range case?"
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1934.126,1936.72,"Your Honor, I do not agree that it's a mid-range case."
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1942.187,1943.796,"Well, the death penalty is supportable in mid-range cases."
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,1951.356,1955.277,"Your Honor, I don't think that the evidence in this case supports that finding whatsoever."
1986.84-6811,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2037.168,2040.807,"Well, didn't the District Court agree with you in this respect?"
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2040.807,2042.37,"Yes, Your Honor, the District Court did."
1986.84-6811,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2042.37,2052.789,"And didn't the Court of Appeals... it didn't generally review the findings of the District Court, but in this particular respect, it seemed to agree with the District Court--"
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2052.789,2053.46,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.84-6811,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2053.46,2054.179,--about the mid-range cases.
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2054.179,2061.271,"In this respect, the Eleventh Circuit did note that they felt that there had really been no showing that there was actually a mid-range of cases that--"
1986.84-6811,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2061.271,2062.302,Of similar... of similar cases?
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2062.302,2064.348,"--Of similar factual nature; that's correct, Your Honor."
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2064.348,2072.768,I thought the Court of Appeals assumed that your opponents were right on this issue for the purposes of its decision?
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2072.768,2080.842,"Your Honor, what the Eleventh Circuit did was, on several occasions throughout its opinion, stated that they were assuming the validity of the study."
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2099.412,2113.172,"Well, do you take the case then as one on which we basically assume it's a factual matter, and we're reviewing findings, or we have a legal question, where we assume basically that the study is sound, and then the question is whether it raises a legal issue?"
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2113.172,2115.844,"Your Honor, I think the Court can take either one of two approaches."
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2126.184,2126.434,"Right, I understand."
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2126.434,2128.23,And they have never been overturned.
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2135.744,2149.08,"No, but if we disagreed, just as a hypothesis, if we disagreed with the legal conclusions of the Court of Appeals, would we not have to send it back to the Court of Appeals and say, well, let's find out if you're right about the study or your opponents are right about the study?"
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2149.08,2151.611,"Your Honor, that's obviously one possible alternative."
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2157.235,2162.233,"But can we be 100 percent confident that all of the cases with identical facts, that the death penalty is imposed?"
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2163.544,2172.806,"Your Honor, I'm submitting that what has not been shown is that there are similar cases in which the death penalty has not been imposed."
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2180.382,2180.882,"Well, I understand."
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2181.725,2183.303,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2190.471,2192.783,"We can, in effect, say the findings are right, and just affirm."
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2192.783,2193.75,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1986.84-6811,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2222.114,2225.504,"Ms. Westmoreland, did the state put on any testimony for that?"
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2225.504,2230.173,"--Your Honor, what... the state took two approaches in its presentation to the District Court."
1986.84-6811,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2248.215,2250.432,Did they put that on with witnesses?
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2250.432,2251.12,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.84-6811,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2253.978,2254.462,Two what?
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2254.462,2259.178,Statisticians who had run analysis of the data that we were given from Professor Baldus.
1986.84-6811,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2263.599,2263.989,Independent.
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2265.144,2266.144,"No, Your Honor, we did not."
1986.84-6811,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2267.518,2272.127,So what basis do you have for saying that this material missed the mark?
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2283.139,2285.466,"No, Your Honor, we presented--"
1986.84-6811,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2285.466,2286.701,"Well, what else did you have?"
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2286.701,2288.842,"--Your Honor, that was my point."
1986.84-6811,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2366.594,2371.717,Were those variables not taken account of in the study?
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2371.717,2377.246,The variables are taken into account in some of the analyses.
1986.84-6811,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2401.786,2407.955,"Well, I don't... well, does it eliminate any qualitative differences attributable to the two factors you just mentioned?"
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2407.955,2409.127,"Your Honor, those two--"
1986.84-6811,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2409.127,2417.39,"I mean, I can't imagine that one of the variables wouldn't be whether the case involved a family dispute or a barroom brawl or an intentional felony."
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2417.39,2422.449,"--Those are included in some of the analyses submitted into the District Court, yes, Your Honor; those particular ones are."
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2464.635,2479.661,"May I just ask you, if they argue, as I understand it, that there's eleven times as great a chance if you have a white victim than a black victim, even though, as I understand it, there are substantially black victim cases than there are white victim cases."
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2480.364,2481.707,"--Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2481.707,2486.252,"Out of some 1,500 black victim cases, there are a total of 20 death sentences."
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2486.252,2487.268,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2487.268,2491.688,"And out of about 970 white victim cases, there are over 100 death sentences."
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2491.688,2492.985,"That's correct as well, Your Honor."
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2492.985,2499.326,And you say all of that is explained by the fact that the white victim cases are consistently the more serious?
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2499.326,2517.351,"That's correct, Your Honor; that's our submission, that in examining these cases, out of the black victim cases I believe you'll find perhaps over a thousand occur in something like a family dispute, a lover dispute, a fight involving liquor of some sort, where some... one party is drunk or the other party is drunk."
1986.84-6811,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2551.555,2552.149,Ms. Westmoreland?
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2552.149,2553.055,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.84-6811,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2553.055,2579.84,"If this Court decides to simply address the Court of Appeals' approach, and not deal with your point about the validity of the study, it's your position, I take it, that assuming the study is valid, it just doesn't show a sufficient level of discrimination?"
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2579.84,2589.337,"Your Honor, we submit the study does not show what it purports to show; and that is, intention racial discrimination in this case, as a first point."
1986.84-6811,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2608.269,2609.143,May I just ask you--
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2617.796,2622.248,"Your Honor, I think one of the more important considerations is the type of case we're dealing with."
1986.84-6811,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2655.859,2667.418,"And how about the evidence insofar as the prosecutor is concerned, the evidence that tends to show that prosecutors just aren't willing as often to offer a plea bargaining?"
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2667.418,2673.431,"--Your Honor, the shifts us into essentially a selective prosecution type of argument."
1986.84-6811,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2686.848,2692.424,Does that discretion include discretion to discriminate on the basis of race?
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2692.424,2693.752,"--Certainly not, Your Honor."
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2726.349,2726.786,Ms. Westmoreland?
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2726.786,2727.099,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2727.099,2728.505,May I ask you another question?
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2759.571,2767.506,"Your Honor, I think what it does is create the question of, have we raised of inference of discrimination such as to present a prima facie case of discrimination."
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2767.506,2769.896,"Well, would that present a prima facie case in your view?"
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2769.896,2771.816,"Once again, it would depend on the circumstances."
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2776.424,2776.783,I understand.
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2790.451,2798.387,"Your Honor, I think it once again gets back to, in that case, is 11 percent going to be enough to raise a prima facie case inference of discrimination."
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2798.387,2798.699,Eleven times as great.
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2798.699,2800.932,This Court has been hesitant to set--
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2800.932,2802.354,"Well, I'm asking you what your view is."
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2804.682,2807.056,"--Your Honor, I don't think an 11 percent disparity--"
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2807.056,2809.224,"What if it was 20 percent, 20 to 1?"
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2809.224,2811.536,--Then you've moving closer to a prima facie case.
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2811.536,2816.238,What in the view of the State of Georgia is an acceptable percentage variation?
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2816.238,2823.08,"Your Honor, I don't think the State of Georgia has a precise view as to any acceptable percentage of variation one way or the other."
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2860.269,2865.407,"Of course they say, when you make the adjustment, it reduces it to four times instead of eleven times."
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,2865.407,2866.454,"Yes, Your Honor, that is correct."
1986.84-6811,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3124.949,3125.963,I don't understand that last point.
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,3128.728,3148.096,"--Your Honor, although Title VII does certainly involve more factors than a simple jury selection process could, for instance, normally under employment situation, you're going to have an employer focussing on a... a few specific things that are the main points being utilized in evaluating whether or not to hire a given employee."
1986.84-6811,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3173.679,3189.455,"But certainly on the theoretical point of whether statistical evidence can properly be used, assuming it's reliable, as evidence of... prima facie evidence of discrimination in the particular case, there's no basis for distinguishing this from the Title VII situation, is there?"
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,3189.455,3197.903,"Your Honor, I think that our point is that the difference is, the number of subjective factors that necessarily come into play in the jury's decision-making process."
1986.84-6811,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3197.903,3199.871,That goes to the reliability of the statistical evidence.
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,3211.554,3214.568,"Well, to that extent, Your Honor is probably correct."
1986.84-6811,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3226.955,3237.949,"General Westmoreland, one difference certainly between Title VII analysis and this kind of case is that under Title VII you can gain relief in some situations by simply proving disparate impact."
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,3237.949,3240.043,"This is true, Your Honor, of course."
1986.84-6811,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3310.703,3313.25,"And that's a factual matter mostly, you say?"
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,3313.25,3313.579,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.84-6811,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3313.579,3315.016,We should go with the District Court?
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,3315.016,3316.793,"Yes, Your Honor, that's our submission, certainly."
1986.84-6811,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3316.793,3326.149,"So if the Court had found the other way and accepted the statistical evidence, in the next case, then we would likewise go with the District Court."
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,3326.149,3339.019,"Your Honor, if the District Court had accepted the statistical evidence, accepted the validity of it, certainly that would be a factual finding of intentional discrimination, which under 42(a) does apply in this type of circumstance, yes."
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3385.188,3391.106,"But wouldn't you agree, Ms. Westmoreland, that the Georgia system does allow a greater room for discretion than some of the other states do?"
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,3391.106,3396.324,"--Yes, Your Honor, it does allow more discretion, which also works to the benefit of the defendant in any given case."
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3396.324,3396.995,Right.
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,3396.995,3400.354,Georgia allows mercy to be extended more often than many states would allow.
1986.84-6811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3400.354,3405.977,"Arguably, it allows the jury to take into consideration, as a mitigating circumstance, that the victim was black."
1986.84-6811,1,36846,mary_beth_westmoreland,,3405.977,3408.429,"Arguably it would, Your Honor."
1986.84-6811,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3435.78,3439.481,"Thank you, General Westmoreland."
