1955.112,0,20730,daniel_duke,,1719.178,1720.365,"Now, but the significant thing --"

1955.112,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1891.768,1892.677,Yes.
1955.112,0,20730,daniel_duke,,1892.677,1907.227,"So, the Court, when if a new term begins in the Court, and the grand jury served with the terms of the Court, the Court will call the Clerk and the deputy sheriff, they roll the boxes in, they usually shake them."
1955.112,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1985.236,1987.015,Now may I -- may I just interrupt a bit.
1955.112,0,20730,daniel_duke,,1990.901,1991.799,23.
1955.112,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1991.799,1992.72,23.

1955.112,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2037.489,2037.811,Yes.
1955.112,0,20730,daniel_duke,,2037.811,2040.849,-- to sustain my position here and I certainly wouldn't do it.
1955.112,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2040.849,2041.202,Yes.
1955.112,0,20730,daniel_duke,,2041.586,2046.041,"If -- if I thought that happened, I would make the challenge then and I would claim it and try to put in evidence --"
1955.112,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2046.041,2046.272,Yes.
1955.112,0,20730,daniel_duke,,2046.272,2047.335,-- to show it did happen.
1955.112,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2047.335,2047.906,Yes.
1955.112,0,20730,daniel_duke,,2052.119,2052.266,We don't understand them.
1955.112,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2052.266,2060.177,"-- as I understood them, they drew 75, and then the judge had the right to select 12 from those 75."
1955.112,0,20730,daniel_duke,,2061.649,2066.719,We do and -- and I'm certain that that happens.
1955.112,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2066.719,2068.06,You do have that practice?
1955.112,0,20730,daniel_duke,,2068.06,2074.665,"We -- we don't have the same practice that they had in Louisiana, but they draw 36 names, usually."

1955.112,0,20730,daniel_duke,,2078.408,2082.164,"Sometimes it'd be three months, subject to recall."
1955.112,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2097.549,2098.11,Yes.
1955.112,0,20730,daniel_duke,,2098.11,2116.67,"But the challenge made here to the indictment, and this case embodies a lot more than just a challenge to this indictment or to quash the indictment, the main thing it brings this case here is the -- is the opinion in the 211th Georgia when they deprived him of the right to put in evidence of discrimination that is trial as to the petit jury."
1955.112,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2116.67,2117.439,Yes.
1955.112,0,20730,daniel_duke,,2117.439,2123.1,I sought to go back to put in then incorporate in that also the same reason as to the grand jury.
