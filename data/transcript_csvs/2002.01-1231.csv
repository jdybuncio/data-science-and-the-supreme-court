2002.01-1231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.66,"We'll hear argument now in Number 10-1... 1231, the Connecticut Department of Public Safety versus John Doe."
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,57.314,60.558,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,108.445,112.632,"In this case, General Blumenthal, we're not talking about ex post facto."
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,121.631,155.522,"We are, indeed, Mr. Chief Justice, talking only about the due process issue and only about whether, first, the listing on this registry is defamatory and, second, whether the defamation, if, in fact, it exists... and we say it doesn't... is a violation of the Due Process Clause in the way that it is imposed here, that is, under Paul v. Davis, whether there is a loss or alteration of right or status as a result of that defamation--"
2002.01-1231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,155.522,160.435,"It's a procedural due process claim, not substantive due process."
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,160.435,171.292,"--The... the claim has been a procedural due process claim, although the United States as amicus has raised... and we welcome that it has raised... the substantive due process issue."
2002.01-1231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,171.292,176.41,"We don't normally address issues raised by amici, do we?"
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,176.41,198.041,"--I don't know whether the Court is more hospitable to claims that may be raised by amici from the United States Government, but it certainly is a relevant issue to be addressed here because many of the claims raised under the guise of due process really involve line drawing and categories."
2002.01-1231,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,204.44,210.55,"Well, the Second Circuit's position puts us... decision puts us in a somewhat difficult position."
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,230.406,242.955,"Certainly that is the way the... the case comes to the Court, raising that issue, and it's one that we believe merits reversal of the Second Circuit."
2002.01-1231,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,299.758,301.821,--May I ask you a question about your system?
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,326.507,326.962,--There is--
2002.01-1231,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,326.962,328.902,Does it draw any distinction between those two?
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,328.902,340.708,"--Justice Stevens, there is no category of information on the registration, as it's made available to the public, about whether there has been treatment."
2002.01-1231,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,345.538,349.336,So they treat one who had treatment and one who had no treatment exactly the same.
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,349.336,353.34,"--That is correct, so far as the information provided to the public is concerned."
2002.01-1231,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,384.137,400.195,Would you... would you agree that there is at least some subclass of cases here in which the non-dangerousness could be shown in a way that probably was highly accurate and did not involve the... the difficulties that you raise?
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,463.065,489.609,"There... there is, in fact, Justice Souter, a category of the registrants who are excepted for the... a... a category of convicted offenders who are excepted from the registry if, for example, they are 18 or younger and they commit statutory rape, if the victim is 13 to 16 years old."
2002.01-1231,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,494.067,496.462,What do... what do they have to do to get the exception?
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,496.462,507.691,"--At the time of sentencing, that finding is made by the sentencing court, or later, that that kind of registration is not required by public safety."
2002.01-1231,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,507.691,510.746,What about the ones who have already been sentenced?
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,525.689,539.774,"The... the legislature has made a determination that certain... under certain circumstances, the crime is not registrable, that is, there is no requirement for registration."
2002.01-1231,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,541.426,544.398,"Well, but take... take... simply take the case as an example."
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,555.832,558.721,--They... they could go back to the sentencing court.
2002.01-1231,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,560.207,560.679,--I see.
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,560.679,564.849,--that someone who would fit the exceptions can go back to the sentencing court.
2002.01-1231,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,564.849,567.616,Does this... does this category fit?
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,576.532,579.71,"I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg."
2002.01-1231,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,583.137,599.938,"You said that there are certain categories of people who can be exempted from that, and I asked if the hypothetical that Justice Souter raised... that particular hypothetical... fits within that exempted or excepted class."
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,599.938,601.713,I believe that it could.
2002.01-1231,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,601.713,603.199,It doesn't on my list here.
2002.01-1231,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,628.373,628.373,--Nineteen.
2002.01-1231,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,628.373,631.057,--so they didn't fit within that exception.
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,648.601,655.865,And... and that question really is the more fundamental issue about legislative line drawing and unquestionably--
2002.01-1231,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,655.865,659.952,"Well, before we get to line drawing, I misunderstood your response to me I guess."
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,669.795,671.447,--Maybe I should--
2002.01-1231,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,671.447,675.451,Justice Breyer understands that they would not be exempted from listing.
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,678.423,691.592,"--I... I believe that probably they would not be exempted, although they could go back to the sentencing court, and determine whether the circumstances of that hypothetical and... and... I'm not--"
2002.01-1231,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,691.592,692.957,But what is the category?
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,692.957,693.161,--But I had in mind all--
2002.01-1231,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,693.161,697.536,"What is the category, General Blumenthal, in which such a person might go back?"
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,712.852,715.081,"--That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2002.01-1231,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,738.198,744.225,"Let's assume... you know, we accept the fact that line drawing has to be done and so do the other people on the other side of the case."
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,786.207,791.946,The justification is that the information that is put on the registry is accurate.
2002.01-1231,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,797.33,797.89,No.
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,821.75,834.836,"--With all due respect, Justice Souter, the court of appeals did not find that the fact of being on the registry means that every individual is subject to that stigma."
2002.01-1231,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,834.836,835.125,No.
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,862.7,868.81,There is differentiation insofar as the crime itself is listed.
2002.01-1231,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,868.81,883.96,"There is, and yet the very fact that the State chooses to list that crime is a clear indication that the State thinks that people in that category of crime deserve to be listed with others who are potentially dangerous."
2002.01-1231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,898.077,907.82,"Mr. Blumenthal, may I ask you whether this statute has helped in any way in reducing sex crimes in Connecticut?"
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,907.82,917.479,"We... we can't really say, Justice O'Connor, at this point because the Internet availability has been suspended by order of the court."
2002.01-1231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,918.882,920.285,How long was it in effect?
2002.01-1231,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,920.285,932.917,"--It was in effect for a couple of years, and even then it was too early to make a judgment as to whether or not it was having any discernible effect statistically, and there's nothing in the record on that point."
2002.01-1231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,982.207,983.776,"Very well, General Blumenthal."
2002.01-1231,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,986.376,993.824,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1068.771,1071.454,That's what it says on the registry or on the Internet?
2002.01-1231,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1071.454,1072.197,Exactly.
2002.01-1231,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1072.197,1074.221,But you could skip that entirely.
2002.01-1231,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1094.943,1096.429,"Well, that's true, Justice Ginsburg."
2002.01-1231,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1126.688,1145.718,"Well, except for the fact that... that the... the State has made a judgment and it doesn't deny it, that individuals who have been convicted of crimes in the categories subject to the law, are as a categorical matter more likely to commit them in the future."
2002.01-1231,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1167.721,1175.523,"--Well, what they do say is that the public is entitled to and should make specific judgments about specific individuals."
2002.01-1231,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1175.523,1176.266,But it can't.
2002.01-1231,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1185.925,1186.463,Precisely.
2002.01-1231,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1195.213,1203.924,"All... all of which, however, are regarded as being within some... above some threshold of dangerousness or they wouldn't be listed on the Internet."
2002.01-1231,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1203.924,1217.753,--Because they are... they are responding to the people's request in 50 States... and the people of the United States through the Congress... to make information available to us about people who have been convicted of sex crimes.
2002.01-1231,2,42079,shelley_r_sadin,,1589.976,1596.935,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1231,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1610.764,1613.902,"You... you state that as a fact, Ms. Sadin."
2002.01-1231,2,42079,shelley_r_sadin,,1617.163,1619.309,--Petitioners themselves have stated--
2002.01-1231,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1619.309,1625.048,"I'm asking you... Ms. Sadin, I'm asking you what is the record support for the statement you just made?"
2002.01-1231,2,42079,shelley_r_sadin,,1625.048,1628.558,--That... that the public knows this is a Megan's Law list?
2002.01-1231,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1628.558,1632.85,That... that the public knows that... what... that they're... that they're dangerous.
2002.01-1231,2,42079,shelley_r_sadin,,1632.85,1637.968,"The... the message of dangerousness comes from a number of sources, Your Honor."
2002.01-1231,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1667.318,1673.263,"But they also say that it... it... they're not saying that anyone is dangerous on that same website, don't they?"
2002.01-1231,2,42079,shelley_r_sadin,,1673.263,1674.378,They don't actually.
2002.01-1231,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1684.409,1685.606,"Well, why isn't that good enough?"
2002.01-1231,2,42079,shelley_r_sadin,,1685.606,1692.21,"It isn't good enough because all it says is what we already know, which is that nobody has been assessed for dangerous or not."
2002.01-1231,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1718.216,1740.523,"But that's not... that's not... I think what I took the Chief Justice is asking... I took... and I'd have a similar question, that... that their response I think to the point that I was trying to make with Justice Souter, that maybe this is overly broad because let's imagine the 19-year-old who simply had intercourse once with a much younger woman and obviously is no danger."
2002.01-1231,2,42079,shelley_r_sadin,,1788.433,1805.317,"There were... the... the court... the district court's decision and the court of appeals decision that affirmed it were based on rule 9(c) statements, undisputed facts on summary judgment, and they included the fact that this is commonly known as a Megan's Law."
2002.01-1231,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1821.912,1827.485,"Well, the public also understands that official records have to be interpreted in different ways."
2002.01-1231,2,42079,shelley_r_sadin,,1835.658,1835.824,--Except that these--
2002.01-1231,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1835.824,1845.318,"This... if... if you have sort of a First Amendment argument you're concerned with here, it... it seems to me that you're arguing at cross purposes to our precedents."
2002.01-1231,2,42079,shelley_r_sadin,,1845.318,1853.574,"--As I understand your question, if... the problem is that it is not just truthful, already public information."
2002.01-1231,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1859.23,1861.087,Is that not truthful?
2002.01-1231,2,42079,shelley_r_sadin,,1861.087,1871.118,"--The current photograph and the current... it is not because the message that it conveys is that this is a person who is being watched and monitored, who must, at risk of felony conviction--"
2002.01-1231,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1871.118,1875.948,"Well, what is the constitutional basis for your argument?"
2002.01-1231,2,42079,shelley_r_sadin,,1883.173,1894.03,"--It is that there is an established liberty interest in... in a government impose... in avoiding a government-imposed stigma, which is not just government name-calling."
2002.01-1231,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1894.03,1900.074,"Well, how does some liberty interest and reputation survive the Paul versus Davis case?"
2002.01-1231,2,42079,shelley_r_sadin,,1900.074,1902.741,But it is more than a liberty interest and reputation.
2002.01-1231,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1916.282,1920.08,Can... can a truthful statement be stigmatizing?
2002.01-1231,2,42079,shelley_r_sadin,,1920.08,1922.886,--This is not a truthful statement.
2002.01-1231,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1922.886,1929.945,"Well, then do you agree that a truthful statement cannot be stigmatizing?"
2002.01-1231,2,42079,shelley_r_sadin,,1929.945,1930.416,No.
2002.01-1231,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1933.1,1936.526,Is that consistent with Paul versus Davis?
2002.01-1231,2,42079,shelley_r_sadin,,1936.526,1942.471,"--I think Paul versus Davis requires that there be a... as there is in this case, a false stigma."
2002.01-1231,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1964.224,1966.453,A danger... potentially dangerous.
2002.01-1231,2,42079,shelley_r_sadin,,1981.025,1981.563,--The government says--
2002.01-1231,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1981.563,1982.594,And is that true?
2002.01-1231,2,42079,shelley_r_sadin,,2008.229,2019.458,"--The State says... with respect, the State says more, but even if it said that these... that these people may be more dangerous than other people, that too reduces people in the eyes... in the eyes of the public."
2002.01-1231,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2047.322,2056.775,"Suppose this... this same information was on the... on the Internet through some private service and I got into the Internet, and I said I don't want to live next to... to this person."
2002.01-1231,2,42079,shelley_r_sadin,,2058.839,2059.293,"--Well, there are two points--"
2002.01-1231,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2059.293,2060.78,--based on a public record.
2002.01-1231,2,42079,shelley_r_sadin,,2060.78,2062.737,"--There are two points with respect to that, Your Honor."
2002.01-1231,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2110.374,2112.232,Let... let me give you that.
2002.01-1231,2,42079,shelley_r_sadin,,2216.423,2222.368,"I understand, Your Honor, and I think... let me see if I can respond to it sufficiently."
2002.01-1231,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2269.633,2272.977,--in finding a liberty interest here.
2002.01-1231,2,42079,shelley_r_sadin,,2284.865,2285.708,I think so.
2002.01-1231,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2285.708,2286.113,Okay.
2002.01-1231,2,42079,shelley_r_sadin,,2286.113,2288.952,And let... let me try to address it now if I haven't done it yet.
2002.01-1231,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2311.947,2313.638,I don't think that's the issue.
2002.01-1231,2,42079,shelley_r_sadin,,2362.967,2368.706,"--But the problem with... the problem with that, Your Honor, is that the list does not just say that the person was convicted of a sex offense."
2002.01-1231,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2368.706,2372.998,So now suppose... that's... what I'm trying to find out what is your real argument.
2002.01-1231,2,42079,shelley_r_sadin,,2423.691,2439.666,I would if... I would if the current appearances and whereabouts of those people were also monitored for the purpose of posting them on a list whose stated purpose is to protect the public.
2002.01-1231,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2451.199,2455.436,But then I don't get the link with the hearing that you're asking for.
