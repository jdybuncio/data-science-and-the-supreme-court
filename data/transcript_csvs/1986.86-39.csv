1986.86-39,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.778,"We will hear argument first this morning in No. 86-39, Burlington Northern Railroad Company, versus the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees."
1986.86-39,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,13.417,34.799,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, one of the prominent features of our federal labor laws is that Congress has singled out two industries, the railroads and the airlines, for special treatment under their own statute, the Railway Labor Act, which differs both in its substance and also in the way it is administered from the National Labor Relations Act."
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1506.753,1527.589,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the petitioners in this case center on the 1926 Railway Labor Act as being the focal Act on which to examine to determine whether or not the unions do have a right to ask other railroad employees to help them in their dispute."
1986.86-39,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1576.523,1578.397,"That is a strike, isn't it?"
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1578.397,1578.647,It is.
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1675.467,1697.739,"So you could accept everything Mr. Lee says about the Railway Labor Act and still conclude that you shouldn't win here, that even if this secondary picketing would have violated the Railway Labor Act, prior to Norris-LaGuardia, or even now, it can't be enjoined."
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1697.739,1701.846,"Your Honor, that is correct, but we don't accept the fact that the 1926--"
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1701.846,1705.392,"Well, I know, but is that your position or not?"
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1705.392,1708.094,--It is... the Norris-LaGuardia Act controls.
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1718.543,1722.245,Even if... no matter what the Railway Labor Act says.
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1722.245,1727.166,--Because the Railway Labor Act does not have an explicit prohibition against secondary picketing.
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1727.166,1737.146,"Well, let's assume that... it isn't explicit, but let's assume that you would infer it, as Mr. Lee suggests."
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1740.549,1745.782,We would submit it still controls because it was the latter statute addressed to a specific problem.
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1745.782,1746.438,The later statute?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1746.438,1752.045,"The later statute, addressed to a specific problem, namely, what forms of self-help--"
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1752.045,1753.514,What do you do about our later cases?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1756.184,1756.996,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-39,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1778.925,1788.718,But Chicago and Northwestern in 402 US as I read it is a statement that the railroads had a duty to do something under the Railway Labor Act.
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1798.855,1818.924,"But the court did make a point of the fact that the Railway Labor Act's heart was the duty to exert every reasonable effort to reach a conclusion, to reach an agreement with the carriers, and that in that case the union was, according to the complaint, simply engaging in perfunctory bargaining, where it did not comply with the Act."
1986.86-39,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1841.494,1852.16,"Mr. Clarke, what has happened in all these 60 years when instances have arisen of attempts to have secondary picketing of railroads?"
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1852.16,1863.985,--Secondary picketing of railroads is... there is a lot of historical development that has occurred in the past 60 years that the Railway Labor Act has been in existence.
1986.86-39,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1999.774,2002.758,What did the injunction prohibit here?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2002.758,2016.814,"The injunction prohibited the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way from placing pickets near the facilities of the carriers involved in this case, the eight carriers, to ask their employees to withhold their labor."
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2065.466,2072.37,What was the prevailing rule at that time before the Act about the enjoinabilty of secondary picketing?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2072.37,2076.946,Secondary activity was enjoinable but primary activity--
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2076.946,2077.337,It was illegal.
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2077.337,2078.478,--It was--
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2078.478,2079.024,It was held to be illegal.
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2079.024,2079.585,--The courts--
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2079.585,2080.367,And it was enjoinable.
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2080.367,2081.085,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2082.492,2086.568,And you think the Railway Labor Act was intended to change that rule?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2086.568,2086.802,"--No, Your Honor."
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2108.527,2109.292,I understand.
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2109.292,2111.683,The Act did not touch--
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2111.683,2123.022,"The law was, the existing law was that secondary picketing was not enjoinable no matter when it occurred prior to the Railway Labor Act."
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2123.022,2127.629,"--Prior to the Railway Labor Act, the law was that secondary picketing was enjoinable."
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2127.629,2128.098,Exactly.
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2128.098,2128.645,That primary--
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2128.645,2130.845,Why wasn't it enjoinable afterwards?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2130.845,2135.781,--It was not enjoinable afterwards because of the 1932 Norris-LaGuardia Act.
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2135.781,2139.405,"I know, but between '26 and '32 it was enjoinable?"
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2139.405,2146.59,"We submit it was enjoinable for the law that existed prior to that time, but primary strikes were enjoinable prior to that time."
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2158.835,2170.58,Didn't the Court of Appeals say that the Norris-LaGuardia Act prevents this injunction even if the secondary picketing in this case violated the Railway Labor Act?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2170.58,2171.423,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.423,2172.438,Do you defend that?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2172.438,2173.391,"Yes, Your Honor, we do."
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2173.391,2173.657,All right.
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2173.657,2175.453,And we defend that on this ground.
1986.86-39,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2188.994,2192.742,But that is contrary to the holding of the court in the Northwestern case.
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2192.742,2210.329,"We submit it is not, Your Honor, because in the Northwest case you had a specific requirement in the Act that was not being compiled with, and the requirement in the Act that was not being complied with was the duty to exert every reasonable effort to reach an agreement."
1986.86-39,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2210.329,2213.187,So the union was violating the Railway Labor Act.
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2217.514,2222.824,"That's correct, Your Honor, because the specific command of the Railway Labor Act was not followed."
1986.86-39,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2246.174,2257.716,"I can see that point, but I thought you were saying that even though there is a violation of the Railway Labor Act here on the part of the union, the Norris-LaGuardia Act flatly prohibits any sort of injunction."
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2259.451,2260.778,"--Yes, Your Honor, we are defending that."
1986.86-39,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2260.778,2264.229,And you say that is consistent with the Northwestern case?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2264.229,2264.464,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-39,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2268.946,2278.755,"You agree if there is a violation of an express prohibition in the Railway Labor Act in a strike, that strike may be enjoined notwithstanding the Norris-LaGuardia Act?"
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2278.755,2279.068,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2336.856,2338.043,Mr. Clarke--
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2338.043,2338.465,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2338.465,2351.039,"--Let's move on and assume, for example, you win this case and secondary picketing not only continues to exist but expands so that the railroads are shut down, half of the United States."
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2352.569,2353.491,"Your Honors, the Act--"
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2353.491,2355.286,Are the courts powerless then?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2355.286,2356.567,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2361.097,2363.205,So the railroads would stay shut down until Congress acted.
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2363.205,2367.251,"Yes, Your Honor, but first of all there is Section 10 in the Act--"
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2367.251,2367.954,Two months?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2367.954,2376.889,"--There is section 10 in the Act, Your Honor, which allows an immediate cessation of all sorts of self-help, which is what occurred in this case."
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2396.348,2399.472,Only with respect to railroads and airlines?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2399.472,2401.908,"No, Your Honor, with respect to any industry."
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2406.782,2410.983,Under Taft-Hartley secondary boycotts are not permitted.
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2410.983,2414.311,"--Yes, Your Honor, but the private party cannot come in and get an injunction."
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2418.637,2422.431,That is by virtue of express Congressional consent.
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2422.431,2425.899,"That is correct, Your Honor, which we do not have here, so the--"
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2425.899,2429.413,What is the situation with respect to the trucking companies?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2429.413,2431.725,"--The trucking companies would be the same, Your Honor."
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2431.725,2432.678,The same as what?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2432.678,2437.472,The National Labor Relations Board has to go to the court to get the--
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2437.472,2442.798,"I understand that, but is there anything comparable to Norris-LaGuardia with respect to the trucking companies?"
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2442.798,2449.312,"--Your Honor, the Norris-LaGuardia Act still applies to prohibit the individual trucker from going into court to get the injunction."
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2482.798,2493.388,"Come back to my question, let's assume, for example, that half the railroads in the United States were shut down by secondary picketing."
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2495.995,2500.822,"Yes, Your Honor, if Section 10 had been used."
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2500.822,2503.695,"That could take a certain amount of time, I assume."
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2503.695,2504.913,It could take a day.
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2504.913,2505.679,A day?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2505.679,2506.992,Or it could take longer than a day.
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2506.992,2508.396,What is Section 10?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2508.396,2528.701,"Section 10, Your Honor, is the section which provides that if in the opinion of the National Mediation Board the strike activity threatens to interfere with the rail transportation in the region of the country, they shall inform the President who may in his discretion create an emergency board."
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2534.402,2535.042,For a--
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2535.042,2538.119,--for a period of 30 days after the--
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2538.119,2539.119,--This is the cooling off?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2539.119,2540.445,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2543.585,2544.288,"Yes, okay."
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2556.892,2557.829,"That is correct, Your honor."
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2557.829,2559.954,So truckers who--
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2559.954,2561.062,Every interstate commerce industry.
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2561.062,2563.655,--Trucker who compete with railroads are subject to different laws?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2563.655,2564.514,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2565.296,2567.326,May I ask you one other question?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2568.419,2569.434,"Yes, sir."
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2569.434,2573.808,What is your view with respect to the substantial alignment issue?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2576.276,2587.364,"We submit, Your Honor, there are no standards in either the Railway Labor Act nor the Norris-LaGuardia Act that would in any way justify the adoption of a substantial alignment doctrine."
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2744.644,2757.639,"Could I ask you, why would you say that nonconnecting roads have a dispute with the employer, or why would you say picketing them arose out of a labor dispute?"
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2757.639,2768.432,Because the only reason the union would engage in picketing of the Burlington Northern or the western carriers would be to aid its dispute with--
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2768.432,2776.273,"What if they went around and picketed the railroad's customers, the people who were shippers?"
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2776.273,2778.304,"--At that point, Your Honor, you are outside the industry."
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2778.304,2800.153,"Well, nevertheless, the only reason that you are... you still have a dispute with your own employer, and you want to put pressure on him, so you go around and talk to the people in other unions in the grain business or in the wood business, and say, stop dealing with this railroad until they topple over."
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2802.745,2804.589,"Well, we submit it is all right, but that is--"
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2804.589,2807.4,"Well, I know, but what would it violate?"
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2807.4,2811.398,--It would not violate--
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2811.398,2814.195,It wouldn't be protected by the Norris-LaGuardia Act?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2814.195,2814.6,"--Yes, Your Honor, we--"
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2814.6,2816.772,Because it doesn't arise out of a labor dispute.
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2816.772,2818.959,"--No, it does not arise in the same industry."
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2818.959,2824.159,But you can picket a railroad in Los Angeles just because it is a railroad.
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2824.159,2824.753,"No, Your Honor."
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2834.249,2836.311,The same industry?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2836.311,2839.716,"Yes, Your Honor, that is in Section 13(b) of the National... of the Norris-LaGuardia Act."
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2839.716,2846.915,"Well, I know, but why does that arise out of a labor dispute and picketing shippers of logs in Maine does not?"
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2846.915,2847.915,It does.
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2853.585,2853.851,But what?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2853.851,2864.16,"But it is not the type of conduct that is protected by the Norris-LaGuardia Act because it does not pertain to the same industry, which is 13(b) of the Act."
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2896.521,2902.737,What would be the basis for the injunction against picketing the neutral wood shipper?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2902.737,2912.201,"Your Honor, the second question that comes up besides the Norris-LaGuardia Act issue is whether there is anything that is wrong about that type of conduct."
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2923.603,2935.911,"Well, anyway, your argument is that picketing the Los Angeles railroad is okay, but picketing the log shipper isn't all right."
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2935.911,2938.301,--It is not lawful now unless Congress changes it.
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2938.301,2940.441,"I mean, it isn't protected by Norris-LaGuardia."
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2940.441,2941.752,I said lawful.
1986.86-39,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2952.357,2953.966,"Mr. Clarke, let me interrupt you there."
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2964.009,2964.695,"No, Your Honor."
1986.86-39,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2964.695,2970.99,So that picketing also could not be enjoined under your view of the--
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2970.99,2973.691,"Your Honor, we would submit that it could not be enjoined because it is lawful--"
1986.86-39,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2973.691,2974.207,--I understand.
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2974.207,2975.895,--under the last part of the Clayton Act.
1986.86-39,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2975.895,2981.44,"And on that you do not rely on the Norris-LaGuardia Act, just simply there is an absence of a federal prohibition against it."
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2981.44,2982.377,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-39,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2984.97,2985.921,What about state law?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2985.921,2987.906,--That is the point that I was getting to.
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3044.397,3045.381,Mr. Clarke--
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3045.381,3045.881,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3045.881,3052.036,--Is there a public policy reason to treat railroads differently in this respect from truckers that compete?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3052.036,3057.52,Not insofar as what is proper forms of self-help.
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3074.497,3093.519,"Yes, but my question... perhaps I don't understand the situation... is that if a railroad is competing directly with a trucking firm why should labor law be different with respect to the two so that you could have an injunction, the NLRB could bring an injunction against a trucker, couldn't it?"
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3093.519,3101.423,"Well, Your Honor, the labor law would be different, because under the NLRA, it is the NLRB, it is the board that has to come to the court."
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3101.423,3102.095,I understand that.
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3102.095,3105.452,Here it is the individual carrier that can come to the court and seek the injunction.
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3105.452,3105.984,Yes.
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3105.984,3110.998,But that is... the difference is the fact that the Railway Labor Act--
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3110.998,3112.966,But there can be an injunction in one case but not in the other?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3113.294,3121.211,"--Yes, Your Honor, but only at the request of the government, and in a rail case there can be no injunction."
1986.86-39,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3129.411,3130.833,I understand Congress set it up.
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3132.504,3135.846,"--Well, the distinction is basically historical, Your Honor."
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3246.896,3267.544,"Could I ask you, what if there had been no picketing, but the head of the union in Los Angeles was a brother of the head of the union in Maine, and he said, well, I just think we ought to help these people out, and he got a lot of other unions, they just walked out on their employers."
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3267.544,3268.669,"Your Honor, the Act--"
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3268.669,3270.496,That is a sympathy strike.
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3270.496,3271.043,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3271.043,3274.729,Would they have had to go through some procedures before they could strike?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3274.729,3275.463,"No, Your Honor."
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3297.547,3298.282,Of the--
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3298.282,3301.905,"Norris-LaGuardia Act, which says that no court--"
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3301.905,3306.45,--Would they have to go through the procedures of the Railroad Labor Act to strike?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3306.45,3306.778,"--No, Your Honor."
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3306.778,3307.605,Because?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3307.605,3313.557,It is a sympathy strike in support of the employees up in Maine.
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3313.557,3314.087,And that is expressly excluded?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3314.087,3319.85,Section 4(a) specifically says that no court may enjoin the refusal to work.
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3319.85,3321.898,That is Norris-LaGuardia.
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3321.898,3322.677,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3322.677,3327.191,But what about the procedures required by the Railway Labor Act before you can--
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3327.191,3328.237,There is no--
1986.86-39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3328.237,3328.737,--Before you can strike?
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3328.737,3329.3,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-39,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3365.254,3366.909,"Mr. Clarke, your time has expired."
1986.86-39,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3366.909,3367.799,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-39,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3367.799,3370.049,"Mr. Lee, you have six minutes remaining."
1986.86-39,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3370.049,3373.5,"I won't need that much, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.86-39,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3402.613,3410.33,"Mr. Lee, why is that important for your purposes if you find the prohibition against this activity in the Railway Labor Act?"
1986.86-39,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3417.654,3419.248,--More important than it was enjoinable is the fact that it was unlawful.
1986.86-39,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3419.248,3423.371,"--That it was unlawful under the Sherman Act, and I don't understand you to be relying on the Sherman Act today."
1986.86-39,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3423.371,3424.605,That is correct.
1986.86-39,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3432.79,3433.352,Okay.
1986.86-39,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3433.352,3449.61,"In 1926, in that setting Congress gave us a law which Congress said was not intended to answer all of the questions but simply to set forth the general principles and then leave it to the courts to develop as the common law had developed."
1986.86-39,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3449.61,3455.078,"But if you are right about that, it doesn't seem to me you need the unlawfulness prior to 1926."
1986.86-39,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3461.464,3462.043,I think that's correct.
1986.86-39,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3470.055,3472.837,"Well, they may have made the assumption, but they didn't write it into the law."
1986.86-39,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3472.837,3473.46,That is correct.
1986.86-39,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3473.46,3480.254,"But you think they intended that some time a court could say, could infer that the Act covers it?"
1986.86-39,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3480.254,3485.204,"What we clearly know, Justice White... we don't know whether they were thinking about secondary picketing."
1986.86-39,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3568.077,3576.746,What is the cognate obligation here similar to the one you referred to in Chicago and Northwestern of the union which it violated?
1986.86-39,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3576.746,3581.417,"--Yes, the cognate obligation is the identical one."
1986.86-39,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3604.236,3608.343,"Mr. Lee, if that is correct, supposing you had nationwide bargaining going on."
1986.86-39,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3613.95,3616.902,"--No, not that there could be no rail strike."
1986.86-39,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3619.87,3635.238,"I mean, it seems to me your reasoning leads to the conclusion that because the statute was designed to prevent strikes, and once you exhaust the procedures and they don't work, the only way to achieve the object of the Act is to enjoin a strike."
1986.86-39,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3635.238,3644.406,"--No, it doesn't say... it does not say that there will be no strikes, and this Court has held that at a certain point in time there can be strikes."
1986.86-39,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3685.577,3692.902,"You are saying, making common law, you would say you could still picket interconnecting lines?"
1986.86-39,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3692.902,3697.588,That gets to the tough case.
1986.86-39,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3716.174,3717.768,"Thank you, Mr. Lee."
