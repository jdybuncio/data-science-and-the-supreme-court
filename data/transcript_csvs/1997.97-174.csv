1997.97-174,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.549,"We'll hear argument next in Number 97-174, Cass County, Minnesota v. Leech Lake Band of Chippewa Indians."
1997.97-174,0,22762,earl_edwin_maus,,29.771,30.462,Thank you.
1997.97-174,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,173.379,181.915,Are these parcels within the boundaries of the tribal reservation here?
1997.97-174,0,22762,earl_edwin_maus,,181.915,187.959,--For purposes of this lawsuit we have stipulated that the lands are within the reservation boundaries.
1997.97-174,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,193.805,194.154,But--
1997.97-174,0,22762,earl_edwin_maus,,194.154,195.206,--is a matter for another day.
1997.97-174,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,195.206,196.007,--Right.
1997.97-174,0,22762,earl_edwin_maus,,205.611,207.333,That's correct.
1997.97-174,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,219.471,228.427,"And if they had never been sold off as pinelands and homesteads, you concede that no county tax would have been possible?"
1997.97-174,0,22762,earl_edwin_maus,,228.427,230.858,That's correct.
1997.97-174,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,243.526,256.546,"And there were additional parcels that were reacquired pursuant to the lands covered by the Dawes Act as amended by the Burke Act, but they're not at issue here?"
1997.97-174,0,22762,earl_edwin_maus,,256.546,257.846,"--They're no longer at issue, that's correct."
1997.97-174,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,257.846,268.975,"And as to those parcels the tax is being levied and the Burke Act expressly says that taxation is possible, I take it?"
1997.97-174,0,22762,earl_edwin_maus,,268.975,292.44,"Well, the Burke Act says that but we believe that the Court went a step farther than that in the Yakima case in finding that the Burke Act made it more clear, but that section 5 of the General Allotment Act made it clear and made those lands taxable as they were alienable following the logic, basically, of Goudy v. Meath, which was decided in 1906, and decided also by this Court."
1997.97-174,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,292.44,295.371,May I be sure I understood something you said?
1997.97-174,0,22762,earl_edwin_maus,,306.18,307.041,That's correct.
1997.97-174,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,307.041,308.391,And who's the trustee?
1997.97-174,0,22762,earl_edwin_maus,,309.723,310.442,"Yes, they are."
1997.97-174,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,336.989,346.005,I don't quite understand why it should make a difference whether the land is owned outright by the tribe or held for the tribe in trust by the United States.
1997.97-174,0,22762,earl_edwin_maus,,347.748,362.527,"You know, basically that's... the difference being this, is that's what Congress decided to do, and they did a balancing test, obviously, when they did the... passed the Indian Reorganization Act, and wanted to look at land as--"
1997.97-174,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,362.527,366.257,"The answer in other words is, that's required by the 1934 statute."
1997.97-174,0,22762,earl_edwin_maus,,366.257,372.334,"--That's correct, and there is specific language that says, once it's put into trust, that it's not taxable."
1997.97-174,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,372.334,373.062,I see.
1997.97-174,0,22762,earl_edwin_maus,,376.836,377.537,That's correct.
1997.97-174,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,383.09,384.7,And so--
1997.97-174,0,22762,earl_edwin_maus,,407.436,408.855,That's correct.
1997.97-174,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,408.855,417.143,So how many years are we talking about that it was in this state where it was reacquired by the tribe but not yet put in trust?
1997.97-174,0,22762,earl_edwin_maus,,417.143,417.682,Okay.
1997.97-174,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,450.504,452.186,So we're talking about 2 years.
1997.97-174,0,22762,earl_edwin_maus,,452.186,477.212,"We're talking about... well, basically if we... if it went on the tax rolls in 1993 it would have been taxes payable in 1994, and the lawsuit was commenced in '95, and towards the latter part of '95 all of these parcels, or at least the remaining parcels were put into trust, so we're talking about a year and a half, basically, I guess of actual, payable taxes for most of the parcels, maybe more or less for some of them."
1997.97-174,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,477.212,487.809,"Does the provision of the law which enables these parcels to be put in trust, does that say that when they go into trust they are no longer taxable?"
1997.97-174,0,22762,earl_edwin_maus,,487.809,489.179,Yes.
1997.97-174,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,495.554,502.579,That probably wouldn't be necessary if they're not taxable anyway so long as the tribe acquires them.
1997.97-174,0,22762,earl_edwin_maus,,502.579,503.659,That's correct.
1997.97-174,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,520.642,529.419,"But your point is that there's a distinction because if it's not put into trust the tribe can sell it and do whatever it wants to with it, but if they put it in a trust they have to get the consent of the United States to do something with it."
1997.97-174,0,22762,earl_edwin_maus,,529.419,530.349,--That's correct.
1997.97-174,1,33066,james_m_schoessler,,1342.941,1350.267,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.97-174,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1378.364,1391.904,"Well, what it says, the negative... it does expressly say that if the Secretary does acquire the land in trust for the Indians, the land shall therefore be tax exempt, which one assumes that before it was acquired it was not tax exempt."
1997.97-174,1,33066,james_m_schoessler,,1393.484,1394.015,Yes.
1997.97-174,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1394.015,1394.526,Yes.
1997.97-174,1,33066,james_m_schoessler,,1394.526,1398.159,"It's basically a negative implication, to which I think two responses are required."
1997.97-174,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1457.587,1472.936,"Well, but that leaves open the question, doesn't it, because the question here is whether this particular tax exemption in fact would... is of the traditional variety, or whether, because of the history traced in Yakima, it's in a different position."
1997.97-174,1,33066,james_m_schoessler,,1472.936,1474.528,"Yes, Your Honor--"
1997.97-174,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1474.528,1478.82,So I think what the Court said really leaves the question right where we find it.
1997.97-174,1,33066,james_m_schoessler,,1478.82,1493.462,"--The point that I was simply making is that there is no authority within the Indian Reorganization Act and section 465 to find a grant of jurisdiction, even by negative implication to counties or States to tax tribal lands."
1997.97-174,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1493.462,1493.96,That may be.
1997.97-174,1,33066,james_m_schoessler,,1499.135,1509.08,"It does bring up, I think, what the basic point of this case is anyway, and the basic rule of law that should govern this case."
1997.97-174,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1526.913,1532.566,The trouble is we say that on the one hand and we also have language very similar to that.
1997.97-174,1,33066,james_m_schoessler,,1552.2,1563.947,"Your Honor, I would suggest that the unmistakably clear intent rule, or the per se rule, if you will, has a long and honorable history in this country's jurisprudence."
1997.97-174,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1566.529,1576.984,"Well, but Goudy v. Meath also has a long and, I suspect, equally honorable... and it seems to me if Goudy v. Meath controls in this case, you lose."
1997.97-174,1,33066,james_m_schoessler,,1580.226,1583.68,"--Give me an opportunity to do that now, Your Honor."
1997.97-174,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1583.68,1584.2,"By all means, yes."
1997.97-174,1,33066,james_m_schoessler,,1584.631,1585.61,I would like to talk about Goudy v. Meath--
1997.97-174,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2490.636,2497.972,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.97-174,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2497.972,2498.743,Ms. McDowell--
1997.97-174,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2498.743,2499.274,--Yes.
1997.97-174,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2499.274,2508.908,"--may I ask you, not necessarily now, but at some point during your argument, to comment on the argument that Mr. Maus made, and I understood it to go basically like this."
1997.97-174,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2559.962,2560.643,Yes.
1997.97-174,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2567.516,2578.014,"Well, he... but I think we accept, and I mean I think the premise of his argument was, the statement does not have to have an express reference to the particular land or category of land."
1997.97-174,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2594.386,2600.488,--We do not believe it's unmistakably clear that Congress intended to tax even the allotment lands in the hands of the tribe.
1997.97-174,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2614.87,2616.359,Didn't we say that in Yakima?
1997.97-174,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2621.753,2623.906,--The Court didn't draw the distinction in Yakima.
1997.97-174,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2625.986,2628.046,"But it did expressly refer... it expressly referred to both, didn't it?"
1997.97-174,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2628.046,2632.14,"--It expressly referred to the fact that there were tribally owned lands there, as well."
1997.97-174,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2633.179,2634.401,"Yes, which were an issue, as I understand it."
1997.97-174,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2634.401,2635.062,"--Yes, that's correct."
1997.97-174,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2635.062,2635.523,All right.
1997.97-174,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2665.363,2680.873,"This Court's rule is that there must be some sort of unmistakably clear expression of what Congress intended, and it's impossible to tell here what Congress would have intended about land that came back into the possession of the tribe."
1997.97-174,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2680.873,2705.782,"But once the Court has determined that it is clear with respect to land that was allotted to individual Indians, once the Court has made that determination that that is clear, then why isn't it, as Justice Souter says, equally clear that no rational Congress could have envisioned a different treatment for the land that went out not under allotments to individual Indians?"
1997.97-174,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2723.563,2738.062,"Congress obviously would have understood at the time that there were many different tax statuses that might have occurred with respect to the homestead lands and the pinelands, depending on whether and how they were actually acquired."
1997.97-174,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2745.536,2748.357,"Yes, but we're talking about land that was sold by the United States."
1997.97-174,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2768.641,2784.422,"Well, Congress doubtless would have assumed that they would be taxable in the hands of an ordinary non Indian individual or business taxpayer, but we cannot conclude what Congress would have intended had the lands been reacquired by a tribe within the boundaries of an existing reservation."
1997.97-174,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2804.417,2808.497,Is it part of your submission that we overlooked the significance of tribal ownership in the Yakima case?
1997.97-174,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2808.497,2809.739,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-174,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2816.905,2821.468,"Why did we take the trouble to comment that there were both tribal and nontribal lands, then?"
1997.97-174,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2821.468,2824.89,"--Oh, that was certainly part of the factual background of the case, Your Honor."
1997.97-174,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2826.089,2828.172,"Oh, but if it was an irrelevant portion, we shouldn't have mentioned it."
1997.97-174,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2834.336,2842.311,--The distinction was not drawn perhaps because the focus of the tribe was on the parcels that was owned by individuals.
1997.97-174,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2868.559,2882.526,"Could you possibly just quickly say what your view is on the question of, if you followed Goudy and followed the rule, taxability follows alienability, you'd have to get to the question, is this alienable, and then we'd get to the nonintercourse act, et cetera?"
1997.97-174,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2883.607,2885.709,These lands are not alienable.
1997.97-174,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2886.65,2888.05,Is downtown Minneapolis alienable?
1997.97-174,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2888.05,2894.033,--We would take the position that the nonintercourse act was intended to apply only within Indian country.
1997.97-174,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2926.645,2927.456,Why is this a big problem?
1997.97-174,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2936.532,2946.47,"That's correct, but there are many tribes that have held lands for over a century now that have not... never been taken into trust and have always been recognized to be exempt from tax."
1997.97-174,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2946.47,2947.689,Taken into trust?
1997.97-174,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2954.504,2967.043,"Well, traditionally those lands have been understood to be protected by the fact of Indian tax immunity, the absence of a clear statement, and the fact that those lands were within an existing reservation, the New York Indians being an example of that case."
1997.97-174,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2976.367,2987.076,"Was 465 the source of the authority exercised in this case to acquire the... these lands in trust by the United States to hold in trust for the Indians, for the tribes?"
1997.97-174,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2987.076,2988.168,"That's my understanding, yes."
1997.97-174,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2988.168,2995.861,You say in your brief that Yakima... it's evident that it rested primarily on section 6.
1997.97-174,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3009.148,3017.035,But the decision then goes on to say that it took section 6 and the Burke Act proviso to make that implication clear.
1997.97-174,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3017.035,3017.794,To make it more clear.
1997.97-174,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3024.66,3050.327,"I think it's important to look at section 3 of the Court's opinion in Yakima, where the Court actually starts applying the clear statement rule to the actual two taxes at issue in that case and there, when the Court decides that the ad valorem tax in Yakima is permissible, it is because it constitutes, quote, taxation of property within the meaning of section 6 of the General Allotment Act and the Burke Act proviso."
1997.97-174,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3050.327,3057.641,"--But if everything rides on the Burke Act, then why didn't that protect only the parcels where there was premature patenting?"
1997.97-174,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3057.641,3060.042,"May I answer, Your Honor?"
1997.97-174,3,22762,earl_edwin_maus,,3077.644,3078.615,"Real briefly, Your Honor."
1997.97-174,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3078.615,3079.186,Good.
1997.97-174,3,22762,earl_edwin_maus,,3080.375,3086.91,"A couple of things, I guess, one just on the Burke Act, just to comment on that."
1997.97-174,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3156.875,3160.508,Weren't those lands that had never been alienated before?
1997.97-174,3,22762,earl_edwin_maus,,3160.508,3161.749,--That's correct.
1997.97-174,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3161.749,3164.531,They'd been Indian territory from the beginning.
1997.97-174,3,22762,earl_edwin_maus,,3164.531,3174.877,"That's correct, and it would be our position that the nonintercourse act applies to lands that have never been alienable."
1997.97-174,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3183.372,3184.714,"Thank you, Mr. Maus."
