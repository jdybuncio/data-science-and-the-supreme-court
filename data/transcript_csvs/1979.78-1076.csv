1979.78-1076,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,79.32,We will hear arguments next in Rhode Island against Innis.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,81.094,85.569,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,167.515,170.285,"Previously, another cab driver had been shot and killed?"
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,170.285,172.791,"A cab driver had been shot and killed, Your Honor."
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,237.48,240.53,You said he was placed in a caged police car with three police officers?
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,240.53,242.786,"There were two police officers in the front seat, Your Honor--"
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,242.786,243.28,And one in the caged --
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,243.28,246.27,-- and one in the cage with Thomas Innis.
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,390.131,399.657,"Well, isn't the basic issue here, in the case before us, whether or not there was interrogation of Innis?"
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,399.657,402.044,"This is true, the question is whether there--"
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,402.044,402.68,Isn't that really the question?
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,402.68,405.321,"Well, I think there are several questions, Your Honor."
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,405.321,408.043,"Well, if there was no interrogation, you win, don't you?"
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,408.043,409.819,"If there was no interrogation, I win."
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,410.247,412.828,"And in Brewer, that was not an issue."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,412.828,414.486,"No, it wasn't; it was clearly interrogation involved."
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,414.486,423.73,And every court that examined the Brewer case described that so-called Christian burial speech as interrogation.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,423.73,425.112,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,425.989,427.32,That was not an issue in the case.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,427.32,430.021,Detective Captain Leeming conceded that his purpose was interrogation--
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,430.021,430.796,Right.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,430.796,431.338,--in that case.
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,431.628,436.373,"Well, not only in this Court, but every court along the way; that had not been an issue."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,436.373,437.154,"That is true, Your Honor."
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,437.154,439.948,The issue in that case was whether or not there had been a waiver.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,439.948,441.119,That is right.
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,443.023,443.439,I know it can.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,443.439,445.466,If the Court concludes that there was interrogation.
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,445.466,445.49,"Yes, I know."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,445.49,449.708,"The State's position is, basically, there was no custodial interrogation."
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,451.815,452.627,Right.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,452.627,471.672,"If there had been by some action of the police--he had scrupulously observed the constitutional rights of the accused--if there had been some custodial interrogation, there was certainly knowing and voluntary waiver by Innis on two occasions - First, in the squad car, and secondly, when he returned--"
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,471.672,474.269,But you don't get to any question of waiver if there was no interrogation?
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,474.269,477.072,"That is absolutely correct, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,705.179,707.668,"Well, that would overturn Miranda, of course, wouldn't it?"
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,707.668,710.163,"Yes, it certainly would, Your Honor."
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,710.163,716.304,That's the overruling approach to Miranda?
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,716.304,720.903,"I suspect that probably lurks around in the back of Professor Granno's mind somewhere, Your Honor."
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,720.903,722.081,And yours?
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,722.081,722.605,And mine?
1979.78-1076,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,757.59,767.82,"Now, you referred to the doctrinal and factual distinctions, or lack of it, by the Rhode Island Supreme Court."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,785.541,786.197,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1979.78-1076,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,786.197,788.121,This fellow had never been charged.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,788.121,791.407,This man was not charged; we did not have the commencement of any criminal--
1979.78-1076,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,791.407,793.173,"He was under arrest and in custody, wasn't he?"
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,793.173,795.24,"He was in custody, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.78-1076,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,811.671,815.001,"When we talk--Miranda deals with custodial interrogation, doesn't it?"
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,815.001,815.923,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.78-1076,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,815.923,817.955,And Massiah deals with something quite different?
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,817.955,820.517,It certainly does; it certainly does.
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,820.517,824.422,What did--what violation was found in Brewer?
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,824.422,825.978,Violation of Sixth Amendment rights--
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,825.978,829.418,"So, and Miranda is a Fifth Amendment case, isn't it?"
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,829.418,831.433,"Mr. Justice White, that's correct, yes, sir."
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,840.335,843.768,But you should be able to say at the outset that Brewer is irrelevant?
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,843.768,847.315,I believe that Brewer is irrelevant.
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,847.315,850.259,Because the Massiah approach isn't applicable here.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,850.259,852.128,"That is Correct, the--"
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,852.128,853.82,There's been no charge.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,853.82,861.997,"No commencement of judicial proceedings, which is the key to the commencement of your Sixth Amendment rights, under Massiah or under Brewer."
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,873.218,875.613,"But you still, even if Brewer is irrelevant."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,875.613,876.051,Yes.
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,876.051,877.391,And Miranda isn't--
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,877.391,878.236,Miranda is not.
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,878.236,882.366,"And neither is--hence, neither is the question of interrogation irrelevant?"
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,882.366,883.272,Correct.
1979.78-1076,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,917.003,934.273,"Well, you've said that, in response to questions from my colleagues, that the Brewer case was written, as I understand it was, to--on a Sixth Amendment basis, and what we have here is a Fifth Amendment question."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,946.712,949.636,"Oh, Brewer clearly, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, involved interrogation."
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,949.636,950.88,It did not involve an issue of interrogation.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,950.88,952.585,It did not involve an issue of interrogation.
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,952.585,953.108,Everybody had agreed--
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,953.108,953.439,That's right.
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,953.439,956.189,--in the Brewer case that that was interrogation.
1979.78-1076,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,956.189,956.951,Wait a minute.
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,958.204,959.804,"No, I'm talking about every Court."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,959.996,962.568,"The court majority, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,962.568,963.499,Every court.
1979.78-1076,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,963.499,964.257,So--
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,964.257,969.232,"Well, let's have that clear, because I think it bears on this case in a way."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,980.517,981.333,Professor White--
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,981.333,982.037,Yes.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,982.037,988.429,--would extend Your Honor the--he would make the case a Sixth Amendment case.
1979.78-1076,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1010.68,1049.626,"Well, if--although not contested--there was an--interrogation was one of the elements in the holding of Brewer, and you say the question of whether or not there was interrogation here is important in the Fifth Amendment context; then is the question of interrogation in the abstract involved both in the Fifth Amendment Miranda-type situation and in the Sixth Amendment Massiah-type situation?"
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1049.626,1052.7,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1979.78-1076,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1113.318,1116.571,He was just philosophizing; is that your suggestion?
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1116.571,1118.661,"No, Your Honor, it's--I'm not suggesting that."
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1141.381,1145.171,What is the difference if this officer wanted to find the gun--
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1145.171,1146.887,This officer was--
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1146.887,1148.392,"Probably interested in where the gun was, wasn't he?"
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1148.392,1149.939,"No, I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1156.916,1157.772,May I ask you a question about--
1979.78-1076,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1157.772,1160.114,"Well, why'd he do that?"
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1160.114,1161.969,"He didn't ask him any questions, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1979.78-1076,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1161.969,1165.126,"Well, then after--he got him turned around though, didn't he?"
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1166.531,1167.908,The man volunteered.
1979.78-1076,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1174.809,1181.029,"But my point is, I don't know just how innocent that conversation was."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1181.029,1186.808,"Well, of course that is what respondent is attempting to provoke the Court to believe."
1979.78-1076,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1187.946,1197.25,"You know I have a great difficulty with deciding how much major intelligence the two-year-on-the-force cop--policeman--has, and a ten-year."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1201.296,1201.735,"Well, the point--"
1979.78-1076,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1201.735,1215.452,"I mean, I think a police officer who's had two years training with the FBI might be equal to a police in a country place that had never seen a city."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1215.452,1216.385,"Well, the--"
1979.78-1076,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1216.385,1224.692,I just don't see the purpose of the--these very innocent people sitting up there in the front seat.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1226.614,1228.568,"They're police officers; no question, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1979.78-1076,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1228.568,1229.343,Qualified.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1229.343,1230.693,That's right.
1979.78-1076,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1230.693,1232.551,"Well, why try to make them unqualified?"
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1232.551,1233.884,I'm not trying to make them unqualified.
1979.78-1076,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1247.599,1253.251,"Well, do you think it's the same as then discussing what happened in the World Series last night?"
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1253.251,1257.561,I think you have to have some kind of evidence that it has inquisitorial intent.
1979.78-1076,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1261.047,1261.816,It wasn't totally absent.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1264.007,1264.939,These men--
1979.78-1076,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1264.939,1267.775,And they were discussing a gun.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1267.775,1270.093,"They were in fact--they were in fact discussing a gun, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1979.78-1076,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1270.093,1272.775,And they were discussing this gun.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1272.775,1273.696,His gun.
1979.78-1076,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1273.696,1274.26,Yes.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1274.26,1275.405,They were discussing his gun.
1979.78-1076,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1275.405,1276.418,Right.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1276.418,1277.149,That's what they said.
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1295.711,1297.37,"Well, and most importantly, it was not directed to Innis."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1297.37,1298.677,It was not directed to Innis.
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1298.677,1300.191,By contrast with the Christian burial speech.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1300.191,1300.724,Yes.
1979.78-1076,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1303.171,1313.887,"When you say it was not on a--when you say it was not on a long ride, how long a trip was it that these officers were instructed to make?"
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1313.887,1319.726,"The testimony--well, the trip they were instructed to make was considerably longer than what eventually happened."
1979.78-1076,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1321.619,1322.363,A half-mile?
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1322.363,1324.644,"A half-mile to a mile, the record suggests."
1979.78-1076,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1329.45,1330.901,And then they turned around and went back?
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1330.901,1335.457,They turned around when the--when Innis volunteered to go back.
1979.78-1076,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1360.807,1370.008,Maybe he was counting on the fact that you can't do ballistic tests on a sawed-off shotgun the way you can on a .38 caliber pistol; is that possible?
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1370.008,1372.702,"I don't know what the state of his knowledge was, Your Honor."
1979.78-1076,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1374.952,1382.867,"I mean, you've referred to the Christian burial speech of Brewer several times, and we have, too."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1397.483,1398.091,In that weather.
1979.78-1076,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1398.091,1399.475,--climate?
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1421.328,1431.974,"I submit, Your Honor, under what I would expect to be the ordinary standards of police work, they probably--their duty should be to carry out the directions of their superior officer."
1979.78-1076,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1445.614,1457.787,"General Roberts, following up on the Chief Justice's point, the trial judge specifically said, we have three officers who are out at four in the morning or later, and have been prowling around searching for a weapon which they had reason to believe was there."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1462.748,1463.925,"No, these three men had been--"
1979.78-1076,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1463.925,1464.719,That's what the trial judge said.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1464.719,1467.031,These three men had been at the scene.
1979.78-1076,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1467.031,1467.573,Looking for the weapon.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1467.573,1469.045,Looking for the weapon; they had been.
1979.78-1076,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1469.045,1474.295,And is it not a fact that the trial judge's decision was based on waiver.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1491.184,1491.798,"That's correct, Mr. Justice--"
1979.78-1076,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1491.798,1497.808,And you're in effect asking us to make a new finding of fact on the question of interrogation; is that right?
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1497.808,1498.859,No.
1979.78-1076,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1499.354,1501.091,"Well, who should make the finding of fact?"
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1501.091,1507.272,The issue of waiver was certainly paramount in the trial judge's decision.
1979.78-1076,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1507.272,1508.373,It was the grounds of his decision.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1508.373,1509.308,"Yes, yes."
1979.78-1076,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1509.308,1509.659,Clearly stated.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1509.659,1511.287,He found a waiver to exist.
1979.78-1076,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1511.287,1513.65,And he did not pass on a finding of interrogation.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1513.65,1515.552,Exactly; exactly.
1979.78-1076,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1522.65,1525.081,"Well, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island did decide the question, didn't it?"
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1525.081,1526.165,They--yes.
1979.78-1076,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1526.76,1530.177,Would you characterize it as a question of fact or a question of law?
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1530.177,1533.653,I believe they treated it essentially as a question of law.
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1555.162,1561.476,"Well, but that doesn't affect the interrogation issue, as I understood your answer to Justice Rehnquist."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1561.476,1561.7,Correct.
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1567.323,1568.018,Right.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1568.018,1569.315,--waiver being subsequent in my view to--
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1569.315,1573.381,"But I'm still interested in your answer, not your interpretation of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1577.605,1580.47,"I believe it's a question of law, as it is before this Court."
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1588.125,1593.477,"And the rule of law would be that unless the remark is directed at the defendant, it's not interrogation."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1595.503,1603.205,"I would ask you to adopt the rule that unless it's directed at the defendant, and unless it's interrogative in nature--it doesn't have to have a question make at the end--"
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1603.205,1605.989,"Well, obviously, Brewer establishes you don't need a question mark."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1605.989,1607.077,Correct.
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1607.077,1616.702,"But you would say that if--that even if it was intended to bring forth the response, if it was not directed at the defendant it would not be interrogation?"
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1616.702,1619.168,If it was intended to bring forth a response?
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1619.168,1619.277,Yes.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1619.277,1624.575,"And it was not directed--well, then I would think that you would have to find that in fact it was directed at the defendant."
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1624.575,1633.749,What if the--what if the trier of fact were persuaded that the reasonable probability of the conversation were to bring out a response from the defendant?
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1637.062,1640.808,"Yes, because then I think you would say that that was, in fact, directed at the defendant."
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1642.668,1645.636,So you don't have to direct it in terms in which I'm speaking to you?
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1650.401,1651.081,In fact--
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1651.081,1652.646,"--by the--because that happened here, didn't it?"
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1652.646,1653.954,"No, that didn't happen here, Your Honor?"
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1653.954,1655.803,It didn't bring a--well--
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1655.803,1658.065,"It was not directed at him, and in fact, all the testimony--"
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1658.065,1663.047,The trial judge describes what the defendant does as his response to the statement.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1663.047,1667.183,"But it was not directed at him in real or implied fashion, and I think all the record evidence--"
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1667.183,1669.154,"Well, how do we know that?"
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1669.154,1673.645,Because there's absolutely no evidence in the record to support that conclusion.
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1673.645,1675.578,"Well, the Rhode Island Supreme Court thought there was."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1675.578,1700.92,"The Rhode Island Supreme Court, if I may say so respectfully, I think misread Brewer in such a way that they felt the Christian burial speech holding in Brewer mandated a finding that anything which is said, which elicits a response, whether or not it's directed, intentionally or unintentionally, at the defendant, that that's going to be sufficient to call for invocation of Miranda."
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1700.92,1705.272,"We don't have any finding here on what the intent of the officer was, do we?"
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1705.272,1710.881,"There is a--the Superior Court finding, Your Honor is correct, goes to the question of waiver; it does not involve a finding of fact."
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1723.743,1744.397,"Well, of course, I suppose you could say that there was--or you could argue, at least--that even if there was sufficient interrogation in Brewer to make out an invasion of the right to counsel, it might not have, in Brewer, been an interrogation for the purposes of Miranda--a Miranda violation."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1744.397,1744.991,I'm troubled by that--
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1744.991,1749.574,"I mean, interrogation may not be interrogation in every possible context."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1749.574,1753.724,"That's very interesting, and certainly is very likely true."
1979.78-1076,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1762.013,1762.747,"Now, I take it you're--"
1979.78-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1762.747,1765.799,"That may be so, but--"
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1780.195,1781.566,That's quite true.
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1781.566,1794.479,"In the Seminole Massiah case, there was a conversation in the front seat of a car between Massiah and his friend who was wired for sound."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1801.261,1803.87,Except for the fact that the Federal Marshall was sitting a block away.
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1803.87,1806.564,"Oh, yes, I know that; Massiah's friend was an agent of the police."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1806.564,1807.438,That's right.
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1807.438,1811.282,And Massiah doctrine has nothing to do whatsoever with coercive circumstances.
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1811.282,1814.718,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1979.78-1076,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1814.718,1820.09,"But as I remember the facts in Massiah, it was not a Q and A sort of interrogation."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1820.09,1826.198,It was just a statement--a statement he made that was incriminating and overheard by the Marshall because the friend was in cooperation--
1979.78-1076,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1826.198,1864.479,"Suppose, since we're psychoanalyzing [ILLEGIBLE WORD] petitioners, would your position be that what took place in the car, whatever it was, was the same as though, over the car radio from headquarters, came a message from the Captain or Inspector saying, ""When you deliver Innis, when you're through with him, get some men out into that area and try to find that shotgun so that some of the children from the handicapped--handicapped children from the local school won't hurt themselves?"""
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1864.479,1870.684,"I believe the intent and the constitutional meaning of both statements would be the same, yes."
1979.78-1076,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1875.442,1881.526,"General Roberts, there's this difference, I suppose, that the suggestion the Chief Justice makes, it would have been new information to the police."
1979.78-1076,0,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,1888.127,1901.245,"The question, I believe, Mr. Justice Stevens, still goes back to the question of intent to interrogate."
1979.78-1076,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1901.245,1906.136,Mr. MacFadyen.
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,1906.136,1909.247,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1076,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2186.644,2235.968,"Well, Mr. MacFadyen, would it be fair to say that just as Miranda was propounded by the Court because it was so difficult to actually analyze the factual circumstances in which a prisoner claimed a confession was beaten out of him involuntarily, the Court felt a prophylactic rule was necessary, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island, which you now support, feels that now it's so difficult to decide whether Miranda warnings have been respected and Miranda assertions of--claims of Miranda rights have been respected by the police, that we need another tier of prophylactic rule in order to make sure that Miranda isn't violated?"
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,2235.968,2250.051,"I'm certain that the Supreme Court of Rhode Island was concerned about its ability to essentially read Officer Gleckman's mind through the printed page, especially when that printed page is very short."
1979.78-1076,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2291.832,2295.215,"But is that wrong, under Miranda?"
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,2304.932,2307.686,I believe it's clearly wrong under Miranda.
1979.78-1076,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2357.843,2360.912,What holding are you relying on of this Court for that proposition?
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,2360.912,2371.398,"I think the Roscoe v. Texas involved a one or two sentence interrogation, and this Court found that to be interrogation."
1979.78-1076,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2371.398,2394.082,"Well, from what you say, I take it that if the arrested person, person in custody, was taken in, and sat down, and the desk sergeant said, ""The first thing I want to know is, give me your name and address,"" and the answer was, ""Never mind my name and address, I want to confess; I killed so-and-so."""
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,2403.643,2407.548,"No, Your Honor, I would not say that was interrogation on--"
1979.78-1076,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2407.548,2417.205,"Well, I thought you had said something to the effect that as soon as they asked the question, or words to that effect, the interrogation began?"
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,2417.205,2421.703,"The reason for saying no, I think, is really in two parts."
1979.78-1076,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2431.617,2437.32,Procedural as distinguished from substantive questioning?
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,2437.32,2440.714,"Those words always trouble me, but perhaps that's fair."
1979.78-1076,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2547.7,2553.18,"Well, the Massiah rule has nothing whatsoever to do with pressure."
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,2553.18,2554.875,"I would agree with that, Your Honor."
1979.78-1076,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2554.875,2558.101,Just nothing.
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,2566.659,2573.2,I would use Brewer in this case simply as illustrative of another fact situation.
1979.78-1076,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2584.296,2596.794,But in Massiah was--what was the activity of the police or others that interfered with consultation with counsel?
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,2596.794,2602.184,"To the best of my understanding of the opinion, it was that he was in fact indicted, that--"
1979.78-1076,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2602.184,2603.387,And that he was out on bail.
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,2603.387,2604.322,That he was out on bail.
1979.78-1076,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2604.322,2606.165,And talking to a supposed friend.
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,2606.165,2619.084,"And instead of going through an attorney, just as a civil lawyer would always contact the lawyer on the other side rather than going directly to the client, they set him up."
1979.78-1076,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2626.656,2627.983,Not a very good friend.
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,2627.983,2630.239,"Or a good friends, depending on your point of view."
1979.78-1076,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2630.239,2646.342,There seems to be general agreement among members of the Court and your opponent and you that Brewer and Miranda and--are not the same cases at all.
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,2661.948,2662.829,Your Honor--
1979.78-1076,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2662.829,2666.202,Which--and Brewer was not a Miranda case.
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,2666.202,2674.328,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would suggest that the Supreme Court of Rhode Island simply used Brewer as an illustrative case."
1979.78-1076,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2726.018,2739.164,"But if factual similarities to Brewer can be relied on you, why can't factual dissimilarities, such as the totally different exposure of time, be relied on by your opponent?"
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,2739.164,2741.077,I think he can rely on those.
1979.78-1076,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2803.198,2819.601,"Well, but, to follow up on what my brother Rehnquist has asked you, you would agree, would you not, that as far as the Court is concerned, the issue in Brewer v. Williams is whether or not there had been a waiver?"
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,2819.601,2821.809,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1076,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2821.809,2834.546,"There was conceded, at least in the Courts--now some members of this Court disagree--but in the courts, every court that had considered Brewer v. Williams had conceded that there was a constitutional violation."
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,2846.794,2848.118,Absolutely.
1979.78-1076,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2848.118,2849.321,"And you would agree with that, wouldn't you?"
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,2849.321,2859.578,"I would agree that the primary, and perhaps most crucial question here, is whether Innis' Miranda rights were violated initially."
1979.78-1076,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2859.578,2860.492,Correct.
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,2860.492,2869.314,"That if they were not, that if he in fact, in that police car, spontaneously volunteered to lead the police to the shotgun, it is the end of the case."
1979.78-1076,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2869.314,2878.631,"Every court, in Brewer v. Williams, had held that Brewer's Massiah rights had been violated."
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,2880.66,2882.902,That's correct.
1979.78-1076,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2883.604,2896.53,"Excuse me, just to pursue that point, that although all the courts resolved the interrogation issue in the same way, that was an initial basic question that had to be put to one side before you reached the waiver issue."
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,2925.799,2930.287,"No, I would agree that interrogation is interrogation, regardless of what the legal pigeonhole is."
1979.78-1076,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2930.287,2933.849,"Well, what if it were unknowing, such as in the original Massiah case?"
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,2939.811,2941.453,I think that is a harder question.
1979.78-1076,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2941.453,2948.161,If it were totally unknown to the interrogee that he was being interrogated.
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,2948.161,2952.688,"Mr. Justice Stewart, I think that's a harder question, and I would answer it in this way."
1979.78-1076,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2966.093,2972.05,The further distress under which he is under--suffering.
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,2976.987,2987.38,"But what I was going to add is, I think there is a second prong to Miranda, which comes into play where a suspect has invoked his rights."
1979.78-1076,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3018.728,3048.111,"What would you say in response to my hypothetical question to the Attorney General, that if the same words that were spoken here in the front seat of the car had come over the car radio from headquarters of the police, no one in the car had uttered them, and then the--all of the events following that would be the same, what would you say?"
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3048.111,3050.727,I would find it a very hard case.
1979.78-1076,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3050.953,3053.421,Even though the words are precisely the same?
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3053.421,3055.182,That they are precisely the same?
1979.78-1076,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3055.182,3055.813,Yes.
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3055.813,3056.804,"No, I don't think they're precisely the same."
1979.78-1076,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3056.804,3074.765,"No, my hypothesis was that over the car radio, exactly the same words which were uttered in the car on this record came over as a direction to the police in the car to find that gun to prevent injury to children."
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3082.497,3086.673,"If the dispatcher was aware that Innis was in the car, I would say it's precisely the same case."
1979.78-1076,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3086.673,3088.919,"Well, let's assume he was not."
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3088.919,3098.684,"Assuming he was not, I would see it as a different case, and that it would be very difficult to apply the Miranda rationale to it."
1979.78-1076,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3207.548,3221.363,"Do you agree that none of the police officers purportedly, purported to direct their remarks to Innis, any of their remarks at issue here?"
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3221.363,3224.012,"None of them purported to do, but the record--"
1979.78-1076,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3224.012,3226.065,Innis no more than overheard?
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3226.065,3227.901,That is correct.
1979.78-1076,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3232.827,3238.191,"No, I just was--limited to that question, you agree that the record shows that--"
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3238.191,3239.258,"Yes, I think it's--"
1979.78-1076,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3239.258,3241.484,--Innis no more than overheard a conversation between the officers?
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3241.484,3246.546,--entirely clear on that point.
1979.78-1076,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3323.617,3325.398,"You use the term ""psychological pressure."""
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3331.079,3332.251,I'm equating the two.
1979.78-1076,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3332.251,3332.639,All right.
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3338.387,3339.114,"Yes, but by--"
1979.78-1076,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3339.114,3340.926,Placed in custody--
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3340.926,3341.685,There was custody.
1979.78-1076,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3341.685,3344.43,--and then add interrogation to custody.
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3344.43,3347.384,"And by interrogation, I mean some further pressure."
1979.78-1076,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3347.384,3347.914,Right.
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3347.914,3356.288,"I think that as the Miranda Court noted, much of modern police interrogative procedures are psychologically oriented."
1979.78-1076,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3359.653,3366.959,And you think that whether or not there was interrogation is a question of law or a question of fact?
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3366.959,3375.237,"I think the ultimate question of whether there was interrogation is a question of law, but oftentimes it will be determined by findings of fact."
1979.78-1076,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3375.237,3376.776,But we don't have any findings here.
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3376.776,3381.723,I would suggest that the Supreme Court of Rhode Island made several very clear findings of fact.
1979.78-1076,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3381.723,3386.979,"Well, they rejected the contention that no interrogation occurred because the defendant was not addressed personally."
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3397.119,3398.493,I would suggest--
1979.78-1076,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3398.493,3400.266,Nor did the trial court.
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3402.241,3428.607,"I would suggest, Mr. Justice Stevens, that the Supreme Court of Rhode Island based its conclusion that this was interrogation within the meaning of Miranda on essentially two findings of fact, one of them made very clearly; and that is, that objectively speaking, the comments in the car were compelling; that they concluded that it was psychological pressure, and therefore it was interrogation."
1979.78-1076,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3459.007,3460.392,"That's your warning sign, counsel."
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3469.332,3470.926,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.78-1076,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3537.536,3551.456,"Well, what the Supreme Court of the State thought was erroneously admitted into evidence here was the shotgun itself, plus testimony as to the circumstances of its discovery; is that correct?"
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3551.456,3555.269,"Well, and testimony regarding two incriminating admissions made by Innis."
1979.78-1076,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3555.269,3556.827,Which were what?
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3556.827,3560.807,"They were, in effect, two agreements to lead Innis to the shotgun."
1979.78-1076,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3560.807,3562.853,"Well, that's the circumstances under which it was discovered."
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3570.964,3572.147,No; the record indicates no.
1979.78-1076,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3572.147,3578.547,"So it's the introduction of the shotgun, and the fact that he had led the officers to discover it?"
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3578.547,3583.651,"Yes, both his oral and actual physical contact."
1979.78-1076,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3583.651,3587.817,Is there any issue of inevitable discovery in this case?
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3587.817,3594.6,The State raised inevitable discovery on a petition for reargument that was denied on procedural grounds.
1979.78-1076,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3597.78,3599.672,Didn't discuss it?
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3599.672,3608.749,"And I would suggest that at least on the present record, the issue is not capable of factual resolution, let alone legal resolution."
1979.78-1076,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3616.323,3619.698,"And how, in fact, was it concealed, and where?"
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3619.698,3626.887,"To the best of my knowledge, on a reading of the record, that it was concealed in some field under some rocks."
1979.78-1076,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3631.11,3638.583,"Even if the gun would inevitably have been discovered, that wouldn't answer the problem about the oral testimony linking the defendant to the gun?"
1979.78-1076,1,31805,john_a_macfadyen_iii,,3638.583,3645.016,"No, and in that regard, I would like to emphasize that it is really the oral testimony that we're most concerned with."
1979.78-1076,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3677.879,3678.216,Very well.
1979.78-1076,2,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,3682.306,3683.969,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1076,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3728.842,3731.71,"Well, that's--Miranda held that it was, didn't it?"
1979.78-1076,2,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,3731.71,3732.96,"Mere custody; I don't believe it did, Mr. Justice--"
1979.78-1076,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3732.96,3736.942,"Yes, and then any interrogation of a person in custody."
1979.78-1076,2,21418,dennis_j_roberts_ii,,3736.942,3737.596,"Oh, yes, yes."
1979.78-1076,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3878.572,3879.363,"Thank you, gentlemen."
