2000.99-1953,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.371,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 99-1953, The District of Columbia v. Tri County Industries."
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,10.774,15.315,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1953,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,87.433,94.575,"I thought that the court of appeals used the expression, a more searching inquiry than had the motion been denied."
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,97.919,102.46,"I'm sorry, more searching inquiry is the phrase that they do use."
2000.99-1953,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,102.46,111.005,"And they use the term, more searching inquiry, as I understand it, to compare it with the sort of inquiry where the district court has denied the motion for a new trial?"
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,111.005,111.459,Yes.
2000.99-1953,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,111.459,114.432,Certainly it's comparing it with something.
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,114.432,120.664,"Yes, and there are also other distinctions about the sort of error that's involved, but yes."
2000.99-1953,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,120.664,132.264,Is it your position that it is exactly the same inquiry in the court of appeals whether a district court grants a motion for a new trial or denies it?
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,132.264,138.291,"Yes, Your Honor, it is, and our position is, can any rational judge have made that decision."
2000.99-1953,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,138.291,157.61,"It seems somehow counterintuitive, though I realize that doesn't make it wrong, that where a district... where the trial judge is in effect giving effect to the jury's verdict, he shouldn't get a more lenient standard of review than when he disapproves it or sets it aside."
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,157.61,160.748,"I don't think, on analysis, it is."
2000.99-1953,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,194.035,196.991,But that's true whether he denies the motion or grants it.
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,196.991,197.734,--That's true.
2000.99-1953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,212.678,222.337,"Well, when you say what this is ultimately rooted in, I mean, whatever decision we come out with has to be ultimately rooted in the Seventh Amendment, I assume."
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,222.337,222.337,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,222.337,241.079,"And the Seventh Amendment certainly has quite different application when you're talking about a trial judge who has accepted the jury's verdict and, on the other hand, a trial judge who has rejected the jury verdict, in effect overridden it and said we have to have a new trial."
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,248.798,260.332,"Well, the... there is one minor difference, and that is, the court has to look to whether the trial court applied the proper standard."
2000.99-1953,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,273.69,285.661,"Sometimes the evidence would be evidence that juries have particular ability to evaluate, or at least the power is given to them saying witness demeanor."
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,339.946,351.835,"That's true, but the trial judge has a much better take on both the force of the evidence and the impact on the jury."
2000.99-1953,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,351.835,354.686,"No, if that's true, would you be satisfied with that result?"
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,376.606,383.005,I think that's implicit in the great weight of the evidence part of the test.
2000.99-1953,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,388.661,396.091,"Oh, well then are we arguing about anything other than just, which is often true in such cases, words?"
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,396.091,403.688,I think the words have had real consequences in appellate review.
2000.99-1953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,441.089,455.95,"Do you think that a jury verdict can be against the great weight of the evidence when the only thing that the judge disagrees with, the trial judge, is the jury's evaluation of credibility?"
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,455.95,457.974,There are--
2000.99-1953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,457.974,461.318,Can that possibly be against the great weight of the evidence?
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,461.318,464.002,--There are a... my answer is yes.
2000.99-1953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,464.002,464.29,And if... let me tell you why I asked the question--
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,464.29,465.488,My answer is yes it can be.
2000.99-1953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,465.488,477.831,"--because if not... if not, then the court of appeals is fully able to evaluate the issue as effectively as the trial judge is."
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,477.831,483.487,"There are, Justice Scalia, a range of different kinds of credibility determinations."
2000.99-1953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,531.95,536.491,"Well, that's queer... that's a queer description of credibility."
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,570.137,582.769,"If we're talking about what I would call eyeball credibility, the courts are... the circuits are in disagreement as to whether the trial judge can reevaluate that independently."
2000.99-1953,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,582.919,592.14,"Mr. Reischel, I wasn't of the view that this turns... this power relates only to the credibility of witnesses."
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,636.145,636.311,That's true.
2000.99-1953,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,636.311,640.232,But it's a sense that the judge has that something went wrong at this trial.
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,640.232,644.773,"That's true, and the judge here made two kinds of findings."
2000.99-1953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,683.577,687.549,Those things... my point maybe wasn't clear.
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,719.472,732.947,"--Well, the court of appeals can't see the witnesses, and it can't see the jury, and it can't tell what impact a particular witness might have on the jury."
2000.99-1953,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,769.727,781.101,"Doesn't that go to the credibility of the expert, whether what he relies on is worthy of credence by the fact-finder?"
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,781.101,786.552,"It goes to the probative force, I think, of his testimony."
2000.99-1953,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,786.552,789.153,"How much weight you should give the testimony, which I thought--"
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,789.153,790.35,"That's correct, and that--"
2000.99-1953,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,790.35,792.203,--is a form of credibility.
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,792.203,798.247,"--That's right, Justice O'Connor, and that's precisely what the trial court could weigh and what an appellate court cannot weigh."
2000.99-1953,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,798.247,806.61,"Well, but that's precisely what the jury, the fact-finder must determine, and in this case it was a jury."
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,815.094,816.08,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1953,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,833.527,857.487,"Okay. Well, if it is abuse of discretion there is still room within that standard, I suppose, to say that a jury fact-finder determination on credibility of witnesses is not to be disturbed by the trial judge, and if the trial judge does, it's an abuse of discretion."
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,857.487,862.178,But this wasn't simply eyeball credibility.
2000.99-1953,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,884.104,888.724,"Yes, but didn't the jury discount his testimony by about 50 percent anyway?"
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,888.724,897.94,"--The jury discounted his testimony, but the jury still came up with a 4.64 million dollar return--"
2000.99-1953,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,897.94,898.206,And he said it should have been--
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,898.206,900.227,--on a 9 million dollar investment.
2000.99-1953,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,900.227,903.585,"--Well, I understand, but he said it should have been twice that amount, didn't he?"
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,903.585,905.304,He said... yes.
2000.99-1953,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,929.297,945.844,"I understand all that, but I thought it was fairly elementary damage law that if you prove the fact of damage, and I guess that was proved here, that... and if there isn't a clear measure of damage out there, the jury's allowed quite a bit of leeway in figuring the amount of damage, and here they took half the expert's--"
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,945.844,951.385,The question is whether or not the damage assessment is a reasonable one.
2000.99-1953,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,951.385,952.121,--Correct.
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,952.121,965.896,"And where Tri County's own evidence is that the last person who entered failed, it's a shrinking industry, and that prices are being driven down just barely to cover costs, it's not reasonable to--"
2000.99-1953,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,965.896,967.982,But you didn't take the position there was no damage.
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,967.982,968.782,--No.
2000.99-1953,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,968.982,971.837,You took the position the amount was exaggerated.
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,971.837,974.509,"--The judge didn't take that position, either."
2000.99-1953,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1017.52,1021.392,"Well, how did the judge explain the million dollars, other than that was just a further discount?"
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,1025.48,1049.873,"--I think what he was finding was, if one looks just at the industry testimony, that is DiRenzo's testimony, that there was a slight boost for this industry in D.C. because transportation costs were slightly better, so one could say that they might be entitled to make a modest return on investment."
2000.99-1953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1056.684,1057.284,Mr. Reischel--
2000.99-1953,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1057.284,1072.445,"--What we've got here, Mr. Reischel, the question before us is the standard that the court of appeals should have applied, as opposed to, perhaps, what it did apply, not whether it was right or wrong in this particular case."
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,1072.445,1073.245,"--Right, but--"
2000.99-1953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1073.245,1085.234,"I was about to make the same suggestion, and the discussion we're having, it seems to me, demonstrates quite clearly that an appellate court can inquire into this matter just as effectively as the district court."
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,1085.234,1085.534,--As I read--
2000.99-1953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1085.534,1092.278,"You know, you're making points that are there on the record, and reflected in the record material."
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,1092.278,1098.538,"--Well, as I read Gasperini, appellate courts are not allowed to weigh evidence."
2000.99-1953,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1102.327,1111.51,"Mr. Reischel, I'd like to clear the air on Gasperini, because frankly I don't think it has anything to do with this case."
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,1133.031,1134.517,--Weigh evidence.
2000.99-1953,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1134.517,1144.333,"The only one who can do it is the trial court judge, so Gasperini had to do with the control authority of a trial court judge."
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,1165.925,1193.557,"No, Gasperini doesn't talk about the difference between grants and denials, but the linchpin of Gasperini as I read it, in terms of assessing facts, is, they're quoting Dagnello v. Long Island, whether there has been... there must be an upper limit, and whether that has been surpassed is not a question of fact with respect to which reasonable men may differ, but a question of law."
2000.99-1953,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1229.04,1232.012,"Well, there's a difference, too, when we're talking about--"
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,1232.012,1232.012,There's no--
2000.99-1953,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1232.012,1242.665,"--is the flaw the excessive damages, or is it some other thing that went wrong so that the wrong person won."
2000.99-1953,0,19921,charles_s_reischel,,1270.331,1270.908,--That's correct.
2000.99-1953,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1338.956,1352.885,"Mr. Reischel, you're still arguing the merits of this particular ruling and what the court of appeals did with it, rather than fitting it into a standard argument."
2000.99-1953,1,23881,frank_j_emig,,1814.327,1820.642,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1953,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1853.874,1862.419,"But if a rational trier of fact could not have reached that conclusion, it isn't setting aside a jury verdict JMOL."
2000.99-1953,1,23881,frank_j_emig,,1871.707,1872.162,That's correct.
2000.99-1953,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1875.051,1882.276,So you say there's no difference between JNOV and setting aside a jury verdict that's contrary to the great weight of the evidence.
2000.99-1953,1,23881,frank_j_emig,,1885.431,1889.046,"No, I don't think I'm going to that extent, Your Honor."
2000.99-1953,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1912.163,1922.194,"But by hypothesis there a rational jury could reach a verdict in favor of the party whom it did, but there are other considerations brought to bear."
2000.99-1953,1,23881,frank_j_emig,,1933.356,1958.026,"--There are situations in which a new trial can be granted, you're correct, that deal with improper instructions, improper admissions of evidence, I would agree with that, but to the extent of a verdict being against the clear weight of the evidence, if a rational trier of fact could come to the same conclusion as that jury, then I don't think it should be set aside by a trial judge."
2000.99-1953,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1958.026,1977.717,"Okay, but you also accept the distinction that there is a distinction between whether an issue of damages can go to the jury, i.e., is there enough evidence to get it to the jury, and on the other hand the question whether the jury's verdict of damages should be set aside as against the great weight of the evidence because it's excessive."
2000.99-1953,1,23881,frank_j_emig,,1977.717,1978.088,Yes--
2000.99-1953,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1978.088,1978.238,Yes.
2000.99-1953,1,23881,frank_j_emig,,1978.238,1978.981,--I do see a distinction.
2000.99-1953,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1978.981,1986.949,"Okay, well, if you do accept that distinction, then what is your criterion for whether it ever gets to the jury or not?"
2000.99-1953,1,23881,frank_j_emig,,1995.122,1997.268,I think it--
2000.99-1953,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1997.268,2006.845,"And I assume it is not, therefore, whether a rational jury, on the basis of this evidence, could reach that result, which is your standard for a new trial."
2000.99-1953,1,23881,frank_j_emig,,2009.9,2019.848,"--Well, certainly the JNOV is phrased in the light most favorable to the party that is seeking, or that the judgment is being sought against."
2000.99-1953,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2019.848,2020.674,"Yes, but isn't the--"
2000.99-1953,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2020.674,2034.503,"--That's the distinction, that for JNOV you do not have to view all the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, that... I'm sorry, for a new trial you don't have to regard all the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff."
2000.99-1953,1,23881,frank_j_emig,,2038.878,2040.614,I think that--
2000.99-1953,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2040.614,2041.851,That would be a distinction.
2000.99-1953,1,23881,frank_j_emig,,2041.851,2053.163,"--That would be, and I think the rules under Rule 50 do talk in terms of phrasing it, or phrase it more in terms of in a light more favorable to the plaintiff, or to the--"
2000.99-1953,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2053.163,2083.255,"What we've got here, Mr.... some fundamentals first, and that is, a refusal of the trial judge to let the case go to the jury on the directed verdict against the plaintiff and a judgement as a matter of law, or call it that, or granting a motion for a judgment as a matter of law after the jury returns a verdict is the rational basis standard."
2000.99-1953,1,23881,frank_j_emig,,2117.807,2124.866,"--Well, I think the court has to decide whether there is a conflict in the evidence."
2000.99-1953,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2133.577,2146.209,"But you're just... when you start talking about, could a reasonable jury have reached the result, you're back to the judgment NOV, or judgment MOL as they call it now, rather than weight of the evidence."
2000.99-1953,1,23881,frank_j_emig,,2146.209,2155.702,--I think that's the only way I can explain how a trial judge should look at the evidence in terms of whether or not a new trial should be granted.
2000.99-1953,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2168.788,2170.729,"Well, what is... what should be the standard?"
2000.99-1953,1,23881,frank_j_emig,,2170.729,2181.503,"I think it should be the standard that was referred to in the Honda v. Oberg case, a... could a rational trier of fact reach the same conclusion as the jury."
2000.99-1953,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2181.503,2183.361,What does Wright and Miller say?
