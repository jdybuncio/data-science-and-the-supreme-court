2010.09-520,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.289,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-520, CSX Transportation v. The Alabama Department of Revenue."
2010.09-520,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,11.306,13.558,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-520,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,54.235,74.298,"But in light of our AFC case, it seems to me that what you are arguing is that the statute -- the effect of your argument is that the statute gives more protection in the case of non-property taxes than property taxes, and that's an -- an odd reading of the statute, which is directed primarily to the -- to the property tax."
2010.09-520,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,74.298,98.83,"No, I think, Justice Kennedy, what we are doing is recognizing that Congress was very specific and very explicit about how to treat property taxes and set up an entire quite carefully articulated scheme in dealing with them in (b)(1) and (b)(3), and then said, in general, when you are dealing with areas that are not approved by (b)(1) and (b)(3), then you have to examine whether or not the overall scheme, in fact, discriminates against rail carriers."
2010.09-520,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,118.243,121.195,But what's the -- what's the possible rationale for that distinction?
2010.09-520,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,123.045,130.632,"Well, I think because Congress didn't have the full run mine of possibilities in front of it at that point in time."
2010.09-520,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,157.782,160.984,--in the legislative record?
2010.09-520,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,160.984,175.827,"Not -- there's very little in the legislative record, Your Honor, because the -- the specific formulation of -- of this (b)(4) catch-all provision comes in very, very late in the 15-year process."
2010.09-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,208.429,230.676,"Mr. Phillips, this is what troubles me about -- about your position: You make a viscerally appealing case on the facts of this case, where you say that your clients, the railroads, are being taxed more than competing carriers, truckers and -- and water carriers."
2010.09-520,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,253.625,256.493,"That -- that -- no, I don't believe that's the necessary--"
2010.09-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,256.493,256.743,Why?
2010.09-520,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,264.414,270.401,"--Well, I think it -- it is discrimination that Congress would have intended to prohibit under these circumstances."
2010.09-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,282.541,283.175,Why -- why do you assume that?
2010.09-520,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,287.377,299.185,"--Well, it -- it did to some extent, because there was a whole question about how -- you know, you had a whole comparative class that Congress defines in the property context."
2010.09-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,307.171,311.723,But not -- not just the industrial and -- and commercial competitors with the railroads.
2010.09-520,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,320.246,332.554,"--To be sure, Justice Scalia, but it was still as compared to the entirety of the industrial and commercial property base, and it was -- and the analysis has traditionally been the averages of the commercial industrial property."
2010.09-520,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,343.092,352.717,"But in this case -- correct me if I'm wrong -- off-road users, agricultural users, and construction and timber companies--"
2010.09-520,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,352.717,353.333,--Right.
2010.09-520,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,353.333,355.669,--have the same -- have the same tax structure as the railroads.
2010.09-520,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,355.669,356.419,Right.
2010.09-520,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,356.419,366.375,"So there is an objective reference, neutral, and it seems to me that that's just quite rational to put the railroads there and not in the category of road -- road users."
2010.09-520,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,377.713,384.902,"Well, but -- remember, Justice Kennedy, we don't even get to this issue if what you say is we are going to take all exemptions off the table."
2010.09-520,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,415.837,431.263,"I thought the concern was that the interstate actors should not be disadvantaged vis-a-vis the home people, the local businesses, and that was what was achieved."
2010.09-520,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,450.474,467.619,"That's -- that's correct, Justice Ginsberg, but I think the premise of your -- of your question is the place where we would probably differ, which is: To be sure, Congress intended to protect interstate carriers against discrimination in favor of local operations."
2010.09-520,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,493.003,513.5,"Suppose a -- suppose a tax were structured so that the same tax applied to railroads and -- and -- and motor transport, but because of the way the tax was assessed, the railroads paid far more per mile than -- than the -- than the road transport."
2010.09-520,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,522.355,523.788,--I can see us making that argument--
2010.09-520,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,523.788,524.955,"--in case -- in case number two, welcome back."
2010.09-520,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,526.39,542.4,"--Well, I always like to come back, but I don't -- I think the answer to that is -- again, I think the -- the Court ought to interpret the term ""discrimination"" against the clear objectives that Congress intended to fulfill when it protected the railroads this way."
2010.09-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,574.221,578.359,So -- so 85-year-old widows would be covered?
2010.09-520,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,586.179,589.214,"Well, they would have -- they would be, to be sure, local interests."
2010.09-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,609.442,621.785,"I agree with that, and that makes me suspect that Congress didn't -- didn't want to forbid exemptions in (b)(4)."
2010.09-520,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,621.785,645.384,"--But it seems to me quite -- I mean, the flip side of that argument would be to say, if they imposed the tax of 4 percent on the railroads and 2 percent on 85-year-old widows, that would be challengeable under (b)(4), because it's not an exemption, it's a differential, and that the exemption down to zero is -- is attackable under (b)(4)."
2010.09-520,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,697.447,708.886,"Mr. Phillips, are you saying that the -- the railroads have to be taxed in the very same way as, say, the -- the trucks?"
2010.09-520,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,741.956,751.896,"I think, ultimately, my conclusion would be that you can't have one -- you can't have this kind of a tax on us and not tax the motor carriers the same way."
2010.09-520,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,814.746,834.326,"Well, why does the course for the court -- taking account of what you said, that the provision about other taxes came out very late in the day -- they had spent a lot of time talking about the property tax."
2010.09-520,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,860.96,871.916,"Well, I think part of the reason, it may well be because the property tax was a big-ticket item, so you were trying to protect certain State interests, and Congress did it very clearly."
2010.09-520,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,931.37,931.987,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
2010.09-520,1,36639,melissa_a_sherry,,950.266,953.801,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-520,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1006.417,1016.709,Do you think we have to decide whether the appropriate comparison class is the rail carriers' competitors or some broader class?
2010.09-520,1,36639,melissa_a_sherry,,1016.709,1019.244,I don't think the Court has to decide it.
2010.09-520,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1179.236,1190.025,"Ms. Sherry, there seems to be a question as to what remedy somebody would be entitled to under subsection (c) in the challenge brought against a tax exemption."
2010.09-520,1,36639,melissa_a_sherry,,1192.127,1205.97,"The government's position, first with respect to subsection (c), is that it is a broad grant of jurisdiction to the district courts to adjudicate all violations of subsection (b), and that seems clear from the first sentence in that provision."
2010.09-520,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1253.746,1280.397,"I think Justice Kagan meant to ask, assuming that we say yes, it -- it applies; exemptions don't count -- are included in whether there is discrimination, and the Court finds discrimination between the way the railroad is taxed and the way motor carriers are taxed, what -- what then?"
2010.09-520,1,36639,melissa_a_sherry,,1281.147,1290.002,"I think in that type of case the remedy would be for the rail carrier to be exempt from the tax, and that's because what subsection (c) provides--"
2010.09-520,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1290.002,1293.387,"Without -- without putting on -- I mean, the motor carriers do have the tax."
2010.09-520,1,36639,melissa_a_sherry,,1293.387,1294.92,"--Oh, I apologize."
2010.09-520,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1326.788,1338.429,"Well -- well, but in any case when you have discrimination, you can remedy it by reducing the tax, for example, in this case on the railroad or by increasing the tax on the people who are otherwise exempt."
2010.09-520,1,36639,melissa_a_sherry,,1338.429,1339.364,And I don't--
2010.09-520,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1339.364,1343.666,A decision that I suppose would be left at some point or another up to the State.
2010.09-520,1,36639,melissa_a_sherry,,1343.666,1360.276,"--It would certainly be left up to the State and the State could choose to remedy it in -- in any number of different ways, including the one that Your Honor suggests, but the remedy that is actually provided for in subsection (c) for the Federal court to issue is to enjoin the discriminatory portion of the tax, and the focus is on the tax--"
2010.09-520,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1360.276,1369.865,But the discriminary -- the discriminary portion of the tax may be regarded as the excess that is imposed on the railroad or the deficiency on -- on the others.
2010.09-520,1,36639,melissa_a_sherry,,1369.865,1379.505,"--I -- I think it's better understood as -- as -- as speaking specifically to the tax itself, and not to the tax exemption."
2010.09-520,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1403.184,1414.908,"You present the case to us as if it's either/or: That we must either in disagreement with your position, to say that it doesn't apply to exemptions; or if it applies to exemptions, it must be remanded."
2010.09-520,1,36639,melissa_a_sherry,,1430.249,1452.014,"I -- I don't know that the Court has to -- has to go with one or the other, but I think the Court should not hold that it only applies to exemptions to the -- to the extent it's the type of tax where it's generally applicable on its face, but everyone is exempt except for the rail carriers, or everyone is exempt except for the rail carriers and maybe some targeted and isolated group, as -- as this Court recognized in ACF."
2010.09-520,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1508.48,1516.901,"It doesn't make any -- any sense, you are quite right; but -- but Congress thought it made sense in (1) to (3), so why doesn't it make sense in (4)?"
2010.09-520,1,36639,melissa_a_sherry,,1516.901,1517.651,--I think--
2010.09-520,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1517.651,1518.785,That's the argument.
2010.09-520,1,36639,melissa_a_sherry,,1518.785,1534.03,"--I think the reason that Congress thought it made sense in (1) through (3) and the reason that this Court in ACF concluded that Congress wanted to permit property tax exemptions is because of the language of (1), (2) -- (1) through (3), and because of the very specific comparison class that is provided there."
2010.09-520,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1553.091,1554.308,You can finish the sentence.
2010.09-520,1,36639,melissa_a_sherry,,1554.308,1559.411,"I don't know if I will get to the point, but suffice it to say--"
2010.09-520,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1559.411,1560.428,Use a lot of conjunctions.
2010.09-520,1,36639,melissa_a_sherry,,1561.094,1562.78,--I'm not surprised.
2010.09-520,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1562.78,1564.565,Don't even try.
2010.09-520,1,36639,melissa_a_sherry,,1564.565,1574.421,"The point is: (B)(4) doesn't talk about property; it talks about discrimination against the rail carrier, and the comparison class is nowhere to be found in that subsection."
2010.09-520,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1574.421,1575.504,"Thank you, Counsel."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,1582.694,1584.894,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-520,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1634.224,1645.513,"Well, it may be because the universe of non-property taxes is -- so infinitely large that there's a much greater room for -- a much great danger of discrimination."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,1647.615,1648.681,Right.
2010.09-520,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1703.982,1714.771,"Well, you are arguing in favor of -- you are arguing in favor of a very idiosyncratic interpretation of the concept of a discriminatory tax, aren't you?"
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,1728.347,1728.513,Yes.
2010.09-520,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1740.905,1752.212,"And it did so with explicit language by -- in -- what is it -- (a)(4), by referring to property that is subject to a property tax levy."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,1752.212,1752.662,--Right.
2010.09-520,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1752.662,1769.488,"So what you're saying is that the ordinary interpretation of the concept of a discriminatory tax should not be applied here, because Congress used specific language to take tax exemptions out of the determination of discrimination under other provisions."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,1769.488,1770.274,My--
2010.09-520,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1770.274,1771.49,What sense does that make?
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,1771.49,1772.557,--I'm sorry?
2010.09-520,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1772.557,1773.909,What sense does that make?
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,1787.717,1787.967,Right.
2010.09-520,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1804.474,1804.64,Excuse me.
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,1825.137,1825.703,Right.
2010.09-520,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1825.703,1827.92,Everybody else pays 4 percent.
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,1831.374,1834.492,"No, because they are paying a generally applicable 4 percent tax."
2010.09-520,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1836.159,1842.413,"But this is not an exemption area, so what meaning do you give -- that's what I'm trying to figure out."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,1853.287,1859.124,"--I'm giving the meaning the same meaning that the Court suggested in ACF; that is, (b)(4) is a tax."
2010.09-520,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1862.326,1864.909,"Well, you can single out the railroads through exemptions."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,1889.31,1896.38,"I'm saying that a tax that in effect, in the end, singles out the railroads because they are the only ones that pay it; that would be discrimination."
2010.09-520,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1896.38,1896.73,Okay.
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,1903.2,1905.902,"Well, then again, the tax wouldn't be generally applicable."
2010.09-520,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1909.902,1916.156,We can determine that a tax is not generally applicable based on the exemptions.
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,1927.131,1927.214,--No.
2010.09-520,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1943.288,1952.327,"So if there's 100 businesses, where does the line between singling out the railroad get drawn?"
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,1971.686,1978.756,"--Well, again, I would say that you use the phrase -- see, I know that singling out is not the best answer, but the lower courts have looked at it."
2010.09-520,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1984.993,2010.144,"What sense would there be for Congress to use the word 4 percent like everyone else, but their competitors, for no reason other than that the State wants to favor the water carrier, is only paying 2 percent?"
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2018.565,2022.283,Because Congress understood that exemptions for individual businesses--
2010.09-520,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2022.283,2023.283,I'm not talking about an exemption.
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2024.902,2032.806,"--If you are given a rate difference, a benefit of any kind to an individual business, Congress understood that that is important to the State."
2010.09-520,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2057.985,2072.912,"So it's a commodity that is purchased by only railroads and one other class, and there is a 4 percent sales tax on this commodity, but the other class is exempt from the tax."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2076.799,2078.666,Can you explain the classes again?
2010.09-520,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2078.666,2091.139,"Let's say there is some commodity that is purchased only by railroads and truckers, and there is a 4 percent tax on the commodity, but truckers are exempt from it -- from the tax."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2098.876,2099.876,No.
2010.09-520,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2110.982,2121.806,"Once you say that, your argument that exemptions can't count as discrimination is destroyed, because you are conceding that an exemption can constitute discrimination."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2121.806,2126.091,"At that point, as the Court said in ACF, it's not an exemption scheme anymore."
2010.09-520,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2137.398,2147.27,"Then you need to give us a test, and the test is whether or not the railroad is singled out as a target group for discrimination."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2147.27,2147.537,Yes.
2010.09-520,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2147.537,2148.92,"Something like that -- for discrimination, something like that."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2148.92,2152.241,And that's the test that just Judge Posner gave in the ACF case.
2010.09-520,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2158.478,2158.978,I'm sorry.
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2160.961,2170.369,"--The test is -- as long as it is a generally applicable tax that does not single out or target the railroads, it is not subject to challenge."
2010.09-520,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2171.102,2174.137,I'm sure I'm just repeating mysself here.
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2185.862,2189.73,--You mean how small the business is that is actually paying the tax?
2010.09-520,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2189.73,2190.364,Right.
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2190.364,2193.448,"That's a question for the Court -- excuse me, choked."
2010.09-520,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2195.65,2196.233,Exactly.
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2204.573,2205.389,Right.
2010.09-520,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2206.389,2208.239,"If I'm right, that means you lose the case--"
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2208.239,2209.022,No.
2010.09-520,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2209.022,2224.267,"--at least as the question presented has been addressed, because all we are deciding -- I understand you think we ought to decide more, but all we are deciding is: Can (b)(4) ever come into play when the discrimination arises from an exemption?"
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2253.017,2224.267,No.
2010.09-520,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2259.754,2266.408,"So to answer that question, you are telling us that we have to define what discrimination means?"
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2266.408,2275.263,I think inherently you have to understand what another tax that discriminates is before you can say whether something is subject to challenge as another tax that discriminates.
2010.09-520,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2319.006,2319.875,That's what railroads do.
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2319.875,2320.475,--Sure.
2010.09-520,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2320.475,2332.35,"But it still doesn't get to the question that in courts in each particular case will be able to decide, even under your test, whether it singles out railroads."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2351.244,2356.446,"And, again, if we adopt a test, which we believe is the right test, the Eleventh Circuit has already done it in this case."
2010.09-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2362.433,2368.587,"Haven't you just pushed all the difficult questions into the word ""generally applicable""?"
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2376.96,2378.426,Right.
2010.09-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2378.426,2379.144,Except for railroads.
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2379.144,2379.578,Right.
2010.09-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2379.578,2380.694,"All right, now."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2388.5,2389.667,Right.
2010.09-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2389.667,2389.75,All right.
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2406.824,2414.58,Here's the problem the State has with that -- and you almost channelled what Mr. Phillips said earlier -- that we leave it to courts to determine discrimination.
2010.09-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2414.58,2415.413,What is the choice?
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2415.413,2417.532,"Well, this is a State tax."
2010.09-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2430.672,2435.326,"I realize that, but what they are worried about is somebody that's having passed on the property level--"
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2435.326,2435.809,--Right.
2010.09-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2435.809,2438.195,--thinks I have a great revenue-raising idea.
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2460.459,2460.992,Right.
2010.09-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2462.644,2466.012,"No, because you're saying that's not generally applicable."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2496.965,2507.254,"--And -- and, again, the problem we would have with that is now you are going to have two different definitions of what another tax that discriminates in (b)(4) for property taxes, which CSX agreed applies to property taxes--"
2010.09-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2507.254,2509.539,"The property taxes, the language is different."
2010.09-520,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2509.539,2511.722,I didn't understand your last answer.
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2512.155,2520.245,--CSX argues on page 8 and 9 of the reply brief that with regard to property taxes (b)(4) would apply if the tax singles out the railroads.
2010.09-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2557.249,2560.768,"You are assuming how the Court will decide the word ""discriminate""."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2560.768,2561.12,--Yes.
2010.09-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2561.12,2564.322,"I understand what you are saying, and so would every other judge."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2578.396,2584.483,Because Congress didn't clearly put in the statute that we want a different definition for discrimination when we have one.
2010.09-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2584.483,2588.518,There is no way -- there is no way with the property -- the property tax is tough.
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2604.444,2604.861,Right.
2010.09-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2604.861,2611.098,And -- and it might not be so that every State in the country has particular taxes on diesel fuel.
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2620.537,2626.893,"I think that if -- well, first of all, every State taxes diesel, at least for truckers, and most do for the trains."
2010.09-520,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2663.881,2665.5,It's not quite -- it's not quite that.
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2687.33,2691.048,--I think the other side would tell you that we can't give a justification.
2010.09-520,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2693.15,2694.067,In their particular facts of their case.
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2711.696,2713.361,--But that is logically what would happen.
2010.09-520,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2713.361,2715.563,"Well, so far, yes, unless they can give--"
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2715.563,2719.599,They haven't articulated a way yet from preventing that from happening.
2010.09-520,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2719.599,2726.503,"Yes, but I don't understand why you think it is -- it is more articulable on your theory than on theirs."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2764.476,2767.328,"What I have been saying, yes, a tax doesn't discriminate--"
2010.09-520,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2767.328,2773.398,"So, it's twiddle dum or twiddle dee, maybe we should, you know, dismiss this as improvidently granted, it doesn't make any difference."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2773.398,2777.552,--I -- I would have no problem if you dismiss it improvidently granted.
2010.09-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2783.773,2786.808,"No, but it's not quite, because this is the same problem I was raising."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2815.708,2818.01,"The -- the statute actually does use the word ""generally applicable""."
2010.09-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2820.112,2821.362,"I'll believe you, I'll believe you."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2821.929,2831.368,"--Well, but it makes a good point in the original version of (b)(3), you could not levy a tax against a leveler property tax at a tax rate higher than the tax rate generally--"
2010.09-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2831.368,2845.026,"The word -- the word I was looking at was is 4, impose another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier providing transportation, subject to the jurisdiction of the board under this part."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2853.281,2853.631,--Right.
2010.09-520,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2898.427,2910.385,"Do you think section 11501(c) is relevant to all these disputes, because one thing 11501(c) does is give the State a little bit of a break?"
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2910.385,2910.837,--Right.
2010.09-520,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2910.837,2916.139,They recognize that it is hard to have exact equality in terms of ad valorem property assessment.
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2919.424,2919.891,Yes.
2010.09-520,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2919.891,2928.613,"Couldn't you, if we rule against you, when you get back and other State officials say, look, the one thing we don't have to worry about is being precise."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2945.872,2952.792,"Textually that's a problem because the 5 percent in it only applies to assessment ratio problems in (b)(1) and (b)(2), and the rest--"
2010.09-520,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2952.792,2953.276,"No, I know."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2964.297,2968.035,--I -- I don't think at that point the courts have any idea what they can do.
2010.09-520,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2977.724,2980.009,"But you don't know what ""generally applicable"" means."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2980.009,2982.961,--It simply means that you apply--
2010.09-520,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2982.961,2983.495,At least I don't know.
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,2984.711,2989.513,--Because I know that everyone who pays the diesel fuel tax pays 4 percent.
2010.09-520,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3011.576,3018.514,It clearly -- it clearly applies to (b)(1) through (3) and has got nothing to do with (b)(4) because it can't apply to (b)(4).
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,3018.514,3020.864,"Well, then it says relief can't be granted."
2010.09-520,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3020.864,3029.886,"(b)(4) is not a -- (b)(4), the whole point is if it's not a property tax, you don't have ad valorem assessments, so the details limiting jurisdiction when you do have ad valorem taxes don't apply to this case at all."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,3029.886,3044.21,"The problem with that is -- that is CSX's argument -- is now you are reading into Congress's intent for the statute and the moment you open up to what Congress's intent for the statute is, we know that Congress didn't intend to make railroads the most favored taxpayers in any way."
2010.09-520,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3106.69,3108.459,How are these any different from property taxes?
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,3118.064,3119.131,Right.
2010.09-520,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3120.197,3121.933,Before deciding whether or not you are discriminating against the railroads.
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,3121.933,3127.17,"--Again, because Congress understood that exemptions are a -- an integral part of the State's tax policy."
2010.09-520,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3131.139,3132.205,--I'm having a problem.
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,3148.916,3150.618,--No.
2010.09-520,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3150.618,3162.01,"So it doesn't really matter that it's a tax exemption; you are just saying if the tax is a positive imposition or a negative one, taking someone out, it doesn't matter."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,3162.01,3164.293,"Right, because that's the way it works for property taxes."
2010.09-520,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3290.088,3299.261,What -- what authority do you have for the proposition that the clear statement rule applies to the exercise of the congressional power under the Commerce Clause?
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,3299.877,3300.277,A--
2010.09-520,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3300.277,3303.665,--some general rule that we've always had?
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,3303.665,3309.485,"--ACF actually applied the clear statement rule, not only said it applied, it said it compelled the ruling in this case."
2010.09-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3342.206,3353.079,"Yes, but in all these years where they never challenged it, did all these other States not only tax their diesel fuel, but at the same time exempt the diesel fuel tax from all their competitors."
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,3353.079,3353.597,Absolutely.
2010.09-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3355.83,3360.084,"What's the rationale, that the trucks don't have to say it but the railroads do?"
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,3360.084,3361.684,--Because Federal law makes us do it.
2010.09-520,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3383.898,3385.417,Thank you counsel.
2010.09-520,2,19551,corey_l_maze,,3385.417,3385.917,--Thank you.
2010.09-520,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3385.917,3388.452,"Mr. Phillips, you have 5 minutes remaining."
2010.09-520,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3388.452,3391.987,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-520,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3467.635,3479.51,"Mr. Phillips, do you agree that -- that, generally applicable produces the same -- requires the same inquiry as discriminates?"
2010.09-520,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3479.51,3496.304,"Well, you're ultimately going to have to come down to the same issue, and the problem is, and I -- the reason why I -- I find it hard to accept Justice Kennedy's formulation, which is simply singling out the railroads, because in ACF the Court sort of said well, we will hold that out as a possibility."
2010.09-520,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3514.6,3515.083,So give me a definition of discriminate.
2010.09-520,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3524.74,3525.158,Right.
2010.09-520,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3534.179,3536.465,So what constitutes an adequate justification?
2010.09-520,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3536.465,3544.135,"Well, it depends on the -- it's going to depend on the tax, and I don't know the answer in this context, because as Justice Alito's question reveals--"
2010.09-520,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3544.135,3544.419,Well--
2010.09-520,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3544.419,3546.754,--it could be that the vast majority of diesel fuel is--
2010.09-520,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3546.754,3546.987,--Stop.
2010.09-520,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3581.727,3583.362,--I -- the first one I think without question.
2010.09-520,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3583.362,3583.846,--what isn't?
2010.09-520,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3583.846,3597.087,"I think the second one has more of a problem, because I don't think Congress intended to allow to you favor direct competitors of the railroads when the ultimate effect of that may be to undermine the -- the financial stability of the railroads."
2010.09-520,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3597.087,3598.539,Give me a working principle.
2010.09-520,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3606.026,3607.311,I would define.
2010.09-520,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3607.311,3612.346,--The government reason is always going to be premised on wanting to favor someone for a reason.
2010.09-520,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3612.346,3612.881,Right.
2010.09-520,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3627.106,3629.391,That is the problem because there were two objectives.
2010.09-520,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3636.145,3637.764,Competition among carriers.
2010.09-520,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3637.764,3638.78,--Right.
2010.09-520,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3638.78,3642.382,Which suggests to me that there are two ways to worry about discrimination.
2010.09-520,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3694.517,3695.683,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips, counsel."
