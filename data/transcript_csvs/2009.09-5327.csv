2009.09-5327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.901,"We'll hear argument next in Case 09-5327, Holland v. Florida."
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,6.809,21.615,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It is undisputed that Petitioner was not provided notice that the State supreme court had denied his postconviction appeal and had issued its mandate, with the result being that his AEDPA statute of limitations expired."
2009.09-5327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,29.519,39.264,How do -- what in the record shows us that the failure to tell him that by the lawyer was anything other than negligence?
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,50.241,56.477,"--Well, first of all, we have what the Eleventh Circuit characterized Mr. Collins's conduct as, which was gross negligence."
2009.09-5327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,59.585,61.363,"Well, I'm trying to find the basis for that finding."
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,61.363,63.176,--We have a repeated pattern.
2009.09-5327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,75.702,76.669,But -- but--
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,76.669,78.529,--I'm sorry.
2009.09-5327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,78.529,79.699,--That's what his intent was.
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,79.699,80.307,Correct.
2009.09-5327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,80.307,86.994,"People say I'm going to do something, and they fail to do it often because something else comes up, because something has happened."
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,96.786,108.844,"Well -- well, in terms of that what we have here, for example, is Mr. Collins was given two opportunities -- or the record shows that there were two opportunities for Mr. Collins to provide answers to these very questions."
2009.09-5327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,147.016,152.81,"Well, that -- but that's the case in every case where -- where the lawyer is negligent and doesn't do something that -- that should have been done."
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,152.81,153.746,--Well--
2009.09-5327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,153.746,157.369,"He has assured the client, I will take care of your case, and he doesn't do it."
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,157.369,157.981,"--Well, here we have--"
2009.09-5327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,157.981,158.73,That's all that happened here.
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,158.73,179.424,"--This -- this goes beyond the case of mere, garden-variety negligence that some of the courts have -- have addressed, because here we have a combination of not only a failure -- we have the failure to notify Mr. Holland that the State supreme court has in fact denied its opinion, despite repeated instructions from Holland to Mr. Collins that he file his petition."
2009.09-5327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,180.438,186.779,"The facts here -- the facts here are quite extreme, but I am troubled by where you think the line should be drawn."
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,190.452,196.024,"--No, courts -- and this Court in Lawrence has held, for example, that mere negligence is not sufficient."
2009.09-5327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,198.785,208.986,Well -- the difference between mere negligence and gross negligence -- one of the things I remember most clearly from torts in law school is that that's pretty -- that's an ephemeral distinction.
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,216.859,223.871,"--Well, we know certainly that the floor from -- from cases from this Court and from other courts is this mere or garden-variety negligence."
2009.09-5327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,226.121,227.65,Why should -- why should that be?
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,273.851,275.349,"--Well, this Court--"
2009.09-5327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,275.349,280.316,"I didn't mean to interrupt his line of questioning, but it seems to be consistent with it."
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,280.316,287.094,"--This and other courts have -- have been able to draw that line, and, of course you have to look at the specifics of each particular case, because not only--"
2009.09-5327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,287.094,287.998,But what's the -- what's the point?
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,289.496,291.715,"--Well, the way--"
2009.09-5327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,291.715,296.309,Other than just limit the number of cases in which we are going to set aside convictions?
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,296.309,304.116,"--Well, in some circumstances, courts have just said, unfortunately you lose, your attorney didn't commit -- it was just a mere mistake."
2009.09-5327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,349.411,365.341,"Are you -- are you suggesting that there should be a different standard for those habeas petitioners who are -- whose counsel is appointed for them by the State or by the Federal government, as opposed to just a lawyer they hire?"
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,366.933,368.465,"--No, and I didn't mean to suggest that--"
2009.09-5327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,368.465,368.761,All right.
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,395.345,395.766,--Correct.
2009.09-5327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,395.766,396.281,All right.
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,405.842,416.897,"Correct enough, but I think each -- well, certainly those were some of the individual factors that the Eleventh Circuit discussed when saying gross negligence isn't enough."
2009.09-5327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,419.475,421.631,"You haven't argued why not, is what I'm saying to you."
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,432.097,447.761,"--Because when you look at, for example, in this particular case, when we are talking about an exceptional circumstance, you're talking about a lot of times -- and courts have done this -- is the confluence of what the attorney did or didn't do versus what the petitioner did."
2009.09-5327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,476.594,485.98,We've never held that equitable tolling for anything is available under this statute of limitations here.
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,485.98,487.291,--That's correct.
2009.09-5327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,488.059,489.042,And why should it be?
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,562.618,574.27,"--Well, with all due respect, I don't concur with the premise that those four particular subsections of 2244(d) are exceptions or -- or are tolling provisions."
2009.09-5327,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,579.05,583.89,How many circuits have said that there is equitable tolling?
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,583.89,590.765,"--Eleven circuits -- all of the circuits, and the only circuit that hasn't held that is the D.C. Circuit where it remains an open question."
2009.09-5327,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,593.404,614.816,"Then it's a question of what are exceptional circumstances and whether it has to be something deliberate, which is what the -- as I understand it, the Michigan Court of Appeals said -- yes, if it was bad faith -- if it was a lie, a deception--"
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,614.816,616.361,--Correct.
2009.09-5327,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,617.706,631.73,--So they're drawing the line between intentional and -- and without intending but just being careless.
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,631.73,633.044,--Correct.
2009.09-5327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,660.921,679.088,"We have a case this afternoon involving an opinion of ours named McNally, which held that there's no such thing as a fraud action for a right to honest services."
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,686.069,687.847,I'm not familiar.
2009.09-5327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,687.847,691.691,Every single court of appeals that had faced it had held that there was such a right.
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,704.42,705.64,Well -- and I--
2009.09-5327,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,705.64,708.686,"Of course, that also assumes that McNally was correctly decided ----"
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,711.918,712.386,--Yes.
2009.09-5327,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,712.386,716.243,--prompted by Justice Kennedy's question?
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,724.35,727.083,In this particular case or in another case?
2009.09-5327,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,727.083,727.863,"No, not in this particular case."
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,752.68,760.943,"There are certainly some cases that address the tolling and then, of course, address the merits of the petition."
2009.09-5327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,795.321,800.321,"I looked in the brief to see if there was reference to the merits, underlying merits of the case."
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,805.535,806.879,In the Petitioner's case?
2009.09-5327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,806.879,807.737,Yes.
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,807.737,811.391,"He had -- well, there were a number of issues that he raised on direct appeal."
2009.09-5327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,823.401,825.729,"Well, I shouldn't probably take your time with that."
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,826.821,827.87,But -- but--
2009.09-5327,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,827.87,853.311,"Mr. Scher, one point that you didn't mention, but you did I thought stress it in your brief, was that counsel here said: Oh, the deadline had run even before I was engaged, even before I was appointed to represent this man, so there was nothing that I could do for him, because the time had already expired."
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,853.311,855.202,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.09-5327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,907.978,914.194,Could you just tell me in a sentence or two what test you think we should apply for equitable tolling?
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,917.114,926.313,"Your Honor, I think the -- the test is the test that this Court has applied, which is in Pace and in Lawrence, which is extraordinary circumstances coupled with diligence."
2009.09-5327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,930.844,932.969,"What does ""extraordinary circumstances"" mean?"
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,932.969,937.466,It's -- it's a case-by-case type of issue.
2009.09-5327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,969.142,977.4,Well then it's nothing to do with -- with what caused -- what caused the inability to -- to bring the habeas action.
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,977.4,977.822,--Well--
2009.09-5327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,977.822,980.415,All of that is -- is preliminary to that.
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,993.736,994.547,--Fourteen days.
2009.09-5327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,994.547,995.265,--Fourteen days.
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,1003.528,1005.419,"Well, I think the one--"
2009.09-5327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1005.419,1012.337,"Any unusual event is a possible for a court to say, oh, yes, it says a year, but this is unusual so we will give you a year and a half."
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,1012.337,1023.457,"--Well, I think what we have here is what makes this case I think unusual, and it's the first type of case that this Court has seen, is under these circumstances you have this confluence of events."
2009.09-5327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1041.325,1049.245,"The client -- this client was sort of the pesky client, but apparently knew a lot more about AEDPA than most people generally do."
2009.09-5327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1051.199,1053.337,And had a lot of time to devote to it.
2009.09-5327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1053.337,1057.757,And -- and suppose you have a client who is just bewildered.
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,1063.724,1064.66,Well--
2009.09-5327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1064.66,1066.301,It seems to me it would be the other way around.
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,1075.095,1076.171,"--Well, I think--"
2009.09-5327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1076.171,1081.856,"But the uninformed client, the ignorant client, could never have approached this."
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,1088.962,1098.581,"--I think the problem we have here with Mr. Holland is that the more diligent he was, the more the Respondent and the lower courts have said he should have done."
2009.09-5327,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1132.04,1139.862,"But he never asked -- he wrote to the clerk, but he never asked to be informed when the judgment came down."
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,1139.862,1151.732,"--Well, what we have, Your Honor, is if you look on page 11, in footnote 11, Mr. Holland wrote a letter to the Florida Supreme Court clerk, toward the end of which he says:"
2009.09-5327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1221.143,1232.967,"Is this case different if the filing error -- I understand there was a lot going on, but if the lawyer just miscalculated the days and was off by one day, this case comes out the other way in your view, right?"
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,1232.967,1241.588,"--I think not only under my -- I think, certainly, courts have -- have discussed this, that that's -- that's just an unfortunate mere mistake."
2009.09-5327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1251.786,1255.19,"I don't -- you say -- you say ""complete abandonment""."
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,1290.675,1304.092,"--And I didn't mean to suggest -- when I -- when I used the word ""abandonment"", I'm -- I'm referring to, of course, in terms of abandonment with regard to preserving -- enforcing the assurances that Collins had made with respect to filing the petition."
2009.09-5327,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1381.731,1408.392,"Then you are -- you seem, from what you just said, to be relying on a distinction between paid counsel, who is just as careless, and court-appointed counsel, because in the one case the client had picked that attorney, and in the other case, the client was given this attorney by the State."
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,1429.586,1456.699,"I think the -- the distinction that I was making -- I'm not saying that there's a difference in terms of paid or appointed counsel, but here where you have appointed counsel, I think one of the extraordinary factors is the State coming in and -- and moving to strike these pro se pleadings, telling Mr. -- sending a signal to Mr. Holland that you are stuck with Collins, you can't speak to the supreme court, and the supreme court can't speak to you."
2009.09-5327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1492.013,1494.653,I guess I understand what the cases have said.
2009.09-5327,0,43307,todd_g_scher,,1512.661,1518.784,"Well, because in Lawrence and in -- in Coleman this Court had -- had said that that made a difference."
2009.09-5327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1530.31,1531.105,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1539.478,1545.632,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case, we believe, is decided by one principle--"
2009.09-5327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1545.632,1554.44,"May I just ask just an information question before you -- are the postconviction lawyers in these cases that are appointed, are they compensated by the State?"
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1554.44,1555.376,"--Yes, they are."
2009.09-5327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1555.376,1555.86,They are.
2009.09-5327,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1555.86,1565.06,"And also, just in the course of your argument, how -- how often do these deadlines missed (a) in capital cases and (b) in AEDPA cases?"
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1568.26,1575.24,"I can tell you anecdotally the attorneys that handle these cases in Florida, that the equitable tolling issue comes up with some regularity."
2009.09-5327,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1630.917,1636.869,"You mean to imply that earthquake, fire, flood, mad postman burns mail truck, et cetera?"
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1636.869,1638.65,"--Precisely, Your Honor."
2009.09-5327,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1639.258,1643.165,"So, even if it's a terrible earthquake, all these people are just out of luck?"
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1643.165,1647.444,"--Well -- well, there are some, certainly, safety valves if there's a natural disaster, some--"
2009.09-5327,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1647.444,1647.896,"Well, why?"
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1652.083,1660.281,"--Well -- well, for example, the Rules of Federal Procedure were recently amended to allow for late filing when the courthouse is inaccessible."
2009.09-5327,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1660.281,1661.014,The statute?
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1661.014,1662.687,"Precisely, Your Honor."
2009.09-5327,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1663.186,1666.762,"And, so, are you -- you read the statute to say in some cases, you could do it."
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1672.998,1674.714,"--Well, two responses."
2009.09-5327,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1681.677,1683.802,"So that's earthquake, fire, flood, et cetera?"
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1683.802,1684.961,Exactly.
2009.09-5327,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1694.487,1709.903,"What if the lawyer lies to the client and the client says my time is running out, have you filed my -- my Federal habeas petition, and the lawyer says, yes, I filed it and here it is, and it has a -- a forged date stamp on it?"
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1711.855,1715.822,"Well, under our position that Congress intended to draw a very clear line, no."
2009.09-5327,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1762.427,1763.535,"Well, why should it matter?"
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1791.464,1794.26,"--Well, the answer -- is it extraordinary?"
2009.09-5327,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1796.553,1811.484,"You mean counsel in Florida often when -- miss deadlines and so forth when their counsel -- when their client specifically says to them, even a few weeks before and by mail several times, please file such-and-such, is not extraordinary in Florida?"
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1811.484,1815.36,--It's not just Florida; it's nationwide there's -- there's problem with this complex statute of limitations--
2009.09-5327,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1815.36,1818.156,"We have a problem with the bar, don't we, if -- if -- if the -- if--"
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1818.546,1823.589,"--Well, there -- there has been no bar discipline, to my knowledge, for missing a deadline."
2009.09-5327,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1827.948,1828.728,I -- I -- I didn't hear.
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1830.744,1834.882,"--To my knowledge, there has not been for missing a deadline."
2009.09-5327,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1834.882,1855.95,"--If we or -- this would probably be the Congress -- assuming some rule maker had probably be the Congress, assuming some rulemaker had authority to do this, would it make sense to say that the State is going to be subject to equitable tolling on a rather broad standard -- we're going to give equitable tolling often -- unless the State has attorney discipline procedures, so that this happens only once and then the attorney can no longer practice in the Federal courts?"
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1855.95,1857.669,I suppose as a matter of--
2009.09-5327,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1857.669,1872.009,"Obviously, what we're looking for is some sort of a rule to keep the deadline, and if we're going to accommodate your friend on the other side, to have -- to have some rule about exceptional -- exceptional cases."
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1872.009,1882.237,"--Well, perhaps something along those lines legislatively might be -- be considered, but -- but in the end, what we have here is garden-variety attorney negligence miscalculating and missing a deadline."
2009.09-5327,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1882.861,1885.485,Isn't there at least one additional thing here?
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1904.574,1908.18,"--Well, let me clarify that, because there's a misconception going on here."
2009.09-5327,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1937.668,1939.606,Was that denied on the ground that he was pro se?
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1939.606,1942.87,--The first motion was stricken.
2009.09-5327,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1976.07,1989.002,"What I don't understand is, how can a -- how can a client request to have -- to be relieved of representation, if the client can't file that motion pro se?"
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2001.246,2010.039,"--No, I think that certainly the filing of the motion, I think perhaps it was -- it shouldn't have been stricken the first time, but the court then on the merits denied it the second time."
2009.09-5327,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2082.137,2083.463,Can we go back to just--
2009.09-5327,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2083.463,2090.053,The State -- the State has no responsibility even though it made this appointment?
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2105.55,2106.658,--Exactly.
2009.09-5327,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2128.084,2143.644,"Under -- on direct appeal, if counsel conducted himself this way, the State would -- he'd have to get relief because the State would have the burden, but not -- not on collateral?"
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2144.455,2144.705,--Sure.
2009.09-5327,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2158.244,2170.991,"Counsel, I'm concerned about some of the situations Justice Breyer mentions, you know, if there is an earthquake, a plane crash, but the law seems to be focusing on other things when it's talking about extraordinary circumstances."
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2189.062,2197.96,"Well, I think two responses there: Obviously, we believe that attorney incompetence or so forth cannot be a basis for equitable tolling."
2009.09-5327,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2224.247,2232.043,"Well, but it legislated against the background of cases like Irwin that stated the general proposition is, unless Congress says otherwise, there is equitable tolling."
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2232.043,2233.996,--But that can be rebutted.
2009.09-5327,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2249.66,2266.062,--I -- what I worry about is that you're confusing the -- or perceive -- confusing the fact that lawyer negligence may not be the type of situation that Congress was looking at.
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2298.875,2300.185,--Well--
2009.09-5327,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2300.185,2310.664,So what can we read to suggest that -- forget about the lawyer malfeasance; let's talk just about equitable tolling--
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2310.664,2312.337,--Sure.
2009.09-5327,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2312.773,2313.806,--in its traditional sense.
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2316.993,2319.145,--Sure.
2009.09-5327,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2362.411,2369.703,"Why could you not say here -- I mean, the key sentence, I take it, is the Eleventh Circuit and it says:"
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2429.162,2437.035,"--Well, we agree with the Eleventh Circuit standard to the extent it says, you know, that this sort of attorney negligence, gross negligence, incompetence, is not enough."
2009.09-5327,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2483.986,2505.523,"Do you have any idea, before the Eleventh Circuit announced its standard, how many habeas petitions were tolled by district courts in that -- in your -- in Florida, on the basis of equitable tolling, that -- that they permitted petitions to go forward after the statute of limitations?"
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2505.523,2508.631,"--Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any data on that."
2009.09-5327,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2509.898,2513.505,"So would there be -- I mean, what I'm actually worried about is not a lawyer being kidnapped."
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2539.647,2560.202,"Well, we say it's not because Congress intended not to have equitable tolling, and then to the extent it did, it could have drafted something along the lines of what's in 2263, which is the next chapter -- it's the companion chapter that says instead of having 365 days with no equitable tolling, you can have 180 days and 30 days for good cause if there's a deadline missed--"
2009.09-5327,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2560.202,2568.278,"You're not -- you're not worried about Justice Breyer's case of the really extraordinary circumstance where everybody would say, well, that's -- you know, we understand."
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2581.804,2583.692,"--Well, under these facts--"
2009.09-5327,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2583.692,2588.27,"It's very hard to argue against -- against equity, against equitable tolling."
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2597.329,2600.14,--Meaning the Eleventh Circuit's standard?
2009.09-5327,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2600.14,2605.997,"Meaning the fact that you have got a client who is constantly telling the lawyer, do this, you know, get it done; doesn't get the judgment."
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2610.041,2616.9,"Well, that goes to the issue that -- of not -- of diligence, of course, which is not the issue we're looking at."
2009.09-5327,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2759.712,2766.021,What -- why isn't it extreme attorney incompetence to miss a deadline?
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2774.409,2783.686,"Well, I guess the short answer, of course, is the courts have said no, that's not enough, we need something that's truly extreme, something far from just missing a deadline."
2009.09-5327,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2797.011,2797.931,"I mean, give me an example."
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2797.931,2799.226,Well--
2009.09-5327,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2799.226,2801.242,That's worse than missing the deadline.
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2801.242,2813.955,"--I mean, the example I've tossed about in our conversations is -- is to say, well, what if the postconviction lawyer is bribed by the victim's family to not file something on time?"
2009.09-5327,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2817.375,2820.28,"Well, we don't -- that's not negligence."
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2820.28,2821.325,--No.
2009.09-5327,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2828.573,2830.555,So you're -- it has to be criminal behavior?
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2830.555,2835.678,--It has to be something beyond just attorney incompetence.
2009.09-5327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2849.643,2851.39,May I ask another question?
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2867.788,2872.085,"Well, there's a collateral counsel registry list."
2009.09-5327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2872.085,2872.584,Is it--
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2872.584,2874.549,There's actually what they call CCRC.
2009.09-5327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2884.766,2889.968,--But the collateral counsel registry is a different group of lawyers than are generally appointed in criminal cases?
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2889.968,2890.28,Yes.
2009.09-5327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2890.28,2890.966,I see.
2009.09-5327,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2890.966,2904.821,"Well, Your Honors, if there's no further questions, we ask that the court affirm the Eleventh Circuit below, either on the basis that there's no equitable tolling or that on this record there's no basis for it under the attorney incompetence standard."
2009.09-5327,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2905.617,2906.943,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.09-5327,2,43307,todd_g_scher,,2908.503,2912.659,I just have a couple of brief points.
2009.09-5327,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2967.495,2974.993,But you would say -- it is -- you could categorically excuse ordinary negligence as opposed to gross negligence?
2009.09-5327,2,43307,todd_g_scher,,2974.993,2978.117,"--That's where courts, including this Court, have drawn the line."
2009.09-5327,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3017.958,3018.617,What were the lies?
2009.09-5327,2,43307,todd_g_scher,,3018.617,3019.569,--about when the petition was going to be--
2009.09-5327,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3019.569,3022.489,What was -- give me an example of a lie that he told him?
2009.09-5327,2,43307,todd_g_scher,,3022.489,3030.378,--These were in the context of Mr. Collins telling Mr. Holland that he would protect his Federal habeas rights.
2009.09-5327,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3031.034,3037.265,"Doesn't that go without saying, that every attorney -- and every attorney presumably undertakes not to miss the statute of limitations?"
2009.09-5327,2,43307,todd_g_scher,,3043.949,3044.339,--I think it makes it more--
2009.09-5327,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3044.339,3044.994,That's a lie?
2009.09-5327,2,43307,todd_g_scher,,3044.994,3046.835,--I think it makes it makes it more extraordinary.
2009.09-5327,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3067.81,3068.843,If I'm worried--
2009.09-5327,2,43307,todd_g_scher,,3068.843,3069.155,--it was too late.
2009.09-5327,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3069.155,3077.305,"--If I'm worried about the open-ended nature of what you're asking for, how -- how would you state the test you would like in the most restrictive terms?"
2009.09-5327,2,43307,todd_g_scher,,3077.305,3083.283,"I think in terms -- I think the test would be appropriate, what Justice Breyer articulated, which is--"
2009.09-5327,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3083.283,3085.05,Hurricane or kidnapping?
2009.09-5327,2,43307,todd_g_scher,,3085.05,3085.877,"--No, no."
2009.09-5327,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3085.877,3087.128,"Oh, the different one."
2009.09-5327,2,43307,todd_g_scher,,3087.565,3089.047,"No, the other test, the other test."
2009.09-5327,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3103.37,3106.649,"What type -- the problem comes up when you say ""this type of attorney negligence""."
2009.09-5327,2,43307,todd_g_scher,,3109.475,3114.44,"--I certainly think, given the unique facts here, we have, again, the confluence of circumstances."
2009.09-5327,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3115.224,3117.377,"--No, I know your test will mean your client wins."
2009.09-5327,2,43307,todd_g_scher,,3117.377,3117.939,--Correct.
2009.09-5327,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3117.939,3126.451,"But, I mean, can you articulate it more -- because I'm very concerned that if you start saying, well, you can forgive an inequitable case, every time a case comes up, you're going to -- there's going to be sympathy for the client."
2009.09-5327,2,43307,todd_g_scher,,3131.576,3149.66,"Well, but certainly -- but the other part of the test for equitable tolling is diligence, and I think, when -- when one looks at the -- at the body of case law that has developed since 1997 on the issue of equitable tolling and AEDPA, the vast majority of these cases are disposed on the fact that the Petitioner is indiligent."
2009.09-5327,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3192.594,3193.125,"Thank you, counsel."
