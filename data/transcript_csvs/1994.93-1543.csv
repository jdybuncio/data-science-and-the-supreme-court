1994.93-1543,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.189,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 93-1543, Christine McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Company."
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,18.878,21.746,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-1543,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,146.291,150.575,"Well, Still was somewhat different than the present case, wasn't it?"
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,161.066,184.332,"Mr. Chief Justice, Still was under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, and it was a case involving an employee seeing compensation for a back injury, and there was a question about information that he had provided in his form, but he railroad in Still took the position that he was not an employee, not qualified to be an employee."
1994.93-1543,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,189.784,195.021,The respondent doesn't say that the petitioner in this case never was an employee.
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,195.021,218.569,"--No, but the plaintiff in Still had worked for Norfolk and Western Railroad for 6 years, just like the plaintiff here had worked for the Nashville Banner for 40 years, so the theory that somehow the misconduct or the application error or misstatement has removed the standing or the qualification was the same."
1994.93-1543,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,218.569,238.217,"Well, what remedies, Mr. Terry, do you say are available to the petitioner if it is discovered during the course of the discovery proceedings that valid cause existed for the employer to fire the petitioner?"
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,238.217,262.082,"Justice O'Connor, the first... in answering your question, and maybe you have already suggested that we think the first and very important part of this rule that we propose is that the employer show under a standard similar to the standard in Price Waterhouse that they would have terminated the employee."
1994.93-1543,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,302.621,325.153,"What about the situation of an employer discovering that there was a fraudulent employment application, that a qualification for the job, for example, was a certain education degree, and the employee had fraudulently said she had that degree, and it's later discovered."
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,328.339,332.576,We... the answer to your question is the same.
1994.93-1543,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,375.753,378.272,Do they do that by way of a counterclaim?
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,397.732,402.719,We believe that the counterclaim may be... will mostly be found in State law.
1994.93-1543,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,407.79,409.909,"Well, it could be a pendant cause of action, I take it."
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,409.909,410.809,"--Yes, exactly."
1994.93-1543,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,410.809,414.277,"But then, as Justice Ginsburg said, it would be an offset to the judgment?"
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,414.277,414.977,Absolutely.
1994.93-1543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,424.668,432.405,Wouldn't you argue in that case that the ADEA trumps any other State recovery mechanism?
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,440.178,440.461,--No.
1994.93-1543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,449.983,454.019,"For the recovery of some of this compensa... backpay, for example?"
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,454.019,461.54,"--Or it could be a situation, let's take for... where the employee has caused some actual damage or injury on the job."
1994.93-1543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,461.54,477.966,"Well, that I can understand, but if you're talking about recovery of the very backpay to which the employee is entitled under the act, or determined by the court to be entitled under the act, are you conceding that that might be a proper subject of recovery under some State law action?"
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,477.966,478.7,Absolutely not.
1994.93-1543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,478.7,479.116,Okay.
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,479.116,480.118,Absolutely not.
1994.93-1543,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,480.918,483.053,"The employer would have to prove damage, I take it?"
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,483.053,483.536,--Absolutely.
1994.93-1543,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,483.536,494.444,"So that if the person holds himself out as a lawyer, and in fact is not a lawyer, and they discover that, if he had been doing his job adequately and the employer hadn't been sued, I take it no damage under your theory?"
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,494.444,497.713,"In a lot of these cases, that's the situation, Justice--"
1994.93-1543,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,497.713,502.867,Despite the fact that it's somewhat outrageous that the person held himself out as a lawyer and in fact was not.
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,502.867,527.732,"--Yes, and... but in that case you may also find some theory of unjust enrichment, and you will also find that the local district attorney will probably initiate a criminal prosecution just like they would in the nondoctor doctor situation, and part of the criminal prosecution could also involve restitution of part of the money that was received."
1994.93-1543,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,527.732,532.284,"Well, now you're causing me to get confused again."
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,541.242,548.646,"You can get it back if there's injury and if there's harm, or if there's some viable State remedy that the title--"
1994.93-1543,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,548.646,550.681,So you can get the backpay back.
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,550.681,551.098,--If--
1994.93-1543,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,551.098,556.002,"You just need a state cause of action for unjust enrichment or for restitution, right?"
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,556.002,558.102,--If... if the... yes.
1994.93-1543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,584.335,586.251,"Okay, let me make sure I understand."
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,620.258,632.482,"The answer to that question is if the State law was passed and promoted as a defense to title VII, then it would have those problems."
1994.93-1543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,635.101,639.736,And wouldn't your argument be that in fact the State law was barred by the ADEA?
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,639.736,649.425,"--If that was the purpose, if the purpose of the State law was to frustrate the purposes of ADEA, or title VII, then it would have problems."
1994.93-1543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,649.425,649.725,Sure.
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,649.725,649.958,But if--
1994.93-1543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,649.958,675.242,"Now, what if it's a general State law saying no one shall be unjustly enriched, and let's assume that under State law as a general rule the payment of salary to someone who has misrepresented qualifications for the office for which the salary is paid would be a proper subject for unjust enrichment recovery, would you say that the ADEA would not bar that State law claim?"
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,675.242,696.406,"--Yes, I would, but I would also say that it would be my understanding of that claim that the employee, as Justice Kennedy has suggested, if they've done the job, if the employer has received benefit for what he's paid, that the unjust enrichment claim would not succeed to the extent of the backpay."
1994.93-1543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,696.406,706.845,"Okay, and the easy claim would be the case of the nonlawyer lawyer whose firm has been sued for malpractice and has had to recover."
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,724.006,725.156,"Absolutely, and we think--"
1994.93-1543,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,725.156,741.685,"Could a judge in such an instance determine the order of trial and say, I'm going to try the counterclaim first, and that may render any discrimination claim academic because of the size of the damages?"
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,741.685,744.101,"--Your Honor, no."
1994.93-1543,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,766.614,791.765,"Let me take you back just one step to clarify, if I understand correctly, that even if you lose on your main argument you are contesting the propriety of summary judgment here, because it was... you were not given an opportunity to challenge whether this misconduct would in fact have led to the discharge."
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,791.765,806.691,"Absolutely, under the appropriate standard, which we think is articulated in Price Waterhouse, where... which requires objective evidence and clear issues of fact which were present in this case, a fair factfinding proceeding."
1994.93-1543,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,811.309,813.761,But you didn't raise that question in the petition.
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,815.178,815.461,--I didn't--
1994.93-1543,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,815.461,818.397,You didn't raise that question in your certiorari petition.
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,818.397,819.582,--We have raised that question.
1994.93-1543,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,821.817,822.834,"We know it's in your brief, but not in your--"
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,831.472,831.689,--Well--
1994.93-1543,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,831.689,834.341,"You may be right on it, but I'm not sure you preserved it."
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,834.341,853.636,"--Well, Justice Stevens, our approach to this is that until there is a rule, a rule articulated by this Court, when you start with the procedural problems that are presented in the district court, the problems are shown in this case."
1994.93-1543,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,864.742,874.198,"Yes, I understand, but your principal argument is that even if they clearly would have fired her for this conduct, you still say that she's entitled to recover under the statute."
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,874.198,875.531,--Absolutely.
1994.93-1543,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,875.531,878.131,"That's a question you primarily addressed, at least."
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,878.131,878.816,Yes.
1994.93-1543,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,879.783,888.722,Is it your submission that the time runs at the... when judgment is entered in the trial court or when the judgment becomes final after appeal?
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,888.722,892.091,--When judgment runs in the trial court.
1994.93-1543,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,892.091,900.862,Don't some circuits say that the cutoff date is when the employer actually discovers the grounds for discharge?
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,900.862,901.146,Yes.
1994.93-1543,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,902.412,906.35,Isn't that what the EEOC has used as well?
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,906.35,911.402,--We think that the EEOC has changed its ruling in that area a couple of times.
1994.93-1543,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,923.36,933.334,"What about the rule that backpay would terminate when the employer would have found out, which could conceivably be never?"
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,935.401,943.123,"If the employer can demonstrate that absent discrimination they would have found out, then it's just as if the plant had closed."
1994.93-1543,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,944.456,945.389,--But suppose the employer can't prove that?
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,970.274,978.88,The reason is that if the... anything other than what we propose allows the employer to improve their position because of the discrimination.
1994.93-1543,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,994.805,998.174,"Well, that's true even under your rule."
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,998.174,999.257,Well--
1994.93-1543,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,999.257,1011.898,"Let's assume that but for the lawsuit this never would have been found out, so even under your rule she... the employer is better off because of the discharge."
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1011.898,1020.337,"--Because they don't have to face reinstatement or front pay, but they have the same obligations under backpay, and backpay is critical."
1994.93-1543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1069.418,1081.975,"But why don't you go for the whole hog in this case, because in this case, presumably absent discovery the employer would never have found out and would never have discharged for any other reason, other than the age discrimination."
1994.93-1543,0,36817,michael_e_terry,,1081.975,1094.366,"--The rule we proposed, Your Honor, is structured with regard to reinstatement and front pay to accommodate the employer's interest."
1994.93-1543,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1109.793,1111.695,"Very well, Mr. Terry."
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1124.052,1126.604,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1543,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1161.392,1169.264,"Well, Mr. Gornstein, what should the cutoff date be for any so-called backpay relief?"
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1169.264,1180.636,We believe that the appropriate cutoff date is the date upon which the employer would have discovered the information had there been no discrimination and no lawsuit.
1994.93-1543,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1180.636,1183.005,That's kind of a hard test to employ.
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1192.777,1204.168,"The EEOC position on this issue has evolved, and at one point it was using or advising its investigators... there's never been an EEOC regulation on this."
1994.93-1543,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1204.168,1205.437,What is it using now?
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1205.437,1218.495,"Right now, the position is the one reflected in our brief, which is that the cutoff date should go to the date on which the employer would have discovered the information had there been no discrimination."
1994.93-1543,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1218.495,1224.332,"Well, that just inserts a new and difficult factual inquiry into the equation."
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1225.934,1229.803,"I think what commends it is that it advances the purposes of the statute here, which--"
1994.93-1543,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1229.803,1239.575,"Well, but do you agree that it does insert an often difficult factual question into the equation?"
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1239.575,1241.694,"--Yes, but I think what it--"
1994.93-1543,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1241.694,1243.544,"Well, it's very difficult in this case."
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1250.264,1254.668,"--And in cases like that, then the backpay period should go to the date of judgment."
1994.93-1543,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1254.668,1256.62,"Mr. Gornstein, can I interrupt with this question?"
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1261.656,1262.357,"Well, I would just--"
1994.93-1543,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1262.357,1265.492,It only relates to liability in all three briefs.
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1265.492,1269.877,--The remedy issue as to what particular remedies ought to be granted--
1994.93-1543,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1269.877,1274.931,"You first have to decide whether there's liability, and that's the only issue that the cert petition raised."
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1274.931,1278.566,"--I think that it fairly raises whether, assuming there--"
1994.93-1543,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1278.566,1281.602,What the remedy should be if she wins?
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1281.602,1281.918,--No.
1994.93-1543,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1295.842,1299.044,But then you don't have to decide which of the various alternatives would be right.
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1299.044,1299.594,You do not.
1994.93-1543,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1299.594,1301.929,You say there's some... some--
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1301.929,1303.879,"That's all you have to decide in this case, this--"
1994.93-1543,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1303.879,1308.9,"--It's clearly all that we should properly decide under the question presented, it seems to me."
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1308.9,1312.685,"--Well, I think that that's probably so."
1994.93-1543,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1408.194,1398.321,All right.
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1439.298,1441.484,Unless the employer can show--
1994.93-1543,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1441.484,1443.867,He couldn't show he discovered... he never would have found out--
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1443.867,1444.352,--Then--
1994.93-1543,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1444.352,1448.82,"--and yet there is this word, equitable, in the statutory section dealing with relief."
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1453.455,1463.728,"--I think that it is equitable because you look at what is equitable in light of advancing the purposes of the statute, which are deterrence, and making whole the victims of discrimination."
1994.93-1543,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1476.57,1477.837,What about the employer's claim?
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1480.106,1486.593,"Absolutely, that there would... in that case, it would look like a clear claim for offset that would probably offset all the backpay."
1994.93-1543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1486.593,1487.893,"Claim for what, a claim for--"
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1487.893,1488.295,Theft.
1994.93-1543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1488.295,1489.412,--to get his money back that's been stolen?
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1489.412,1489.762,Yes.
1994.93-1543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1489.762,1491.914,He's still paying this guy wages.
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1494.199,1495.816,"Well, only in the sense that the--"
1994.93-1543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1495.816,1497.318,That doesn't seem equitable to me.
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1497.318,1498.334,"--Well, Justice Scalia, we--"
1994.93-1543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1498.334,1500.353,"The statute does use the word equitable, doesn't it?"
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1500.353,1500.803,"--It does, but that's--"
1994.93-1543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1500.803,1504.222,It doesn't say whatever... whatever helps to further the purposes of the act.
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1504.222,1504.488,"--Well, it does--"
1994.93-1543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1504.488,1505.022,"It says, equitable."
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1505.022,1510.542,"--Well, it says such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate to effectuate the purposes of the act."
1994.93-1543,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1511.993,1513.01,That's my question.
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1527.087,1545.299,"Our answer to that is, and I think this is the question is which of those two rules best advances the purposes of the statute, and we think that the rule that you... the backpay ends on the date on which the employer would have discovered it follows directly from this Court's decision in Albemarle."
1994.93-1543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1545.299,1551.719,"It doesn't say best advances, it says such legal... as may be appropriate, right?"
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1557.522,1557.956,That's right.
1994.93-1543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1557.956,1560.891,Don't you think some people may think it's inappropriate?
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1560.891,1571.032,"Well, I don't think there should be an... that implies a sort of unguided discretion to deny relief based on your reaction to the personal character of the plaintiff."
1994.93-1543,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1577.02,1580.822,"Is ease of administrability, is that taken into account at all?"
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1594.463,1595.096,Yes.
1994.93-1543,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1595.096,1604.437,"But then, if you take the day of discovery, that's something fixed, and you don't have to quarrel about it, apart from any equitable clean hands doctrine."
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1610.891,1626.434,"I think that the virtue of the date of discovery rule is that it's easier to administer, but I think that that should be balanced against... the more important question is which rule is more appropriate to effectuate the purposes of the statute, not which rule is easier to administer."
1994.93-1543,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1626.434,1628.719,You say our discretion is unguided.
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1636.123,1638.825,"No, I would not... you can call a thief a thief, sure."
1994.93-1543,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1638.825,1641.158,But it's unguided discretion to allow that--
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1641.158,1641.691,"No, I would say that--"
1994.93-1543,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1641.691,1644.979,--to allow that to shape the remedy that we provide?
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1644.979,1656.001,"--Well, I think it's unguided when the rule is, if somebody who's engaged in serious misconduct, they get relief, somebody who's engaged in less serious misconduct, they do not get the relief."
1994.93-1543,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1667.308,1671.194,But your submission is there be no discretion at all.
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1671.194,1676.229,"No, there will be discretion, but not on the basis of the employer's misconduct."
1994.93-1543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1676.229,1676.829,What about criminal?
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1681.05,1681.716,I don't think--
1994.93-1543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1681.716,1682.383,That's a pretty clear line.
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1682.383,1690.322,"--I don't think it's an appropriate line to draw, because there are many things that are not criminal that are very serious, and there are many things that are criminal--"
1994.93-1543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1690.322,1697.059,"Oh, so therefore we have to let even larceny go unpunished because there are some things that aren't criminal that are serious."
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1697.059,1702.879,"--Well, larceny will not go unpunished, because that violates the criminal law and the State will punish it."
1994.93-1543,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1712.604,1713.52,"Thank you, Mr. Gornstein."
1994.93-1543,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1713.52,1716.37,--Thank you.
1994.93-1543,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1716.37,1720.257,Mr. Wayland.
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,1720.257,1722.959,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1741.17,1743.788,"The court didn't have an ""undeniably"" case before it though, did it?"
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,1743.788,1744.322,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1751.209,1761.75,"The conduct was undeniable, but what would have followed from it, whether her employment would have terminated, was a debatable fact question, was it not?"
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,1761.75,1762.916,"--No, Your Honor, it was not."
1994.93-1543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1766.468,1770.606,"Undisputed facts, there were only affidavits, no cross-examination, even."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,1770.606,1772.189,"--No, that is not correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1772.189,1772.589,It was?
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,1772.589,1772.989,There was.
1994.93-1543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1800.589,1809.295,Is a deposition the same thing as presenting a witness before a trier of fact who will then take into account the credibility of the witness?
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,1825.655,1833.643,"Well, Your Honor, if that's the standard, then there could never be summary judgment in any case where someone could argue that credibility of witnesses may be appropriate."
1994.93-1543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1833.643,1843.416,"I thought that was the case, in fact Where there's a credibility question to be resolved, then you do not have a case where there is no genuine doubt of what the facts are."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,1843.416,1855.407,"I believe the teachings of this Court establish, Your Honor, that when faced with a properly supported motion for summary judgment, the person opposing the motion has to come forward with evidence that would show that there is a genuine factual dispute."
1994.93-1543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1867.983,1873.268,"Was it shown what had happened in similar situations, or was the testimony just that, yes, we would have fired her?"
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,1873.268,1892.849,"The testimony was, Your Honor, that there was no similar situations to compare it to, that it had never happened before, that the rule at the company was so well understood... in fact, the plaintiff admitted that anyone would know that if you did this you could be discharged for it, and the company in the testimony was that they would have unequivocally terminated the employee the minute they found out about it."
1994.93-1543,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1910.793,1919.416,"Mr. Wayland, I take it the trial court went no further than to say, than to conclude that there was no genuine issue on the point?"
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,1919.416,1931.907,"The trial court concluded that there was no genuine issue, Your Honor, and also further concluded that, on the basis of the undisputed facts, that the company had objectively stated a legitimate cause for discharge."
1994.93-1543,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1945.734,1956.624,"Well, whatever the deficiencies, the question presented at least does assume that the conduct here would have provided a basis for dismissing the employee."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,1956.624,1957.458,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1543,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1957.458,1959.141,And that we take the case on that assumption.
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,1959.141,1960.01,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1543,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1960.01,1961.81,That is not much to argue about.
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,1961.81,1977.538,"And if you look at what's happened here, if you look at the statute, and we submit that's the place to start, in the Age Discrimination Act, Congress pecifically provided that if someone... if there's good cause for termination, or if there's a reasonable factor other than age, then that is not age discrimination."
1994.93-1543,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1991.511,2011.359,"Well, at the time of the discharge of the petitioner, the employer did not know of any other ground for discharge, and I guess we take the case on the assumption that the discharge was made at that time on the basis of her age."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2011.359,2012.425,For purposes of--
1994.93-1543,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2012.425,2017.513,"For purposes of our disposal of this case we take it on that assumption, do we not?"
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2017.513,2018.729,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1543,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2018.729,2030.755,"And so as of that date, it appears that there was indeed discrimination as described in the statute, and an injury occurred on that date."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2030.755,2041.711,"Well, the question, we submit, Your Honor, is, did an injury occur on that date, a legal injury, and if so, even assuming that it did, is it redressable, and that's the real... that's what we're dealing with here."
1994.93-1543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2056.471,2088.09,"Mr. Wayland, suppose what was at issue here was not intentional misconduct, but simply gross incompetence that the employer had not theretofore been aware of, but it comes out during the course of the trial that this employee is really grossly incompetent, would that in your view lead to the same conclusion, that no recovery could be had for firing this employee because of race, or sex, or age?"
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2088.09,2090.356,"It may well lead to that conclusion, Your Honor."
1994.93-1543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2090.739,2091.308,I know it may well.
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2092.875,2094.909,"--Well, I think it would depend upon the employer."
1994.93-1543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2104.7,2106.366,Had it known about the incompetency.
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2106.366,2107.533,--Had it known about the incompetency.
1994.93-1543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2107.533,2117.274,"So it's not a matter of intentional misconduct alone, it's if there were any reason for which this employee might have been, would have been discharged had the employer known about it?"
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2117.274,2117.858,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2137.254,2137.921,So I gather--
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2137.921,2138.504,--that resulted in an injury.
1994.93-1543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2139.054,2150.562,--if you bring a suit under this statute you better expect your employment history to be very carefully scrutinized not only for intentional misdeeds but for general incompetence?
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2150.562,2151.445,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2151.445,2154.681,"And that would be rather risky, wouldn't it, to bring such a suit?"
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2154.681,2156.149,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1994.93-1543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2156.149,2163.203,"Even if the employer is unable to establish the general incompetence, it would make good reading for any subsequent employer, wouldn't it?"
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2163.203,2167.19,"Well, Your Honor, I guess there's protective orders that would deal with that."
1994.93-1543,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2176.296,2187.168,"Well, Mr. Wayland, I would have thought you would look at the situation at the time the employment action occurred, and that's what Congress was trying to prevent."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2203.78,2220.158,"Well, Your Honor, it's also a goal of the statute not to reward bad employees, and if you buy the plaintiff's theory, if you ignore the fact of the misconduct that would have resulted in their termination, then the result is you are rewarding an employee for their stealth and for the concealment of their misconduct."
1994.93-1543,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2220.158,2227.145,"Well, not if you look at it, for example, as of the date of the acquisition of the subsequent knowledge."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2232.883,2242.655,"Well, the employee is still being rewarded, Your Honor, because that's going to, employees that conceal it better than others are going to be rewarded more, because it's going to take longer for the company to find out about it."
1994.93-1543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2250.827,2254.362,"Mr. Wayland, let me put it this way."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2308.764,2311.616,"--The question, Your Honor, is to relief."
1994.93-1543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2320.987,2324.023,How about even a matter of a declaratory judgment?
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2337.283,2349.074,"Your Honor, this Court, under my reading of the statute, would have the discretion to award that if it found that that was appropriate, and that would certainly be consistent with what Congress has enacted in the 1991 Civil Rights Act."
1994.93-1543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2349.074,2354.144,Then how can you give summary judgment and not even have that proof in the case?
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2354.144,2369.32,"Well, Your Honor, we submit that in the cases that we're dealing with when we're dealing with misconduct serious enough to warrant discharge, that would have warranted discharge, that that ends the inquiry, because the... that conduct becomes a superseding cause for any injury."
1994.93-1543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2372.772,2376.724,"You're running two theories, Mr. Wayland, and I think you're going to have to pick between them."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2415.749,2416.718,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2416.718,2417.951,"Well, which theory do you want?"
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2417.951,2421.937,"Well, we would submit that the first theory is the correct one."
1994.93-1543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2421.937,2426.824,"That's what I thought your brief contained, the first theory, not the remedial theory."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2426.824,2437.214,"But if the Court determines that there is a violation, then we think you have to go to the remedial theory as a... a, for lack of a better term, a fall-back position, and that's certainly appropriate then."
1994.93-1543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2437.214,2439.614,"I thought your starting point is, we can concede the violation."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2464.83,2473.952,"Your Honor, the teachings of this Court in the Price Waterhouse case is there are three things that are necessary for a legally cognizable injury under the discrimination law."
1994.93-1543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2489.397,2501.538,"I had not understood the Price Waterhouse decision to involve the scenario here, that is, that there is never any proof of discrimination because we go right to the defense."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2501.538,2518.582,"--The difference between the Price Waterhouse scenario and this one, Your Honor, in the abstract, we submit, is that in Price Waterhouse both motives were present at the same time, whereas in this case by definition the after-acquired knowledge was not present at the time the decision was made, but once you set that aside--"
1994.93-1543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2518.582,2523.051,"That makes this one a case where, less sympathetic to the discrimination charge?"
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2537.128,2537.528,"--Well, Your--"
1994.93-1543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2537.528,2551.554,"--why it makes any difference whether they knew, on the very day they discriminated against her on the basis of her age they also knew, say another officer knew that she had taken confidential documents."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2559.909,2561.443,"--I don't believe it does, Your Honor."
1994.93-1543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2570.599,2571.717,Why is there no injury?
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2585.025,2590.929,"--Well, Your Honor, you haven't suffered a legally cognizable injury under the discrimination laws."
1994.93-1543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2590.929,2591.679,Why?
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2599.951,2603.586,"There is an injury, but there is a superseding cause, or another cause of that injury."
1994.93-1543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2607.224,2608.44,But that wasn't the cause.
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2614.378,2625.536,"--Well, Your Honor, it was a fact at the time, and if the Court ignores the existence of that fact simply by a lack of employer knowledge, then it is rewarding employees for their concealment of misconduct, and that's not--"
1994.93-1543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2625.536,2629.388,"Well, that goes to the appropriateness of the remedy, but it doesn't go to the existence of a cause of action."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2641.362,2649.433,"--Well, Your Honor, again, we submit that in terms of looking at the legal injuries, this Court has said there has to be a tie, it has to be traceable to the event."
1994.93-1543,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2650.349,2659.622,"Legal injury has got to be defined in statutory terms, and the statute uses discharge because of age."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2659.622,2660.255,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1543,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2660.255,2672.429,"That is the legal injury, and if there has been a discharge because of age, it seems to me that under the statutory language, that is the end of the inquiry as to whether there has been a legally cognizable injury."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2678.083,2682.004,"We believe the proper test is, is there has to be a but-for causation, Your Honor."
1994.93-1543,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2682.004,2685.556,"What do you do with the language, because of age?"
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2685.556,2689.091,"Your Honor, we think that the proper interpretation is, that's a but-for test."
1994.93-1543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2701.049,2702.667,"Mr. Wayland, could I interrupt for just a second?"
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2734.937,2737.139,"I don't know that she's established injury, Your Honor."
1994.93-1543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2737.139,2738.174,She's lost her job.
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2738.174,2742.559,She's established a presumption that the loss of her job was the result of discrimination.
1994.93-1543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2742.559,2746.66,"But if you put in no evidence at that point, judgment would be entered against you."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2748.112,2755.516,"That is correct, Your Honor, but here, using your example, the after-acquired evidence and what we're talking about here goes to that case."
1994.93-1543,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2761.836,2764.788,"Well, I have other questions similar to Justice Stevens."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2792.205,2794.907,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1543,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2794.907,2813.638,"Can I go to the point, which might not be in the case question, but nonetheless is bothering me, on day 1, the person's fired because of age, 10 months later, in discovery, they find out the person was a terrible thief, and 14 months after that, judgment enters."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2864.404,2871.057,"Well, Your Honor, I think that the discovery is governed by the normal discovery principles, and it would be job-related discovery."
1994.93-1543,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2872.276,2881.699,"I'm asking you to address the point of when, in your opinion, if you lost on your main point, the damages would be stopped, and why."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2881.699,2896.459,"--The answer to that question, Your Honor, is the damages should be stopped as of the time that the employee engaged in the misconduct, or the alleged injury occurred, so it would be the time of the lay-off, because otherwise what the court is doing is rewarding an employee for their misconduct."
1994.93-1543,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2896.975,2900.327,"You understand, I'm making the assumption that you lose on that point."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2900.327,2901.561,"--I understand that, Your Honor."
1994.93-1543,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2901.561,2915.186,"I'm making the assumption that for argument's sake that our choice is between stopping it at the time the employer discovers it, or letting the damages run, despite the discovery, until judgment enters."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,2925.626,2942.404,"Your Honor, on your assumption, then the damages should stop when the employer learned of the misconduct, because if not, then this Court is ignoring the teachings of Mount Healthy and its progeny that a plaintiff should not be better off because they raise a discrimination claim."
1994.93-1543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3015.702,3022.373,"Mr. Wayland, can we just go back to the question, the liability question, the basic claim?"
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,3063.617,3092.802,"If the employer could prove, Your Honor, that it would have terminated her absent the illegal intent, if it would have taken the same action based upon the stealing of the confidential documents, then the answer is yes, she would not have a claim for relief under the discrimination laws, and that is the teaching of this Court in the plurality opinion in Price Waterhouse, that's the teaching of the principle in Mount Healthy, and that's what this Court has recognized over and over again."
1994.93-1543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3094.421,3098.023,How do you... can you just explain one thing that I don't understand clearly?
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,3139.35,3144.671,"--Well, Your Honor, I suspect because in those cases there were disputes of fact that required a trial."
1994.93-1543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3190.283,3218.766,"Are you saying, then, if you don't have a summary judgment case on the defense, then under your theory, suppose the employer says, objectively there were grounds for discharging her but there's a dispute whether they would in ract have, could, in your view of this kind of case, the trial judge say, well, I'm going to have a trial on that, because if I find that they would have fired her for a reason for which they could have fired her, I save everybody a lot of time, because that's totally dispositive?"
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,3218.766,3219.35,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3221.218,3225.706,"So you could do the same thing in Price Waterhouse, and the same thing in the Mount Healthy setting as well?"
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,3225.706,3227.456,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, I did not hear the second--"
1994.93-1543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3227.456,3240.799,"In the Mount Healthy type case, the mixed motive case, you could do the very same thing, say, I'm going to have a trial on the defense first, and we'll never have a trial on the discrimination part because that becomes irrelevant?"
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,3240.799,3244.501,"--The Court certainly could do that in handling the case, Your Honor."
1994.93-1543,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3266.681,3289.212,"Of course, in terms of what is properly disputed, isn't it a relevant fact in determining whether they would have discharged that they are coming forward with this evidence and they are trying to prove this we assume, for the sake of argument, after they have violated the statute, so isn't the fact of the statutory violation always going to be relevant except in a case in which it's stipulated that they would have discharged anyway?"
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,3289.212,3291.731,"Well, Your Honor, it's relevant but it's not determinative."
1994.93-1543,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3292.781,3313.412,"No, but it simply goes to the question whether you can, in fact, litigate solely your affirmative defense, and it seems to me that in the case... except in a case in which it is stipulated that there would have been a discharge absent the discrimination, you really cannot so divide the issues, because the one is relevant to your determination under the other."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,3313.412,3323.12,"--Well, Your Honor, I think the better practice probably would be to have a trial on the merits with this being an affirmative defense, but it's similar to going to the qualification requirement of a plaintiff."
1994.93-1543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3323.12,3324.553,But didn't you move for summary judgment?
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,3326.321,3326.938,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1994.93-1543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3326.938,3330.623,You moved for summary judgment on the basis of an affirmative defense.
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,3330.623,3331.975,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3332.241,3338.879,"But you... so... but you think the better practice would have been to reject your motion and say well, let's have a trial first and then decide it?"
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,3338.879,3339.362,"--No, Your Honor."
1994.93-1543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3422.466,3433.757,"One of the facts of this case, I guess, is no matter how serious your misconduct was, and we assume, of course, it was serious enough to justify discharge, it didn't cause any pecuniary damage to the employer."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,3433.757,3434.891,"--That it did not, Your Honor?"
1994.93-1543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3434.891,3438.578,"It did not cause any pecuniary, not even a nickel of damages to the employer."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,3438.578,3441.947,"I don't think it would be any provable damages to the employer, Your Honor."
1994.93-1543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3442.863,3443.68,No.
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,3443.68,3447.215,"I think there was certainly an injury and a damage to the employer, but I don't know that's something they could recover for."
1994.93-1543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3447.215,3449.834,"She just told her husband some company secrets, basically."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,3449.834,3452.35,"Well, she breached her confidence and trust, Your Honor."
1994.93-1543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3452.35,3452.7,"Yes, I understand."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,3452.7,3454.469,She stole documents from the company.
1994.93-1543,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3454.469,3455.636,"Thank you, Mr. Wayland."
1994.93-1543,2,40754,r_eddie_wayland,,3455.636,3455.821,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1994.93-1543,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3455.821,3460.856,"Mr. Terry, you have 1 minute remaining."
1994.93-1543,3,36817,michael_e_terry,,3460.856,3479.901,"Justice Ginsburg, there are questions of fact in this case."
1994.93-1543,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3489.806,3490.322,Very well.
