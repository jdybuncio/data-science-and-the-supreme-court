1972.72-804,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,51.291,"We’ll hear arguments next in 72-804, Ruckelshaus against the Sierra Club."
1972.72-804,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,56.907,60.253,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-804,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,270.942,276.031,"Mr. Wallace, what you just said is something that’s I’ve been wondering about in this case."
1972.72-804,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,280.198,281.349,The parties agreed.
1972.72-804,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,281.349,287.265,And that parties agreed to consider it something else for a limited purpose i.e. for the purposes of appeal.
1972.72-804,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,291.016,291.636,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1972.72-804,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,291.636,294.204,And that is all that ever has happen in this case.
1972.72-804,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,294.204,298.102,The parties agreed that it involved the controlling issue of law that settled the rights between the parties.
1972.72-804,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,298.102,319.961,"For purposes that appear to the Court of Appeals, then really isn’t the only – isn’t the frame of the issues here whether or not the Court was right in issuing a preliminary injunction not whether or not it was right or wrong on the merits of the case."
1972.72-804,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,319.961,325.742,I think not Your Honor because what this Court is reviewing is the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
1972.72-804,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,325.742,331.928,Which in our opinions simply affirm the preliminary injunction of the District Court?
1972.72-804,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,331.928,349.891,On the basis of the District’s Court’s opinion as to the legal issues but on the basis of the submission of parties that this was the controlling legal issue that would govern the practice of the administrator and whether the administrator could approve or disapprove the state plans that are pending before it.
1972.72-804,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,349.891,365.899,"But the preliminary injunction is issued generally as we all know on matters and questions of probabilities and possibilities, threats of harm and how immediate and irreparable they are and what not without getting to a definitive decision of underlying merits and that’s all what was done here, isn’t it?"
1972.72-804,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,365.899,373.486,"No, the rationale of the District Court’s memorandum opinion is not based on probabilities at all."
1972.72-804,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,389.654,395.234,"Well, they say first -- first the plaintiffs made a strong showing that they are likely to prevail on the merits."
1972.72-804,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,401.504,412.07,"They just reached the Virginia Petroleum Jobbers type of standards for this interim purpose, didn’t they?"
1972.72-804,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,412.07,425.065,"Well, that is the Court said initially this matter came before the Court in that posture."
1972.72-804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,427.927,430.452,"Mr. Wallace, I don’t mean to interrupt."
1972.72-804,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,478.015,480.563,But it was not intended as just for the part --
1972.72-804,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,480.563,487.713,"There couldn’t have been an appeal, could they or am I mistaken if it were an interlocutory injunction to the Court of Appeals?"
1972.72-804,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,487.713,499.84,I think an injunction is appealable so long as it then joins the enforcement of a federal statute.
1972.72-804,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,503.426,505.394,This was a preliminary injunction.
1972.72-804,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,505.394,525.71,"But Mr. Wallace pardon me, having in mind that the Court of Appeals wrote no opinion but merely acted on the District Court’s memorandum, which I might say parenthetically they don’t very often do in an important case."
1972.72-804,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,541.503,550.245,"The terms of the stipulation, which Mr. Justice Rehnquist just pointed out plus the chronological situation."
1972.72-804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,625.919,627.935,"Well, it’s not the way the District Court put it."
1972.72-804,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,635.996,643.33,"Well, that -- and its answer was based on what the parties regarded as the governing legal question."
1972.72-804,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,652.06,676.385,"Would you have a chance of success for my satisfaction that the Court of Appeals did anything more as Mr. Justice Sturgis intimated then say that in the particular circumstances, the action of the District Court was not an abusive discretion as distinguished from whether it was right or wrong on the ultimate legal issue?"
1972.72-804,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,676.385,683.049,"Well, that is not the issue that the parties stipulated where it was the issue before the Court of Appeals."
1972.72-804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,720.344,729.033,"And certainly, the Government’s application for a stay refers to what is worth to a final judgment?"
1972.72-804,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,729.033,729.853,That is correct.
1972.72-804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,729.853,735.245,The application not only to the District Court but I take it to the Court of Appeals.
1972.72-804,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,735.245,741.385,This had to be shortcut to get around this Court not taking certified questions.
1972.72-804,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,741.385,745.086,It was not regarded as a shortcut at all.
1972.72-804,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,747.253,755.609,"The Court of Appeals merely passed on the District Court’s pending judgment without any opinion of their own, right?"
1972.72-804,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,755.609,756.339,Without any opinion of their own.
1972.72-804,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,756.339,758.827,So they passed it up there.
1972.72-804,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,758.827,764.008,Well it was not mandatory for this Court to grant certiorari.
1972.72-804,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,1694.989,1697.441,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.72-804,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3586.778,3590.182,May it please the Court.
