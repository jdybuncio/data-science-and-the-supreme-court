1979.78-572,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,30.169,We'll hear arguments next in United States Parole Commission against Geraghty.
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,32.606,35.658,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.78-572,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,103.41,111.658,"Was there an allegation of $10,000 in dispute in this case for jurisdictional purposes?"
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,111.658,117.38,"There was not an alligation of -- of $10,000 in controversy."
1979.78-572,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,178.763,183.143,Had the plaintiff's prayed for subclass certification in the District Court?
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,183.143,186.146,Neither in the District Court nor in the Court of Appeals.
1979.78-572,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,198.361,199.516,Raised it to sua sponte?
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,199.516,203.102,"Yes, the Court of Appeals raised it sua sponte."
1979.78-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,253.636,262.511,"Mr. Jones, would this case become moot if the plaintiff had been paroled before the certification question had been decided in the District Court?"
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,262.511,264.631,It would be equally moot.
1979.78-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,264.631,269.07,"So, it really doesn't matter if it's before or after sort of -- either -- either before certification or after --"
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,269.07,269.879,What matters (Voice Overlap) --
1979.78-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,269.879,271.379,-- certified be the same issue.
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,271.379,271.599,Right.
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,281.487,289.098,"But you -- if there -- if the class have been certified and then it -- it had become, ""moot"" that the case would have gone on?"
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,289.098,292.145,"Yes, so that under Franks against Bowman Transportation Company."
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,292.145,292.323,"Yes, yes."
1979.78-572,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,292.323,293.772,And how about Sosna against Iowa?
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,293.772,295.054,Sosna and --
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,295.054,296.671,"And also, under Sosna."
1979.78-572,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,296.671,297.703,Yes.
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,297.703,310.942,"And I suppose if in the Court of Appeals, the court had just happened to break up its decision in two parts and as the very -- and as the very -- and as the very first opinion that wrote, it reversed the class action."
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,314.679,316.431,Right.
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,316.431,325.794,"-- suppose that the Court had decided that the class action decision was wrong and then he was paroled, then it would be Franks, I suppose or Sosna."
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,325.794,329.7,"Well, if the class was certified, it would be a Franks or a Sosna."
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,427.374,429.404,"I know that's what the -- what the result, was."
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,437.75,437.971,Yes.
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,442.213,445.934,I know -- I don't understand how it can be really.
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,446.34,451.698,"Well, let me illustrate by com -- by comparing the facts of Roper."
1979.78-572,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,451.698,452.685,"Which one is Roper, the one we're just talking --"
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,452.685,454.262,"Roper, the case that we're just arguing."
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,454.262,455.757,Right.
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,455.757,463.358,"The question in Roper would seem to be whether in the context of that case, the judgement of the District Court made the case moot."
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,499.184,502.045,How do you feel which should decide Roper?
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,502.045,516.182,"Well, I would -- I'm reluctant to -- to indicate the result, but I think the question there in Roper is whether -- is whether the judgment of the District Court mooted the case, but the question in -- that's not --"
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,516.182,520.546,The interest of -- what interest did the named party had after judgement?
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,520.546,521.153,In Roper?
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,521.153,521.942,Yes.
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,521.942,523.144,"Well, he had -- he had the same --"
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,523.144,524.893,Had been a certified class.
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,524.893,531.511,"He had the same interest that this Court hypothesized, would exist in United Airlines against McDonald and in Coopers and Lybrand."
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,531.511,536.707,"Well, I know, but he did -- he didn't have any interest himself, except in -- to continue the class action."
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,536.707,539.371,"Well, in some context, the plaintiff will have an interest."
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,539.371,544.186,"Well, did he just -- tell me -- well, just tell me what the interest was in McDonald or in Roper --"
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,544.186,544.889,Well I --
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,544.889,546.036,-- other than -- other than to --
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,546.036,546.811,I -- I'd like to start --
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,546.811,548.901,-- other than the class part of the case.
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,548.901,552.288,"In -- in McDonald, the -- the plaintiff's interest in the class --"
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,552.288,553.807,How about Roper?
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,553.807,555.843,I thought you're giving me a choice.
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,565.854,571.931,"So he -- but his only interest after judgement, was the class aspect to the case."
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,571.931,575.827,"Well, in the benefit that he would obtain from having a class claim --"
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,575.827,576.457,Exactly.
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,579.946,580.71,Yes.
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,580.71,584.539,"Now, in this case, how about this case?"
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,584.539,592.032,"Well, the distinction in this case is that the respondent's claims expired without the benefit of any District Court decision."
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,592.032,598.492,"I know, but he still had a very solid interest in maintaining and pushing the class aspect of the case."
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,598.492,602.2,"He may have had an interest in pushing it, but he didn't have a live claim."
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,604.609,606.832,"So, the one in Roper."
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,606.832,607.22,No.
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,607.22,610.234,"His claim, his own claim had been extinguished."
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,610.234,613.069,"Well, that's the question in Roper, is whether the judgement --"
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,613.069,615.083,That's the question here.
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,615.083,623.419,"Well, I think the question is a little different in the two cases, although the ultimate question is the same, whether the plaintiff's claim is moot."
1979.78-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,636.174,650.791,"Mr. Jones, are you saying this, so I get your point that if in this case, the District Judge had ordered the man paroled and the Government had acquiesced in the order and said we won't appeal then it would not have been moot? Would that be a different case?"
1979.78-572,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,651.649,652.843,It'd be more ahead on the previous case.
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,652.843,654.992,It would -- it would be different from the case we have.
1979.78-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,655.335,660.64,"Would it legally -- is it different in any significant respect and if not, why are you laboring the point?"
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,660.64,668.212,"Well, even under Mancusi against Stubbs, it depends on I think, in part on how we acquiesce in the claim."
1979.78-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,673.29,674.117,(Voice Overlap) opinion.
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,676.216,680.066,"Well, if we don't appeal, then the -- you're asking whether he can appeal?"
1979.78-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,680.066,691.728,"Yes, that's -- wouldn't then the case be precisely the same as the Roper case because you're distinguishing Roper on the ground that here, the parole came without a court order and I say well, suppose we had a court order, what -- why would it be --"
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,691.728,703.197,"Well, the distinction I suppose between that case and Roper is that after the order was entered, the Government by your hypothetical, in effect, settled its claim."
1979.78-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,703.197,704.372,"Well, that's what the bank in turn --"
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,704.372,708.237,"But -- but the bank wants to settle the claim, but Roper never accepted the tender."
1979.78-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,708.836,711.038,Because he wants to maintain his class action and the same thing --
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,711.038,711.586,That's right.
1979.78-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,711.586,712.106,-- as Geraghty.
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,712.106,712.391,But the different --
1979.78-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,712.391,714.402,-- (Voice Overlap) go out of jail by making the litigation going.
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,714.402,721.775,"The difference is that if -- if the claim is in fact settled, that raises a whole new different -- a whole different question of mootness."
1979.78-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,727.784,735.548,"When neither -- in neither case are they settling the class aspects of the claim, but they're settling everything else, isn't that right?"
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,735.548,737.897,"Well, I'm not sure what you mean by, in either case."
1979.78-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,737.897,740.384,In either Roper or Geraghty?
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,740.384,742.143,"Well, in Geraghty, there was no settlement."
1979.78-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,742.143,746.269,"Well, I mean that Geraghty is modified by saying he gets out pursuant to a court order."
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,746.724,747.254,It maybe --
1979.78-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,747.254,749.814,-- are you relying on the nonexistence of a court order?
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,751.755,757.305,"Well, the question really is -- is what -- in Roper, the question is what the bank's relying on."
1979.78-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,775.195,778.958,"You mean, one of his claims, but he had two claims, didn't he?"
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,778.958,790.959,"Well, he -- the claim that he had that expired was -- was his claim which was up to that -- that point, the only claim that he was the only party in the case who could raise any claim."
1979.78-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,792.328,794.766,"Well, he's claimed class action too, didn't he?"
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,794.766,796.929,He sought his class certification.
1979.78-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,796.929,799.478,"Well, isn't that a claim?"
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,799.478,800.3,"Well, alright, it's --"
1979.78-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,800.3,801.317,"Less -- less in argue, you know (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,801.317,806.479,"-- he -- he sought that additional relief, but his claim expired before --"
1979.78-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,806.479,809.199,His personal claim for himself expired.
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,809.199,811.128,"Well, it's -- yes."
1979.78-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,811.128,815.317,"But his claim for -- to represent the class didn't expire, did it?"
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,815.317,817.753,"Well, he couldn't service the class representative."
1979.78-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,817.753,818.495,Why not?
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,818.495,827.349,"Well, under Sosna against Iowa, the Court noted there has to be a prisoner and -- not a prisoner, there has to be a plaintiff with a live claim at the time of class certification."
1979.78-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,827.944,831.734,"So, all he has to it buy more one at a time?"
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,831.734,834.312,"Well, the Parole Commission didn't buy anybody off."
1979.78-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,851.373,860.067,"No, the -- they considered -- one word, they didn't accept it, but he and the man did accept it because he couldn't [Laughs] accept it."
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,860.067,860.17,Well --
1979.78-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,860.17,860.768,"The parole, right?"
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,860.768,863.446,But I -- I think that the -- that a point that is critical that you've raised is that --
1979.78-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,863.446,867.69,"Well, I mean, I just couldn't -- you keep relying on this claim."
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,874.78,881.822,"Well, he may have stared with two claims, although I don't know if I would phrase it that way, but I would certainly say that after his individual claim became --"
1979.78-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,881.822,883.826,"Well, he started with two alligations, didn't he?"
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,883.826,884.572,Alright.
1979.78-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,904.753,918.544,"So that in any class action case, all you have to do is settle with the individual party and they'll knock out the class action."
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,918.544,920.51,There -- it's possible we noted about --
1979.78-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,920.51,922.583,"It's (Voice Overlap) true, if not the end of class action."
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,922.583,925.515,We noted in our brief that it's possible to -- to say --
1979.78-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,925.515,925.8,That's right.
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,925.8,943.201,"-- that if a -- if a defendant undertakes a series of actions in which he immediately pays off class representatives' claims before certification, it's possible that the case could be viewed like Gerstein against Pugh that entered the mootness of the claim was inevitably intervening before even the class certification order could be ruled on."
1979.78-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,943.201,952.712,"It ought to be the case -- a very old case of Hansberry against Lee whereas the Court said, ""You couldn't do that way back."""
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,953.671,956.329,"Well, I -- we don't dispute that."
1979.78-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,956.329,958.649,"Well, I think you are going into ancient history."
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,958.649,958.871,Yes.
1979.78-572,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,969.962,973.413,Would it be irrational to refer back to the Roper?
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,997.912,998.908,I think that's correct.
1979.78-572,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1013.261,1023.601,"No, relating that this case, would Geraghty's situation be any better if there were injunctive relief with respect to the class action claim?"
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1023.601,1026.7,His relief would be unaffected.
1979.78-572,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1026.7,1028.489,He is either out or he's in.
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1028.489,1037.885,"Well, that's the nature of the parole relief that he requests."
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1118.66,1137.412,"And just before you leave the mootness, I take that your position would be the same here if -- if this case didn't involve this kind of a claim, but involved the Roper kind of a claim that the -- that the Roper case became moot on appeal."
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1145.043,1154.408,"If they had settled in the Court of Appeals, then the question is whether the settlement manifested an intention to -- for all claims to be ended."
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1154.408,1167.577,"Well and Roper -- Roper just took his money and -- and that -- that the order denying the class certification, not yet been reversed, Roper is just paid off and he accepted it."
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1167.577,1182.692,"Well, I think that that's -- that issue that the Court had in mind in McDonald in its footnote, when it noted that a settlement is not necessarily always intended to extinguish the plaintiff's right to appeal."
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1194.087,1201.55,"(Voice Overlap) -- everybody -- everybody agrees that -- no one claims that the Roper would have any for himself, hasn't anymore claimed."
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1212.14,1219.457,"Well, I don't -- I wouldn't say that his -- that his personal claim is moot, by the fact that he's had a favorable judgement."
1979.78-572,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1225.785,1229.755,(Voice Overlap) we have to do enforce a judgement when the money is in the registry of the court.
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1229.755,1231.345,"Well, if -- if he goes to the --"
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1231.345,1234.738,"In his pocket then, might be an example to you, it's in his pocket."
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1234.738,1235.262,Well and I --
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1235.262,1241.185,"They -- they settle with him and pay him and -- and he says, ""Yes, that's all the money I'm entitled to."""
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1247.953,1252.406,"Well, under McDonald, he would be entitled to seek such a settlement."
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1252.406,1255.209,You mean to pursue the class aspect of the case?
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1255.209,1258.22,"That's -- that's in effect, what happened in McDonald."
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1258.22,1262.356,"And yet, you think, Geraghty is different."
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1262.356,1264.815,Geraghty is different because he hasn't settled his claim.
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1266.579,1267.662,It's just worn-out.
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1267.662,1268.887,His claim expired.
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1276.331,1276.86,"Well, then --"
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1276.86,1279.724,"In this case, he doesn't have a claim he can take to federal court."
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1279.724,1285.967,"In my example of you -- in my example of you, there was nothing left to adjudicate on Roper's claim in my example I just gave you, because --"
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1285.967,1292.545,"Well, I don't want to say that I wouldn't agree with you that that was a settlement that extinguished all the claims that Roper had left to raise."
1979.78-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1295.27,1306.49,"Mr. Jones, your difference is not -- that if they had rushed up the period for parole would be at one thing, but this was just normal parole."
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1307.351,1308.563,This was normal parole.
1979.78-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1308.936,1313.441,So that's -- the point is it wasn't done for the benefit of this case.
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1313.441,1314.226,Certainly not.
1979.78-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1317.78,1321.864,And he's not the (Inaudible) between that and Roper and in any other case.
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1322.529,1325.634,That's a significant difference that we rely on.
1979.78-572,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1325.634,1344.935,"Well, what if in Roper, Mr. Jones, the plaintiff had written a letter to the bank before suit saying, ""I claim $15,000 and if you don't pay me off, I'm going to bring a class action for myself and on a bunch of other people"" and the bank replied, ""Here is a check for $15,000."""
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1356.307,1357.46,"No, I don't think he would."
1979.78-572,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1368.506,1377.058,Has the class action aspect had existed separate and apart from a live controversy as to some substantive matter?
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1377.058,1379.578,"And under the rules of procedure, it can't."
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1379.578,1379.927,Well --
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1379.927,1380.643,I also wanted to --
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1380.643,1392.354,"Well, then I would think you were to say on that basis, how -- how come Sosna or how come McDonald, the class aspect of the case survive?"
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1392.354,1392.988,"Well, in Sosna, the reason that it --"
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1392.988,1394.102,The disappearance of the name that was claimed.
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1394.102,1396.665,-- survived was because a new party had come into the case.
1979.78-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1406.847,1408.671,No party left in Roper --
1979.78-572,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1408.671,1414.826,"Would be easier for you, if we overrule McDonald?"
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1414.826,1421.966,"I can't deny that it would be easier for us, but I wouldn't want to go on record as saying that McDonald is irreconcilable with our position."
1979.78-572,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1421.966,1423.52,"Well, you don't want to go on record with that."
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1431.506,1433.223,"Well, then let me go on to the merits of this case --"
1979.78-572,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1433.223,1435.725,"Perhaps, this Court gave you no choice."
1979.78-572,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1435.725,1443.506,"You're -- you're in bet with Roper whether you like it or not, I'm afraid."
1979.78-572,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1443.506,1447.305,"My white lie hasn't come on, but should it have?"
1979.78-572,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1491.586,1496.88,"Very well, Mr. Jones."
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1498.539,1500.017,Thank you.
1979.78-572,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1523.427,1528.646,What -- what can the judicial branch do for Mr. Geraghty now?
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1528.646,1534.078,"Well, Mr. Geraghty is here on behalf of these unnamed members of the potential class."
1979.78-572,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1534.078,1535.566,That's not my question.
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1538.474,1538.705,Oh!
1979.78-572,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1561.423,1563.278,"Are you saying -- you say, they can do for him."
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1568.267,1568.79,That's correct.
1979.78-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1604.462,1607.873,"As of now, he couldn't file any kind of lawsuit, could he?"
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1607.873,1609.576,That's correct.
1979.78-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1609.576,1611.011,And that's how he stands now?
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1611.011,1612.189,That's correct.
1979.78-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1616.671,1618.405,That's -- that's a different case.
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1618.405,1619.426,That's -- that's correct.
1979.78-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1619.426,1622.126,"As of right now, he can't file anything, anything."
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1622.126,1622.44,That's correct.
1979.78-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1624.039,1626.024,"I didn't say it personally, I said any kind."
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1630.132,1631.128,"Not, about the parole system."
1979.78-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1634.388,1636.357,He couldn't anywhere --
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1636.357,1636.375,But --
1979.78-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1636.375,1639.347,-- but he can -- he can argue here?
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1639.347,1640.409,"Well, he can't continue --"
1979.78-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1640.409,1642.546,He can argue here?
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1642.546,1643.225,"Well, yes."
1979.78-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1643.225,1645.29,He could argue in any of the courts?
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1645.29,1650.052,"That he could argue in the Court of Appeals, he could argue in the District Court, at the time the action was commenced --"
1979.78-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1650.052,1650.925,How?
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1653.191,1661.348,"As of now, he's continuing to assert the standing of the persons who are presently in custody, who have presently aggrieved by the system."
1979.78-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1661.768,1663.611,But how can he file a lawsuit?
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1663.611,1664.76,He's not filing a lawsuit now.
1979.78-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1665.412,1667.35,"I understand he can't file any now, can't he?"
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1667.35,1673.294,"That's correct, but he can continue to defend through appeal the case once it has been filed."
1979.78-572,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1712.928,1716.902,"But under that analysis, you could be the named plaintiff just as well as Mr. Geraghty?"
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1716.902,1717.36,That's not true.
1979.78-572,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1722.926,1726.98,"So, there is some sort of a bridge-crossing at some stage rather or --"
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1726.98,1735.041,"Well, I think the rule is at the time the action is commenced, the class representative must be a member of the class that he seeks to represent."
1979.78-572,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1744.245,1749.7,But he wasn't a member of the class which he's -- which he described as complaint?
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1749.7,1750.411,He --
1979.78-572,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1750.411,1754.423,I mean that they had -- the Court of Appeals held that that would not be a proper class.
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1754.423,1761.104,"Well, that's -- I have been saying since -- in all the briefs that the Government is misreading the opinion of the Court of Appeals."
1979.78-572,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1797.212,1802.894,"Well, if you lose this case, it just means that some other member of the class can sue, I guess?"
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1802.894,1803.925,That's correct.
1979.78-572,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1803.925,1808.216,"In this case anyway, you've lost a filing fee?"
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1808.216,1809.441,That -- that's correct.
1979.78-572,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1809.956,1815.124,"In the Roper type case, it maybe that people are foreclosed by the statute of limitations?"
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1815.124,1816.245,"Well, the --"
1979.78-572,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1816.245,1819.209,But -- but there's no problem about that in this case?
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1819.209,1826.826,That's correct that we -- this actually is the second case which was filed to present the same theories as to the invalidity of the guidelines.
1979.78-572,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1829.308,1829.756,Right.
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1829.756,1833.207,And that became moot and this was for as a class action to avoid that problem.
1979.78-572,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1841.424,1847.104,Or you could -- or you might have had five or six named plaintiffs to start with?
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1847.104,1850.021,"Well, I -- I could've had as many as -- the number of our prisoners."
1979.78-572,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1850.021,1851.24,As you wanted -- as you wanted.
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1851.24,1862.354,These people are anxious to -- for me to represent their rights and obtain vindication and have -- have this Court consider whether the Parole Commission in making parole release decisions --
1979.78-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1862.354,1865.13,Why didn't you have one of them to intervene?
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1865.13,1866.618,I did have one to intervene.
1979.78-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1868.707,1870.881,Why'd you have another one to intervene?
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1872.121,1876.855,"-- I have -- I think, 13 potential interveners in this Court."
1979.78-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1876.855,1879.878,Did they -- did you ask us to let them intervene?
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1879.878,1884.176,"Well, the motion that was filed as the substitute respondents or in the alternative to intervene."
1979.78-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1884.176,1887.021,"Oh and the alternative, I missed the alternative."
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1887.021,1888.565,"Okay, I've --"
1979.78-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1888.565,1891.303,But it is my point (Inaudible)
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1891.303,1901.821,"I -- and there are -- those people, the original prospective, additional respondent's, petitioning interveners, most of them have already satisfied their sentences, so there are --"
1979.78-572,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1901.821,1904.431,And you don't -- and are these people indigent?
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1907.823,1909.565,"Well, we're the respondent, we don't pay for that."
1979.78-572,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1911.322,1912.996,But you brought the suit?
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1912.996,1917.234,"Well, Mr. Geraghty paid the $15 filing fee in the beginning."
1979.78-572,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1946.458,1947.179,Yes.
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1947.179,1952.289,"That's the situation presented by Mr. Hayes, as one of the additional perspective respondents."
1979.78-572,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2169.205,2171.251,"Now, where do -- where do we find this in the record?"
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,2171.251,2172.931,That's going to come out on remand.
1979.78-572,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2177.521,2181.058,Was there an offer of proof to this effect?

1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,2197.078,2219.555,-- represents in this Court that we use our judgment in making individual parole release decisions and I'm making these representations to make it clear to this Court that we expect the evidence to show exactly the opposite in a District Court and that the Court should not accept the Government's representations which have not been the subject of a reliable fact-finding in the District Court.
1979.78-572,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2235.599,2239.35,"You mean the -- the maximum, the full amount of the sentence?"

1979.78-572,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2241.77,2242.361,Yes.
1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,2242.361,2245.51,"Let's say, the judge gives him a five-year sentence."

1979.78-572,1,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,2659.859,2668.106,"That the -- if -- I think, the traditional ways parties perceive an injury and then seek legal assistance and that's exactly what's happened here."

1979.78-572,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2709.314,2726.446,"I -- I wanted to point out again that the respondents' arguments basically, go to the wisdom and reasonableness of the Parole Guidelines system and Senator Burdick and the members of the Conference Committee simply disagree on whether this is a wise system."
1979.78-572,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2802.713,2814.328,"Are there any prisoners who in this setting, sentenced for five years maximum, who maybe kept in prison for longer than five years by action of the Parole Board?"

1979.78-572,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2826.605,2827.756,That's correct.

1979.78-572,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2845.363,2849.439,It is not a factor that the Commission considers under the guidelines.
1979.78-572,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2849.439,2852.324,It -- only to the extent that imposes either a minimum or a maximum (Voice Overlap) --
1979.78-572,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2852.324,2861.292,It determines the eligibility for Parole but it doesn't determine the Commission's exercise of discretion.
