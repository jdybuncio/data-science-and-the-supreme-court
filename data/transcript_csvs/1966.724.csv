1966.724,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,36.074,"Number 724, Frank A. Dusch et al, Appellants, versus J.E. Clayton Davis et al."
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,38.594,42.218,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.724,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,293.797,296.841,How was that set up on the ballot?
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,296.841,307.315,It is set up on the ballot by having the borough election for a resident councilman from Blackwater.
1966.724,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,316.214,319.364,"And everyone in the city votes for one, is that it?"
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,319.364,320.208,That is correct.
1966.724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,350.299,353.684,"Oh, what's the purpose of the residential requirement then?"
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,353.684,370.112,The purpose of the residential requirement is to guarantee that the view points of all sections of an amazingly complex city are going to be presented to its governing body.
1966.724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,370.112,381.682,What's on the assumption then that people who lived in a certain place are going to have a certain point of view or going -- or suppose to represent the area from which -- in which they reside?
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,381.682,385.506,I don't think it can be stated quite that way Mr. Justice White.
1966.724,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,435.797,440.789,He's still responsible in other words for the citywide election and not just to a borough election.
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,440.789,441.984,That is correct.
1966.724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,572.548,575.832,(Inaudible) the mayor or rather executive officer?
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,575.832,576.577,I beg your pardon?
1966.724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,576.577,579.234,Who was the mayor or other executive officer?
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,579.234,581.349,The mayor is the president --
1966.724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,581.349,581.447,Of the Council --
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,581.447,582.535,-- of the City Council.
1966.724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,582.535,583.947,I see.
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,583.947,583.987,The --
1966.724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,583.987,585.64,A city manager or anything like that?
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,585.64,588.635,A city manager who is appointed to serve at the pleasure --
1966.724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,588.635,588.876,Pleasure of the council.
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,588.876,590.384,-- of the City Council.
1966.724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,590.472,595.892,"And he is -- he runs as the chief administrative officer, the day-to-day executive --"
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,595.892,595.984,That is correct.
1966.724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,595.984,597.507,-- operations of the city.
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,597.507,601.121,"Now, what about the City of Virginia Beach?"
1966.724,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,601.121,607.307,"What is the stature of the towns that are incorporated in the county, have they any?"
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,607.307,607.324,Now --
1966.724,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,607.324,609.112,Any function at all?
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,609.112,610.777,That's been in mind Your Honor.
1966.724,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,635.449,635.805,Yes.
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,635.805,640.147,-- are quite different in our system of local government.
1966.724,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,640.147,644.359,"Well, how do you subdivide the city into these districts then?"
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,644.359,652.409,"Well, there are seven boroughs, the boundaries of which are historical more than anything else."
1966.724,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,738.474,740.031,What's size did you say it is?
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,740.031,742.555,300 square miles.
1966.724,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,764.458,765.281,What are the dimensions?
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,768.259,769.629,15 by 20.
1966.724,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,769.629,770.966,"15 by 20, alright."
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,770.966,772.265,That's correct.
1966.724,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,947.03,950.217,What ground was it declared unconstitutional?
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,950.217,955.134,"On the ground that one man, one vote applies at local levels of government."
1966.724,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,961.648,963.554,What year was that?
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,963.554,966.071,In 1965.
1966.724,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,966.071,970.882,"1965, oh, I haven't thought you went back a little farther."
1966.724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,970.882,976.825,And the former plan first authorized five from the old City of Virginia Beach?
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,976.825,977.309,Right.
1966.724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,977.309,980.892,And the present one authorizes four?
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,980.892,981.274,No sir.
1966.724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,981.274,981.828,Okay.
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,981.828,987.586,"The present one authorizes one from the old City of Virginia Beach, elected at large."
1966.724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,987.586,988.044,Yes.
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,988.044,989.976,One from each of the six --
1966.724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,989.976,990.122,Yes.
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,990.122,992.657,-- former magisterial districts elected at large --
1966.724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,992.657,993.1,Yes.
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,993.1,997.517,And four elected without any residential requirements at all.
1966.724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,997.517,997.847,Right.
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,997.847,998.621,They could come from --
1966.724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,998.621,998.821,Yes.
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,998.905,1000.493,-- the old City of Virginia Beach.
1966.724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1000.493,1000.766,Right.
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1000.766,1002.589,Now we come to this --
1966.724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1002.589,1015.85,"But the old plan, I suppose this isn't important but I -- the old plan like the present one, did it provide that all of the people wherever they live were to be elected by all of the voters (Voice Overlap)?"
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1015.85,1016.397,No sir --
1966.724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1016.397,1016.408,I see.
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1016.408,1017.256,It was a strict --
1966.724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1017.256,1017.802,That was the basic difference.
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1017.802,1019.608,-- borough award system.
1966.724,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1036.615,1038.624,And when was that adopted?
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1038.624,1040.09,In 1966.
1966.724,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1040.09,1042.453,This was after the courts reversal?
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1042.453,1044.82,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.724,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1092.033,1098.833,"Mr. Frazier, may I ask in that -- anticipate -- in fact, hasn't there been an election of the Seven-Four Plan?"
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1098.833,1099.488,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.724,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1099.488,1105.937,"And before at large, has it worked out that they've been elected from the heavily populated areas?"
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1105.937,1108.553,I believe three of them were.
1966.724,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1224.954,1231.963,"Then, why wouldn't that same argument apply to the state governments, in the state governments?"
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1231.963,1240.101,Because in your state governments you are already looking at -- for the -- the geography does that.
1966.724,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1240.101,1242.247,"No, it doesn't."
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1242.247,1242.416,Because --
1966.724,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1242.416,1264.413,"There may be some states in which there is a majority of the people are concentrated in one or two urban areas and then you've got lots of people in quite different types of enterprises, different sort -- different areas in the state far different in their essential characteristics."
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1264.413,1284.138,"Well, as I see the districting for state legislatures, however you do it, you're going to have one district that has -- that gives an opportunity to represent agricultural interest because thatâ€™s where they are."
1966.724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1294.064,1304.558,"Well, this would be though the equivalent if you're going to pursue that analogy, you would have to assume that the state legislature was wanting to elect it at large."
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1328.217,1329.013,That's correct.
1966.724,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1437.178,1440.311,Do you know any of the other states that have (Inaudible)?
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1440.311,1447.492,"No, I do not, nor do I know of any city that cries for the protection this city affords."
1966.724,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1455.974,1471.671,"Well, I gather your basic position however is that the Seven-Four Plan, acquiring as it does at large election of all eleven even though seven come from (Inaudible) satisfies the one man, one vote standing?"
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1471.671,1472.858,That is correct.
1966.724,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1490.509,1496.141,Then I suppose that there might be some difficulty.
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1521.554,1522.172,Well --
1966.724,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1522.172,1526.128,Because that would present an analogy to your problem.
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1533.784,1540.854,"Well, you have brought me to my final aspect of this argument."
1966.724,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1581.113,1588.995,"Well, is this -- this is -- are you suggesting Mr. Frazier this would require an analysis of each of the 20,000 units by this Court?"
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1588.995,1595.791,"Of course, that's the basic hurdle you've got to get over if youâ€™re going to decide one man, one vote does apply down here in local government."
1966.724,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1595.791,1597.891,"No, not unless you're going to say."
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1605.681,1607.364,This is true.
1966.724,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1611.888,1616.463,"Well, that approach certainly would require us to look at each in the 20,000 units?"
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1616.463,1620.45,"Well, I don't think it requires this Court to do it."
1966.724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1638.835,1656.642,"Are you suggesting that perhaps in Virginia Beach, you couldn't have had a single legislative power over this extensive territory if the one man, one vote principle had been known in advance?"
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1664.503,1665.366,Yes sir.
1966.724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1665.366,1665.416,-- consolidate?
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1665.416,1688.573,"No question in my mind about that because the record shows that the guarantee to the former city of Virginia Beach with its 8000 people of a degree of identity and representation in substance on the City Council was an essential element and without that, they never would have voted for this plan and no question about that."
1966.724,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1735.888,1757.529,Would you mind telling us what the special situation the Virginia Beach is as compared to other cities that amalgamate some smaller communities and some rural area into one larger city?
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1776.713,1780.751,"Well, I think there are two aspects of that question."
1966.724,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1862.628,1862.95,(Inaudible)
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1862.95,1874.689,Two things that characterize this city are its explosive growth and the heterogeneous makeup which is the City of Virginia Beach.
1966.724,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1874.689,1897.786,"Well in effect, I expect that what we're hearing is that Virginia Beach is more like a -- or Virginia City or whatever itâ€™s called, is more like a state than a city except possibly with respect to the powers of exercise in the two jurisdictions."
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1897.786,1905.371,"I don't think that -- I don't think I agree to that Mr. Justice Fortas, it exercises powers of a city."
1966.724,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1917.6,1919.792,"Then, I think we are in accord on that."
1966.724,0,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1919.792,1920.642,Alright.
1966.724,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1928.44,1930.001,Okay.
1966.724,1,26919,henry_ehowell_jr,,1930.001,1932.587,Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1966.724,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1933.34,1935.541,Mr. Howell.
1966.724,1,26919,henry_ehowell_jr,,1935.541,1953.568,"Before examining the parochial defects of the Seven-Four Plan which stand condemned by unanimous opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, I know that this case will be that platform for setting the guidelines for other cities across the United States of America."
1966.724,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2401.948,2413.562,"I suppose Mr. Howell, your point is that, once from Pungo, always from Pungo and the fact that it's a citywide election doesnâ€™t help the other residence of the city because they have to elect a man from Pungo."
1966.724,1,26919,henry_ehowell_jr,,2413.562,2421.509,"Exactly, and that's what Judge Bryan said in not quite so graphic words."
1966.724,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2444.898,2460.258,"I guess the problem is that it cuts the other way too doesn't it, that is to say unless you share Mr. Ryan's view about the virtues of city officials, I'm just teasing now."
1966.724,1,26919,henry_ehowell_jr,,2474.132,2480.61,What we want to do is integrate the farmer with the -- with this -- the suburbanite.
1966.724,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2519.857,2529.009,"I don't know how far it's appropriate to pursue this in practical inquiry about this ""once from Pungo, always from Pungo"" argument."
1966.724,1,26919,henry_ehowell_jr,,2546.295,2546.586,Judge Bryan has (Voice Overlap) --
1966.724,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2546.586,2555.133,There are only 600 and some total vote in Pungo in the -- these people are running to get the majority of the -- a majority of the vote of the entire city.
1966.724,1,26919,henry_ehowell_jr,,2562.665,2566.161,"Mr. Justice Stewart, I agree with the -- Circuit Judge Bryan when he said that --"
1966.724,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2566.161,2567.443,(Inaudible)
1966.724,1,26919,henry_ehowell_jr,,2567.443,2576.128,"No, would his naturally dominating provincial interest be neutralized by his defendants upon the electorate of the entire city for his office."
1966.724,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2589.036,2594.249,"It would be a very valid argument if there were only one candidate from Pungo, but there were -- there would be two or more --"
1966.724,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2594.249,2597.263,(Inaudible) than at Pungo?
1966.724,1,26919,henry_ehowell_jr,,2597.263,2602.259,Pungo has not been characterized by outstanding demonstration of political competition.
1966.724,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2615.839,2616.986,Because of that premise? [Laughter]
1966.724,1,26919,henry_ehowell_jr,,2616.986,2619.445,(Inaudible)
1966.724,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2619.445,2622.028,I thought the -- suppose you got (Inaudible) down there from the city?
