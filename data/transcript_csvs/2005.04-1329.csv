2005.04-1329,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.81,"We'll hear argument first in Illinois Tool Works Inc. v. Independent Ink, Inc.--"
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,8.625,12.116,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1329,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,89.208,96.028,Let me ask you about patents and tying products.
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,108.947,110.611,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2005.04-1329,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,140.231,143.862,"Well, does the patent somehow spread to cover the larger product?"
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,145.206,156.039,"Well, I think... I think the theory of the application of the presumption is, first of all, obviously, if the whole product is patented, then the presumption would be applicable."
2005.04-1329,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,171.233,174.301,"Well, I suppose... I suppose we could say... I just hadn't thought of it."
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,185.754,187.491,But then I think the argument--
2005.04-1329,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,187.491,193.199,"It's an... a very interesting question, but it seems to me that we could handle that by just saying, well, there's not a separate product."
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,193.199,203.571,"--Well, you could, but I think the question... the question would be whether that product as a whole in the marketplace, which is... part of it is made up by this component."
2005.04-1329,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,215.524,216.387,It's not a--
2005.04-1329,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,216.387,217.902,"Well, why would the person want if he thought that?"
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,226.487,234.633,"Well, Your Honor, at the... at the time that... that the inventions are patented, it's not clear... many inventors don't know what the market value of their product will be."
2005.04-1329,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,234.633,238.614,"Now, you see, you're talking about the wide... you... you say there are a lot of failed patents."
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,243.879,244.222,Well--
2005.04-1329,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,244.222,245.163,There might be.
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,245.826,255.996,--Our system encourages... there... it... it certainly is possible there are many patents that... that are... there are many inventions that are patented that don't have value in the marketplace.
2005.04-1329,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,257.7,257.92,"Well, there might be."
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,259.777,260.999,"--Yes, but the fact--"
2005.04-1329,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,260.999,269.305,"And in respect to there being a valueless patent, the owner would not be able to raise the price over what it otherwise would be."
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,278.152,282.154,"--Well, Your Honor, I... I think there are... there are two answers to that question."
2005.04-1329,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,306.787,311.863,"--As I understand the respondent's position, it's not the component."
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,336.758,337.952,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1329,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,367.47,368.061,"Well, let's go to--"
2005.04-1329,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.061,373.911,"Mr. Pincus, you... you had a second point you were going... in response to Justice Breyer's question."
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,375.003,392.657,"Well, my second point, in response to Justice Breyer, if I can recall it, was that in the component situation, which was one of the situations that we were talking about, that the problem with the component test, the presumptions are supposed to be easy to apply."
2005.04-1329,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,412.005,417.411,Isn't the refutation of the presumption really the same thing as a demonstration of market power?
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,417.411,418.655,Yes.
2005.04-1329,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,419.598,424.561,And... and we usually leave the demonstration of market power to the... to the plaintiff in the case.
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,424.561,426.418,"--Absolutely, Your Honor, and--"
2005.04-1329,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,426.418,437.391,So it... it'd be rather strange to... to have in this one category of cases the market power has to be... or lack of market power has to be demonstrated by the defendant.
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,437.391,440.89,--It would be extremely strange especially because there's the lack--
2005.04-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,440.89,450.531,Do you think there's a distinction... do you think there's a distinction between components in cases where there's a one on one relationship between the tied product and the tying product and cases like this which involve metering?
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,453.46,459.376,"--No, Your Honor, we don't because the... the economic literature--"
2005.04-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,459.376,464.291,But your earlier point was we know that a whole lot of patents are not all that important.
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,476.026,477.019,--No.
2005.04-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,493.658,500.711,"But if it's... if it is true, as your opponent says... and I don't know if it is or not... that you're able to get twice the price for the ink than you otherwise would get, does that... is that any evidence of market power?"
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,500.711,503.871,"Well, first of all, that... that is not... is not true."
2005.04-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,506.268,507.762,"Well, if it were what the record reflected."
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,507.762,515.275,"--Well, if it were what the record reflected and there was a relevant market that was... that was restricted to this ink, yes."
2005.04-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,546.329,549.097,But isn't it also true that some... some economists disagree?
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,553.399,562.717,"Well, I think the problem, Your Honor, is that the presumption does take one view over another based on... based on something that was adopted at the time there was no analysis."
2005.04-1329,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,631.254,637.724,"--Mr. Pincus, let me go... ask you to follow up on that and, in effect, go back to... to Justice Ginsburg's question."
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,677.835,690.261,"I think the short answer to that, Your Honor, is that there are a lot of antitrust cases that are filed that aren't successful, and there's no reason to believe that just because a plaintiff files a case, that it is going to be successful."
2005.04-1329,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,696.491,696.962,I was going to say I--
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,696.962,697.432,If there was--
2005.04-1329,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,697.432,701.877,--I would have thought the answer was you could say that in any case in which an antitrust case is... is brought.
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,704.536,706.089,"--Well, and I think it's an interactive nuisance."
2005.04-1329,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,717.843,718.724,Do you think the fact--
2005.04-1329,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,718.724,724.1,"In other words, the existence of the loss of... of... the existence of the lawsuit... of... of the presumption is what drives the lawsuit."
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,724.1,725.394,"Yes, exactly, Your Honor."
2005.04-1329,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,725.394,730.259,"--Well, does it drive the... I mean, it... it drives the lawsuit with respect to one element."
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,759.436,771.856,"Well, there certainly have been lawsuits that are unsuccessful, but... but, Your Honor, one of the problems with our litigation system is many cases are not tried to completion on the merits, especially expensive antitrust cases."
2005.04-1329,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,772.697,785.506,"Yes, but this is... this is basically a practical question, and I... I'm trying to get a... I guess because I'm not an antitrust lawyer, I'm trying to get a handle on how the presumption is actually working in the system, and I'm not sure that I understand it."
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,785.506,789.117,"--Well, right now I would say the presumption status is somewhat murky."
2005.04-1329,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,877.882,879.056,Suppose it's the other one that's the critical one.
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,879.056,880.652,"--Well, Your Honor, I think the--"
2005.04-1329,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,880.652,898.032,"And the other one being that... the attack on the problem is there happens to be instances where tying is justified for procompetitive reasons, risk sharing, maintaining product quality, probably Jerrold Electronics."
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,909.759,917.752,"--Well, Your Honor, I... I think there obviously is... a lot of commentators have expressed concern about the... whether the per se rule makes sense."
2005.04-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,935.435,936.88,Can I ask you--
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,936.88,938.224,--with the jurisprudence of two products.
2005.04-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,941.805,943.359,--Can I ask you how far your position extends?
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,962.668,965.266,If there's a monopoly in the tied product?
2005.04-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,965.266,966.147,In... in the tying product.
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,967.792,968.685,All we're asking for is--
2005.04-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,968.685,970.429,I know that's all you're asking for--
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,970.429,972.237,"--is the opportunity to demonstrate market power, and if--"
2005.04-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,972.237,978.323,"--but I'm just wondering if it isn't... if it isn't the logical conclusion of your position that it really doesn't matter, even if there is a monopoly in the tying product."
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,978.323,978.473,--No.
2005.04-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,986.184,988.853,"No, but I'm... I'm asking sort of an economic question rather than a legal question."
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,988.853,990.599,Whether even if there was a--
2005.04-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,990.599,997.651,"If your position is all the economists say this is a lot of nonsense, I think maybe it's a lot of nonsense even if there's a monopoly in the tying product is what I'm suggesting."
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,997.651,1000.178,"--I think there are some that hold that view, Your Honor, but there are some that don't."
2005.04-1329,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1010.696,1014.417,There was a... a point that you were in the process of answering.
2005.04-1329,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1034.207,1034.537,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1329,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1059.622,1060.635,"Thank you, Mr. Pincus."
2005.04-1329,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1062.5,1073.683,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1329,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1129.029,1136.6,"Mr. Hungar, is the issue of the presumption, as it applies to copyright, part of the question presented?"
2005.04-1329,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1139.208,1142.609,"Strictly speaking, it's not, Your Honor, because of course, this is a patent case."
2005.04-1329,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1142.609,1143.512,Right.
2005.04-1329,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1143.512,1152.028,"And the only case in which this Court has actually applied a presumption of economic power is the Loew's case, which was a copyright case."
2005.04-1329,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1212.16,1218.337,And market power... you mean price... ability to charge a price higher than otherwise would be the case?
2005.04-1329,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1218.337,1221.568,--As this Court defined market power--
2005.04-1329,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1221.568,1222.449,As you're defining it.
2005.04-1329,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1223.062,1223.723,"--Well, yes."
2005.04-1329,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1225.478,1225.801,Fine.
2005.04-1329,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1232.22,1233.735,"--No, Your Honor."
2005.04-1329,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1237.234,1240.354,"But then are you relying on that, the existence of valueless patents?"
2005.04-1329,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1240.354,1242.449,"--Well, that's... that's part but not all."
2005.04-1329,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1242.449,1244.948,"If you're going beyond that, which patents are you talking about?"
2005.04-1329,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1244.948,1249.914,"Patents can be valuable, but not confer meaningful, significant market power."
2005.04-1329,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1287.296,1287.627,"No, I see."
2005.04-1329,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1287.627,1296.542,"Mr. Hungar, one of the amicus briefs for the respondent was submitted by a professor, I think, named Barry Nalebuff--"
2005.04-1329,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1296.542,1297.385,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1329,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1297.385,1311.889,"--which took the view that the Court should, in any event, retain the presumption where a patent is being used to impose a variable or a requirements tie."
2005.04-1329,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1314.958,1315.681,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1329,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1332.239,1333.464,"Well, it wouldn't be a new one."
2005.04-1329,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1336.592,1339.693,"--Well, Your Honor, those... those cases don't state a presumption of market power."
2005.04-1329,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1342.08,1344.558,"No, but that's the example they're saying it would be following."
2005.04-1329,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1345.51,1359.131,"Well, it is a brand new idea in the sense that they would... they would ask the Court to adopt a presumption of market power, which the Court did not recognize in the IBM case or any of those cases because market power was not a part of the analysis in those cases."
2005.04-1329,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1375.23,1385.751,"But your... your answer to Justice O'Connor is there should be no distinction even if there is evidence that there's a long term relationship, a requirements relationship, and an increase in price."
2005.04-1329,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1385.751,1404.408,"--Well, an increase in price is a separate issue which might or might not, depending on the circumstances, be probative of market power in the... in the tied product market or, again, depending on the circumstances, it might be probative of market power in the tying market and certainly a plaintiff would be able to rely on such evidence if they could establish it."
2005.04-1329,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1453.564,1460.785,Does the Government have... I'd like to ask you the same question Justice Stevens asked Mr. Pincus about the broader question.
2005.04-1329,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1482.923,1483.776,--Well--
2005.04-1329,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1483.776,1489.153,"In other words, this is not part of a broader approach to get rid of the tying issue altogether, is it?"
2005.04-1329,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1489.153,1495.54,"--Certainly we have not asked the Court to... to do that, and that's not necessary to address in this case."
2005.04-1329,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1511.188,1513.754,And... and what is the Government's position on the latter question?
2005.04-1329,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1513.754,1529.192,"Well, Justice O'Connor made persuasive points in her concurring opinion in Jefferson Parish in which she explained why, in the view of those Justices, that the per se rule does not make a whole lot of economic sense."
2005.04-1329,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1612.422,1615.46,But isn't that also true even if there's monopoly power?
2005.04-1329,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1630.446,1637.668,"--Well, as Justice O'Connor explained in her Jefferson Parish concurrence, there's significant force to that argument."
2005.04-1329,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1639.854,1640.204,No.
2005.04-1329,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1648.266,1669.793,"--Well, I think, as I said, those are completely separate and... and really, I would say, unrelated points because what we're talking about here is not whether... whether market power is relevant, but rather, whether the plaintiff should be required to prove an element of its case, which is the normal rule that this Court and the lower courts apply in... in the whole array of contexts, including in antitrust cases in every other context."
2005.04-1329,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1669.793,1671.035,"We're talking about components, for example."
2005.04-1329,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1681.146,1682.169,"Thank you, Your Honor."

2005.04-1329,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1735.849,1739.911,"Well, this isn't a requirements tie case, is it?"
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1739.911,1741.303,"Yes, it is, Justice O'Connor."
2005.04-1329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1766.75,1767.373,But that--
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1767.373,1768.938,--operating it in perpetuity.
2005.04-1329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1768.938,1784.785,"--that, I would think, would be one of the strongest cases for not having a per se rule because if, in fact, you have a justification, in terms of sharing risk with a new product, that would be one of the cases where you would expect to find a tie."
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1857.563,1860.142,"Justice Breyer, this is not Jerrold Electronics."
2005.04-1329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1896.652,1897.495,All right.
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1899.199,1899.63,No.
2005.04-1329,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1938.316,1942.872,"But this in... as a practical matter, this screen is really the heavy lifting in the antitrust cases."
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1952.85,1958.777,"--With respect, Mr. Chief Justice, this does not entail a heavy burden on the defendant."
2005.04-1329,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2006.212,2011.477,"Well, except that the... the Chief... Chief Justice's question... and it... it's the same question as Justice Souter had and is what concerns me."
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2049.25,2059.159,"--Justice Kennedy, the patent presumption makes economic sense because, more likely than not, a patent used to effect a requirements tie will have market power."
2005.04-1329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2077.795,2079.04,"More often than not, it doesn't."
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2079.04,2087.935,"--95 percent of patents are valueless according to petitioners' own statistics, but they won't arise in a patent tying case because if they're valueless, they won't be licensed."
2005.04-1329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2090.734,2090.877,"Well, that isn't so."
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2115.058,2131.619,"Justice Breyer, Justice Souter asked before to petitioners' counsel, has there been any evidence of frivolous litigation, tying litigation, brought where there was a valueless patent to which a tie to a requirement was... was made, and petitioners' counsel could name none."
2005.04-1329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2139.672,2140.483,--Let me be more specific.
2005.04-1329,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2152.913,2156.965,"But if it's a success, we'll all be rich."

2005.04-1329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2162.851,2165.339,To tie something to the great machine.
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2165.339,2168.278,--To make up the money through a requirements tie in perpetuity.
2005.04-1329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2168.278,2168.899,"Correct, if it takes off."
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2168.899,2170.062,If it takes off.
2005.04-1329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2170.062,2173.984,"If it takes off, everybody will be rich, and if it doesn't take off, who cares."
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2174.575,2175.169,Justice Breyer--
2005.04-1329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2175.169,2175.83,--that could happen.
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2175.83,2176.25,--Justice--
2005.04-1329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2176.25,2177.674,"And there often does, I guess."
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2177.674,2180.973,"--Justice Breyer, that couldn't happen unless there was market power in the patented product."
2005.04-1329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2186.189,2188.626,I'll put this machine in your store for a penny.
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2189.95,2191.182,--Not the case here.
2005.04-1329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2191.182,2195.348,"By the way, a penny and you have to buy marvelous component."
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2201.795,2204.332,This returns us to Justice Stevens' question.
2005.04-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2250.642,2251.173,I have to interrupt to say--
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2251.173,2251.544,--the discount case.
2005.04-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2251.544,2254.322,--I think your opponent would say the district court made a finding to the contrary.
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2254.322,2258.604,"Justice Stevens, we believe the district court erred in holding that there was no--"
2005.04-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2258.604,2259.618,Okay.
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2259.618,2266.238,"--direct evidence of market power here, and we urge, as an alternative ground for affirmance, that there's ample direct evidence of market power here."
2005.04-1329,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2267.551,2271.262,"If your... if your arguments are right, isn't that going to typically be the case?"
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2273.409,2276.84,"Mr. Chief Justice, that is not typically going to be the case."
2005.04-1329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2324.542,2326.78,But the... the only issue is who has to prove that.
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2349.126,2360.811,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia, but it's... there... there... it would take a far better showing than the petitioners and the Government have made to overturn a sensible rule of thumb that makes sense as a matter of theory and makes sense of... as a matter of practice."
2005.04-1329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2377.67,2378.714,We don't know how many people paid... paid off the plaintiff.
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2398.474,2402.686,"Well, in this case that isn't so because the petitioner initiated the litigation."
2005.04-1329,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2497.408,2503.398,Are you conceding that the presumption makes no sense outside of the requirements metering context?
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2503.398,2510.499,"Mr. Chief Justice, there could be a sensible argument that you should always presume requirements ties to indicate market power."
2005.04-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2523.769,2527.047,I'm kind of curious what your answer is to the Chief Justice's question.
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2527.207,2546.687,"--Do we... we argue that the rule should continue to be, as it has always been, that when a patent is used to enforce a tie for a requirement... sorry... when a patent is used to enforce a tie, that's presumptive evidence of market power."
2005.04-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2546.687,2549.675,"No, but the question is does the presumption make any sense at all outside of the requirements context."
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2549.675,2553.848,We... it... it's not the law and we don't urge it in any other context.
2005.04-1329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2562.935,2567.409,"Let me try this again, and I'm thinking of a way of saying this more clearly."
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2655.151,2658.322,"Justice Breyer, you should affirm the court of appeals."
2005.04-1329,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2670.599,2672.334,But why can Congress--
2005.04-1329,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2672.334,2673.005,"Well, didn't they do that?"
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2676.186,2677.179,--They... they did not.
2005.04-1329,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2710.237,2711.902,But isn't it logically inconsistent for Congress--
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2711.902,2712.124,Not at--
2005.04-1329,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2712.124,2724.541,"--to say that a patent is insufficient evidence of market power in the misuse context and then just turn around and say, but if you're having a straight lawsuit under antitrust, it is sufficient as a presumption?"
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2724.541,2743.417,"--It's not inconsistent, Your Honor, at all because the patent misuse context lacks the other screens that are present here, the other screens that are present here from the other elements, and the affirmative defenses, like the business justification defense in Jerrold Electronics, like the business justification defense in Microsoft."
2005.04-1329,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2744.539,2751.392,"So it gets back to how important you think and how... whether it's true or not that the market power is the heavy lifting, as far as all these screens go."
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2751.392,2752.483,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-1329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2767.811,2778.603,"Well, I mean, once you start that, then you're saying that... which I thought was the... I would have agreed with the dissent... the concurrence in... in Jefferson Parish, but that's not the law."
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2783.506,2784.299,"--No, no, not--"
2005.04-1329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2784.299,2786.955,If you're going to give me... if you're going... well.
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2786.955,2800.545,"--Justice Breyer, with respect to your concerns about stopping innovation, there's no reason to think that the presumption of market power in a patent tying case has had the slightest adverse effect on the important new technological developments you've described."
2005.04-1329,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2823.356,2824.941,--May I just ask your point on that?
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2858.119,2864.498,"--Justice Ginsburg, the presumption here arises in a very special statutory context."
2005.04-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2901.289,2905.593,"As I remember the text of section 3, it applies to other products patented or unpatented."
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2905.593,2906.144,--It does.
2005.04-1329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2954.529,2969.295,"We're not even sure, are we, Ms. Sullivan, that... that you can extend, assuming that there is market power in the patent... we're not really sure that you can extend it through tying."
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2972.805,2988.24,"Justice Scalia, the... the economic theories that focus on the relevant pool, which is patents that have sufficiently high value to be used to enforce a tie, is unanimously on our side so that there's no procompetitive value, that there are anticompetitive effects."
2005.04-1329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2988.24,2991.491,There are no... I thought we were just talking about several.
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2991.491,2994.217,The... they're focusing on the wrong pool.
2005.04-1329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3012.433,3016.185,"Price discrimination, I gather, sometimes good, sometimes not."
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,3017.509,3017.939,--But the--
2005.04-1329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3017.939,3019.253,"--on the low side, it's good."
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,3022.242,3022.454,--It--
2005.04-1329,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3022.454,3025.783,"And so I think most economists... in fact, everyone I've ever read agrees with that."
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,3025.783,3035.884,"--Most... the majority view is that price discrimination does reflect market power, that you can't discriminate without it, and that's reflected in Judge Posner's recent decisions, for example."
2005.04-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3112.393,3117.538,"Of course, one of the interesting aspects of this kind of discrimination is the victim of the discrimination is the more powerful buyer in these cases."
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,3117.538,3134.28,"Well, we would argue that the presumption makes sense no matter whether the patentee is a big or a small company, and the reason is, to go back to Justice Scalia's question, that the... the patentee will always have better information about the market for the tying product."
2005.04-1329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3159.766,3170.357,You could probably say that in every... in... in every antitrust case where... where the defendant is... is alleging a... a monopoly on the part of the plaintiff.
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,3177.89,3181.762,"Justice Scalia, we argue simply that it's fair to shift the burden to the defendant."
2005.04-1329,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3187.168,3188.109,But isn't... it's in fact easier for you here.
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,3199.102,3200.638,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3311.682,3313.939,I suppose you can do that under modern computer technology.
2005.04-1329,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,3315.613,3316.777,"--Justice Stevens, that's correct."
