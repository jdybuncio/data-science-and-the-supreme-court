1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,386.918,401.134,"Mr. Justice White we got a ruling in the sense that at the conclusion of the motion and presentation open court, the state renewed its motion for that an entry being made of nolle prosequi with leave and that was granted."
1966.100,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,401.134,405.457,(Inaudible)
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,405.457,410.244,"No, Your Honor that they never, the court never attempt to go into the --"
1966.100,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,410.244,413.783,But you never had a rule position on that point.
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,413.783,421.387,"Well the motion act, the motion did not immediately request the ruling on the merits of that contention."
1966.100,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,453.747,464.073,What procedure do you have there to quash an indictment or information on the grounds that it can't go forward because it's constitutionally even?
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,466.8,471.635,"Your Honor, this question has engendered some discussion among the members of the bars."
1966.100,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,485.763,486.443,"So, you have no --"
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,486.443,498.44,And we do not have as my understanding a motion to dismiss and that the defendant on his own motion can move that the court consider his case when it is not in regular.
1966.100,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,498.44,504.039,"So, this motion that you did file can't be considered if the motion to dismiss, did it not?"
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,504.039,505.14,"No, Your Honor."
1966.100,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,517.168,519.066,Let's see if I understand that.
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,529.372,533.085,"Well, let me explain at this way Mr. Justice Brennan."
1966.100,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,550.16,550.852,But not on the --
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,550.852,556.083,But was not on the trial docket and we have been put off about that.
1966.100,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,586.52,591.699,Does the consequence to the motion or whatever it is now finds the proceeding here.
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,607.39,614.897,"Well, if I may I'll briefly explain that procedure in order that the Court can see the context in which we operate."
1966.100,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,674.905,677.011,What's your circuit name?
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,677.011,678.927,Nolle prosequi with leave.
1966.100,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,678.927,679.691,With leave?
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,679.691,700.424,"Now with leave means -- well, I'll put it this way, under a nolle prosequi entry in order for the solicitor to reinstitute the proceeding he would have to first apply to the trial judge and get his consent and a trial judge would issue an order directing the clerk of court to issue a case."
1966.100,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,746.962,750.063,And without any (Inaudible)?
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,750.063,751.761,Absolutely not.
1966.100,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,751.761,759.361,Is any question raise in interstate as to the appealability of the order of the trial court?
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,759.361,769.828,"Your Honor, there were some concern on the part of the petitioner that under our statutory appellate procedure that there might be a question raised."
1966.100,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,776.222,781.411,And I don't recall that any -- that question has been raised here.
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,781.411,783.441,"No, Your Honor, it is not raised from the brief here."
1966.100,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,830.314,840.535,"When a nolle prosequi with or without leave is entered, is it open to defendant at any stage to come in and move to dismiss the indictment for failure of prosecution?"
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,840.535,868.862,"Your Honor, in effect we may be dealing here as the question has been raised originally with the possibility of semantics actually is my understanding North Carolina procedure we have no procedure equivalent to a motion to dismiss initiating from the defendant it would be under the basis of a motion to quash a bill of indictment."
1966.100,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,868.862,871.623,"Well, is that available to leave?"
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,871.623,894.857,"Well, we would contend that is not available under the present legal status of this case because we have no way to get back on the docket and even we owned, I mean even there'd be a question whether this case is even pending in that court now for purposes of directing a motion to the superior court judge."
1966.100,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,894.857,903.387,"When you say motion to quash, wasn't available to you at any kind because it was never on the trial docket?"
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,903.387,908.766,"Well, I think -- if we could made a motion to quash at this point --"
1966.100,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,908.766,911.866,You could have made it to the motion to quash under this Hamm or nothing?
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,911.866,924.748,That's right but I think what we anticipate on the North Carolina procedure the reaction would have been while this case that is premature at this point until the Solicitor calls this case on the docket.
1966.100,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,924.748,934.309,If there's no way of getting rid of the case if it requires follow for a 10 years say under nolle prosequi motion there's no way of tearing the case on the docket?
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,934.309,946.061,"Well, Your Honor that's the way I read the -- the court was appearing on because the Supreme Court of North Carolina says that the defendant may not compel the state to give him his day in court --"
1966.100,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,946.061,946.275,(Voice Overlap)
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,946.275,949.37,-- even to the limited basis of a motion to quash.
1966.100,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,949.37,951.96,Did you try to make such a motion?
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,951.96,957.449,"Not on those words, Your Honor we in open court on the consideration of this motion."
1966.100,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1001.415,1006.735,"Failure that -- failure to prosecute, the prosecution doesn't want to go forward."
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1009.506,1016.816,There's no way that the defendant may on his own initiative raise that question as I understand North Carolina law.
1966.100,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1045.849,1048.903,What's the legal aspect of --
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1048.903,1050.072,"Mr. Justice Brennan, --"
1966.100,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1050.072,1052.703,-- the purpose of what that means?
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1052.703,1103.513,We would contend that the under the circumstances in which the state has proceeded particularly after we put the state on notice in our motion that we had not just a question of contesting their evidence but the affirmative defense based upon a federal statue in the decisions of this Court and in there being no show here at any point in the record as indeed it's not required under North Carolina to show those of why there's any reason for delay we contend that the action of the state here was so arbitrary and capricious as to justify this Court in finding that the right to speedy trial applies that it has been unpardonably violated here and that further prosecution is barred in this case because of the deprivation in the constitutional right.
1966.100,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1103.513,1108.544,You want a declaration that this prosecution is (Inaudible).
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1108.544,1111.667,That would be our first and major request.
1966.100,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1111.667,1114.346,"I noticed that, I beg your pardon."
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1146.913,1154.685,"No, as I recall our brief did not stress the First Amendment point that it is referred to in our brief in this Court."
1966.100,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1154.685,1155.38,"Well, it is?"
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1155.38,1168.167,"Yes, Your Honor, appearing up on page 18 in the last paragraph on that page."
1966.100,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1244.949,1248.127,It operates on this kind of an informal probationary --
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1248.127,1254.286,That's right and I think it has a legitimate (Voice Overlap) quite often has legitimate years and we do not --
1966.100,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1254.286,1255.697,(Voice Overlap) accepted that --
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1255.697,1257.874,We do not cite at this procedure per se.
1966.100,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1257.874,1259.808,(Voice Overlap) before any finding of guilt.
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1271.272,1278.413,"Well, let me say, I would concede it's appropriate only if the defendant in effect consents to it."
1966.100,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1286.631,1289.085,Oh usually he's very happy now.
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1289.085,1300.846,"In fact, on our proceeding in the Superior Court of Orange County, we have a little difficulty with the superior court judge and taking -- in trying to take me seriously that I was opposing a nolle prosequi with leave."
1966.100,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1300.846,1312.94,"Well, isn't that in fact I get the impression right there, tell me if it's wrong that in fact isn't it of the practical matter not of the equivalent of the dismissal of the indictment?"
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1312.94,1323.524,"Your Honor, I do not think so from -- I'll say under normal practice 99% of the time in ordinary criminal case is it is."
1966.100,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1323.524,1330.176,As Professor Klopfer engaged and then the civil rights demonstrations since this time?
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1330.176,1345.39,"Not in a sensible note, the very assertion as was used here and I might say Your Honor this case was hardly contested of whether or not there was any violation in North Carolina trespass law, it took approximately three days to come out."
1966.100,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1345.39,1352.702,(Inaudible)
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1352.702,1380.083,"Well, I think for this I think the objection that we contend for applied equally whether it's with or without leave because we contend that this procedure transgresses vital interest of a criminal defendant whether it's with or without leave if the state construes that it has giving the absolute and final and complete authority to for ever denying this day in --"
1966.100,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1380.083,1386.696,That's why it proceeded on motion although it takes so far as the concerning judge absolutely stated that (Inaudible).
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1386.696,1388.046,That's right and it's as far as
1966.100,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1388.046,1390.421,(Voice Overlap) doesn't it?
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1390.421,1408.1,"No, Your Honor, that's the crucial point in the case and the reason that that puts the weight and burden upon the defendant and that is that the statute to limitations which is only two years in a misdemeanor case does not ran during dependency of the nolle prosequi entry."
1966.100,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1408.471,1411.359,You mean a nolle prosequi without or with leave?
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1411.359,1412.133,Either one.
1966.100,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1412.133,1412.578,Either one?
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1412.578,1414.864,Either one told the statute of limitations.
1966.100,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1428.336,1444.335,When do you -- I would think you would be contending them that all nolle prosequi actions are unconstitutional in North Carolina and I just understood you say that nolle prosequi maybe a very useful beneficial (Voice Overlap) --
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1444.335,1457.476,I contend that all cases disposed of by the nolle prosequi procedure over the objection of the defendant (Voice Overlap) urge in trial does transgress the (Voice Overlap) --
1966.100,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1457.476,1460.694,Whether regardless that his debate is clear objection.
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1460.694,1462.003,That's right.
1966.100,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1523.262,1540.806,I noticed that while you answer the other (Inaudible)?
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1540.806,1568.166,"Well, in the sentence immediately before that Mr. Justice Brennan was first urged that under these circumstances the arbitrary and capricious action of the state justifies barring it as on the grounds of the very basic constitutional right but at the very least we're entitled to what we sold in our original motion and that is the opportunity to present our defense on its merits in the trial court."
1966.100,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1568.166,1578.56,Do you have to know how many fellow states there are that have if any that have statutes exactly like North Carolina?
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1578.56,1595.686,"Mr. Chief Justice, actually North Carolina's nolle prosequi procedure is not grounded on a statute as I understand that's a carryover from the procedural device under the same name of common law."
1966.100,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1622.937,1638.308,I take it for in some states where they do have the nolle prosequi that when it's nolle prosequi the action is terminated then if they want to proceed to further they have to re-indict it within the statute of limitations to that (Voice Overlap) --
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1638.308,1648.974,"That's my understanding that some states do not go with the position that North Carolina has of the nolle prosequi statute, I'm afraid to say it does told the statute."
1966.100,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1677.799,1682.007,Do you agree on the limitations from (Inaudible)?
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1682.007,1685.244,"Yes, Your Honor, this case of State versus Williams that's cited in the brief."
1966.100,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1685.244,1686.164,In your brief?
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1686.164,1689.259,"Yes, Your Honor State versus Williams."
1966.100,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1689.259,1694.116,When was this action instituted as against the petitioner?
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1694.116,1695.323,It does not appear in the record.
1966.100,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1702.031,1703.495,January 3rd of what year?
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1703.495,1704.801,1964.
1966.100,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1704.801,1705.552,1964.
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1705.552,1720.427,And then it went into Recorder's Court and the state did not want to try the case in Recorder's Court and went up in to the superior court and on motion of the state in normal procedure there is to seek an indictment.
1966.100,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1720.427,1725.506,What's the statute of limitations applied to this offense to this offense?

1966.100,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1728.812,1729.555,Two years?
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1729.555,1743.998,We have no statute on felonies so if these were felony charge the effect that it told the statute wouldn't make any difference but it would still involve the basic considerations --
1966.100,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1743.998,1751.596,So that except for this nolle prosequi statute would've run by now.
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1752.544,1760.456,"Well, except for the nolle prosequi we would have either have our hearing in court."
1966.100,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1760.456,1763.034,I would assume nothing in happen at all.
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1763.034,1765.884,"That's right, assume nothing had happen this would've ran."
1966.100,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1765.884,1766.408,Right.
1966.100,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1766.408,1774.656,"Well, the statute only (Voice Overlap) what has to be done within the statutory limitation period if the indictment or information has to be filed the charges to be made."
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1774.656,1775.169,That's right.
1966.100,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1775.169,1779.307,That's what the statute limitation is and a charge was made here within the two years.
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1779.307,1782.298,"Well, yes that was made within one month."
1966.100,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1782.298,1782.632,"So, --"
1966.100,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1782.632,1786.981,Do you think (Inaudible)?
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1786.981,1799.731,"Well, it was actually told by the issuance of the warrant on the day after the offense and then of course the warrant comes up to a point then he's bound over the bill of indictment fixed it up at that point."
1966.100,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1808.665,1808.892,Right.
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1808.892,1813.386,And yet come February we will look -- at three years actually --
1966.100,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1813.386,1832.677,"But in other words, if there have been nothing -- if this had never happened if there have been no nolle prosequi at all it would've been no statute of limitations problem there, you might've have a very good claim under your right to a speedy trial but certainly the statute limitations are satisfied when the charge was made and within the two years, wasn't it?"
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1832.677,1833.612,That's right.

1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1834.258,1866.902,Now that the point is now that it's told forever and that therefore there is as to this defendant this procedure as I read the opinion of State of North Carolina says that that there is no relief available to compel a trial that explicitly states we may not compel trial and yet it is not conclusive on the State of North Carolina and the reason it's not conclusive as a termination of this case is that it owes the statute of limitation.
1966.100,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1866.902,1879.069,(Inaudible)
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1879.069,1897.542,That's right Your Honor and even as I read North Carolina nolle prosequi procedure as long is there is a nolle prosequi for nolle prosequi with leave entry in a case brought within the original statute of limitations if they want to they can go back and get a new bill of indictment and proceed upon that.
1966.100,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1897.542,1902.771,But as long as the bill indictment that says -- state outstanding the statute does not ran.
1966.100,0,45824,wade_h_penny_jr,,1902.771,1904.506,That is correct.
1966.100,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1917.296,1920.732,Mr. Vanore.
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,1920.732,1924.615,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.100,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1989.983,1997.721,"Mr. Vanore, are you telling us that there is no such thing in your state as the power to dismiss the case?"
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,1997.721,1999.243,That is correct Mr. Justice Stewart.
1966.100,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1999.243,2000.449,There in no such thing as that?
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2000.449,2010.612,Once a bill of indictment is drawn and return as a true bill by the grand jury the only alternative that the Solicitor has is to nolle prosequi or nolle prosequi with leave.
1966.100,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2010.612,2014.59,"How about the trial judge, does he have power to dismiss an indictment without a trial?"
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2014.59,2019.533,"No, as far as the -- a motion to quash as you brought up before and asking Mr. Penny about that."
1966.100,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2028.07,2044.492,"Well, suppose the indictment as barred by some principle of laws and decisions in the North Carolina Supreme Court can't you make a motion that quash the indictment and at sometime or do you have to go through trial?"
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2044.492,2048.223,It is my understanding that you would have to go to a trial.
1966.100,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2048.223,2059.34,You mean that -- do you really mean that this defense based on (Inaudible) could not have been raised until after the -- all the evidence is in and there was an argument about at the end of the trial?
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2059.34,2075.005,"Well, the only alternative would have been for the Solicitor to bring the case to trial and then request the Court to remove the juror without cause and therefore if the state ever tried to prosecute the individual again, it would be a question of double jeopardy there."
1966.100,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2075.005,2080.987,"Well, some of – suppose after two years, that's the limitation as I understand?"
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2080.987,2082.926,"Yes, that is correct."
1966.100,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2082.926,2095.819,"As to Mr. Justice Stewart, do I understand you to say if there had been no move on that offense until January 4, 1966 one day after two years."
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2099.726,2101.645,That is correct You Honor.
1966.100,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2126.836,2128.704,"And no dismissal, is that right?"
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2128.704,2131.267,"Well, as you mentioned before Mr. Justice Stewart --"
1966.100,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2131.267,2132.067,This is the equivalent.
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2132.067,2134.127,This is the equivalent of a dismissal.
1966.100,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2134.127,2135.157,But it isn't the dismissal.
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2139.06,2142.115,"Theoretically, I must agree with you in 10 years from now."
1966.100,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2144.564,2152.17,And he probably have a very good defense in terms of forgetting on Hamm and (Inaudible) in terms of his right to a speedy trial but nonetheless he would have to --
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2152.17,2152.689,Excuse me.
1966.100,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2152.689,2155.062,"This is hanging over his head, isn't it?"
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2155.062,2166.143,"Well, when you say hanging over his head, the petitioner has said that this impedes his right to take trips to Europe and so forth."
1966.100,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2174.56,2177.667,"And apparently, the person can go hands without any bond or anything else."
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2177.667,2182.812,"Well, our court has so ruled in Coffey that the effect of nolle prosequi with leave is to --"
1966.100,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2182.812,2207.713,But here there have been discloses that the main implication with federal employment or I assume and after disclose that he was under indictment in North Carolina or I don't know what the situation is with respect to passport application whether they have to disclose this or not if there were an indictment for felony probably won.
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2207.713,2214.423,"Well, as far as the felony is concerned Mr. Justice Fortas there is no statue of limitations on the felony but actually --"
1966.100,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2214.423,2217.501,But you use this nolle prosequi procedure in felony cases too.
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2217.501,2220.771,"Yes, it is used in the felony case also."
1966.100,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2222.434,2225.544,"What do you mean you don't have felony, Mr. Vanore?"
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2225.544,2227.201,There is no statute of limitations.
1966.100,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2234.352,2239.912,"Yes, but how about a non-capital case supposed he's accused of grand larcenies?"
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2239.912,2243.104,That would be a felony in North Carolina and there would be no statute of limitation.
1966.100,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2243.104,2244.376,No statute of limitations.
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2244.376,2252.876,The only statute of limitation that is applicable is in the case of a misdemeanor.
1966.100,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2252.876,2253.567,Thank you.
1966.100,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2253.567,2262.039,But suppose 10 years from now the prosecuting attorney wanted to try this man.
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2270.213,2278.679,That is correct but of course Mr. Chief Justice the state contends that the defendant would certainly have a good defense.
1966.100,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2297.243,2302.296,When would that date arrived when he would have a good trial -- have a good defense?
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2302.296,2314.078,"Well, this would only arise when and if the prosecutor elected to prosecute the defendant for the case which with which he is charged."
1966.100,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2314.078,2320.284,"The question I asked you is about 10 years, how about eight years or seven or six or five?"
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2320.284,2322.722,Or 50 years as far as that's concerned --
1966.100,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2322.722,2336.202,"Yes, but how long would he have to wait before he could -- to get such a relief if the prosecutor decided that he wanted said was five years that he want or in five years he want to try him?"
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2336.202,2343.791,"As soon as prosecutor put the case on the trial docket, the defendant could come in and make a motion to dismiss on grounds that he was denied his constitutional right to speedy trial."
1966.100,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2343.791,2345.49,But you said there was no such thing.
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2349.325,2357.506,On this constitutional right here as far as it would be a motion on the merits because --
1966.100,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2357.506,2361.615,I understood you to say and you correct me I obviously and I misunderstood you.
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2377.366,2378.066,That is correct.
1966.100,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2397.197,2399.053,"So there would be what, a directive acquittal?"
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2399.053,2400.377,"A directive verdict yes, (Voice Overlap)."
1966.100,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2400.377,2401.023,A directive verdict for the --
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2401.023,2403.464,"Yes, the court would direct the verdict to the juror."
1966.100,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2403.464,2405.183,But after a trial?
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2405.183,2406.118,After a trial.
1966.100,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2420.884,2421.975,"Yes, by (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.100,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2421.975,2427.603,He could then affect a motion to withdraw a juror and that way -- is that way you work it?
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2427.603,2431.601,"No, I suggested that would be a way that this could have been done."
1966.100,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2433.627,2438.283,You have to wait until a jeopardy of taxes before you get rid of the case?
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2438.283,2446.89,"Well, that would be one way to do it withdraw a juror without reason and of course you can never be tried again because it would be double jeopardy."
1966.100,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2446.89,2453.635,Would that be done by a pretrial motion or must the jury be drawn before or he can make such a motion?
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2453.635,2455.657,The jury must make be drawn.
1966.100,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2455.657,2486.571,"Well, then if he didn't want to be tried because of the lifetime and he move for dismissal on the grounds of not getting a speedy trial and the judge said, alright, that's true then the only acquittal he would have would be because he didn't give a speedy trial, he wouldn't have an adjudication on the facts, would he?"
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2486.571,2504.24,"Well, it would start out as an adjudication on the facts if Your Honor pleases, that would be the only way this case could be finally terminated and that would be for the Solicitor to bring the case and put it on the trial docket for trial by a jury."
1966.100,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2548.971,2566.158,I want to (Inaudible)?
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2566.158,2571.173,He would have to answer that yes Mr. Justice Brennan.
1966.100,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2571.173,2577.157,Do you happened to know how many other states if then he have the same procedure you have?
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2577.157,2580.591,"Well, there are none that have exactly the same procedure."
1966.100,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2602.802,2604.513,"And the civil liberty's union, the brief (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2604.513,2604.883,Yes that is correct.
1966.100,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2604.883,2607.011,-- that 21 you say.
1966.100,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2607.011,2611.771,I'd like to ask you a question on whether I understood you're correctly or not.
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2628.749,2643.165,Well I'm not sure whether or not the state would accept it but I would certainly think in light of the decisions of North Carolina Supreme Court and the decisions of this Court that that would certainly be a good defense that he was denied his right to a speedy trial.
1966.100,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2643.165,2655.586,"Then all your -- all your contra verdict here is that as I gather it states right to keep some intending against him, state knows he shouldn't be convicted up."
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2655.586,2656.989,I think that is the crux of the matter.
1966.100,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2656.989,2660.801,But why does the state do this?
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2660.801,2663.632,I cannot give any reasons for why the state does that.
1966.100,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2665.403,2681.603,It does and what you are saying is that he is the man charged with an offense or which he has a good defense which would be recognized and he become lose but he has denied any right to raise it in states of North Carolina.
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2681.603,2683.955,He has denied the right due to the fact that the procedure --
1966.100,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2683.955,2688.964,"Well, whatever it is, he is denied the right to raise, that he does?"
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2688.964,2690.092,"That is correct, yes."
1966.100,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2690.092,2697.047,"He is under this, it's none of the constituting return for the rest of his life, is that right?"
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2697.047,2698.215,That is correct.
1966.100,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2699.324,2702.872,But why does the State of North Carolina not confess evidence?
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2702.872,2731.678,"I was just like to suggest one thing if Your Honor pleases as Mr. Penny mentioned to the Court, it would seem that where a nolle prosequi with leave is requested by the Solicitor and the is no objection by the defendant that certainly would be proper as in this case where the defendant has objected quite candidly perhaps this Court should allow some redress to that."
1966.100,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2736.074,2741.254,The Court revealed in time to put up a defense to a charge defending against him.
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2741.254,2743.248,That's correct.
1966.100,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2743.248,2749.612,"You don't take the position that we should decide this case on its peculiar facts, do you?"
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2749.612,2760.489,Well I think you should decide this on its peculiar facts in that the defendant objective strenuously to the entry of a nolle prosequi with leave by the Solicitor.
1966.100,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2781.445,2793.681,(Inaudible)
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2793.681,2810.665,"Well, where an objection is made and where the state does not set forth good reason such as he needs more time to get more evidence against the individual and they have good reason for requesting a continuation yes if --"
1966.100,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2810.665,2812.491,(Inaudible)
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2812.491,2813.284,That did not occur.
1966.100,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2830.818,2833.599,"On what ground, counsel?"
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2833.599,2835.674,On what ground do they quash the indictment?
1966.100,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2835.674,2840.896,On what ground do we take this action?
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2844.908,2853.724,"No, I would say this that under the peculiar procedure in North Carolina that it is unconstitutional not to allow --"
1966.100,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2853.724,2855.86,"Yes, but how?"
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2855.86,2859.147,"Well, it would have to come under the Sixth Amendment speedy trial, yes."
1966.100,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2859.147,2860.676,Was that ever been applied to the state (Voice Overlap)?
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2860.676,2861.923,No it has not.
1966.100,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2862.305,2864.139,Do you think that we do it in this case?
1966.100,1,17172,andrew_a_vanore_jr,,2864.139,2865.982,"No, I'm not suggesting that, that is the only --"
1966.100,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.982,2874.589,"Well, then what constitutional ground do you suggest the --direct the Supreme Court of North Carolina?"
