1990.89-1679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.918,"We'll hear argument now in No. 89-1679, Summit Health, Limited v. Pinhas."
1990.89-1679,0,33388,j_mark_waxman,,10.168,18.134,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1679,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,295.164,299.038,"Mr. Waxman, what, what do you do about our opinion in McLain?"
1990.89-1679,0,33388,j_mark_waxman,,321.638,324.919,"Well, I don't read McLain that way."
1990.89-1679,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,324.919,325.309,You don't?
1990.89-1679,0,33388,j_mark_waxman,,325.309,337.648,I think the way I read McLain is that the Court looked at a situation which involved a brokerage for four years in New Orleans and looked at an alleged conspiracy to fix commission rates which are part of the price.
1990.89-1679,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.525,530.024,Price fixing in general or price fixing in this particular case with respect to these particular real estate transactions?
1990.89-1679,0,33388,j_mark_waxman,,530.024,534.007,I'm not sure I understand the import of the question.
1990.89-1679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,645.401,651.226,"Mr. Waxman, I, I want to ask you a question about McLain, following up on Justice Scalia's question."
1990.89-1679,0,33388,j_mark_waxman,,693.6,698.567,"Well, I read that language in the context in which the case was brought."
1990.89-1679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,731.429,740.175,"Then you think the Court has a different thing in mind for a jurisdictional showing as a, as opposed to the, the showing you have to make on the merits?"
1990.89-1679,0,33388,j_mark_waxman,,740.175,748.455,"I believe that the Court... I believe that it's not required for jurisdictional purposes that you prove that the conspiracy would be, would have been successful."
1990.89-1679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,752.655,758.777,"But would you have to... in proving your case on the merits you wouldn't have had to show the conspiracy was successful, would you?"
1990.89-1679,0,33388,j_mark_waxman,,758.777,779.643,"In proving your case on the merits, I still believe that you would have to show that there was a substantial effect on interstate commerce which is exactly what the Court goes on to state that towards the end of the decision where it indicates that either side... for example, it says, that trial respondents will have the opportunity to make their own case contradicting this factual showing."
1990.89-1679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,813.818,816.005,Does that really make a lot of sense do you think?
1990.89-1679,0,33388,j_mark_waxman,,816.005,822.392,The same language applies to the jurisdictional finding as to the ultimate offense involved.
1990.89-1679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,858.832,859.801,May I ask... may I ask you a question?
1990.89-1679,0,33388,j_mark_waxman,,880.807,886.149,--I don't believe jurisdiction would exist under the Sherman Act if nothing ever happened.
1990.89-1679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,893.693,902.985,"So you really have to prove more to prove jurisdiction than you do to prove the crime, because it's kind of a horn-book law that the conspiracy itself is the heart the offense under--"
1990.89-1679,0,33388,j_mark_waxman,,902.985,905.422,The conspiracy would be the heart of offense.
1990.89-1679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,915.012,916.948,--Why do you... why do you have to take that view?
1990.89-1679,0,33388,j_mark_waxman,,929.131,933.099,Because I agree I don't have to take that view.
1990.89-1679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,946.264,946.748,But you--
1990.89-1679,0,33388,j_mark_waxman,,946.748,948.748,--as opposed to the successfulness of the offense.
1990.89-1679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,948.748,959.807,"--Your view is that there actually has to be an effect on interstate commerce, not, not what... it's just not that if it were successful there would have been an effect?"
1990.89-1679,0,33388,j_mark_waxman,,959.807,972.691,"No, I think my view... no, my view is not that you have to go to the success of the particular conspiracy that's alleged, but that its logical conclusion would have resulted in a restraint which substantially affects interstate commerce."
1990.89-1679,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,972.691,982.265,"Well, then what you're really arguing is not the thing must allege an effect, but that they must allege a tendency to affect, isn't that true?"
1990.89-1679,0,33388,j_mark_waxman,,982.265,988.591,"Well, I'm not, I'm not sure I would know the, the real difference between a tendency to affect--"
1990.89-1679,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,988.591,990.715,"Well, a tendency that may not be realized."
1990.89-1679,0,33388,j_mark_waxman,,990.715,1006.787,"--No, I think I would have to back up somewhat from what I said and indicate that what they actually would have to allege is that, is that there would be a logical connection between success, if you will, and a substantial effect on interstate commerce to create the Section 1 jurisdiction."
1990.89-1679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1287.706,1289.456,"Very well, Mr. Waxman."
1990.89-1679,1,35077,lawrence_silver,,1292.327,1300.825,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1616.508,1619.116,"Mr. Silver, what's the, what's the activity here?"
1990.89-1679,1,35077,lawrence_silver,,1619.116,1622.225,The affected activity?
1990.89-1679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1630.862,1631.737,General... in general?
1990.89-1679,1,35077,lawrence_silver,,1639.062,1639.421,There are.
1990.89-1679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1660.241,1663.896,"So it's, it's just hospital peer review proceedings that's, that's the relative activity?"
1990.89-1679,1,35077,lawrence_silver,,1663.896,1665.942,--That's hospital peer review proceedings.
1990.89-1679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1666.207,1672.455,In general or just the peer review proceedings... not just the peer review proceedings of this particular hospital.
1990.89-1679,1,35077,lawrence_silver,,1672.455,1682.621,"Peer review... hospital peer review... peer review proceedings provide in its entirety the, the affected activity that allows the door to be closed."
1990.89-1679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1682.621,1689.916,"By hospital peer review proceedings, you mean peer review proceedings in all hospitals throughout the United States?"
1990.89-1679,1,35077,lawrence_silver,,1689.916,1690.416,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1990.89-1679,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1690.416,1693.04,That's no geographic limit at all?
1990.89-1679,1,35077,lawrence_silver,,1693.04,1694.585,"No, Your Honor, none."
1990.89-1679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1721.527,1731.289,"Why isn't there... I mean once you depart from the particular context of the particular offense, I don't know where you define the area."
1990.89-1679,1,35077,lawrence_silver,,1744.55,1746.784,--Those are the relevant markets.
1990.89-1679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1746.784,1749.142,But that's not the relevant activity?
1990.89-1679,1,35077,lawrence_silver,,1749.142,1755.968,The relevant affected activity is bad peer review as distinguished from the market of the general business activity.
1990.89-1679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1790.204,1795.405,"And what's, what's the test for whether there is jurisdiction under the, under the Federal antitrust laws?"
1990.89-1679,1,35077,lawrence_silver,,1795.405,1797.295,"In, in my view under McLain?"
1990.89-1679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1797.295,1797.764,Yes.
1990.89-1679,1,35077,lawrence_silver,,1797.764,1806.104,You determine whether or not the defendant... one of the things is that the plaintiff's activities involve interstate commerce that are now... involve interstate commerce.
1990.89-1679,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2174.915,2176.679,"Very well, Mr. Silver."
1990.89-1679,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2178.71,2193.906,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1679,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2359.495,2364.883,"But it does say, Mr. Wallace, Respondent's brokerage activity, not brokerage activity in general."
1990.89-1679,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2364.883,2365.586,"Well, I--"
1990.89-1679,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2365.586,2366.57,It at least does insist.
1990.89-1679,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2371.459,2431.263,"--Respondent's brokerage activities and then there, there is a further question whether their effect on commerce should be looked upon in isolation or as one of a class of activities that Congress can regulate, but before that question arises I want to refer to language appearing later in the McLain opinion which some courts have used to inject ambiguity into the opinion and this appears at page 4... 246 of 444 U.S. and the sentence is at the very top of the page, to establish Federal jurisdiction in this case, there remains only the requirement that Respondent's activities which allegedly have been infected by a price fixing conspiracy must be shown as a matter of practical economics to have a not insubstantial effect on the interstate commerce involved."
1990.89-1679,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2632.355,2642.008,If there were an on going boycott by the employer because they didn't like this nurse and they black balled her at other hospitals.
1990.89-1679,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2644.804,2646.616,--She might be able to build--
1990.89-1679,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2646.616,2648.661,"Is that, is that where we're--"
1990.89-1679,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2648.661,2673.261,"--enough of an allegation to surmount a motion to dismiss, but it's, it's questionable whether even with the elements you have added, Mr. Justice, that that's still... would allege an injury to competition in any line of commerce, whether she could show that anyone other than herself is affected by it."
1990.89-1679,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2673.261,2680.82,"--Well, why, why again, Mr. Wallace, is the doctor case different from the nurse's for anti-trust purposes?"
1990.89-1679,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2680.82,2694.394,Because his complaint is that competition in the provision of ophthalmological services has been the very object of the peer review sanction that was applied against him.
1990.89-1679,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2710.495,2720.632,I take it a nurse might allege... make the same allegations that she assists faster at operations than the other nurses and she's been discriminated against for that reason.
1990.89-1679,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2720.632,2720.976,It could happen.
1990.89-1679,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2787.886,2808.518,"But there's almost no line of commerce that isn't, you know, within the reach of the Federal commerce... as I understand your argument, you're saying if the, if the activity in question is within the reach of the Federal Government with the commerce power and if there is a restriction of competition within that regardless of whether the actual restriction itself impedes commerce, then it's covered."
1990.89-1679,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2810.251,2836.882,"That is our position and that is the point made by the 22 states that have filed an amicus brief in this case, agreeing with our position and pointing out that at least one state doesn't have any state antitrust laws at all and pointing out deficiencies in other state anti-trust laws and that, as a matter of fact, there is great reliance on the Sherman Act as protection."
1990.89-1679,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2836.882,2842.614,"Let's, let's assume I believe that that was not the original intent and that it was thought that Valentine acts and other state acts were going to continue to apply."
1990.89-1679,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2860.373,2870.478,"Well, one hypothetical we have discussed is an agreement among teenage baby sitters to fix prices."
1990.89-1679,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2876.85,2880.396,You don't think Congress could pass a law regulating teenage baby sitters?
1990.89-1679,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2882.192,2884.221,--Perhaps not.
1990.89-1679,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2914.96,2925.814,"The act does say in restraint of... in restraint of commerce among the several states, not in restraint in a field of commerce that happens to be among the states."
1990.89-1679,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2925.814,2931.266,"We're not painting on a, a new slate here in interpreting that language."
1990.89-1679,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2942.027,2949.446,"But that, that could simply mean that what is meant by commerce is broadest meaning of commerce, but it still has to be in restraint of commerce."
1990.89-1679,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2959.551,2969.608,"With all respect, I do not believe that is a fair reading of those cases which said that the protection that Congress afforded reached to the utmost extent."
1990.89-1679,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2969.608,2971.483,"Well, that's usually dicta anyway in those cases."
1990.89-1679,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2971.483,2999.222,"It, it, it, it, it could be considered that, but it has been the basis for expanding the reach of the Sherman Act repeatedly as the court's notions of the reach of the Commerce Clause have similarly expanded because the, the act has been interpreted to afford the protections to whatever is the currently accepted notion of the reach of the commerce power."
1990.89-1679,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3067.399,3068.399,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1990.89-1679,3,33388,j_mark_waxman,,3070.133,3071.709,I do.
1990.89-1679,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3071.709,3074.176,You may proceed.
1990.89-1679,3,33388,j_mark_waxman,,3074.176,3089.311,I think that the principles that are involved here are distinguishing the Section 1 from other regulatory Commerce Clause type cases.
1990.89-1679,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3164.625,3169.563,"But I'm saying even if there aren't any limits on the, on the commerce power, there may be limits to the Sherman Act."
1990.89-1679,3,33388,j_mark_waxman,,3169.563,3172.03,I think one could read it either way.
1990.89-1679,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3224.257,3239.923,"Suppose, suppose hospitals... all the hospitals in a metropolitan area agreed to admit only no more than an x number of new doctors to their staff every year."
1990.89-1679,3,33388,j_mark_waxman,,3239.923,3247.982,--I would suppose that the physicians collectively involved in that case would allege this had a significant affect on the--
1990.89-1679,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3247.982,3263.523,"Just one sues... just one who applied and is rejected, sues, and says there's a conspiracy to limit the availability of medical services in town and I've been hurt by the conspiracy."
1990.89-1679,3,33388,j_mark_waxman,,3276.425,3288.654,"--I would assume that that one physician would allege that this conspiracy which affects more than one physician, namely any physician who might come from out of state and be on the medical staff of the hospitals collectively in that area."
1990.89-1679,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3288.654,3290.496,So that would be enough in this case?
1990.89-1679,3,33388,j_mark_waxman,,3290.496,3291.465,"If, if--"
1990.89-1679,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3291.465,3296.462,He wouldn't have to show that... he wouldn't have to show that just excluding him had any effect.
1990.89-1679,3,33388,j_mark_waxman,,3296.462,3302.492,--The allegation would be that using the example you gave is that more than this physician was affected.
1990.89-1679,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3317.205,3323.28,He wouldn't have to prove that excluding just him would have... would affect interstate commerce substantially?
1990.89-1679,3,33388,j_mark_waxman,,3323.28,3325.202,--I'm sorry.
1990.89-1679,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3325.202,3333.948,He wouldn't have to show and prove that excluding only him had a substantial effect on interstate commerce?
1990.89-1679,3,33388,j_mark_waxman,,3333.948,3339.477,He would not have to show given the example you gave that particular incident affecting him.
1990.89-1679,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3341.148,3342.773,You should answer my question yes or no.
1990.89-1679,3,33388,j_mark_waxman,,3342.773,3343.304,--No.
1990.89-1679,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3400.609,3421.35,What if they allege... let me just be sure I get your point... what if they allege that there was a conspiracy to require an assistant position in all cases and that conspiracy restrains trade because it imposes unnecessary costs on that line of commerce and then he alleges as a by-product of that agreement they won't let me have hospital privileges because I refuse to practice with an assistant.
1990.89-1679,3,33388,j_mark_waxman,,3422.991,3450.244,"I think that if one could allege and ultimately controvert make the showing that the conspiracy to impose the assistant surgeon requirement had a specific effect on a volume of interstate commerce such as it affected the total volume of surgeries at a significant level of those coming from out of state, a total volume of supplies that would be involved in surgeries which could no longer be performed, a total volume of individuals--"
1990.89-1679,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3450.244,3451.291,But your answer is yes?
1990.89-1679,3,33388,j_mark_waxman,,3452.962,3453.369,--Yes.
1990.89-1679,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3453.369,3453.884,Yeah.
1990.89-1679,3,33388,j_mark_waxman,,3454.337,3481.812,"Finally, the notion that the Court should expand the Sherman Act simply because concepts of commerce have expanded or that the Sherman Act is the... the Magna Carta is no substitute for the specific congressional intent which is evidence in the act itself which says restraints of trade of commerce among the states and the Court should not single mindedly decide as I indicated at the beginning to eliminate that phrase from the act."
1990.89-1679,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3482.389,3483.983,"Thank you, Mr. Waxman."
