1979.78-1455,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.762,We will hear arguments first this morning in United States against Gillock.
1979.78-1455,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,16.053,19.357,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1455,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,312.526,323.685,"General, how do you reconcile the application of that principle in this case with Tenney v. Brandhove?"
1979.78-1455,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,323.685,342.228,"Well, Tenney v. Brandhove was a case that recognized a common law immunity from prosecution--I beg your pardon, a common law immunity for civil liability for legislative acts."
1979.78-1455,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,388.219,428.11,"Well, isn't there some interest akin to that spoken of in Mr. Justice White's dissenting opinion in Brewster that if this man is offered a bribe by the electrician--some out of state syndicate to introduce legislative language favoring electricians, that he will thereafter simply shy away from that issue for fear that he will be prosecuted, even though he in good faith believes that such legislation should be introduced?"
1979.78-1455,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,428.11,430.629,"Yes, there is validity to that point."
1979.78-1455,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,438.841,440.826,And Brewster was a speech or debate clause--
1979.78-1455,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,440.826,446.822,"And Brewster was, as you point out, Mr. Justice White, a speech or debate clause case."
1979.78-1455,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,473.203,484.069,"Justice Frankfurter, in Tenney v. Brandhove, said that 1983 was informed by the common law understanding of legislative privilege."
1979.78-1455,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,484.069,487.482,Tenney v. Brandhove does make that suggestion.
1979.78-1455,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,520.203,526.402,"And as you pointed out, Mr. Solicitor General, Tenney v. Brandhove involved immunity from civil liability."
1979.78-1455,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,528.469,531.214,An evidentiary privilege in a criminal prosecution.
1979.78-1455,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,531.214,531.511,Right.
1979.78-1455,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,538.536,540.174,"No, there isn't, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1979.78-1455,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,556.308,563.64,"And we've--there are also remarks in certain cases, I should remember since I was responsible--"
1979.78-1455,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,563.64,565.859,O'Shea v. Littleton.
1979.78-1455,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,565.859,577.546,"--where we've indicated that the non-speech or debate clause executive privilege, or privilege for Federal employees, doesn't reach criminal liability."
1979.78-1455,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,577.546,579.029,That's indeed so.
1979.78-1455,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,670.889,685.871,"In the Brewster case, to which you have made some reference, it was not necessary for the government to prove any--or offer proof of any legislative act of Senator Brewster, was it?"
1979.78-1455,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,685.871,695.043,"Well, the Court--I believe in the Brewster case, the Court held that there could be no showing of legislative acts, but that the--"
1979.78-1455,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,695.043,696.239,"It wasn't necessary, was it?"
1979.78-1455,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,696.239,696.832,That's right.
1979.78-1455,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,708.884,715.025,There he was charged with taking money in consideration of a promise to do certain legislative acts--
1979.78-1455,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,715.025,718.472,"Which is not, of course, a legislative act."
1979.78-1455,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,718.472,731.366,"And I think the Court's opinion said that the criminal act was complete when he took the money, whether or not he ever performed any legislative acts because of that payment."
1979.78-1455,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,731.366,733.543,"That is my understanding, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.78-1455,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,832.627,858.07,"Nonetheless, here you do have a restriction on the legislator's ability to follow his normal instincts, or respond to his constituents in that you have another force, a fear of Federal prosecution, that may prevent him from perfectly honestly responding to the judgments of his constituents."
1979.78-1455,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,858.07,861.368,"That is so, and we recognize that."
1979.78-1455,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,883.82,891.505,"Well, why is it the business of the Federal Government to prevent the corruption of a state government?"
1979.78-1455,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,891.505,903.421,"Because the members, persons who function in state governments, are also citizens of the Federal Government, and are subject to its laws."
1979.78-1455,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,928.107,932.643,Is it not just a coincidence that this gentleman happens to be a state official?
1979.78-1455,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,944.231,947.235,That is correct -- the Hobbs act --
1979.78-1455,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,947.235,959.782,"Well, Tenney was charged under the citizen could have, as I recall it."
1979.78-1455,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,959.782,962.18,But Tenney was sued civil.
1979.78-1455,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1103.182,1108.981,"In any event, the conflict is on the testimonial privilege, which is the issue before us in this case."
1979.78-1455,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1110.257,1111.476,Not on immunity.
1979.78-1455,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1111.476,1115.05,All agree that there's no immunity to prosecution under these statutes.
1979.78-1455,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1115.05,1116.716,"Exactly, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1979.78-1455,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1116.716,1117.953,And that's conceded in this case--
1979.78-1455,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1117.953,1123.105,It's conceded in this case that there is no underlying immunity.
1979.78-1455,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1164.724,1171.895,"Very well, Mr. Solicitor General."
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1173.217,1175.988,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.78-1455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1224.956,1231.353,Do you agree that we're not talking here about immunity but about an evidentiary privilege?
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1231.353,1232.266,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1232.266,1233.069,You don't?
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1233.069,1234.513,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1237.75,1238.878,"Well, I didn't think you had."
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1238.878,1241.412,--is under this particular indictment.
1979.78-1455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1277.244,1281.343,Did you move to dismiss the indictment on the basis that you were immune from prosecution?
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1281.343,1282.459,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1282.459,1284.132,And how did you fare on that?
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1284.132,1285.748,The District Court denied that.
1979.78-1455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1285.748,1288.84,And was that appealed?
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1288.84,1289.971,"Not, by us, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1289.971,1290.861,Hm?
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1290.861,1290.997,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1290.997,1293.491,"Well, it certainly wouldn't have been appealed by the government."
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1293.491,1294.56,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1294.56,1297.679,"So it wasn't appealed, was it?"
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1297.953,1299.049,"No, Your Honor, it was not appealed."
1979.78-1455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1299.049,1301.596,"That's not an issue before us here, is it?"
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1312.077,1314.441,"Your Honor, immunity is an issue here."
1979.78-1455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1323.726,1330.484,"May give rise to an inability to convict, but hardly to any immunity from prosecution."
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1330.484,1331.063,"That's right, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1331.914,1332.83,"Well, which is right?"
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1336.432,1346.854,"Your Honor, we--it is our position that there is an underlying immunity, as the government uses that term."
1979.78-1455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1346.854,1348.776,Is that an issue before us here?
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1348.776,1349.424,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1349.424,1352.365,It wasn't mentioned by the Court of Appeals.
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1352.365,1353.273,It wasn't necessary--
1979.78-1455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1353.273,1358.577,"The district court held that you were not immune from prosecution, you just told me, and that was never appealed."
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1358.577,1359.398,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1359.398,1361.458,Then why is that an issue before us?
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1361.458,1365.818,"Because that is the result of a privilege in another case, not our case."
1979.78-1455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1365.818,1369.736,"Maybe the result is, an inability to convict."
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1374.828,1377.308,"No, I would say that's exactly right, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1377.308,1379.564,"Well, it was never tried, was it?"
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1379.564,1383.586,This comes on the government's motion to review the suppression order of the district court.
1979.78-1455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1383.586,1387.346,"Well, if you didn't bring the--as a respondent."
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1399.348,1401.25,"No, we have not, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1421.525,1431.236,"It isn't just a question for the judge and jury, that you could not have appealed the order denying your motion to dismiss the indictment; that's not an appealable order, is it?"
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1431.236,1438.315,"That was our view at the time, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1438.315,1453.273,"It may not be appealable, but that doesn't mean you couldn't have asserted it as a respondent in the Court of Appeals."
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1454.54,1455.14,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1455.14,1462.806,No.
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1462.806,1467.592,It is our position on immunity that that does not make a difference in this case.
1979.78-1455,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1480.336,1483.759,You don't draw any distinction between the criminal and the civil?
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1483.759,1485.29,"Yes, Your Honor, we do."
1979.78-1455,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1485.29,1489.268,"Well, the way you just said, criminal or civil, I thought--"
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1489.268,1494.776,"It is our position, it has a different application in a civil case than in a criminal case."
1979.78-1455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1522.678,1525.24,Exactly.
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1525.24,1534.623,"And that is what we are asking in this case, is that the principle be treated in the same manner as with respect to a Federal legislator."
1979.78-1455,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1534.623,1535.785,"Well, they're a little different."
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1542.275,1542.758,That's correct.
1979.78-1455,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1542.794,1544.137,It's in the speech or debate clause.
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1545.98,1555.975,"Your Honor, according to the opinions of this Court, we have a Federal constitutional provision that comes from the very source that we assert here today."
1979.78-1455,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1576.182,1578.864,Doesn't Tennessee have a speech or debate clause?
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1578.864,1580.025,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1582.484,1583.831,Virtually substantially identical.
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1583.831,1586.799,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1455,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1643.583,1648.413,"You're not suggesting it doesn't give protection against civil suits, are you?"
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1648.413,1649.042,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1649.042,1655.014,What about a civil suit for libel for a speech made on the floor of the House or Senate?
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1657.427,1660.493,"It certainly is, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1660.653,1663.613,Well--go ahead.
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1663.613,1672.534,"It is just our position that the criminal immunity, or criminal privilege, came first."
1979.78-1455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1680.065,1683.614,"Well, are you making a constitutional argument here?"
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1683.614,1685.707,We're making a constitutional argument--
1979.78-1455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1685.707,1693.744,That the United States Constitution forbids the Federal Government from prosecuting a state legislator for a state legislative act?
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1693.744,1703.45,We're making a constitutional argument in the sense that we look to other provisions of the constitution to supplement what we view to be a common law.
1979.78-1455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1703.915,1722.275,"I thought--perhaps I wholly misapprehended this case; I'm beginning to think perhaps I have--but I thought that you reliance, and the reliance of the Court of Appeals, was on common law evidentiary privileges; not on the constitution."
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1722.275,1726.183,"Your Honor, it is unnecessary to reach the constitution, because of--"
1979.78-1455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1726.183,1729.541,But now you tell my Brother White you're relying on the constitution.
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1732.649,1736.502,I believe that our brief does mention principles of federalism.
1979.78-1455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1736.502,1737.216,That's right.
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1737.216,1741.367,"And it mentions the republican form of government, and it mentions the Tenth Amendment."
1979.78-1455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1744.319,1759.005,"Well, do you say--is it your claim that if the Congress of the United States said specifically in a criminal statute, ""This statute will apply to state legislators for their legislative acts,"" would you say that you would be invalid under the Federal constitution?"
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1759.005,1761.408,"Your Honor, I would say that would be invalid."
1979.78-1455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1772.393,1774.164,"Well, that's a different question."
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1782.535,1783.401,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1783.401,1785.851,"Well, let's assume you're wrong on that."
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1800.763,1812.084,"Your Honor, before Congress takes away from the state this old and well-established right, we think that they ought to specifically say that that's what they're doing."
1979.78-1455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1813.864,1825.013,"You're making an argument--like in 1983, this Court has said that Congress didn't intend to invalidate, or not to recognize, or to set aside the common law immunities."
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1825.013,1825.242,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1825.242,1826.73,Under 1983.
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1829.747,1831.228,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1831.228,1842.138,"That Congress, just as a matter of legislative--just as a matter of statutory construction, we should construe the statute as not reaching legislative acts of state legislators?"
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1842.138,1844.022,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1844.022,1845.431,At least that's one of your arguments?
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1845.431,1847.448,That's correct.
1979.78-1455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1847.448,1872.144,"But it's also your position, as I understood your answers to Mr. Justice White, that Congress constitutionally could not specifically say that these criminal statutes are available to be used to prosecute state legislators, and that if, in any such prosecution, the legislators were to have no evidentiary privilege for legislative acts."
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1873.987,1878.194,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1878.539,1882.001,And just which section of the constitution does it violate?
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1882.001,1888.585,"It would be the guarantee of a republican form of government, and the Tenth Amendment."
1979.78-1455,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1888.585,1889.605,Fifth Amendment?
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1889.605,1891.737,"Tenth, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1891.737,1901.014,"You're saying that the speech or debate clause is an essential part, indispensable part, of republican government in each state; is that it?"
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1901.014,1903.671,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1933.077,1949.401,"What's your answer to the holding of the Court way back in the early part of the century that the Republican form of government guarantee is a political question, and can't be considered by this Court?"
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1949.401,1952.179,"Two answers, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1979.78-1455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1981.297,1990.195,"Do you think Baker v. Carr, then, undercut Pacific Tel & Tel v. Oregon, the early case?"
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,1990.195,1997.424,"To some extent, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2123.511,2157.283,"Well, hasn't the Court indicated that a member of Congress, if he's acting outside the reach of the speech or debate clause, if what he's doing isn't a legislative act, because a claim that--but he claims in defense the Federal common law legislative privilege of a Federal official, that that privilege, that common law privilege, doesn't reach--doesn't immunize him from criminal liability?"
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,2157.283,2158.462,"It does indeed, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2158.462,2161.175,"Well, we've--but we've held that it hasn't."
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,2161.175,2163.216,You have held that it does not preclude prosecution.
1979.78-1455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2186.554,2202.572,"Well, but you've--in order to really--you really would want to elevate a common law privilege or immunity to constitutional status then."
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,2206.627,2207.693,"Yes, I would, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2216.535,2227.588,"Well, this Court has certainly taken the Federal speech and debate clause far beyond its literal terms, hasn't it?"
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,2227.588,2230.718,"Your Honor, I'm not sure I can agree with that."
1979.78-1455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2462.498,2465.55,"Are you arguing immunity now, again?"
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,2465.55,2480.577,"No, Your Honor; I am saying that official immunity does not apply--is not a principle that this Court should consider."
1979.78-1455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2515.788,2526.938,"In that connection, can you give us any instances of historical abuse of this kind of thing?"
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,2526.938,2531.341,"Your Honor, I cannot point to any abuse."
1979.78-1455,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2542.784,2549.088,"When you say that, are you overlooking the conflict in this issue in the Courts of Appeals?"
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,2549.088,2550.661,"No, Your Honor, I was getting to that."
1979.78-1455,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2605.669,2620.288,"Of course, there are lots of common law evidentiary rules that not only were not adopted in the constitution, but are not part of the Federal Rules of Evidence, such as the inability of a defendant in a criminal case to testify at all."
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,2629.771,2632.772,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2632.772,2652.279,"Are there any statistics, or if not statistics, figures in the briefs of either party indicating how often, and how recently, state legislatures have been prosecuted under Federal statute?"
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,2652.279,2654.907,"We have no such statistics, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2667.93,2672.417,So Congress didn't really authorize it until that time?
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,2672.417,2691.022,"Not to my knowledge, Your Honor, unless a wire fraud or mail fraud prosecution under the Isaacs theory could have been brought years ago; to my knowledge, none such were brought."
1979.78-1455,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2691.022,2705.493,"I understand your argument to be that before our constitution was adopted, the common law was that all legislators, Federal, state and local, were covered; is that right?"
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,2705.493,2706.702,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2706.702,2713.587,"And then Congress adopted the speech and debate clause, which was limited to Congress."
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,2715.712,2719.588,"Your Honor, it would appear to be limited to Congress, because it's in the section defining the--"
1979.78-1455,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2719.588,2723.899,"Because it says Congress, right?"
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,2723.899,2724.865,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2724.865,2730.658,"Well, can you tell me why they did that, why they didn't make it broader?"
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,2730.658,2733.681,"No, Your Honor, I cannot tell you why they did not make it broader."
1979.78-1455,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2733.681,2737.385,So I'm still in trouble.
1979.78-1455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2737.385,2750.816,"Of course, Congress didn't adopt--the constitution doesn't contain any speech or debate privilege for state legislators in connection with 1983, and yet one was found in Tenney V. Brandhove."
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,2750.816,2752.174,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1455,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2761.699,2768.196,"Well, now can you give me the reason why it was left out?"
1979.78-1455,1,30049,james_v_doramus,,2768.196,2778.14,"Your Honor, the best answer I have for that is that the constitution did not purport to set up the scheme of government within individual states."
1979.78-1455,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2853.193,2856.662,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Solicitor General?"
1979.78-1455,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2856.662,2859.221,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1455,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2940.292,2940.987,"Thank you, gentlemen."
