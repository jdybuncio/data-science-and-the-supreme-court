1962.63,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,40.87,"Number 63, Barbara D. Ford, Petitioner, versus Herman A. Ford."
1962.63,0,28826,joseph_aronstein,,73.825,73.946,That's right.
1962.63,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,73.946,81.214,-- represent this man and I just want to express the appreciation of the Court to you for undertaking this public service.
1962.63,1,28633,irving_malchman,,103.146,106.896,"I consider it a privilege that the Court has appointed me, Your Honor."
1962.63,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,111.917,116.037,"Now, Mr. Marion, you may proceed with your case."
1962.63,2,45523,w_francis_marion,,116.037,117.489,May it please the Court.
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,2161.132,2166.735,"Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, and members of the Court."
1962.63,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2357.999,2360.509,What did that Court hold?
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,2360.509,2366.056,The Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court gave custody to the mother.
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2669.598,2670.628,What -- pardon me --
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,2670.628,2671.712,"Excuse me, Chief Justice."
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2671.712,2682.326,What is the significance of the fact that the attorney for the defendant who brought the case to trial on this motion.
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,2682.326,2709.381,"I think that it has significance in this light that they have charged us with the proceeding and the respondent and that based on the order of Mr. Justice Frankfurter, stating the enforcement of the South Carolina order and they had the right to make a motion to bring it onto trial."
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2739.497,2762.759,"Did you proceed in the North Carolina case on the theory that the Virginia decree dismissing that original case, controlled the situation so far as the children are concerned or did you -- did you have a hearing on what is the best interest of the children?"
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,2762.759,2764.501,"They were both, Your Honor."
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2767.13,2783.101,Did you set up -- did you set up the decree of Virginia as being determinative of the custody of the children or did you pursue -- proceed on the theory that North Carolina had jurisdiction over the children.
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,2783.101,2791.051,"If Your Honor please, it was proceeded on the basis originally that North Carolina had jurisdiction of the children and of the parties."
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2791.051,2791.941,Yes.
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,2791.941,2794.999,And the case went on to trial.
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2850.623,2862.16,"But it's your position then that if there were a change of circumstances, that the court in South Carolina even if it would have jurisdiction over the children?"
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,2862.16,2864.155,"Yes, sir."
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2886.148,2892.764,But was it conceded in the South Carolina case that there was no change of circumstances?
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,2892.764,2894.304,"Yes, sir."
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2900.459,2910.91,I ask you if it was conceded that in that proceeding that there had been no change of circumstances since the Virginia decree.
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,2910.91,2915.082,"According to my interpretation, I answer that, yes sir."
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2915.082,2917.769,"If there were, where will I find that from the record?"
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,2917.769,2929.682,I would go back to the original statement made by the judge of the -- made by the judge of the Juvenile Domestic Relations Court.
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2982.867,2987.319,"Well, it does not say that -- does that say that the conditions are the same?"
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,2987.319,2987.834,"Yes, sir."
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2994.04,3001.945,"Well, it might not have been necessary to prove the father is unfit to have a change in the custody of the children."
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3001.945,3008.16,"I think under the circumstances of this case, they are -- the facts of this case -- pleadings, there would have been sir."
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3008.16,3022.679,How does -- how would the -- how would the judge of the lower court in north -- in South Carolina know that there were no change of conditions because there was no -- no evidence of any kind in the Virginia Court.
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3035.722,3039.967,"Now, your question is how would the judge in the South Carolina Court --"
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3039.967,3040.199,Exactly.
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3040.199,3042.264,-- have known whether there were any change?
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3042.264,3043.729,Since the Virginia decree.
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3043.729,3071.51,"I think that there would be no way that he could know unless the parties -- the petitioner here offered proof of change of circumstances, unless he made some allegation of it and offered proof of the pleadings that make the issues in the case of course, and unless the petitioner offered some proof of a change of circumstances, then of course the judge could not know."
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3110.404,3111.065,Well --
1962.63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3111.065,3118.375,"(Voice Overlap) finding of the court -- South Carolina Supreme Court, is that the one -- 206, is that the one you're referring to?"
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3118.375,3119.671,"Yes, sir."
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3173.983,3208.023,"Well, I notice in the -- on page 6 of the transcript at paragraph 4 of the amended complaint, I think if that's a complaint of a -- of the petitioner in this case, he says that this plaintiff was informed and believes that for the benefit of the minor children of the parties that she is the proper person to have the control of custody of said children, 5, that the plaintiff is informed and believed that the defendant has been miss -- the guilty of misconduct and there's an unfit person to have custody of the minor children of the parties."
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3217.093,3237.927,"I think that is not an allegation of change of circumstance and that would be the very reason I would point to the statement that I did a few moments ago of the judge of the trial court, that is the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court who said to me in the trial they have not attacked the respondent's fitness."
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3238.153,3241.779,"He said he wouldn't go to hear anymore witnesses, didn't he?"
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3241.779,3244.385,"He said at the end of -- yes, sir."
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3262.324,3289.27,"But apparently, wasn't that the end of the case, you say here -- or it says in the record on page 33 that the judge of the Court stated on the record during presentation of plaintiff's case, â€œBefore going on to the next witness, both parties are good people, good family, good parents, I am going to exclude any further testimony as to their faithfulness as parents."
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3291.612,3293.774,"Yes, sir."
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3294.281,3299.833,"So, how do you know what they would have presented if they had an opportunity?"
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3299.833,3300.447,I beg your pardon.
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3300.447,3305.211,How do you know what the plaintiff might have shown if she had had an opportunity.
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3308.687,3317.667,"That was because they offered no evidence with respect to the plaintiffs or with respect to the defendant there, respondent here, as testimony."
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3317.781,3320.667,But they said -- my point is simply this.
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3340.385,3346.292,"The answer to that, Mr. Chief Justice, is that though they alleged it, they did not account to prove it."
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3346.292,3349.862,How can they prove it if he won't let them prove it by presenting witnesses?
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3349.862,3350.745,Oh but he did.
1962.63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3415.044,3419.293,Didn't this judge awarded custody to the mother?
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3419.293,3420.095,"Yes, sir."
1962.63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3420.095,3423.98,"Well then, he certainly didn't suffer by any act of proof."
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3423.98,3426.949,"No sir, not in that -- not in that judge's order."
1962.63,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3427.696,3441.9,"Well didn't they -- well didn't they in this Court the petitioner and the respondent both agreed that throughout, and including all the proceedings up to the North Carolina, there were no changes in circumstances from Virginia."
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3444.785,3448.052,That is not a point in issue here.
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3448.052,3452.607,"Back to the first question I asked you, you didn't respond in that way."
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3452.607,3453.045,I ask --
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3453.045,3453.616,Alright.
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3454.903,3456.106,"I beg your pardon, sir."
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3456.106,3459.414,-- part of the course purpose is all -- I took a lot of your time.
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3459.414,3460.282,"Well, as I understood --"
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3460.282,3460.486,If you answer it that way --
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3460.486,3461.134,"-- the question, it was --"
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3461.134,3462.711,-- I would have been through.
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3462.711,3465.102,It was the extent to which they had conceded.
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3465.102,3465.762,Yes.
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3465.762,3494.403,"Well, I understood you too inquire if they had made a concession into the record, I think that there is no issue, no controversy about it, but if you had then asked me where would you find that in the record and I think you did, I cannot point to a place in the record where counsel for petitioner says expressly, we make no question of change of circumstances other than in the trial of the North Carolina case."
1962.63,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3511.306,3515.996,You mean the change of circumstances with regards to the defendant and the plaintiff.
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3515.996,3522.717,"Or as to the minor children, any change of circumstances with respect to this course."
1962.63,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3858.448,3861.178,"May I ask you this, sir."
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3900.276,3925.259,"We contend that if they wish that anytime under the South Carolina Supreme Court's decision to bring a new action contending a change of circumstances, they could do so and the South Carolina Court or the court that would have jurisdiction of the parties under the rule that is prevalent or the same in Virginia and in South Carolina, and in North Carolina, they could bring that action."
1962.63,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3930.327,3938.341,"What I was getting at was -- meeting a practical situation, how long have these parents -- children with this mother?"
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3938.341,3946.295,The children have been with their mother since first Christmas of 1959.
1962.63,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3968.493,3970.013,He now lives in Greenville?
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,3970.013,3970.397,No sir.
1962.63,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3978.079,3991.017,"Well, the thing has always bothered me about this full faith and credit with reference to my mind is that -- take a situation where the child has been -- litigation goes on for two to three years."
1962.63,3,46554,wesley_m_walker,,4011.718,4014.368,"My time is up, thank you, sir."
1962.63,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4014.368,4015.764,We'll recess now.
