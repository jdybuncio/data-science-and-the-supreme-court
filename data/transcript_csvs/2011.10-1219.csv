2011.10-1219,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.052,"We will hear argument next in Case 10-1219, Kappos v. Hyatt."
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,5.987,9.356,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,75.129,78.397,Can you only get a 145 proceeding when you have new evidence?
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,78.397,80.516,No.
2011.10-1219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,80.516,84.035,Suppose I have no new evidence and -- and I want to challenge.
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,85.737,87.32,"Yes, section 145--"
2011.10-1219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,87.32,87.939,Right.
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,87.939,90.489,--permits any applicant dissatisfied with the decision of the PTO--
2011.10-1219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,90.489,94.359,And on what basis does the court decide the case?
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,94.943,105.199,"--No, the Federal Circuit has held that in those cases substantial evidence review applies, and where the Federal Circuit gets that is this Court's case in Morgan v. Daniels."
2011.10-1219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,123.612,124.095,Yes.
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,124.095,125.112,So it's quite clear that when--
2011.10-1219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,125.112,127.695,How close a predecessor is the predecessor?
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,127.695,131.016,--All of the material language is the same.
2011.10-1219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,134.051,148.625,"But the Morgan case involved -- it wasn't a contest between the PTO and the would-be patent holder; it was an interference proceeding, wasn't it?"
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,148.625,158.081,"That is correct, Justice Ginsburg, it was an interference proceeding, and that's because at the time section 145's predecessor applied equally to interferences and to ex parte patent denials."
2011.10-1219,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,166.837,182.612,"I thought that -- it's interesting that the language of Morgan and one of its companion cases, not companion in the sense of being heard at the same time, but on the same issue -- the Radio City case -- both of them don't talk in the language of today."
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,267.885,276.974,"--Well, I think here we are suggesting that in -- in 145 actions when there is new evidence the Morgan ""thorough conviction"" standard should apply."
2011.10-1219,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,309.909,313.128,Let me tell you what my problem is with this case.
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,405.054,408.006,"--Certainly, Justice Sotomayor."
2011.10-1219,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,438.525,444.512,"Could you tell me what -- other than it's in the form of an affidavit, tell me what in the content was new evidence?"
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,453.718,455.018,--Certainly.
2011.10-1219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,566.89,570.276,"Your case is stronger if it isn't new facts, right?"
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,571.711,572.761,--I'm sorry?
2011.10-1219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,572.761,577.782,"Your case is stronger if in fact it is only new argument, and not new fact."
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,577.782,579.182,Certainly.
2011.10-1219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,594.791,656.282,"Ms. Anders, one of the problems with, I think, your position, is it sounds very strange to have two proceedings, one where you go directly to the Federal Circuit under 101 -- 141; and then this other one where you go to the district court, where if that's not as that, as Judge Newman said, a whole new -- whole new game, then -- and why would Congress create two judicial review routes, one in district court, reviewable in the Federal Circuit, the other directly in the Federal Circuit, if there's no difference, that is, if in both of them it is not de novo review, it is review of what the agency did under the ordinary standard for reviewing agency action?"
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,662.836,670.524,"Well, in the 145 proceeding the applicant has the ability to introduce new evidence that couldn't be presented to the PTO."
2011.10-1219,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,671.191,672.809,"What kind of evidence is that, Ms. Anders?"
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,672.809,678.13,"--Well, I think there's two primary categories, both of which can be very important in the examination proceedings."
2011.10-1219,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,685.617,698.175,"So in the 145, an applicant can take all of his written affidavits and say: I want to present oral testimony, on these exact matters, but live?"
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,698.175,701.746,"--He could certainly bring that to the district court, yes."
2011.10-1219,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,723.259,731.432,"But to the extent the substance of that testimony was something that he could have brought to the PTO, that testimony, in your view, would be out of bounds."
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,731.432,734.984,There would have to be a reasonable justification for not having presented--
2011.10-1219,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,734.984,737.002,"There has to be a reasonable, some kind of justification."
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,799.759,807.33,--The standard we are proposing is that the district court has discretion to determine whether there was reasonable cause not to present the evidence to the PTO.
2011.10-1219,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,807.33,810.532,"And if it says there isn't, then it can't hear it?"
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,820.49,825.394,"Well, I think it's no different from exhaustion or forfeiture rules in any other context."
2011.10-1219,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,825.394,825.994,"Now, except you have a history here."
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,825.994,826.594,The board applicant has the--
2011.10-1219,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,826.594,832.798,You have the history of the pre-APA section 145 where they apparently did take the evidence in.
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,832.798,837.368,"--Well, certainly in the early cases they took new evidence in."
2011.10-1219,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,854.893,863.499,"But then you really do go back to Justice Ginsburg's question because your understanding of what they wouldn't have a reasonable opportunity to present, I mean, it's very, very narrow."
2011.10-1219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,881.445,889.8,"And you were beginning to answer that by saying, well, you can't have oral testimony before the PTO."
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,901.741,908.38,"--Well, the other primary category of evidence that could come in would be evidence that has a temporal component."
2011.10-1219,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,931.209,936.197,"But I thought that your brief suggested that even with respect to that kind of evidence, a person can go back to the PTO."
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,936.88,943.351,"--For the most part, the record closes once the -- once the applicant files his brief on appeal to the board."
2011.10-1219,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,972.303,977.107,What if the new evidence is in reaction to the PTO's ruling.
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1006.544,1015.649,"--Well, in the first instance, the PTO's procedures actually provide, they actually provide for this situation, and that's when the board or the examiner enters a new ground of rejection."
2011.10-1219,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1020.886,1021.636,So this is an exception?
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1024.338,1024.871,--Right.
2011.10-1219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1086.412,1088.279,"What evidence -- oh, please, continue."
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1088.279,1105.79,"--Simply that there are -- for some number of other applicants, it was important to provide a safety valve because the PTO couldn't consider oral testimony and because certainly at the time oral testimony was a major concern in interference proceedings, where you would often have two inventors saying: I invented it first."
2011.10-1219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1113.229,1118.198,But you said that you could go into court on 145 even if you had no new evidence.
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1118.198,1121.419,"Yes, and Morgan, in fact, was a case like that."
2011.10-1219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1123.002,1132.025,"Well, did you -- In that case, would there be any difference between 141 and 145 other than you go to a different court?"
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1132.025,1137.361,"No, I don't think there would be for an applicant who had no new evidence at that time."
2011.10-1219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1157.342,1162.996,"Well, that was Judge Newman's view, but the en banc court took the middle position."
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1218.213,1232.39,"--Well, I think you are correct, Justice Kennedy, that -- that the en banc court believed that administrative deference principles didn't weigh against its conclusions because the district court could give more weight to the new evidence:"
2011.10-1219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1269.996,1275.281,"Well, then you are saying that we should choose either between your position or Judge Newman's position."
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1275.281,1283.287,"--Well, Judge Newman's position I think is inconsistent with Morgan, because Morgan was a section -- Revised Statute 4915 action."
2011.10-1219,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1300.999,1304.951,But I'm not sure--
2011.10-1219,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1304.951,1309.986,Morgan has very little to say about what types of evidence ought to be admitted in this proceeding.
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1330.249,1351.496,"Well, I think Morgan did not directly address the -- the admissibility of new evidence, but by saying that the PTO is the primary decisionmaker, and that the Court should not lightly set aside what the PTO does, it invoked administrative deference principles, which in turn show why all of the reasonably available evidence needs to be presented to the agency."
2011.10-1219,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1382.534,1396.544,"--But I don't know that that -- I think you're confusing the nature of the review, which is de novo, new, with the burdens that attach to the proof."
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1448.243,1459.884,"--Well, I think that the presumption of validity and the need to give deference to the PTO's determinations are essentially two ways of -- of saying the same thing."
2011.10-1219,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1476.496,1478.163,I have two problems with your argument.
2011.10-1219,0,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1549.842,1561.667,"--I think the record does support our argument, Justice Sotomayor, because what you see in the early twentieth century after Morgan had construed this as administrative review -- you referred to the 1927 hearing."
2011.10-1219,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1618.188,1618.505,"--Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1626.609,1629.244,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1675.042,1683.214,The problem I have with your submission: you say there are basically two routes to get review of the denial by the Patent Office.
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1691.653,1692.336,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-1219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1692.336,1693.336,--on which you lost.
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1720.97,1736.479,"Well, Your Honor, to be clear about what is permitted under section 145, it is correct that new evidence can be permitted to go to issues that have been properly ruled on by the PTO in the course of ruling on the ex parte application."
2011.10-1219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1765.166,1772.236,"So that in -- in every case where it's anything other than a purely legal issue, you would go under 145?"
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1772.236,1778.841,"--Well, Your Honor, if you had evidence that you wanted to present, and the remedies at the PTO were inadequate for one reason or another."
2011.10-1219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1795.768,1796.72,"Yes, I know."
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1804.407,1814.598,"--Well, I think that the number of cases involving rejections that are taken up into court are somewhat limited, in part because applicants often have an adequate remedy before the PTO."
2011.10-1219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1852.64,1861.21,"Well, Ms. -- Ms. Anders told us that there's a procedure before the PTO that lets you deal with these -- these sort of something came up that you didn't think about, and you can address that."
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1861.21,1868.399,"--Your Honor, what -- what Ms. Anders was referring to, I believe, is the possibility to reopen where there are new grounds for a rejection."
2011.10-1219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1915.714,1919.249,Do you think -- in terms of here is a question on the standard of review.
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1982.858,1983.574,Right.
2011.10-1219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2000.236,2005.205,That begs the question in a sense because they are interlinked.
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2012.628,2013.211,"Well, I think that--"
2011.10-1219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2013.211,2020.114,"It is an old trial with some new evidence, and there will be a thousand different variations on that theme."
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2020.114,2046.932,"--I think that goes to Justice Sotomayor's point really, which is there is a trial de novo and clearly at a minimum what the courts are talking about when they refer to this, not five times, not ten times but dozens of times this Court several times, lower courts pervasively when they are talking about a de novo proceeding they are talking about the fact that the applicant can introduce new evidence to attempt to overcome the adverse action that was entered by the--"
2011.10-1219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2046.932,2048.498,"All right, so the new part -- I get that."
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2048.498,2048.884,--Okay.
2011.10-1219,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2116.778,2124.698,"If the judge does that, how does he articulate the weight that he gives to it, the PTO finds?"
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2139.024,2139.792,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-1219,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2139.792,2146.88,"And in that connection, on this same line, do you agree with that summary?"
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2146.88,2149.082,"I do, Your Honor."
2011.10-1219,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2210.554,2221.761,"Well, in line with Justice Breyer's question, can you give us an example of some other agency review proceeding that is somewhat like this, or is this just unique?"
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2221.761,2224.48,"I don't think it's entirely unique at all, Your Honor."
2011.10-1219,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2278.096,2283.9,Are there limits on the new evidence that can be produced?
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2289.387,2296.66,"Well, Your Honor, I think that the principle of estoppel that was recognized in Barrett is not one that we are challenging."
2011.10-1219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2339.67,2375.243,"Well, if you are willing to accept that, then what about broadening that to prevent people from running around the PTO, and simply saying that unless the -- unless the person, the potential patentee, unless he wants to -- unless he has shown or you can show that he is innocent, that is to say it wasn't deliberate, it wasn't negligent, it wasn't a part of a trial of a strategy, unless he shows that he was totally without sin in some form of words in not introducing the evidence the first, time he can't introduce it now?"
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2375.243,2388.835,"I think the difficulty with that, Your Honor, is not only is it inconsistent with the practice of the courts which have always recognized that but it also ignores the fact that there needs to be decisions that an applicant makes about what evidence to present to the PTO."
2011.10-1219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2395.256,2395.939,"Well, say that."
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2405.797,2416.503,"--Well, Your Honor we would certainly meet that good cause standard in this case but the thing that I think is difficult about that standard is that it could potentially lead to all sorts of collateral litigation."
2011.10-1219,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2433.281,2443.654,So give us a standard and how what -- the good cause that you are somehow willing to accept different from the government's reasonable cause standard?
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2460.516,2473.775,"Justice Sotomayor, to be clear, the proper standard is one -- does not permit exclusion of evidence because there was good cause to present it and it was not."
2011.10-1219,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2493.737,2497.022,And what do you see the limits of that estoppel principal -- equity principal?
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2504.545,2522.422,"--And I that think in looking at the cases that were decided before 1952, which everyone seems to -- to agree is -- is the magic date, the furthest that any court went was the decision in Barrett."
2011.10-1219,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2526.91,2530.712,"That's a little bit unfair, to characterize the cases as limited to that."
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2532.112,2533.414,Not--
2011.10-1219,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2533.414,2535.23,And some courts said it should be intentional.
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2536.599,2540.718,"--In the court of -- in the court of appeals, Your Honor, the only exclusion of evidence--"
2011.10-1219,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2540.718,2541.42,"Yes, I agree."
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2541.42,2566.035,"--was from Barrett and that was a case that involved again, directing a witness not to answer, the suppression of inquiry into a particular factual area where the applicant then -- changing his story and claiming a different date for reduction of practice and a different basis for reduction to practice than had been argued before the PTO -- attempted to introduce the evidence that he had suppressed."
2011.10-1219,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2763.147,2768.266,And I think you are not taking the position that judge Newman did.
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2778.24,2803.372,"--Your Honor, Judge Newman said that if there -- that all -- all findings should be de novo in a Section 145 action, but the -- the majority of the en banc court said if there is no new evidence -- relying on what the Federal Circuit had held for many years, that if there is no new evidence than the standard would be the substantial evidence standard that would apply on appeal."
2011.10-1219,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2803.372,2804.641,And that -- and that--
2011.10-1219,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2804.641,2805.141,And you agree with that?
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2805.141,2807.176,"We haven't taken a position on it, but--"
2011.10-1219,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2807.176,2808.009,I noticed that.
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2808.009,2809.809,"--let me suggest why it might be right, Your Honor."
2011.10-1219,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2854.657,2858.026,It seems to me you were introducing such a gamesmanship.
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2874.536,2874.987,Right.
2011.10-1219,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2876.003,2888.727,Articulate a standard that would -- no one is suggesting total de novo review with no deference to any kind of presumption applied to the PTO decision.
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2891.096,2891.479,--I'm not sure--
2011.10-1219,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2891.479,2903.236,"--is the way that I suggested, which is it doesn't matter if there is no new evidence or not; what is the level of respect that you are going to give to the PTO factual findings?"
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2903.236,2908.355,"--And, Your Honor, I think the standard of proof is one of -- is the preponderance of the evidence."
2011.10-1219,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2933.09,2936.958,"Be -- as the language of Morgan, be convinced that the PTO was wrong?"
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2936.958,2945.647,"As section -- as I say, the language of Morgan deals with the circumstance in which there is a challenge to the validity of an issued patent."
2011.10-1219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2982.17,2995.496,"Suppose you were a lawyer, back to the Chief Justice's question, as you are; and you have the client there; and you are thinking, you know, if he prints all his evidence before the PTO, and they say no, we have had it."
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,3020.897,3036.507,"I think the -- I understand the concern, but the practicalities of patent prosecution practice are that no applicant would hold back evidence in an effort to -- to -- to produce that sort of tactical advantage, because once--"
2011.10-1219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3036.507,3037.59,"Because -- I'm sorry, go ahead."
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,3037.59,3043.311,--I think because it's -- it's frankly more straightforward and easier to try to meet those objections in the Office.
2011.10-1219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3180.95,3185.769,"I guess as a practical matter, these things all end up before the Federal Circuit anyway, right?"
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,3185.769,3186.503,"That's right, Your Honor."
2011.10-1219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3186.503,3202.196,"And I suppose if you had the same case and one is coming up under the 141, and the other one under 145, I suppose it is theoretically possible they could reach different results because of different standards of review?"
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,3202.196,3204.731,"Well, Your Honor, you can't do both."
2011.10-1219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3204.731,3205.667,"No, no."
2011.10-1219,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,3219.975,3223.644,"Well, Your Honor, it wouldn't be on the same record."
2011.10-1219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3275.094,3276.294,"Thank you, Mr. Panner."
2011.10-1219,2,24896,ginger_d__anders,,3278.346,3281.981,Thank you.
2011.10-1219,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3341.789,3344.272,Seems you have a strange statute here.
2011.10-1219,2,24896,ginger_d__anders,,3359.833,3364.635,"Well, that language was in the statute in Morgan when the Court construed this as judicial review."
2011.10-1219,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3383.616,3390.436,"Well, but I guess the compelling reason is the statutory language, and especially with respect to the admissibility of evidence question."
2011.10-1219,2,24896,ginger_d__anders,,3397.875,3401.327,"Well, I think certainly there is an exhaustion requirement within the statute."
2011.10-1219,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3418.706,3421.908,But why doesn't the Court just say what you said.
2011.10-1219,2,24896,ginger_d__anders,,3458.231,3477.858,"--Well, the language could be taken to suggest that some new evidence is admissible, but I think then we look to the fact that this -- just like Section 141 is a judicial review proceeding and there has to be compelling reason before we deviate from the normal deferential standards that apply when a -- when a court is reviewing an agency's determination."
2011.10-1219,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3477.858,3478.894,"Thank you, counsel."
