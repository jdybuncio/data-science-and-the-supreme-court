1978.78-275,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,41.105,We'll hear arguments next in Oscar Mayer & Co against Evans.
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,47.531,50.55,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.78-275,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,306.522,311.408,This would not by -- just because one of the judges changes his mind --
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,311.408,318.046,"One judge changed his mind on the petition, after the petition for rehearing was filed; there was not an En Banc here."
1978.78-275,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,362.989,368.257,"Mr. Gladden it doesn't say that proceedings must be commenced under the state law now, does it?"
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,368.257,383.088,"It does not say it must be commenced, but it says no suit maybe brought and I think if you will look at Section 7(b), which deals with filing an action in Federal Court, it says no suit maybe commenced until notice is given to the Department of Labor."
1978.78-275,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,460.411,469.135,"You are arguing that the similar language had been construed and that we should follow that construction, but I was suggesting to you that the language itself was not entirely unambiguous."
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,469.135,470.028,"Well, I think –"
1978.78-275,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,470.028,482.65,Because unlike Section 7(b) which says that until the individual has given the secretary notice there is nothing here that requires that the proceedings be commenced before the state agency?
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,482.65,483.694,"Well, I think that the language --"
1978.78-275,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,483.694,486.113,You can read it either way is all I am saying.
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,486.113,530.523,"Well, I think you could technically read it either way, but I think when you look at the fact that the language was taken from Title VII and the consistent interpretation of Title VII, I think the far better reading and I think the more the reading which I think gives more meaning to the language of the section is one which needs it as a requirement and it's our position that this making it a requirement is every consistent with the purposes underlying the Age Discrimination Act, because the Act encourages conciliation of disputes rather than litigation of such disputes and by requiring resort to state agencies you maximize the possibility of a non-judicial resolution of such disputes."
1978.78-275,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,664.563,671.017,Is there anything in congressional history that supports you that you have go through the state first?
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,671.017,677.141,"I think Mr. Justice Marshall that if you look at the history which led to Title VII, it was very clear they wanted them to go to the state."
1978.78-275,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,677.141,678.068,I'm talking about this?
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,678.068,692.14,"Right, when they adopted this provision as you recall, this statute when it was first proposed had a National Labor Relations Board type procedure then through various discussions it was amended and became a hybrid of section of some Title VII --"
1978.78-275,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,692.14,693.893,So the answer is going to be no?
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,693.893,716.892,"No, there's -- then toward the end of the consideration, a representative of organized labor and a representative of one of the state agencies raised the question with Congress with respect to the possibility that the Age Discrimination Act is then drafted would preempt states and preclude them from age discrimination enforcement and these two people suggested to Congress that they follow the Title VII procedure."
1978.78-275,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,721.706,725.808,But nobody -- no man of Congress said a word about it?
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,725.808,731.556,There's no recorded discussion on that provision either way.
1978.78-275,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,823.098,827.765,"Can I interrupt with a question before the noon hour, so you may want to think on that over lunch."
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,842.765,846.188,"Well, I think the question there was whether or not you've had to file with the state agencies."
1978.78-275,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,878.207,882.341,"It went to a question of timeliness I think, whether there was any question about it being filed in time?"
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,882.341,888.086,But I think it was also a question whether you had to file with the state as well.
1978.78-275,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1010.167,1011.817,We'll resume there at 1 o'clock counsel.
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,1011.817,1012.583,Thank you.
1978.78-275,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1027.396,1029.502,"Counselor, you may proceed."
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,1029.502,1032.423,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-275,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1103.016,1106.0,"And the Love case simply held that there had been, there had been compliance?"
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,1106.0,1110.4,The Love case simply held that there had been in the procedure that was followed there.
1978.78-275,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1189.077,1192.438,"But there's some difference between the procedures, isn't it?"
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,1192.438,1194.264,"There's some difference, absolutely correct."
1978.78-275,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1197.491,1201.333,"And you don't have to go the state before you go to the Federal now, do you?"
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,1201.333,1202.431,No you may go to the State.
1978.78-275,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1202.431,1205.212,Isn't that quite a substantial difference?
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,1208.345,1216.341,"But it shows less deference, but it doesn't mean it shouldn't go to the State at all, because what it does is, it sets up two parallel administrative lines to be pursued."
1978.78-275,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1241.801,1245.433,Must he file with the Federal people before he goes to court?
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,1245.433,1246.462,Yes.
1978.78-275,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1246.462,1250.043,"And how long does he have once he files with the Federal people, how long does he have to wait?"
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,1250.043,1252.269,He must wait a minimum of 60 days.
1978.78-275,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1252.269,1259.404,"But even under your theory, the claimant can forget about the state proceedings at the expiration of 60 days, can he not?"
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,1259.404,1264.246,"He can at the minimum -- after a minimum of 60 days, but he doesn't have to go to court at the end of 60 days."
1978.78-275,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1276.804,1278.901,"Well that's all he is claiming here, I take it?"
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,1278.901,1286.414,"No, what he is claiming here is he doesn't have to go to the State at all; that he never filed a claimant, he never has to file a claim with the state."
1978.78-275,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1291.712,1294.283,"He can't ignore the Federals, but he can ignore the State?"
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,1294.283,1295.824,That's his contention.
1978.78-275,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1295.824,1301.968,"And your contention is that of course he has to file with the Federal people, but he has to file with the State too?"
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,1301.968,1311.65,"That's correct, because in terms of the numbers of complaints, in terms of the obvious purpose of the act is to have conciliation of these matters to avoid litigation."
1978.78-275,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1312.94,1318.242,"So, if he files with the Federal people and waits 60 days, he still is going to have to file with the State and wait 60?"
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,1318.242,1343.869,"But he could make that filing contemporaneously and it's our feeling that this encourages -- what it does is, it establishes a state agency which has an ongoing relationship dealing with plans with respect to race and sex charges and other age charges, it enables those local people that have been dealing with claims to get into this picture and attempt to resolve this matter, so that we don't get into Federal litigation over an age discrimination complaint if at all."
1978.78-275,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1343.869,1354.747,Was there any explanation in the legislative history as to why there was no requirement of resorting to State procedures before resorting to the Federal procedures?
1978.78-275,0,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,1354.747,1362.416,"No, there is no legislative history in those terms with respect to the 1967 Act."
1978.78-275,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1614.492,1616.053,Very well Mr. Gladden.
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,1619.556,1622.069,Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-275,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1683.801,1691.447,"It's fair to say from your opening remark, that if the Eighth Circuit had gone the other way you would not have brought the case here?"
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,1691.447,1700.556,"I think by the time by the Eighth Circuit decided this case, there was a pretty pronounced conflict among the Circuits and I think that by itself would have justified certiorari."
1978.78-275,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1700.556,1702.113,Conflict alone.
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,1702.113,1705.927,Yes sir.
1978.78-275,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1759.304,1770.371,"If the Court finds that the language of the statute provides just that, however, the fact that it may be a procedural money-wrench is none of our business, is it?"
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,1770.371,1783.825,"That if this Court finds that that is what Congress intended then we agree Mr. Justice Stewart, but I think this Court has the opportunity to construe an admittedly ambiguous statute, at least we --"
1978.78-275,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1783.825,1792.753,"It is you who admits ambiguous, you claim it is ambiguous and so does the respondent, but petitioner says it is very clear."
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,1792.753,1793.647,That's what petitioner says.
1978.78-275,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1793.647,1797.244,"So, it is not at all conceded that this is an ambiguous statute?"
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,1797.244,1800.036,"No I don't, I am sorry; I don't mean to imply that it was."
1978.78-275,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1800.036,1805.799,You are relying on a presumption that Congress does not create procedural money-wrenches?
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,1805.799,1809.422,"I would like to relay on that presumption Mr. Justice Rehnquist, [Attempt to Laughter]."
1978.78-275,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1814.312,1821.347,[Inaudible] that the complaining part only had probably a piece of paper work to state or –
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,1821.347,1822.594,In this case.
1978.78-275,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1822.594,1825.225,In any case?
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,1825.225,1826.14,I'm sorry I don't understand.
1978.78-275,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1826.14,1830.872,In order to do what petitioners says --
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,1830.872,1830.985,Yes.
1978.78-275,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1830.985,1841.22,"-- would it be satisfactory if the complainant merely files a piece of paper with the Wisconsin agency or Ohio or whatever it is, saying I've been done in?"
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,1841.22,1845.818,That is the question that the federal court will have to answer when the case ends up there.
1978.78-275,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1845.818,1846.829,That is what –
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,1846.829,1854.938,That is -- in fact that is the question that has been much litigated where plaintiffs have gone to state agencies.
1978.78-275,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1894.732,1906.191,And your friend has suggested that and I suppose we can judicially notice the fact that most claims of this kind are subject to the settlement via conciliation and negotiation.
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,1925.664,1934.232,Well I think they would much prefer to have cases like this settled rather than litigated and I think that's no question about it and that's -–
1978.78-275,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1934.232,1937.537,It's the desirable without a dozen reasons?
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,1937.537,1944.62,Without any doubt at all and I'm sure that given that choice every member of Congress would have said we favor conciliation and settlement.
1978.78-275,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1963.975,1973.425,"One way the Secretary of Labor might employ to settle it would be cooperation and coordination of state agencies, is it not?"
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,1973.425,1976.562,That is in his discretion one path that he might to choose.
1978.78-275,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1976.562,1994.269,"In other words, if the state has an agency which is established a record in the minds of the Secretary of Labor as being effective and prompt, reasonably so and the Secretary of Labor would perhaps hold his hand and say proceed."
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,1994.269,2000.922,"That is a choice that the act leaves open in the sense that it doesn't preclude it, but there are two points I think Mr. Chief Justice in that regard."
1978.78-275,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2013.605,2017.411,"Well, if there is no agency, then there is no problem, is there?"
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2017.411,2035.316,"Well, there is a problem in the sense that if a plaintiff goes directly into Federal Court, the employer is free to raise the question and say is this the state which requires resort to state procedures and this puts another question in front of the federal court that it must act."
1978.78-275,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2035.316,2040.666,"If there is no agency that should be rather, a question readily answered?"
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2040.666,2055.29,"It's not readily answered as easily as it sounds, because there are cases in which Federal Courts have said, have opened the statute books and said there are some statutes in here that prohibit discrimination in one way or another."
1978.78-275,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2061.425,2067.128,But the question is not does the state law require a resort to state procedures.
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2079.237,2079.444,That's correct.
1978.78-275,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2079.444,2082.339,It doesn't depend at all upon whether the state does or does not require?
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2082.339,2099.354,"No that is correct Mr. Justice, it does not depend on that, but when the plaintiff goes into the Federal Court not having gone to any state agency at all, the employer is certainly entitled to raise as one of the questions that the Federal Court must decide, we are in a deferral state and this man is not to deferred."
1978.78-275,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2124.044,2133.941,"I suppose once it were decided in any district that that state does have a law or that state doesn't have a law, that would be the end of it for future cases, wouldn't it?"
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2133.941,2136.782,"Assuming that the law doesn't change in that state, yes."
1978.78-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2136.782,2137.766,Mr. Ryan can –
1978.78-275,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2137.766,2140.337,It wouldn't be repeatedly.
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2140.337,2142.104,I would think not.
1978.78-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2142.104,2145.133,Would you help me with a problem I was concerned with before lunch.
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2156.76,2161.924,"I would answer that Mr. Justice Stevens by saying that has been the way, it has always been understood."
1978.78-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2161.924,2164.293,And the government doesn't question that understanding?
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2164.293,2166.782,"Well, certainly not in this case and I don't think that we do in other cases."
1978.78-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2166.782,2174.705,And so what really we are being asked to do is to say that the identical language in two similar statutes has different meaning?
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2174.705,2180.239,"Well, I would -- my answer was that is the way it has always been understood."
1978.78-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2194.928,2201.368,"I didn't think Love really squarely decided, but it seems to me, this is something everybody is assuming for purposes of the decision in this –"
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2201.368,2201.496,Yes.
1978.78-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2201.496,2209.91,"And so, really what it boils down to is, you are asking us to construe precisely the same language in similar statutes in different ways?"
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2209.91,2212.6,"Yes, I won't."
1978.78-275,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2214.428,2216.612,Without pertinent legislative history?
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2216.612,2229.827,"Well, the difference is that in Title VII there is an unmistakable legislative history that shows that prior resort to the states was required."
1978.78-275,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2235.657,2241.335,"Well, according to this when you abide that, you also abide that legislative history?"
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2241.335,2242.613,In Title VII.
1978.78-275,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2242.613,2244.904,"Yeah, he says you abide and obey it too?"
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2244.904,2246.799,I disagree with the petitioner on that score.
1978.78-275,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2246.799,2247.844,Why not?
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2247.844,2248.609,We are talking here about --
1978.78-275,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2248.609,2251.375,"You are taking to the whole thing, aren't you?"
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2253.774,2255.162,It's not the same section.
1978.78-275,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2258.569,2260.359,It is certainly not identical language?
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2260.359,2261.635,It is not identical.
1978.78-275,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2261.635,2263.314,It's the difference in the language?
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2263.314,2264.045,It is similar.
1978.78-275,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2280.623,2300.214,"My brother Steven says is that, we say that these two sections are not identical, but are so also similar that we can't decide the difference between the two and however we do find that one means something different from the other."
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2307.837,2309.711,I would be happy to give you something to cite.
1978.78-275,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2309.711,2311.266,Alright.
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2311.266,2321.51,The structure of the ADEA is different from the structure of Title VII in terms of utilizing state remedies and utilizing federal remedies.
1978.78-275,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2404.198,2408.305,And Aged act did not have any difference to the states?
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2408.305,2409.958,The -- I am sorry sir.
1978.78-275,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2409.958,2414.916,The act we have here was not intended to give any difference to the state?
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2414.916,2417.638,I would not say it was intended to give no difference.
1978.78-275,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2433.438,2437.735,"They would have that without this section, wouldn't they?"
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2437.735,2439.185,That the plaintiffs would have been free to go--
1978.78-275,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2439.185,2440.398,Yeah.
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2440.398,2448.827,"They would have but then it would have gotten into some of the problems which this Court mentioned in Love versus Pullman which of course, which yet to be decided in 1967."
1978.78-275,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2524.279,2529.406,"We simplify it, no matter what we do, if we decide the case?"
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2529.406,2531.115,I respectfully disagree sir.
1978.78-275,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2550.6,2562.254,As conditions change in the various states it's a simple matter of Congress to modify this problem if they think a problem flows--
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2562.254,2564.589,It is simple for Congress to modify it in either way.
1978.78-275,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2564.589,2564.838,Yeah.
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2564.838,2602.385,"And certainly if Congress does not like what this Court says, it can change it, it did that in McMahon and it can do that in this case if it wants to, but our position is that given that choice to complicate the Act or to simplify it that this Court should simplify it and if Congress wants to change it that’s up to Congress, but until that time Congress -- the Act the purpose of this Act gives individuals a right in Federal Courts to vindicate claims of age discrimination should be supported by this Court and not submitted to a continuing round of procedural questions."
1978.78-275,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2602.385,2609.481,Was enforcement of ADEA transferred last summer to the EEOC?
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2609.481,2613.889,"It becomes effective this coming summer July 1st 1979, yes sir."
1978.78-275,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2613.889,2619.126,"So that the EEOC will administer the section, that issue here today as well as Title VII?"
1978.78-275,1,16807,allan_ryan_jr,,2619.126,2623.235,"Yes sir, that's my understanding."
1978.78-275,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2623.235,2637.582,Very well Mr. Ryan.
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,2639.821,2642.662,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-275,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2670.389,2676.768,Is that the case where the Court of Appeals relied on the legislative history largely?
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,2676.768,2677.604,Yes Your Honor.
1978.78-275,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2677.604,2682.269,"The legislative history, 11 years after the event, is that the one?"
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,2682.269,2683.563,Ten years after it Your Honor.
1978.78-275,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2683.563,2686.667,Ten.
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,2693.031,2698.984,"As the Secretary pointed out in the brief for Mr. Chief Justice, six of the members were--"
1978.78-275,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2698.984,2700.34,"I said it could be, not were?"
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,2700.34,2701.353,Yeah it could be.
1978.78-275,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2701.353,2703.827,There could be an entirely new team?
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,2703.827,2707.6,"Some of them were in fact in the team, some were holdovers."
1978.78-275,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2858.087,2877.198,"But you do agree that under Title VII even if the complaining party does not file anything with the State, he still must wait 60 days before he can file a charge with the EEOC, you agree with that?"
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,2889.595,2900.119,I am not sure that situation would arise because of this Court’s decision in Log which said or at least it seemed to intimate that you have to go to the state agency first.
1978.78-275,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2909.677,2922.447,"Then if that’s fair reading of that language as mandatory why except for that there was to be no charge and no suit, why doesn’t dramatically the same language lead to the same result in the other statute?"
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,2927.97,2934.906,"Well because in Title VII the, I think they specifically said that the state must be given the 60 day period."
1978.78-275,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2956.257,2962.011,What is the section in the Title VII that requires prior resort to the state agency then?
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,2962.011,2963.814,I don’t know the answer to that question.
1978.78-275,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2963.814,2968.816,But you say it’s not this section?
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,2977.751,2982.683,No Section 706(c) has been interpreted to me and I am wrong.
1978.78-275,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2982.683,2985.976,Yeah.
1978.78-275,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2985.976,2991.476,This section only implies to states like ours?
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,2991.476,2994.207,Well that’s also true with Section 706(c).
1978.78-275,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2998.181,3002.909,"But I mean the old section not just this bottom, it starts all."
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,3020.24,3021.084,"Well, I think if they had a --"
1978.78-275,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3021.084,3034.408,"We’re making a separate rule for States that have State machinery, from states that don’t have state machinery, isn’t that what 14(b) is?"
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,3034.408,3037.578,Well I think 14(b) says you have option of going to the State.
1978.78-275,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3037.578,3051.416,"But let me read it says, in the case of alleged age discriminate occurring in a state which has a law, well what is the provision to State it does not have a law?"
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,3051.416,3057.68,"In a state that does not a have law Mr. Justice Marshall, there’s no state exhaustion requirement?"
1978.78-275,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3057.68,3068.194,"The whole point is that this could be, once you get into State that does have such law, you have to the go to the State machinery first?"
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,3068.194,3071.782,"That could be, that’s obviously not the interpretation that worried you."
1978.78-275,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3071.782,3074.081,"There have to be, obviously."
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,3074.081,3076.08,"No, Your Honor."
1978.78-275,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3076.08,3078.796,"Mr. Bennett, did you argue the case below?"
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,3078.796,3081.512,Yes sir.
1978.78-275,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3081.512,3085.907,Did you have an oral argument on the rehearing petition when it was granted?
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,3085.907,3086.771,"No, Your Honor."
1978.78-275,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3086.771,3088.699,Done purely on briefs?
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,3088.699,3094.257,It was done on the petition for rehearing filed by myself and the --
1978.78-275,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3094.257,3103.929,"What do you – what prompted Judge Smith to change his mind, the appearance of the Secretary of Labor?"
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,3103.929,3119.938,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, I believe it was the holding, the subsequent inter -- there was a subsequent holding by Gabriele of the Sixth Circuit in between the time when we orally argued the case and the time when we file the petition for rehearing."
1978.78-275,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3124.832,3128.215,"Of course that had no impact on Judge Wright though, did it?"
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,3128.215,3130.581,"Judge Wright today does not been persuaded, no."
1978.78-275,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3130.581,3135.6,"The Sixth Circuit was Judge Smith’s circuit, he was the District Judge in Ann Harbor, Michigan when he -- was this is this Talbot Smith?"
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,3135.6,3138.808,It was Talbot Smith sitting by designation from Michigan.
1978.78-275,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3138.808,3141.6,"Yes, Sixth Circuit."
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,3141.6,3142.72,In any event Title VII --
1978.78-275,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3142.72,3145.501,The Eighth Circuit Judges were divided?
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,3145.501,3147.983,"Yes, one-one."
1978.78-275,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3287.283,3304.247,"There has been anti-preemption provisions though in civil rights acts that are far -- simply say nothing in this actual preempt state provisions that go further, without saying being as expressed but going into the state procedures as this one does?"
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,3304.247,3312.323,"That certainly would have been a clearer way to do it but I think the section, you know, we would have known the answer had they done that?"
1978.78-275,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3312.323,3313.43,We would not be all here?
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,3313.43,3314.36,"We wouldn’t be here, correct."
1978.78-275,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3314.36,3320.941,"We might, but you wouldn't. [Attempt to Laughter]"
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,3320.941,3340.804,It’s interesting to note under the legislative history that there is a total lack of legislative history under the ADEA where under Title VII the legislative history is cleared by the remarks of Senator Humphrey that it was intended to go to the States.
1978.78-275,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3402.597,3421.51,"Now couldn't they solve it as I have read that some States have solved it that when the papers are filed with the state agency, they notify the Federal and vice-versa and they work on a coordination that if one’s going ahead the other one’s state is examined."
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,3425.507,3449.985,That would work in the case of concurrent filings where the filings took place at the same time but if an individual chose to file with the Department of Labor first then the Department of Labor is under a mandate to use those 60 days and then maybe on the 61st day if that individual is within his statute limitation on the state would then file with the state and it would be too late for that kind of cooperation that you suggest.
1978.78-275,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3449.985,3465.551,"Why would it be too late, the Secretary of Labor or no other agency in the government work so swiftly that it would have gone very far, it couldn’t do work coordination on the 61st day?"
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,3465.551,3472.201,But in any event the claimant could file suit in the Federal Court on the 61st day because that’s all the time the statute gives.
1978.78-275,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3472.201,3480.87,"Well, there is no, under the statutory scheme that can’t be avoided by coordination I agree?"
1978.78-275,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3480.87,3485.206,"Well, you need not go to the Federal administrative agency at all?"
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,3485.206,3485.872,Under this statute?
1978.78-275,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3485.872,3487.191,Under this statute.
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,3487.191,3489.181,That is incorrect.
1978.78-275,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3489.181,3490.585,Can you file a suit?
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,3490.585,3499.064,"No, there’s a 68 waiting period with the Department of Labor as well as a 60 day waiting period with any State Civil Rights Commission."
1978.78-275,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3499.064,3501.312,But he doesn’t have to get a right to sue letter?
1978.78-275,2,35444,mark_w_bennett,,3501.312,3502.67,There’s no right to sue letter.
1978.78-275,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3556.152,3556.951,Very well.
1978.78-275,3,30463,james_w_gladden_jr,,3562.45,3562.957,May it please the Court.
1978.78-275,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3650.672,3651.329,Thank you gentleman.
