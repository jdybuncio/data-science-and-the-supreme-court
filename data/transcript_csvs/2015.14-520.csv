2015.14-520,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.84,"We'll hear argument next in Case 14-520, Hawkins v. the Community Bank of Raymore. Mr. Duggan."
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,7.84,21.37,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Persons who jointly and severally agree to repay the applied-for debt are applicants under ECOA. And that is precisely what occurred here."
2015.14-520,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,58.815,71.785,"Didn't the Federal Reserve Board originally, I think, in 1977 take the opposite position and said explicitly that applicant excludes guarantors?"
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,71.785,88.6,"Your Honor -- Your Honor, with regard to that position that was taken by the FDIC in 1977, they were responding to claims by the industry that they did not want applicants broadly defined to include guarantors for notice provisions."
2015.14-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,123.85,127.335,Do you have to give notice to -- to guarantors now?
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,127.335,128.315,"No, you do not, Your Honor."
2015.14-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,128.315,131.37,"Well, how can that be? I mean, they're either applicants or they're not applicants."
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,131.37,131.75,"Well, I think --"
2015.14-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,131.75,133.405,"If they're applicants, you have to give them notice."
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,133.405,134.01,I think the --
2015.14-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,134.01,136.98,"You're saying they're applicants for one purpose, they're not applicants for another?"
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,136.98,137.55,"Yeah, in this case --"
2015.14-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,137.55,138.89,The agency can make that up?
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,138.89,154.61,"Well, I think the Court has already ruled in the Duke Energy case that regulators, in appropriate circumstances, can even take a defined term under the statute, in that case the term ""modification,"" and cause it to mean different things in different subsections."
2015.14-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,154.61,155.91,I never liked that case.
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,155.91,158.505,My apologies. (Laughter.)
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,158.505,164.04,"What -- what happened in this case, Your Honor, was very, very reasonable by the regulators."
2015.14-520,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,165.69,173.96,"Just out of curiosity, why -- well, everybody agrees that PHC Development is an applicant, right?"
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,173.96,175.155,Agreed.
2015.14-520,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,175.155,185.52,Why didn't PHC Development sue and claim that requiring the guaranties was in violation of the law?
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,185.52,196.93,"At that point in time, the case law that had developed so far, and the Regulation B, made it clear that the spouses had standing to bring the claim, and the spouses were the ones that asserted the claim."
2015.14-520,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,196.93,204.59,"Why does it matter, if there's always somebody to bring a claim? In what set of cases does the answer to this question matter?"
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,204.59,206.71,I think it's important for several reasons.
2015.14-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,243.98,244.73,"Wait, wait, wait."
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,253.495,256.25,And I think that's exactly what the regulators --
2015.14-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,256.25,259.07,"Well, but don't talk about it as she was required to sign."
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,260.54,262.66,There was a requirement placed upon --
2015.14-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,262.66,268.785,"If he -- if he was to get the loan, he had to get her to sign, but she was not required to sign."
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,268.785,269.64,I'd agree.
2015.14-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,339.84,351.965,"Let's -- let's -- let's assume that I -- I write a letter of recommendation for some -- some young woman who is applying to a law school, or to a college."
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,364.805,365.2,No.
2015.14-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,365.2,367.385,Would anybody use the English language that way?
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,367.385,373.63,"Well, I believe, in that context, that person is not agreeing to become jointly and severally liable to pay the tuition."
2015.14-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,374.41,382.91,"What difference does it make? Instead of putting my financial solvency on the line, I put my reputation on the line."
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,382.91,398.64,"Well, I think it's very important, because the regulators made a reasonable interpretation under their broad grant of authority that when they're required, when a condition is placed upon the approval, that they have to come forward and be contractually obligated to repay the applied-for debt, they are an applicant."
2015.14-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,398.64,406.36,"They are not applying. It's -- it's their husband who's applying, and they don't have to -- or -- or it's a company that's applying."
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,408.47,429.39,"The guaranties in this case have specific requirements for independent performance by the guarantors, such as providing financial statements, repaying the debt, paying their debts on time, honoring all their obligations with the lender. If they breach one single obligation that's independent to their guaranty, they're obligated to repay the debt in full, and --"
2015.14-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,429.39,430.37,That doesn't show --
2015.14-520,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,430.37,440.585,"What if I have a child, and I apply for that child to be admitted to the XYZ public school for which I will pay -- a private school, for which I will pay the tuition."
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,441.635,442.59,I don't think so.
2015.14-520,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,442.59,443.44,You don't think so?
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,443.44,446.2,"I think in part you may be, but my -- my contention --"
2015.14-520,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,446.2,446.855,"Wait, wait, wait."
2015.14-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,452.44,456.36,"Well, you shouldn't -- you shouldn't have asked that. (Laughter.)"
2015.14-520,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,456.36,457.38,I have a parent that applies for --
2015.14-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,457.38,459.395,You and I share that concern.
2015.14-520,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,459.395,460.34,What? Wait.
2015.14-520,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,474.955,480.66,"Isn't it normal for us to refer to the parent as the applicant, even though the child doesn't?"
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,480.66,481.41,Yes.
2015.14-520,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,481.41,489.605,"And it is not normal for us to refer to the applicant for college as the parent, even though, unfortunately, the parent foots the bill?"
2015.14-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,489.605,491.94,Was this corporation a minor?
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,491.94,492.23,What?
2015.14-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,492.23,494.68,"The corporation that applied, was it a minor?"
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,494.68,495.87,"No, but the point --"
2015.14-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,495.87,504.18,"Change the -- the seven-year-old to a young man who is applying to law school, who is already shaving, for Pete's sake."
2015.14-520,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,504.18,505.38,But my point --
2015.14-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,505.38,507.41,Is Justice Breyer the applicant?
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,507.41,507.56,He may.
2015.14-520,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,507.56,515.81,"I think our point for both of us is that how we use the word ""applicant"" depends upon the context."
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,515.81,516.23,Very true.
2015.14-520,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,516.23,527.325,"And, therefore, what is it about the context of the guarantor of a loan that makes it reasonable in that context to call that person an applicant?"
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,527.325,529.06,Let me answer that question directly.
2015.14-520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,529.06,530.9,"Well, I don't agree with the hypothesis."
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,546.56,549.2,"May I address the questions, Mr. Chief Justice?"
2015.14-520,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,549.2,550.15,That's all right with me. (Laughter.)
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,550.15,557.6,"Thank you so much. The definition of the word ""apply"" is to appeal to a request."
2015.14-520,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,592.72,595.95,Under your -- under your view -- let me understand the theory of the case.
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,616.425,620.33,"No, the loan cannot be declared unenforceable under the laws that exist today."
2015.14-520,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,644.295,645.125,"Thank you, Counsel."
2015.14-520,0,62591,john_m_duggan,,645.125,653.905,Thank you so much.
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,1566.615,1574.02,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is a Chevron step one case."
2015.14-520,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1605.73,1612.9,"Mr. McAllister, I take it if there were two borrowers, you would include both of them, both would have a cause of action?"
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,1612.9,1613.66,Absolutely.
2015.14-520,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1615.38,1615.97,They're joint applicants.
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,1615.97,1616.69,-- covers them.
2015.14-520,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1616.69,1624.62,"How about if they're cosigners? I take it that -- is -- a co-signer is somebody who's jointly and severally liable, but is not himself --"
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,1624.62,1626.24,Is not an applicant.
2015.14-520,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1626.24,1627.04,-- receiving the money.
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,1627.04,1628.1,Exactly.
2015.14-520,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1628.54,1630.78,You would -- you would count that out.
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,1630.78,1632.19,Count that out.
2015.14-520,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1647.08,1658.0,And this is so even if the cosigner had to file the exact same kind of papers and do everything else that the borrower himself had to do?
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,1658.0,1658.99,Exactly.
2015.14-520,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1733.38,1747.87,"So suppose -- suppose that I have a credit card, and now I get married, and I'd like a secondary credit card for my spouse, and I apply to the credit card company for a secondary credit card. Who's -- who's the applicant there?"
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,1747.87,1751.91,"Well, I think you are still the applicant there."
2015.14-520,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1751.91,1758.33,"So even though I receive no direct benefit, the credit is actually given to my spouse now?"
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,1758.33,1765.945,"Well, if they have the ability to charge on the account same as you, then I guess they would, in effect, become a joint applicant at that point in time."
2015.14-520,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1765.945,1771.57,"They would effectively become a joint applicant, even though I'm the only one who's filling out the -- the -- all the papers."
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,1771.57,1789.38,"But the statute contemplates that there can be situations in which a third-party requests credit on behalf of another, and that's another reason why we think guarantors are not included because it is contemplating, for example, the parent who goes in, says I want to arrange a loan for my son or daughter to buy their first car."
2015.14-520,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1802.69,1848.15,"I guess -- I guess -- you know -- and this is a -- a functional point for sure. But it doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense that suppose a lender doesn't want to provide credit to a married woman because it has all these sex, gender stereotypes in the lender's head or -- and the lender couldn't require that the -- that the husband be listed as a -- a joint applicant, but could require that the husband be listed as a cosigner, even though the effect of those two things are exactly the same, which is that it's a requirement that the spouse essentially become joint and severally liable for the loan."
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,1848.15,1850.34,"Well, I -- I don't think there is a difference."
2015.14-520,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1925.15,1937.57,"That's not -- that's not quite accurate, because the only person who's given a right not to be discriminated against is the applicant -- an applicant on the basis of marital status."
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,1937.57,1939.735,"No, Your Honor."
2015.14-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1955.25,1965.28,"Mr. McAllister, why -- why does it matter? A person sitting at the table says, please lend me $10,000."
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,1991.455,1993.22,It is -- it --
2015.14-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1993.22,1998.605,What is it -- because who are the ones you said do fall within applicants? It's not just --
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,1998.605,1999.5,So it's --
2015.14-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1999.5,2006.52,"It's the person sitting at the table, then others come up, and they have to get -- there's like sureties, they're like guarantors, there are a bunch of different things."
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2006.52,2007.2,None of them --
2015.14-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2007.2,2008.79,It seemed to me some of them you thought might.
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2008.79,2010.56,None of them actually should be included.
2015.14-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2022.36,2030.685,"Why? I mean, the thing I don't get is why can't you apply? An applicant means a person who applies for something."
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2036.26,2042.155,"Because, again, I come back to the statutory definition, Justice Breyer, which says you are applying for credit."
2015.14-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2049.83,2050.15,Yes.
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2061.66,2064.94,"And in our view, the statute means Smith is the applicant."
2015.14-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2064.94,2065.175,Because?
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2065.175,2067.66,"Because, again, the -- the --"
2015.14-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2067.66,2069.92,The person who filled -- I don't want you to repeat yourself.
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2070.38,2070.94,Okay.
2015.14-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2070.94,2082.99,"But I mean, you see where I'm having the problem, that Jones, who came in, he fills out the papers and he signs the signature, he puts in all the things and he says, please, please, please give that credit to Smith."
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2082.99,2084.91,"Well, again, I don't think that --"
2015.14-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2084.91,2088.835,Why hasn't -- he's applied. He's applied for the credit to go to Smith.
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2091.14,2102.42,"Well, I -- I think that's in a sense contrary, really, to the -- the most ordinary understandings of the word ""applicant."" Of course, we've got a statutory definition. If I go back to the university admissions process --"
2015.14-520,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2102.42,2103.12,I'm sorry.
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2125.03,2126.34,I'm aware of that.
2015.14-520,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2126.34,2127.73,It's a terrible dictionary. (Laughter.)
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2127.73,2129.4,I'm aware of that.
2015.14-520,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2129.4,2133.52,All the others don't use a direct benefit language.
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2150.72,2152.75,"Well, I come back --"
2015.14-520,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2152.75,2160.25,"You've got cosigners, you've got parents who -- who sign as cosigners rental agreements for their kids."
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2184.04,2188.18,"Perhaps that's the key, Justice Sotomayor, is that you're talking common parlance."
2015.14-520,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2193.65,2213.45,"Then why did -- why did the Federal Reserve Board initially -- specifically exclude guarantors? If it was so clear that applicant excludes guarantors, why did the Federal Reserve Board do something so unnecessary to specifically exclude them?"
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2213.45,2217.25,"Because I think they created confusion, Justice Ginsburg."
2015.14-520,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2255.98,2295.58,"Mr. -- Mr. McAllister, in Corbin on Contracts, when they talk about guaranties, they say, in most cases of guaranty contracts, the offer comes from the guarantor requesting the giving of credit to a principal debtor. So Corbin on Contracts is -- clearly thinks that the guarantor is a requestor, is an applicant for credit, and just to a third-party, to the principal debtor. But why -- why -- I mean, that's a pretty, you know, credit-specific definition of what it means to apply for credit."
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2299.02,2303.145,"Well, that's -- that -- that is a -- what Corbin says."
2015.14-520,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2316.23,2338.7,"Well, do you think that it's really contingent on that, on exactly which contract you signed? I mean, these folks give you a lot of information, they sign their names to a lot of information, and -- I mean, unlike the usual guarantor case where the guarantor is only liable if there's a default, here the guarantor is jointly and severally liable, much like a cosigner is. At any rate, cosigners are jointly and severally --"
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2338.7,2341.88,That's -- cosigners are jointly and severally liable.
2015.14-520,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2341.88,2343.93,"And you want to put them in the same box, too."
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2344.89,2345.42,Right.
2015.14-520,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2348.38,2348.92,It doesn't matter.
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2348.92,2350.81,-- that are not joint and severally liable.
2015.14-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2350.81,2352.745,I bet we could find 50 like that.
2015.14-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2358.72,2381.445,"But the -- the -- it says, an applicant -- this is very helpful -- an applicant is a person who applies for something, all right? We're not making too much progress. But then when we go to apply, the second definition down here, is to make an appeal or request. Does the guarantor make an appeal or request? Yes. Especially in the form of written application."
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2392.71,2393.98,And we're talking --
2015.14-520,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2393.98,2394.515,-- the meaning.
2015.14-520,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2394.515,2403.16,I assume that that definition would -- would cover my letter to somebody urging that person to hire somebody else.
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2403.16,2404.61,I think that's exactly right.
2015.14-520,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2404.7,2409.58,"I would be -- I would be an applicant under -- under that definition, which is, of course, absurd."
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2409.58,2413.1,"And two -- two things about that absurdity, Justice Scalia."
2015.14-520,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2414.86,2416.15,"Well, he's not asking for money."
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2416.15,2417.435,Pardon?
2015.14-520,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2417.435,2421.15,"He's recommending someone, but this is about an extension of credit."
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2421.15,2421.79,Right.
2015.14-520,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2429.43,2435.15,"Well, it would be a different thing if the statute said, don't discriminate on the basis of someone being a Justice."
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2436.4,2438.0,"It should say that, but --"
2015.14-520,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2438.0,2440.38,"The analogy would work only if you did that, right?"
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2440.38,2456.0,"But -- but what I was going to say is the government concedes that the statute uses -- well, in fact, they didn't say this, but I believe the statute uses the word ""applicant"" something like 50 times, and only for one purpose do they say this definition should apply."
2015.14-520,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2459.94,2462.515,I thought that the government answered that question differently.
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2475.0,2477.48,Neither one is -- I don't think either one is true --
2015.14-520,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2477.48,2477.89,You may disagree --
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2477.89,2479.055,-- Justice Kennedy.
2015.14-520,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2479.055,2480.3,Maybe I misunderstood their answer.
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2480.3,2483.74,"Oh, I don't think they say that it would apply across all 50 uses."
2015.14-520,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2493.65,2502.56,"And can you give me an example of where it would be really contrary to a sensible interpretation of the Act to use the term ""guarantor"" and --"
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2502.56,2503.63,For example --
2015.14-520,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2503.63,2506.63,"-- ""applicant"" as synonymous, other than for what we're talking about here?"
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2506.63,2510.09,"Well, for example, giving notice of adverse action."
2015.14-520,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2515.49,2519.335,I frankly -- I frankly don't believe why that makes the statute unworkable.
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2538.33,2542.31,"Well, it would -- it is not just that, Justice Sotomayor."
2015.14-520,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2593.29,2593.35,No.
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2599.05,2602.93,"They would say the person who wants the credit, the applicant, is not the same as a guarantor."
2015.14-520,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2602.93,2603.37,So what -- what --
2015.14-520,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2603.37,2647.975,"The entire idea of a guaranty contract, right, why is a guaranty agreement even enforceable? Is it there is consideration, and the consideration has to do with the fact that credit is going to a third-party, right? And so the guarantor is stepping in and saying, I'm asking for something and I'm getting something when I enter into this contract, and that's the credit will go not to me, but to a third party. So the question I think is, like, why should that be, you know -- just because it's to a third party, the appeal, the request to the application is as to a third party rather than to yourself, why that should make any difference if the question is just what does applicant mean? Applicant doesn't have to be for yourself."
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2647.975,2651.31,"Well, I -- I agree that's the consideration for the guaranty."
2015.14-520,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2762.855,2777.02,"On the -- on the question of the guarantor entering a contract just as the borrower enters a contract, the two contracts are quite different."
2015.14-520,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2823.82,2832.485,"I agree with that, Justice Scalia. And unless the Court has further questions, I would ask that you affirm the decision of the Eighth Circuit."
2015.14-520,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2832.485,2839.175,"Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Duggan, you have four minutes."
2015.14-520,3,62591,john_m_duggan,,2839.175,2850.495,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think the primary answer to talk about, to start with, is these guaranties are not simply guaranties of the performance of the borrower."
2015.14-520,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2880.57,2890.52,Could you ask -- could you respond to counsel's last point? Why would a bank ever decide to give a loan with a spousal guaranty?
2015.14-520,3,62591,john_m_duggan,,2890.52,2891.89,I'm not sure I --
2015.14-520,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2891.89,2893.4,Why would -- why would a bank do that?
2015.14-520,3,62591,john_m_duggan,,2893.4,2903.205,"There's several circumstances. Number one, husbands and wives can come under the regulation safe harbors as joint applicants contemporaneously and say we want joint credit."
2015.14-520,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3041.86,3043.4,"Thank you, Counsel."
2015.14-520,3,62591,john_m_duggan,,3043.4,3043.62,Thank you.
2015.14-520,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3043.62,0.0,The case is submitted.
