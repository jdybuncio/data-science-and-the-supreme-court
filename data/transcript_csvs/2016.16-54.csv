2016.16-54,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.785,"We'll hear argument next in case 16-54, Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions. Mr. Fisher."
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,7.785,43.16,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The key statutory term of the INA in this case is the word ""abuse."" And the Federal statute criminalizing sexual abuse of a minor, as well as the State statutes dealing with the same subject, dictate that sexual relations become abuse only -- on account of age, only when the younger partner in the activity is younger than 16. At the very least, the Federal and State laws that I just mentioned dictate that California statute is well outside of that which Congress would."
2016.16-54,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,43.16,43.23,I'm --
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,43.23,43.72,-- have expected.
2016.16-54,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,43.72,44.49,"I'm sorry, Mr. Fisher."
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,67.01,81.03,"Justice Kagan, what we think is that if you want to give a definition for sexual abuse of a minor, at least in the context of the allegation of abuse being due to age, that 16 would be the appropriate cutoff."
2016.16-54,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,89.57,111.015,"Do you have any further views of what the generic offense is? Are there other elements of the generic offense that you're willing to tell us you think? I mean usually, in these cases, first we define the generic offense, and then we see whether the State statute in question fits within that or doesn't. And so what is the generic offense? It's under 16."
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,112.175,114.125,"There are four elements, Justice Kagan."
2016.16-54,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,176.24,183.275,Suppose that there were no -- that the definition here -- the phrase here had no criminal application.
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,186.82,188.855,Uh-huh.
2016.16-54,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,188.855,192.355,And you're not asking us to overrule Chevron.
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,192.355,193.385,"No, no, no."
2016.16-54,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,193.385,194.055,All right.
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,210.61,211.63,No.
2016.16-54,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,213.82,218.35,"So that -- that is not an ambiguous phrase by itself, ""sexual abuse of a minor""?"
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,218.35,223.85,"Not in the way you've defined ""ambiguity,"" both in the categorical approach cases and for purposes of Chevron."
2016.16-54,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,257.11,264.24,"But you think that if we look at this incredible array of State laws, it becomes clear what Congress intended by ""sexual abuse of a minor""?"
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,264.24,265.87,"Well, we think ""yes"" for two reasons."
2016.16-54,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,289.93,303.0,"Well -- well, before -- before you continue your answer and get into Chevron, why -- suppose that there were -- the Federal statute is the only one on the books."
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,308.86,310.64,"I think that would be a harder case, Justice Kennedy."
2016.16-54,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,328.7,334.58,"But why would you think that, Mr. Fisher? I mean, there -- in this statute, there are loads of cross-references."
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,339.025,341.92,"It's -- it's -- it's a canon, Justice Kagan."
2016.16-54,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,410.22,414.26,So what do we do with Chevron if we think it's ambiguous?
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,414.26,415.08,So --
2016.16-54,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,415.08,416.37,And it's not clear?
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,416.37,418.68,If you think -- I want to make sure I understand the question.
2016.16-54,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,423.16,423.79,Exactly.
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,423.79,424.57,Then you would go --
2016.16-54,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,424.57,426.63,"Or sufficiently unambiguous, to be --"
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,426.63,427.0,Fair enough.
2016.16-54,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,427.0,427.57,-- to be clear.
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,427.57,433.99,Then what I think you would do is have one more set of questions you ask before you ask the traditional Chevron reasonableness questions.
2016.16-54,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,484.66,494.73,"Well, but we've always said, though, that the rule of lenity, or at least most often said that the rule of lenity is something you apply when you've already exhausted the normal tools of statutory interpretation."
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,501.785,505.65,"Well, I think you've said more or less the same thing in the Chevron context, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.16-54,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,526.76,527.82,But I --
2016.16-54,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,527.82,530.7,-- I don't know how the two of them can coexist.
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,554.355,556.51,I think that premise is correct.
2016.16-54,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,568.41,603.825,"Are you suggesting, Mr. Fisher, that if we turn Chevron off, we have to turn lenity on? Couldn't there be a middle ground between the two; in other words, some space where you say, because of this -- the -- the criminal application of this statute, we don't apply ordinary Chevron deference, but at the same time, we don't go straight into the kind of grievous ambiguity that -- that triggers lenity? There's some middle area where the Court gets to decide just what is -- it thinks is the best construction of the statute?"
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,603.825,608.01,"It's hard for me to imagine exactly how that works, but I'm happy with the --"
2016.16-54,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,608.01,616.94,"It works -- it works, if you think that ambiguity doesn't necessarily mean the same thing for Chevron purposes and for lenity purposes."
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,616.94,617.21,I would --
2016.16-54,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,617.21,635.29,"The lenity purposes really demands grievous ambiguity, and but there's some sense in which there's -- there's a of lack clarity, a lack of clear meaning that allows the Court to decide what the best interpretation of the language is."
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,635.29,647.06,"So if that were the situation here, what I would tell the Court is when you do that job as a court, you should take into account for any ambiguity the rule against construing deportation statutes against noncitizens."
2016.16-54,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,648.85,660.03,"I don't really understand that -- that canon, because that canon would suggest that we never give the BIA deference as to its interpretation of this statute."
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,667.86,670.25,"You have in other parts of the INA, Justice Kagan."
2016.16-54,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,691.29,710.79,"Can I take you back to the -- the argument that Chevron isn't appropriate here because the definition applies in both the criminal and the civil context? And that was the point that Judge Sutton made in his dissent, and it has kind of a -- it's an appealing argument when you say it fast."
2016.16-54,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,712.975,730.255,"-- the less sense it makes. Now suppose that a -- there's an ambiguous phrase in an immigration statute, and it applies only in the civil -- it applies only in immigration and has no criminal -- has no criminal applications."
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,748.49,749.24,I think it --
2016.16-54,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,749.24,757.82,I -- I don't see anything odd about having the same phrase interpreted using a different methodology in a civil case and in a criminal case.
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,757.82,766.755,"I think it would go away and, Justice Alito, I just cite this Court's case law to you. Clark against Martinez is the foremost example, but there's Thompson Center Arms Company."
2016.16-54,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,771.91,785.865,"Well -- but I would like to know why it makes sense, so something other than a citation of cases, why would Chevron deference be appropriate up to the point where Congress decides to use the same phrase in a criminal statute and then it disappears."
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,785.865,788.36,Because it would violate the separation of powers.
2016.16-54,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,789.9,790.78,I'm sorry.
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,790.78,791.05,-- similar --
2016.16-54,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,791.05,804.11,"How does -- I -- I -- I -- I'm having some of the difficulty that Justice Alito is having, but just last term we decided a Fair Labor Standards Act case involving car salesmen --"
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,804.11,804.315,Uh-huh.
2016.16-54,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,804.315,815.925,"-- car repairs, that was the dispute. In that Act, a willful violation can be criminally prosecuted."
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,840.615,841.43,It's --
2016.16-54,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,841.43,845.15,-- in part or in whole? Almost all of them do.
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,847.19,849.42,I'm not sure empirically that's correct.
2016.16-54,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,870.675,870.91,But --
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,870.91,871.02,Here --
2016.16-54,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,871.02,874.225,-- most of the regulations are interpretations of the statute.
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,874.225,878.26,"That's right, but Congress has created the crime of violating the regulation."
2016.16-54,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,889.34,893.665,"No, but it is -- but it's why I think people are discussing it and I may have --"
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,893.665,894.0,Yeah.
2016.16-54,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,894.0,895.2,You don't have to accept my view.
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,979.55,988.285,"What -- what I think and what we're asking for today, if the Court reached the question, is for a very small exception to Chevron."
2016.16-54,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1006.78,1007.11,I'm sorry.
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1012.605,1013.35,The reason --
2016.16-54,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1013.35,1022.945,I -- I -- most of the crimes that are -- are set out in regulation almost largely parrot the statutory language.
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1033.54,1036.03,"So two -- so two things about that situation, Justice Sotomayor."
2016.16-54,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1052.07,1053.555,But that's if its reading unreasonable.
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1053.555,1064.29,"Almost all -- that's right. Almost all the examples you're thinking of are ones where Congress has delegated the authority to create crimes through the regulatory process. Now, you don't have to reach that question in this case."
2016.16-54,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1138.65,1142.545,Multi-jurisdictional survey would yield age 16?
2016.16-54,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1142.545,1148.465,"Justice Ginsburg, there are two -- there would be two possible answers to your multi-jurisdictional survey."
2016.16-54,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1407.365,1415.125,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kedem."
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1415.125,1439.905,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress has charged the Attorney General with responsibility to administer the INA to conduct removal proceedings and to render controlling interpretations of the statute within those proceedings. In this case, the Board of Immigration Appeals exercised that authority in a manner both reasonable and consistent with the statute, and for that reason, should be afforded deference."
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1484.36,1494.93,"Well, Mr. Kedem, you don't disagree, do you, with the premise that the first thing that we should do is to define the generic crime; is that right?"
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1494.93,1495.545,That's correct.
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1498.35,1498.5,Okay.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1511.905,1513.8,That's the first argument that we make in our brief.
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1513.8,1514.01,Yeah.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1518.25,1518.51,Sure.
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1518.51,1533.625,"In other words, you're just saying, well, it's whatever the States consider illegal, when the whole idea of a generic crime is that it's not just anything that's illegal, it's the prototypical case, even though that differs from what some States do."
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1533.625,1533.97,Sure.
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1543.875,1544.45,Yes.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1547.47,1547.64,Sure.
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1547.64,1550.325,-- and saying whatever a State does goes.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1555.55,1559.35,"I think not, because what we're dealing here is not one crime."
2016.16-54,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1595.29,1598.08,"Now -- now, it looked to Federal law itself 2243(a)"
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1606.605,1607.22,So --
2016.16-54,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1607.22,1609.89,"The same term, sexual abuse of a minor."
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1609.89,1620.14,"A couple -- couple of thoughts about that provision. First of all, it was adopted more than a decade before the term ""sexual abuse of a minor"" was added to the INA's definition of aggravated felony."
2016.16-54,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1643.11,1653.16,"Can you think of a definition from -- from an evidentiary statute, a statute designed to protect children who testify in court."
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1656.17,1670.895,"So I -- I don't think it's accurate to characterize the board's decision as treating that as the definition. And I think if you look at the board's opinion, what it said is that is a pretty common-sense definition for the type of activity that might be covered."
2016.16-54,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1722.89,1727.185,Why isn't an 18-year-old in the same age group as a 21-year-old?
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1727.185,1728.57,I don't think we're dealing with 18-year-olds.
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1734.61,1738.55,It's really like a freshman in college going out with a junior in college.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1738.55,1743.3,It is true that sometimes there are 17-year-olds who are in college.
2016.16-54,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1778.44,1780.01,"It's quite complicated, which I agree."
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1801.495,1809.51,"It's right with this one caveat, which is that the definition of aggravated felony actually came much earlier and has been amended a number of times."
2016.16-54,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1809.51,1813.45,"But what happened at that time is they stuck in the words ""sexual abuse of a minor."""
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1813.45,1814.54,That's correct.
2016.16-54,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1814.54,1815.02,Okay.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1866.29,1872.87,"First of all, if they intended to do so, it would have been very easy to do what they've done in other provisions, which is to include a cross reference."
2016.16-54,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1872.87,1873.745,Oddly enough --
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1873.745,1874.45,At least --
2016.16-54,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1874.45,1879.71,"-- I can list 10 or 15, including deceit, rape, murder, a whole bunch in this statute --"
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1879.71,1880.17,Even Petitioner --
2016.16-54,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1880.17,1882.06,-- which don't use cross references.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1882.06,1888.32,Even Petitioner does not claim that sexual abuse of a minor is defined entirely by the bounds of the Federal provision.
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1911.46,1916.4,"Mr. Kedem, you have here -- you have a federal statute."
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1929.85,1931.28,"No, certainly not."
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1931.28,1939.665,"You think it's unambiguous, this kind of pragmatic construction about -- what did you say -- like power differentials --"
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1939.665,1940.65,"No, no."
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1961.12,1962.98,I -- I guess I don't understand that.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1985.385,1999.31,"So I think I would just step back to say that when this Court is giving content to the Federal provision of the first step of the categorical approach, it is engaging in a normal case of statutory interpretation which brings to bear --"
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1999.31,1999.88,"Well, I'm asking --"
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1999.88,2000.24,-- all of the --
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2000.24,2001.96,-- about normal statutory interpretation.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2001.96,2002.44,The normal --
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2002.44,2012.37,"The normal statutory interpretation get you to think that out of, like -- out of our heads pops 18 plus a three-year differential --"
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2012.37,2012.56,I see.
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2014.4,2022.26,"-- looking at -- as opposed to looking at 30-plus States, the Model Penal Code, and the Federal statute, which all define it differently."
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2022.26,2022.855,Sure.
2016.16-54,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2051.8,2060.86,And this quest for the -- the generic offense of sexual abuse of a minor seems to me to be a -- a meaningless quest.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2101.07,2102.825,"We agree with that, Justice Alito."
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2108.24,2109.16,"Mr. Kedem, can I say that --"
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2109.16,2109.26,Sure.
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2109.26,2111.515,-- I think you disagree with two parts of that.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2118.16,2118.65,That's correct.
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2118.65,2122.5,"So Justice Alito was suggesting that, in this case, we shouldn't do that at all."
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2129.84,2130.105,Correct.
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2130.105,2133.495,"But you said to me, even without deference, you win."
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2146.28,2166.01,"So maybe the best way to answer that question is to describe what the government thinks is the relationship between the two arguments that we make in the brief. The term ""sexual abuse of a minor"" would naturally support the interpretation that we offer in the first section of our brief to cover all sexual activity directed at a minor under the age of 18 years old."
2016.16-54,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2191.32,2192.77,What about an application --
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2192.77,2193.01,But because --
2016.16-54,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2193.01,2195.085,What about application of the rule of lenity?
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2195.085,2215.635,"So I think application of the rule of lenity does coexist with Chevron in the following sense: I think, first of all, before the board, the board has recognized that lenity can come into play, but it has conceived of it in the same limited way that this Court has; namely, that you don't apply lenity simply because the statute can be read in more than one way."
2016.16-54,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2226.41,2230.89,So you necessarily apply Chevron before you apply the rule of lenity?
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2230.89,2237.49,"I think -- I think that you do, but I think there's still work for lenity to do even after applying Chevron."
2016.16-54,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2289.73,2302.13,I can understand Chevron in the context of an agency that has special expertise in regulating the environment or the forest service or fisheries or nuclear power.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2307.5,2316.11,"So, first of all, Justice Kennedy, I think it's important to orient ourselves around the fact that this is a civil statute that's being applied in a civil context."
2016.16-54,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2354.615,2364.06,But why is INS in any better position to make that determination than the American Bar Association or the forest service?
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2364.06,2374.09,"So I think that the board exercises delegated authority from the Attorney General, who is administering the scheme in an administrative capacity."
2016.16-54,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2396.96,2410.47,"What he's saying -- I think what the question is, is this: There are many agencies -- Social Security -- that have statutes that are incredibly detailed and have to do rather directly with how this program is being administered."
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2410.47,2410.865,Sure.
2016.16-54,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2410.865,2415.26,And they see some words over here in Part 1 on page 3860.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2429.945,2430.17,Sure.
2016.16-54,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2430.17,2434.645,But you've just listed things that we seem to be able to know just as well as they.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2434.645,2451.48,"So, Justice Breyer, one thing to keep in mind is that the aggravated felony definition is a spine that runs throughout the INA and determines a whole range of administrative consequences, not merely whether a person is removable, but whether they're eligible, for instance, for cancelation of removal --"
2016.16-54,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2451.48,2451.71,Yeah.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2451.71,2485.2,"-- asylum, certain detention consequences, voluntary departure, readmission. And in this case we're dealing with a delegation of interpretive authority that is not merely implicit in the sort of general sense Chevron talks about it, but an express provision 8 U.S.C. 1103(a), which says that the Attorney General not only gets to conduct removal proceedings, but gets to render interpretations in those proceedings that are, quote, ""controlling."" And this Court has relied in cases like Aguirre-Aguirre and Negusie on that fact."
2016.16-54,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2485.2,2485.44,Okay.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2495.3,2495.58,Sure.
2016.16-54,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2495.58,2499.38,"And you said one, because there's no cross-reference, so I got that one."
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2500.56,2500.9,Two --
2016.16-54,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2500.9,2506.52,"-- it would be because if you go read the thing, 1140 -- is it 1143 or whatever -- 2243 --"
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2506.52,2507.88,Uh-huh.
2016.16-54,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2507.88,2512.195,"-- if I go read that, I'll see that there are things that couldn't possibly apply. That was your second."
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2514.97,2523.885,"So if there was a third, it might have been that a 16-year age of consent and 4-year age differential would disqualify statutes from most States."
2016.16-54,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2590.36,2593.59,"Well, that's a good reason to look at to 2243."
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2593.59,2610.795,"Well, 2243 would disqualify even more because, again, it requires a 16-year-old age of consent, a 4-year age differential, and it includes a reasonable mistake of age defense that most States don't have. I think it's also actually quite difficult to determine what is or isn't an outlier."
2016.16-54,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2667.72,2670.72,There's one question about your interpretation.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2674.98,2678.205,That -- that is under the first argument that the government makes.
2016.16-54,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2686.28,2692.125,And -- and you -- but you say that sexual abuse means illegal sexual contact.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2692.125,2712.125,"Illegal sexual conduct, usually, and the word ""minor"" added to the statutory provision, sort of reinforces that we're just talking about minors here. So, in addition to the problems that I've just been discussing with this multi-jurisdictional survey and looking for outliers, it would also pull the Court into a number of very difficult line-drawing problems."
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2736.18,2747.165,"So, Mr. Kedem, Mr. Fisher said and I just want to make sure that this is right, that you no longer rely on the statute that the BIA relied on; is that correct?"
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2747.165,2751.8,I think -- I think the BIA itself relied on it only in a very general way.
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2753.02,2753.15,Okay.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2774.33,2777.95,So we treat this as an ordinary case of statutory interpretation.
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2778.18,2779.01,I'm asking for ordinary --
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2779.01,2781.36,We -- we rely on the dictionary definitions --
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2781.36,2781.68,The term --
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2781.68,2782.68,-- the legislative history.
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2784.75,2793.32,"So the -- the dictionary definition that you pull out is illegal sex acts performed against a minor by a parent, guardian, relative, or acquaintance."
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2794.7,2795.265,That is.
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2795.265,2795.74,Yeah.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2799.78,2800.77,"No, that's not right."
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2812.28,2812.8,"No, no, no, no, no."
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2816.085,2817.79,That's what this does --
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2817.79,2818.15,That's right.
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2824.98,2826.45,Okay.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2828.62,2844.09,"We point to legislative history, which is relatively sparse, but I think it strongly indicates that Congress wanted to get a lot tougher on crimes involving children and to context in which other INA provisions talk about minors as being people under the age of 18."
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2844.09,2846.25,What are -- what are those?
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2846.25,2849.99,So we cite two of them in -- in the -- in this -- in our brief.
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2858.46,2860.75,One -- one's -- one deals with the rights of child witnesses.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2864.59,2864.85,That's right.
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2864.85,2865.31,Are those the two?
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2865.31,2865.92,Those are two.
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2865.92,2870.655,"So those two, which really have nothing to do with the generic meaning of sexual abuse of a minor."
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2870.655,2871.09,That's correct.
2016.16-54,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2871.09,2878.89,"A single dictionary -- a single dictionary definition, and some legislative history that even you indicate is sparse."
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2878.89,2880.325,I -- I think that that's accurate.
2016.16-54,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2888.49,2902.205,"Is it your understanding anything other than -- if a stranger does anything to a minor other than commit a rape, then that would not be sexual abuse of a minor because the person wouldn't be a relative or an acquaintance?"
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2902.205,2904.84,I'm -- I'm not -- I'm not sure I understand the question.
2016.16-54,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2904.84,2911.57,"I thought your definition was it had to be a relative -- parent, relative, or acquaintance; is that right?"
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2911.57,2913.75,I think those are probably what it targets.
2016.16-54,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2917.91,2919.16,If -- of course.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2937.08,2937.67,So I -- I --
2016.16-54,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2937.67,2938.65,That's my question.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2938.65,2941.07,So I -- I think it would apply in that case being an acquaintance.
2016.16-54,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2941.07,2942.53,"It would, but there's no acquaintance."
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2942.53,2943.11,But if --
2016.16-54,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2943.11,2944.225,Unless everyone is.
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2944.225,2950.305,If -- if I could turn to the question of deference in this case.
2016.16-54,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3016.43,3030.25,Don't you have the problem that somebody in another State that did the same thing that this defendant was -- this person was convicted of would be no crime in another State?
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,3030.25,3030.58,Sure.
2016.16-54,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3030.58,3031.12,So --
2016.16-54,1,56065,allon_kedem,,3031.12,3033.63,That -- that's true whenever you have the categorical approach.
2016.16-54,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3176.735,3180.894,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fisher, seven minutes."
2016.16-54,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3180.894,3182.1,Thank you.
2016.16-54,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3186.015,3200.56,"Four topics. First, as to multi-jurisdictional surveys, the cases the government talks about where the Court has not conducted those kinds of surveys are cases where the Court did not have to define a generic offense."
