1985.84-1972,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.356,We will hear arguments first this morning in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation against Philadelphia Gear Corporation.
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,12.729,16.062,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court."
1985.84-1972,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,125.348,132.173,"Well, Mr. Rothfeld, are you suggesting in your description of this note that it was not therefore a promissory note within the language of the statute?"
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,132.173,133.673,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1972,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,133.673,137.857,You are saying that this particular note was not a promissory note within the language of the statute?
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,137.857,140.258,"That is correct, although--"
1985.84-1972,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,140.258,147.053,Is that because there was a side understanding setting forth certain contingencies?
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,147.053,150.265,"--Essentially that is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-1972,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,150.265,163.172,"Does it make any difference at all whether the note bore interest or not, or was in fact easily negotiable because of its lack of interest?"
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,163.172,175.55,"I think that the note here functioned simply as an elaborate reimbursement agreement, but the note didn't represent any actual liability on the part of the maker of the note."
1985.84-1972,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,175.55,178.032,"Well, on its face, of course, it did."
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,182.997,202.098,"It could have been, arguably could have been negotiated by the holder of the note on its face, although given the contingencies attached to the note, it is difficult... the value of the note would have been practically nil."
1985.84-1972,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,202.098,205.871,--in due course.
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,216.279,219.421,"Well, I think there are two points to make in response to that."
1985.84-1972,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,233.67,236.031,"Well, you are not a holder in due course if you do that."
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,236.031,239.574,"--Well, that is true."
1985.84-1972,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,247.471,249.251,How about someone who took without knowledge?
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,249.251,251.842,"Someone who took without knowledge arguably would be, although--"
1985.84-1972,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,251.842,263.46,And what about if Orion wasn't paid and collected on the letter of credit in the bank?
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,267.142,268.972,--That is true.
1985.84-1972,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,268.972,269.804,On the note.
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,280.42,283.302,"Again, let me give two responses to that."
1985.84-1972,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,297.802,299.705,Why does that make it not a note?
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,299.705,302.797,It was labeled a note.
1985.84-1972,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,308.521,313.834,"Exactly, and I still don't understand why it is that just by calling it a reimbursement--"
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,313.834,325.17,"Well, to be termed a note within the meaning of the statute, I think you have to look at what precisely Congress had in mind in drafting the statute in the way that it did."
1985.84-1972,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,345.103,357.324,"--Would you be here arguing if this note didn't have the conditions attached to it that were a freely negotiable note, like any other note, and there were no side agreements at all, just a promissory note?"
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,357.324,359.595,"No, if there--"
1985.84-1972,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,359.595,360.457,Would you be here making this argument?
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,360.457,361.458,"--No, we wouldn't, Your Honor."
1985.84-1972,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,371.704,376.709,Regardless of whether Orion had given a lien or any backup security for the note?
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,376.709,377.848,That is correct.
1985.84-1972,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,387.315,394.56,So for you the whole case turns on whether there is a side contingency agreement?
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,394.56,407.287,"--For us, the case turns on whether this was a... I suppose that is right, Justice O'Connor, whether or not this is a contingent or uncontingent instrument."
1985.84-1972,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,408.209,410.49,Did the conditions appear on the face of the note?
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,410.49,418.537,"--No, they didn't, Your Honor, although the Court of Appeals found as a matter of fact that it was in fact a controlling agreement between Penn Square--"
1985.84-1972,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,418.537,437.718,So this case doesn't turn upon a letter of credit on whether this letter of credit was the kind of a letter of credit that should... that the FDIC should pay on.
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,437.718,438.71,"--That is correct, Justice White."
1985.84-1972,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,456.992,460.313,Has this always been your position throughout this litigation?
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,460.313,462.014,--It has been our position.
1985.84-1972,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,462.014,475.084,"Mr. Rothfeld, in the question presented in the petition for writ of certiorari, the question is whether a standby letter of credit is a deposit within the meaning of 12 USC for purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation."
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,482.127,488.013,"That I think is done simply for purposes of clarity, Justice Rehnquist, because standby letters of credit--"
1985.84-1972,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,488.013,495.968,"But you just told me it didn't make any difference whether there was security backing up the note, that it made no difference."
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,495.968,498.59,"--No, that's... I should make myself clear."
1985.84-1972,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,531.001,553.123,"In looking at the statute, the relevant statute, it says the unpaid balance of money or its equivalent up in the first part of the sentence, and then it says provided that, without limiting the generality of the term money or its equivalent."
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,582.572,585.286,"I think you do, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-1972,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,595.783,606.359,"Well, is the person obtaining such credit or instrument... who is the person obtaining the credit or instrument?"
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,607.531,612.513,"Orion has attained it for the benefit of respondent, Philadelphia Gear."
1985.84-1972,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,615.157,622.741,"Well, is it the person obtaining the promissory note or the person obtaining the letter of credit referred to in that phrase?"
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,622.741,626.264,"Well, the bank would be obtaining the promissory note."
1985.84-1972,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,635.409,645.495,"Yes, but I am just asking whether the language in the statute refers to the person obtaining the promissory note or the person obtaining the letter of credit."
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,645.495,654.262,"That, I think, refers to the bank, the bank receiving the promissory note in exchange for the letter of credit."
1985.84-1972,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,813.498,821.982,I don't see why then on that rationale why it would make any difference if this note was an ordinary negotiable promissory note.
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,821.982,834.779,I think what is crucial is whether or not the note is as good as money to the depositor at the time that he finally gives it to the bank in exchange for one of these bank instruments.
1985.84-1972,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,846.637,871.735,"But I just don't think that reads the statute very accurately, because up to the proviso it talks about money or its equivalent, and then it says provided that without limiting the generality of the term money any such encounters must be regarded as evidencing the receipt of the equivalent of money when credit or issuing checks... in exchange for checks or for a promissory note."
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,877.348,905.307,"I think that it is fairly clear from the background of this deposit definition that the FDIC put that proviso in its original regulatory definition of deposit, and Congress borrowed it and put it in 1813(L)(1) simply to make it clear that deposits include things in addition to cash, that anything of value that is given to and entrusted to a bank that is put at risk and is lost when the bank fails is entitled to the benefits of deposit insurance."
1985.84-1972,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,936.457,938.347,May I ask this question?
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,955.58,970.11,"Again, I think, Justice Powell, that it would be funded only if... well, that you would have to look at the note itself and decide whether or not the note created an uncontingent liability, whether or not--"
1985.84-1972,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,970.11,995.935,"Assume the note on its face was not contingent, but it was funded in the sense of security having been provided rather than having a deposit in equal amount of the note or perhaps getting a government bond or something that was absolutely a gold-plated security, it gave something that was perhaps speculative or at least subject to a good deal of litigation before you could realize on it."
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,998.787,1004.741,"--In our view, the question would be whether the letter of credit rather than the note is funded."
1985.84-1972,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1022.052,1036.802,"But you get back to whether there was any basic value in the deposit, don't you, as to whether or not the letter of credit was funded by anything that made it the equivalent of money."
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1036.802,1039.133,That is correct.
1985.84-1972,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1040.375,1042.015,"--question of fact, I would suppose."
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1042.015,1056.067,"--Our view is that if the letter of credit is uncontingent, and creates an absolute liability which to the depositor is as good as cash, that that is enough to make it the equivalent of money within the meaning of the statute."
1985.84-1972,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1114.554,1123.121,"Well, the argument in this case is that this one was funded by the promissory note."
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1135.277,1137.851,"No, I don't think there is, Justice White."
1985.84-1972,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1137.851,1138.321,No.
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1146.418,1148.178,That is true.
1985.84-1972,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1152.292,1158.346,You are saying the reality does not support that argument.
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1158.346,1165.198,"That is absolutely correct, Your Honor, and again, I can provide an example which I think may make our position clear."
1985.84-1972,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1260.662,1267.648,Have there been other claims like this which the FDIC has routinely rejected?
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1267.648,1275.955,I am not aware of any claims for insurance under such a letter.
1985.84-1972,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1281.639,1291.614,But you are aware of no examples like this where they had a claim that has been made for the recovery of insurance which has been denied?
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1291.614,1318.402,"Other than this litigation and the currently ongoing litigation in the Sixth Circuit, I am not aware of any claim in which that has arisen, although in the 1950's, even before the statutory definition was put... well, even before the proviso was put in the statute, the District Court of New York recognized and endorsed the FDIC's view that it is only when the depositor puts his money at risk to back a letter of credit that the letter is insured."
1985.84-1972,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1326.998,1336.132,"If I understand your argument correctly, it is that because this instrument may be negotiable does not mean that it is the equivalent of hard money."
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1337.845,1351.093,"That is absolutely correct, Your Honor, whether or not this instrument was negotiable, it was not an immediate obligation of the maker of the instrument, and the maker of the instrument was not liable to pay out any funds."
1985.84-1972,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1387.978,1391.461,May I ask a question about... does the record tell us what happened to Orion?
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1391.461,1393.542,"--It does not, Your Honor."
1985.84-1972,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1396.905,1402.178,"It doesn't tell us whether the bank made any attempt to collect on this note against Orion, does it?"
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1402.178,1404.649,The bank did not attempt--
1985.84-1972,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1404.649,1407.17,"I mean, or the liquidator after the bank."
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1407.17,1407.922,"--No, it does not."
1985.84-1972,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1407.922,1417.968,"Mr. Rothfeld, I understand there is a bill pending in Congress to eliminate from the definition all letters of credit."
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1421.358,1424.62,"Well, again, let me make two points in response to that, Justice Blackmun."
1985.84-1972,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1446.314,1453.39,May I come back to what constitutes an unfunded letter of credit?
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1472.812,1480.349,"Well, our view is that there must be a deposit either of funds or of the equivalent of funds."
1985.84-1972,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1480.349,1498.05,"Well, you can fund in various ways, but you are saying that the only acceptable funding based on 50 years of history and practice is where a deposit in the amount of a letter of credit is available to make sure it is paid."
1985.84-1972,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1498.679,1503.363,"That is correct, Justice Powell, and let me expand on it just a little bit."
1985.84-1972,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1538.265,1538.996,Very well.
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,1544.509,1554.797,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to begin, if I may, with an answer to a question Justice O'Connor posed to the Solicitor General."
1985.84-1972,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1633.698,1657.724,"Mr. Slattery, do you think that the FDIC's long-standing decision not to charge insurance premiums, in effect, for unfunded or for standby letters of credit constitutes an administrative interpretation of the Act which we owe some deference in resolving this question?"
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,1657.724,1659.744,"--I do not, Your Honor."
1985.84-1972,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1699.321,1706.266,"But it has to be a decision, in effect, not to collect insurance premiums."
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,1706.266,1708.117,"--As I say, Your Honor, it is problematic."
1985.84-1972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1846.047,1848.04,You mean no distinction between funded and unfunded?
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,1848.04,1850.15,"--That is... pardon me, Your Honor?"
1985.84-1972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1850.15,1854.273,You say there is no distinction between funded and unfunded drawn in the regulations?
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,1854.273,1855.533,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1865.63,1876.186,"Of course, you don't need to convince us that completely unfunded letters of credit are insured, do you?"
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,1884.582,1892.768,--Your Honor asked counsel for the FDIC if it could not be considered funded by having been issued in exchange for the promissory note.
1985.84-1972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1904.017,1905.147,--Is that your primary argument?
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,1919.596,1922.527,"--I would not say it would be insured in that event, Your Honor."
1985.84-1972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1924.7,1928.113,You really are... you are resting on the fact that a note was given.
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,1928.113,1929.392,"--Yes, I am, Your Honor."
1985.84-1972,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1942.971,1946.323,"Well, the statute refers to promissory note."
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,1949.766,1950.487,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1972,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1950.487,1973.492,"But what the SG in effect is saying is that the term promissory note should be defined in terms of federal law, not ordinary state commercial law, that promissory note has a federal definition, and in this context that federal definition means there can't be side contingencies attached to it."
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,1975.532,1978.835,I disagree with that position advanced by the FDIC.
1985.84-1972,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2051.243,2056.496,"Mr. Slattery, I wonder if we are not getting into kind of a semantic dispute."
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2082.606,2083.427,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2103.479,2114.747,But I suppose there is no denying that there was no liability on this note unless the bank paid out some money to the holder of the letter of credit.
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2114.747,2116.199,"There is no denying that, Your Honor."
1985.84-1972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2117.021,2124.654,May I ask you... excuse me.
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2141.594,2149.852,"That is a good question, Justice Stevens, and it raises the fact pattern, incidentally, that is before the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Allen versus FDIC."
1985.84-1972,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2155.575,2158.387,"Assuming for a moment it is still... is it a deposit, do you think?"
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2158.387,2160.098,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1985.84-1972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2175.479,2184.023,"Well, but the note... this kind of a note in this context didn't give the bank anything that it wouldn't have had without the note."
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2184.023,2187.015,I don't believe... perhaps--
1985.84-1972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2187.015,2199.394,"But the bank had paid out... issued the letter of credit, unfunded letter of credit, and the paydown on the letter could have recovered its payments from its customer."
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2199.394,2203.556,"--That is true as a conceptual matter, Your Honor."
1985.84-1972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2203.556,2211.563,"Well, and so he sues the customer, and in the one case he has got this promissory note."
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2218.409,2219.701,"The difference is very important, Your Honor."
1985.84-1972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2237.211,2239.151,Let's just talk about this note and this case.
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2239.151,2239.452,--Yes Your Honor.
1985.84-1972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2239.452,2245.035,What did it give the bank that the bank wouldn't have had under the Uniform Commercial Code?
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2245.035,2262.697,"I have the note reproduced in the joint appendix at Pages 27 and 30, and there are specific remedies the specifics of which I cannot recall at this time, but which go far beyond the mere statutory obligation of Orion to reimburse."
1985.84-1972,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2274.514,2277.807,"May I just follow up, because I just want to be sure I understand your position."
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2287.074,2288.494,"--No, Your Honor, that is not correct."
1985.84-1972,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2295.409,2300.292,But your client didn't make... you don't claim your client gave anything of value to the bank.
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2300.292,2301.243,"No, I do not, Your Honor."
1985.84-1972,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2301.243,2305.446,"The only deposit that has been made, if there is a deposit, is the delivery of the promissory note."
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2306.157,2315.254,"Your Honor, I believe that question in a sense presupposes the rather narrow view of deposit that the FDIC has articulated here today."
1985.84-1972,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2428.569,2432.25,Let me pursue a thought I didn't quite finish on.
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2438.785,2439.886,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1972,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2439.886,2446.748,And must it not be a promissory note upon which the person obtaining the credit is primarily or secondarily liable?
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2446.748,2447.7,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1972,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2447.7,2454.495,So that is it not essential to your claim that Orion was primarily or secondarily liable on the note at the time it was delivered to the bank?
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2454.495,2455.715,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1972,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2455.715,2456.856,"And it wasn't, was it?"
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2457.715,2464.861,I think that the enforceability of the note should not be confused with the question of--
1985.84-1972,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2464.861,2466.283,--Whether it created a present obligation.
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2466.283,2467.252,--Exactly.
1985.84-1972,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2468.795,2470.024,"It didn't create any obligation, did it?"
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2470.024,2477.449,--It created the obligation on Orion's part to reimburse the bank for any drafts that were paid on the letter of credit.
1985.84-1972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2481.311,2485.533,"And it was the only one that was liable on the note, primarily or secondarily."
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2485.533,2488.025,Orion was the only one that was liable on the note.
1985.84-1972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2489.327,2494.092,How can you say it is liable on the note when the note gives rise to no liability?
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2496.293,2498.213,"I think an example may help to answer that question, Your Honor."
1985.84-1972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2559.314,2568.781,Would the case be different if instead of a promissory note there was just a long written agreement describing all the contingencies pursuant to which the letter of credit were issued?
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2568.781,2570.391,"It might very well be, Your Honor."
1985.84-1972,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2570.391,2574.943,Even though it created the same kind of contingent liability?
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2574.943,2594.627,"Possibly, and that raises the very good point that Congress drew some bright lines where it in effect wrote this insurance policy in 1960, and that, I believe, is the reason for some of the... what appear at first blush to be anomalies in the statute right now."
1985.84-1972,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2612.68,2614.71,May I ask this question?
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2622.057,2623.736,"I would say they did not, Your Honor."
1985.84-1972,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2623.736,2624.507,Did not?
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2627.509,2630.021,"No, it did not, Your Honor."
1985.84-1972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2696.383,2705.459,Do you agree with the Solicitor General that the FDIC for half a century has consistently disagreed with the position you take today?
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2705.459,2707.512,"No, Your Honor, I do not."
1985.84-1972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2707.512,2711.132,Is there any evidence one way or the other on that in the record?
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2711.132,2714.394,There is no evidence in the record.
1985.84-1972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2745.816,2755.772,"But it is true that no premiums have been collected by FDIC on notes that were held to be unfunded, whatever that means?"
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2755.772,2757.144,"That is true, Your Honor."
1985.84-1972,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2833.713,2840.248,Is there an industry practice to issue unqualified promissory notes to back up a letter of credit?
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2843.661,2847.362,"I do not know the answer to that question, Justice Stevens."
1985.84-1972,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2871.377,2878.663,"Well, I guess it is just possible that Penn Square Bank had some looser banking practices than one might normally find."
1985.84-1972,1,26093,gerald_f_slattery,,2878.663,2889.89,"I would note in response to that question, Your Honor, that the bank officer who executed this letter of credit refused to testify at trial, citing the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination."
1985.84-1972,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3158.075,3161.658,"Mr. Rothfeld, do you have anything further?"
1985.84-1972,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3161.658,3165.732,"A couple of points, Your Honor, which I will try to make quick."
1985.84-1972,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3184.454,3192.519,"Is the note that we are talking about, is that the note that appears at Page 27 of the joint appendix?"
1985.84-1972,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3192.519,3204.438,"That is correct, Your Honor, which... and the note is characterized explicitly as a backup note to the letter of credit, which clearly indicates that it is to be drawn upon only when the letter of credit is itself drawn upon."
1985.84-1972,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3213.082,3223.981,"On that point, what is your response to his argument that there are a lot of things that the term deposit includes that are not what an old-fashion note of deposit is?"
1985.84-1972,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3230.446,3233.407,"--Well, I should make two points in response to that, Your Honor."
1985.84-1972,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3261.946,3277.706,"But they all suggest that the purpose of this statute was to extend credit to a number of bank creditors for whom no deposit in the old-fashioned sense had been made, that he fits into that general class, and therefore fits into the overall Congressional purpose."
1985.84-1972,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3279.436,3282.748,"Again, I think there are several points to make in response to that."
1985.84-1972,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3317.162,3329.311,"Well, and do you say an unconditional note would qualify for insurance?"
1985.84-1972,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3329.311,3331.482,"That is correct, Justice White."
1985.84-1972,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3359.199,3374.048,"Let's assume that the bank hadn't failed, but there was some payment on the letter of credit by the bank, and then they call on the customer to pay."
1985.84-1972,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3384.685,3389.678,"--Under the terms of the note they would, although it is not clear what the side agreement in this case would have provided for."
1985.84-1972,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3407.811,3409.273,But is that right?
1985.84-1972,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3421.751,3439.333,"Well, again, the particulars of the agreement between Orion and the bank aren't clear for the record, but to the extent that the note would have... to the extent the bank could have drawn on the note for reimbursement only for what it has paid out, again, it is simply getting reimbursement for its own funds that it has paid out."
1985.84-1972,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3442.605,3443.725,I see.
1985.84-1972,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3448.529,3449.768,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1972,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3453.341,3456.653,"Thank you, gentlemen."
