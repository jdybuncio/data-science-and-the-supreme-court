1988.87-6431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.022,"We'll hear argument now in No. 87-6431, Wayne T. Schmuck v. United States."
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,11.072,11.656,Steinberg.
1988.87-6431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,11.656,12.541,Steinberg.
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,14.926,17.795,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-6431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,85.253,90.574,Judge Crabb let the case go to the jury and then granted judgment of acquittal after they returned their verdict.
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,90.574,92.407,"Yes, in the Galloway case."
1988.87-6431,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,188.97,196.509,How long a period of time did this odometer scheme go on as established in the indictment and as established at trial?
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,196.509,198.143,"About two years, Your Honor."
1988.87-6431,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,199.278,207.765,"We'll, isn't the government going to tell us in its part of the argument that the mails were really necessary for the scheme to continue this long?"
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,207.765,222.042,"--Well, it seems to me that if in a single instance the mailing of the title documents doesn't suffice to make it mail fraud, the multiplication of the instances doesn't change anything."
1988.87-6431,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,229.047,236.051,"Well, a mail fraud can be a long-term scheme involving multiple acts, can it not?"
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,236.051,253.746,"Well, Justice Kennedy, the core prohibition of the mail fraud statute, as I think was well-analyzed in McNally, is to prohibit mailings which somehow alter the situation to the benefit of the person committing the fraud."
1988.87-6431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,267.237,268.221,Why didn't they lull anybody?
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,282.263,284.698,"--Justice Scalia, my client gave good title to those cars."
1988.87-6431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,320.738,326.859,Wasn't passing good title to the car an essential part of his scheme?
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,340.535,352.009,"--Well, the reason that there had to be a title registration mailed was because the state has set up a scheme for title registration in order to preserve a record."
1988.87-6431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,369.888,378.577,"But... but if there had been no mailing in any given case in which your client participated, he would have had problems in the future, wouldn't he?"
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,378.577,385.914,--But how could the fact that he had tampered with the odometers possibly affect whether the title registered or not.
1988.87-6431,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,400.09,407.311,Was there any evidence that the sale of the cars was facilitated by the lower mileage?
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,407.311,411.548,--The cars were sold for a higher price because of the lower mileage.
1988.87-6431,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,416.267,418.469,"Well, then isn't that part of the scheme?"
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,418.469,421.171,"It's part of the scheme to sell the cars for more money, yes."
1988.87-6431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,433.894,443.869,"If... if your point is that the... that the fraud, the misstatement of fact, has to be contained in the document that's mailed... is that the point because that can't be right?"
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,443.869,444.269,No.
1988.87-6431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,468.985,475.99,Suppose your client had mailed the automobile title to the used car dealer instead of handing it to him.
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,483.56,493.433,"I don't think so, Justice Scalia, because I don't think that the provision of good title was at all affected by the fraudulent odometer."
1988.87-6431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,509.961,511.929,But... but you're now confirming what you before denied.
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,517.65,518.033,--No.
1988.87-6431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,518.033,518.85,Because I read the statute that way.
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,528.189,529.541,"No, Justice Scalia."
1988.87-6431,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,568.0,578.289,"Well, I... I... I take it that if the dealer had mailed your client the money in the mail for each car, there would have been a fraud?"
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,578.289,581.574,--Well--
1988.87-6431,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,581.574,582.76,"I mean, we can't get any more--"
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,582.76,583.026,--I think that case--
1988.87-6431,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,583.026,583.643,--raw than that.
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,583.643,584.293,--I think that case--
1988.87-6431,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,584.293,588.228,"And if you say that doesn't have anything to do with turning the odometer back, we get back to the same question."
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,591.263,602.654,"--Justice Kennedy, I think the example you cite is more akin to Pereira where the $35,000 bank check was mailed from one bank to another for collection before it was paid."
1988.87-6431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,617.331,618.949,"May I ask you a question, Mr. Steinberg?"
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,632.173,634.692,My client's would have been successful.
1988.87-6431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,636.527,637.144,For how long?
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,637.144,639.077,Because he got his money before the dealers resold the car.
1988.87-6431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,639.077,642.429,"Once it would have, but for two years could he have kept going if they kept every time--"
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,642.429,646.166,"If the dealers had been willing to accept the loss of throwing the title outs, yes."
1988.87-6431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,650.285,652.737,"--You don't really think there are any dealers who are that dumb, do you?"
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,653.437,653.804,--No.
1988.87-6431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,660.759,666.996,And isn't it equally obvious that the scheme could not have persisted for two years had there been no mailings?
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,666.996,672.131,The sale of cars in general can't persist without mailings of title registrations.
1988.87-6431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,676.952,679.887,It depended on repeated sales of automobiles.
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,679.887,684.375,--It depended upon repeated tamperings with odometers.
1988.87-6431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,691.195,692.462,"Well, because there's no fraud."
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,692.462,693.414,Exactly.
1988.87-6431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,702.519,705.038,But odometer fraud wasn't an end in itself.
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,711.942,712.458,--If you--
1988.87-6431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,712.458,715.744,Certainly transfer of title is incident to the sale of cars.
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,715.744,727.285,"--Mr. Chief Justice, if you accept that line of analysis, then any person who tampers with an odometer had better be prepared to face mail fraud charges because somebody sooner or later is going to register that car."
1988.87-6431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,728.654,730.087,Only if he sells the car.
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,746.829,753.717,"--Well, it says no person shall disconnect, reset or alter the odometer with intent to change the number of miles indicated thereon."
1988.87-6431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,758.287,762.389,"So, you think it would be an offense even if I didn't sell the car."
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,762.389,766.96,I can't conceive of how the case would come to the attention of the U.S. Attorney.
1988.87-6431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,791.142,794.11,"Well, that really isn't quite the same... that is not what is alleged in the indictment."
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,804.816,809.454,"--Well, Mr. Maze ran up a bill on several different credit card charges."
1988.87-6431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,823.146,825.998,But Maze really just took a winter vacation.
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,834.687,838.056,"I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, it was a summer vacation--"
1988.87-6431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,838.056,838.656,Was it?
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,839.456,840.758,--as you indicated in the opinion that you wrote for the Court.
1988.87-6431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,840.758,842.375,I don't know why he went south then.
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,847.329,854.316,"Well, in Maze in the dissent it was described as a $2,000 spree."
1988.87-6431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,891.524,900.047,I... I think you're right that... that the offense here is... is not odometer tampering.
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,932.015,933.381,"Scalia, I disagree."
1988.87-6431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,943.823,945.956,"If I never sell the car, that's a fraud?"
1988.87-6431,0,38368,peter_l_steinberg,,949.241,953.678,The reason it's prohibited is because that kind of conduct is typically associated with fraud.
1988.87-6431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1152.471,1153.754,"Thank you, Mr. Steinberg."
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1156.59,1160.827,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-6431,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1218.747,1222.985,"Mr. Martin, why wasn't it complete when the cars were sold to the dealers?"
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1222.985,1231.84,Because Mr. Schmuck was in... in the business of... a continuing business of selling cars to the public through dealers.
1988.87-6431,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1233.14,1234.775,"Well, I thought he wanted his money."
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1241.529,1244.564,--He sold to dealers with the understanding that they would resell.
1988.87-6431,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1245.581,1246.85,"Well, all dealers are going to resell."
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1246.85,1247.633,"Absolutely, absolutely."
1988.87-6431,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1247.633,1254.939,But I'm not sure that that means that the offense isn't complete when the dealers bought it.
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1262.676,1267.246,"Well, there would... if... if there was no resales--"
1988.87-6431,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1267.246,1271.131,"He had sold them to the dealers, gotten his money, and the car is destroyed."
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1272.317,1274.917,--Certainly there would be no fraud at the retail level.
1988.87-6431,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1298.283,1304.187,Did the evidence show that they relied... that they purchased for him because they'd purchased from him on past occasions?
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1304.187,1304.872,Yes.
1988.87-6431,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1334.391,1341.545,"Did they say specifically that they relied upon him because of past transactions, or do we just infer that?"
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1341.545,1343.497,--They developed a business relationship with him.
1988.87-6431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1371.261,1377.099,"When you say the scope, he's not challenging the scope, you mean he's not raising the point that Justice O'Connor was raising?"
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1377.099,1377.782,That has not been--
1988.87-6431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1377.782,1378.701,Because I have trouble with that point too.
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1379.901,1381.653,--That has not been our understanding.
1988.87-6431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1402.65,1410.903,"--Okay, but... but nonetheless, if... if that is your theory then, you have to show that the use of the mails was necessary to sell it to the customers, not to the dealer."
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1410.903,1411.672,Exactly.
1988.87-6431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1411.672,1413.205,"Okay, which is probably easier I guess."
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1413.205,1414.29,Yes.
1988.87-6431,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1418.159,1419.759,And mailed by him.
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1419.759,1420.944,And mailed by the dealers.
1988.87-6431,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1420.944,1423.746,"Mailed by the dealers, not Schmuck."
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1423.746,1429.55,"Not by Schmuck, although Schmuck... the evidence shows that Schmuck knew that the dealers customarily mailed applications."
1988.87-6431,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1429.55,1434.002,And do you know are the... is there a sample of the title application in the record?
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1434.402,1436.787,"It's... It's not in the appendix, but it is in the record."
1988.87-6431,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1440.839,1443.874,"Some applications, you know, require you to put the mileage down."
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1443.874,1444.241,Yes.
1988.87-6431,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1450.861,1451.711,Yes.
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1451.711,1463.553,But the first mileage in Wisconsin titling records was the false odometer mileage that Mr. Schmuck recorded when he applied for Wisconsin titles or when the dealer did.
1988.87-6431,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1472.224,1474.193,These were cars brought in from another state?
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1474.193,1474.526,Yes.
1988.87-6431,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1481.93,1490.37,"So, it was a... so, it was a... was it the accurate or the false odometer reading that was on the title application in Wisconsin?"
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1490.37,1492.655,It was the false... it was the false odometer reading.
1988.87-6431,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1529.578,1536.851,"Well, that would really broaden the mail fraud statute if every document mailed had a lulling effect because it didn't mention the fraud."
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1536.851,1551.443,"--Well, I... I think our point is that an average retail customer understands that titling laws are there for protection of customers, maybe to some extent to protection from odometer tampering."
1988.87-6431,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1639.409,1642.211,He was not charged with odometer tampering in the indictment.
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1642.211,1645.063,He was not charged with odometer tampering in the indictment.
1988.87-6431,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1717.358,1724.862,Where... where in your brief is the language of 31(c)?
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1724.862,1728.564,It's stated in full in Petitioner's brief.
1988.87-6431,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1731.599,1734.968,Where is it in the Petitioner's brief?
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1734.968,1739.038,"--Page 19 has the ""necessarily included"" language of our brief."
1988.87-6431,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1739.038,1744.675,Thank you.
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1744.675,1752.029,We believe that points to an abstract examination of the statutory elements of two crimes and not to the facts of a particular case.
1988.87-6431,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1761.551,1766.753,Which page 19 is... is the language?
1988.87-6431,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1768.772,1771.657,--We cite it on page 19 and quote a phrase.
