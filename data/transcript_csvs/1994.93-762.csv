1994.93-762,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,18.045,"We'll hear argument next in Number 93-762, Jerome v. Grubart, Inc., v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company, and No. 93-1094 consolidated with it, City of Chicago v. the same."
1994.93-762,0,17461,ben_barnow,,19.745,27.583,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-762,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,151.799,159.553,Didn't our Sisson decision pretty well reject totality-of-the-circumstances test which you refer to?
1994.93-762,0,17461,ben_barnow,,159.553,160.92,Not the way I read it.
1994.93-762,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,226.695,229.147,Isn't that an argument against the Extension Act?
1994.93-762,0,17461,ben_barnow,,235.301,247.359,"No, Your Honor, and the reason is, is that when this Court developed the nexus test it did it to find a substantial connection between the activity and traditional maritime activity."
1994.93-762,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,277.025,282.513,"Incidentally, you don't question the Congress' authority to do that if it chooses?"
1994.93-762,0,17461,ben_barnow,,282.513,285.048,"If it chooses to do that, but I don't believe it has."
1994.93-762,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,286.981,292.099,"Congress can define admiralty jurisdiction any way it wants, even though it's a constitutional term."
1994.93-762,0,17461,ben_barnow,,292.099,300.555,"--The definition has been left open, as Your Honor is aware, and this Court has defined and determined that definition."
1994.93-762,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,308.227,329.891,"Well, I don't think there's much problem under the Commerce Clause, but if Congress purports to be defining admiralty jurisdiction in a way differently than this Court has done, does that cause a constitutional problem with reference to the authority of the Congress to define what admiralty jurisdiction means?"
1994.93-762,0,17461,ben_barnow,,329.891,331.593,"Frankly, I'm not sure."
1994.93-762,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,348.971,351.087,"Well, you don't raise that question in your brief."
1994.93-762,0,17461,ben_barnow,,381.007,386.328,"Well, I think the totality-of-the-circumstances approach has been used by this Court in other areas."
1994.93-762,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,386.328,389.097,"For jurisdiction, for subject matter jurisdiction?"
1994.93-762,0,17461,ben_barnow,,389.097,392.464,I don't recall it in terms of a subject matter jurisdiction.
1994.93-762,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,392.464,395.85,"That's what we're talking about here, admiralty jurisdiction."
1994.93-762,0,17461,ben_barnow,,395.85,402.606,"We are, but in this particular case, it merely serves the test that this Court has already developed."
1994.93-762,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,557.336,565.007,"Mr. Barnow, may I ask you to get specific in applying the third Sisson prong?"
1994.93-762,0,17461,ben_barnow,,586.023,588.975,That's basically it on the point.
1994.93-762,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,589.475,602.633,"Well, may I ask you, then, is it also proper, or isn't it also proper under Sisson, to consider the fact that the City of Chicago I presume had some role in maintaining this navigable water?"
1994.93-762,0,17461,ben_barnow,,625.729,634.585,"--Well, first, I'm buoyed by the Court's use of these additional inquiries, because Sisson doesn't tell you how to make those additional inquiries."
1994.93-762,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,688.37,704.48,"Well, is your claim, then, that what the lower court did in effect was simply to isolate the activity of, the kind of common-sense way, the maritime actor and say the activities of cotort... of fellow tortfeasors simply are to be ignored?"
1994.93-762,0,17461,ben_barnow,,707.498,717.371,"Well, first I'm not sure that common-sense approach ever works in an uncommon problem situation, and because this is an uncommon problem, had the--"
1994.93-762,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,717.371,729.428,"Well, whether it does or not, is that what you're saying the court did, that it isolated... consistently or inconsistently with Sisson, it simply isolated the acts of one of the tortfeasors and ignored the acts of the others--"
1994.93-762,0,17461,ben_barnow,,729.428,730.03,--It did--
1994.93-762,1,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,898.123,910.931,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-762,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,935.146,956.56,"Mr. Rosenthal, before you do that, what would your position be if a ship on navigable waters slipped its moorings, drifted into a dam, caused a breach in the dam, and the dam flooded surrounding territory, causing damage?"
1994.93-762,1,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,956.56,959.329,Our view is that that would be an admiralty case.
1994.93-762,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,959.329,960.364,"That would be, but this--"
1994.93-762,1,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,960.364,961.547,That would be.
1994.93-762,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,961.547,963.097,"--It's the difference between a dam and a tunnel, is that--"
1994.93-762,1,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,963.097,979.409,"Well, I think it quite important to start by identifying the cause of action with considerable precision, because the cause of action in this case is not how a boat was spudded down on navigable water, or anything having to do with navigation or seaworthiness."
1994.93-762,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1677.658,1683.061,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-762,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1700.423,1704.392,What exactly... how would you describe this vessel?
1994.93-762,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1704.392,1706.844,It was a repair barge.
1994.93-762,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1711.165,1713.517,And it moves from place to place on water?
1994.93-762,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1713.517,1714.85,--With a tug.
1994.93-762,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1764.882,1774.321,"Suppose the Court were to determine... the district court... that the limitation act doesn't apply, that you don't qualify within the terms of the statute."
1994.93-762,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1775.673,1784.363,"Well, that's a decision on the merits that would have to be made after trial, as the Seventh Circuit ruled in an issue on which the Seventh Circuit did not--"
1994.93-762,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1784.363,1786.713,But then would there be no more admiralty jurisdiction?
1994.93-762,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1787.815,1788.315,--No.
1994.93-762,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1788.315,1789.465,"--say, case dismissed?"
1994.93-762,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1789.465,1791.815,"It would be case dismissed on the merits, like anything else."
1994.93-762,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1806.025,1814.263,"I'm thinking of the claims coming in, the Great Lakes start this controversy, but couldn't counterclaims come into the admiralty forum?"
1994.93-762,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1814.263,1817.282,"--Yes, and they can be adjudicated once the court has jurisdiction."
1994.93-762,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1826.804,1839.612,"And if the court decided it didn't make sense, would the character of those claims then change so that when you brought your suit elsewhere it would no longer be considered under maritime law?"
1994.93-762,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1839.612,1846.016,I think if the case were brought elsewhere it would be governed by the law in that court.
1994.93-762,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1855.887,1862.56,"Mr. Roberts, is it your position that the Maritime Extension Act is really not at issue here, at this stage?"
1994.93-762,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1862.56,1868.131,"Well, the Admiralty Extension Act added to 1333 gives jurisdiction."
1994.93-762,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1881.622,1886.843,"Well, would you... are you saying that the Admiralty Extension Act is just irrelevant to your case?"
1994.93-762,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1886.843,1887.876,"No, not at all."
1994.93-762,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1902.768,1909.458,Does the Admiralty Extension Act purport to be defining the constitutional meaning of admiralty jurisdiction?
1994.93-762,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1909.458,1909.924,No.
1994.93-762,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1918.045,1922.032,"Well, then, it's construing the phrase admiralty jurisdiction, is it not?"
1994.93-762,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1922.032,1925.968,"It's within Congress' power to modify and supplement the admiralty jurisdiction, yes."
1994.93-762,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1925.968,1927.336,Can it expand it?
1994.93-762,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1927.336,1929.602,"It can expand it within reasonable bounds, yes."
1994.93-762,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1929.602,1932.221,What's the authority for that proposition?
1994.93-762,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1932.221,1938.291,"Well, the lower courts have uniformly found the act constitutional, and Congress--"
1994.93-762,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1938.291,1943.945,"Well, the Genesee Chief extended admiralty and overruled the Daniel Ball, did it not?"
1994.93-762,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1943.945,1949.599,"--It did, and Congress does it with some regularity... the Longshore and Harbor Workers Act, where, for example--"
1994.93-762,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1949.599,1951.785,But relying on the commerce power.
1994.93-762,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1951.785,1953.635,--Relying on the commerce power--
1994.93-762,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1953.635,1958.705,"Which, of course, it has, but here it purports to be simply defining the meaning of admiralty jurisdiction."
1994.93-762,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1958.705,1964.609,--It defines a category of cases that were... are arguably within admiralty jurisdiction apart from the Extension Act.
1994.93-762,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1979.183,1982.32,Sisson didn't cite the Admiralty Extension Act.
1994.93-762,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1982.32,1982.653,No.
1994.93-762,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1991.759,1999.846,Do you think the Sisson test incorporates the Admiralty Extension Act and we can just apply the Sisson test and be faithful to what the Admiralty Extension Act says?
1994.93-762,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1999.846,2014.173,"--I think if you have an incident on navigable water posing a threat to maritime commerce arising from traditional maritime activity, that that could be considered within the admiralty jurisdiction apart from the Admiralty Extension Act, yes, and here--"
1994.93-762,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2014.173,2019.344,"Mr. Roberts, may I get down to more specific cases and the application of Sisson here?"
1994.93-762,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2031.817,2033.253,"--No, we don't, Your Honor."
1994.93-762,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2033.803,2034.186,Why not?
1994.93-762,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2039.74,2044.894,--The definition of the incident and the activity comes from the allegations in the complaint.
1994.93-762,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2054.8,2058.969,"Well, doesn't... doesn't... I confess I didn't pull out the complaint before argument."
1994.93-762,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2061.437,2072.393,"--We allege in our limitation complaint, yes, that the city is liable to us for contribution and indemnity, but the existence of other contributing causes doesn't defeat admiralty jurisdiction once it's found to exist."
1994.93-762,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2076.596,2078.982,"Oh, I see, the plaintiff made no claim against the city."
1994.93-762,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2081.583,2083.0,We are the plaintiffs in the limitation action.
1994.93-762,3,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,3152.08,3173.678,"Mr. Roberts discussed many causes of action except the one that is actually before the Court, because this is the first time that this Court is asked to put any cause of action arising further inland than the reach of the vessel and its appurtenances into admiralty."
