1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.651,We will hear arguments next in Roberts against the United States Jaycees.
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,71.69,78.625,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, at issue today are two conflicting claims."
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,277.17,285.885,"Well, what does that... how does that bear on any of the issues in this case?"
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,285.885,287.806,"I think, Mr. Chief Justice--"
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,287.806,289.322,How they get their numbers?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,289.322,293.632,--I think what it shows is that it operates the way a business operates.
1983.83-724,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,307.345,310.297,"Well, that's true of social fraternities, too."
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,316.779,318.42,"No, I don't think it does."
1983.83-724,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,329.008,338.035,"Well, there may be those differences, but I think one of them is not a... there is not a difference between their desire for new members at frequent intervals."
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,338.035,343.955,"Well, I bring that point out to show that that's one of the aspects of their business."
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,367.211,388.594,"Well, an association of this kind has one thing in common with a fraternity that was just mentioned, in that the fraternity has access to these people for about four years of undergraduate work, and perhaps a little longer, and you have an age limit here."
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,390.873,391.764,"Yes, that's correct."
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,391.764,393.138,And what is that age limit?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,393.138,398.684,The Jaycees' programs are offered to people between the ages of 18 and 35.
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,398.684,402.666,Does that violate... does that discriminate against older people?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,402.666,406.415,"It certainly does, but in the State of Minnesota that's not illegal."
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,414.207,414.942,With that turnover--
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,414.942,415.942,Pardon me?
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,415.942,422.704,"--With that age limit, there's a very substantial turnover in membership, is there not?"
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,422.704,426.968,"I don't know if the record indicates quite what their turnover is, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,426.968,428.561,You don't need to know what the record shows.
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,437.199,438.089,"Yes, that's correct."
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,438.089,447.93,"Well, then in order to maintain an organization, they've got to have a program at the bottom side to bring new ones in, don't they?"
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,447.93,448.975,No question about that.
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,448.975,451.006,What's remarkable about that?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,451.006,452.88,There's nothing remarkable about it.
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,455.191,456.129,Why does that it make it a business?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,456.129,457.098,--Pardon me?
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,457.098,459.205,Why does that make it a business?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,459.205,461.048,It's a businesslike aspect to it.
1983.83-724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,489.474,490.958,"It recruits women, too, doesn't it?"
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,490.958,491.754,--Pardon me?
1983.83-724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,491.754,493.364,"It recruits women, too, doesn't it?"
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,493.364,499.892,"The Minneapolis and St. Paul chapters, in contravention of the financial charter, recruited women."
1983.83-724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,502.89,512.559,"I thought you, in describing the Jaycees at the outset, you said that women can be limited members."
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,512.559,517.901,"The Jaycees, Justice White, have several categories of members."
1983.83-724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,530.552,533.191,Don't they recruit for them?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,533.191,534.801,I don't believe that they do.
1983.83-724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,536.674,537.798,"That's strange, isn't it?"
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,539.298,541.5,"--Yes, they have to pay if they come in."
1983.83-724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,541.5,543.203,I would think they would be recruiting them all the time.
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,545.92,559.54,"Again, I hate to fall back on what the record says, but the evidence in our record consisted of what the Minneapolis and St. Paul chapters did, and it consists of a large number of materials about how the national chapter operates."
1983.83-724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,564.615,565.412,As members.
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,565.412,566.943,As individual members.
1983.83-724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,571.144,572.707,Regardless of how sensible--
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,572.707,574.033,--That's correct.
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,574.033,588.184,"--Would you agree that the core issue in this case is not whether this is a good idea to include or exclude women, but whether it is required as a matter of law."
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,590.324,593.136,I'd agree with the first half of that formulation.
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,593.136,594.167,What about the second half?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,594.167,597.509,Whether it's a good idea or not makes no difference to this Court.
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,606.317,613.471,Or whether people who are not members have a statutorily guaranteed right to come in.
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,613.471,614.534,Yes.
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,616.018,623.468,Then why is the good sense of it relevant one way or the other?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,623.468,628.639,I think the good sense of it is particularly relevant.
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,635.324,640.618,There's two organizations in the two cities that thought it was a good idea.
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,640.618,641.366,"--Yes, they did."
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,641.366,647.255,"But that has nothing to do, has it, with whether... with the legal question that's presented here."
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,647.255,647.693,No.
1983.83-724,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,660.672,680.663,"Would the statute in your state be applied to prevent a group of blacks from forming an all-black club to advocate causes and interests to black citizens, and compel that group to admit whites?"
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,680.663,686.708,"--I think, Justice O'Connor, it would depend on several things."
1983.83-724,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,692.83,711.948,"If it were found to be as much of a public accommodation as the Jaycees, then do you think that there would be a First Amendment right of that black association that would override any state regulations?"
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,711.948,741.28,"If the admission of whites to this black institution in your hypothetical could be shown to interfere with some constitutionally protected freedom... let's say a constitutionally protected right to hold a belief or to advocate a belief... then the State of Minnesota, I think, would have trouble requiring through its public accommodations law that those people be--"
1983.83-724,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,741.28,750.995,"Well, does the First Amendment incorporate a right to advocate causes relating just to young men?"
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,750.995,759.554,"--It probably does, Justice O'Connor, but that freedom is not interfered with in this particular case."
1983.83-724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,778.954,783.374,"I'm sure you tried to tell Judge Arnold, but he didn't agree with you."
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,783.374,784.327,That's correct.
1983.83-724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,784.327,798.291,"What if there were, in Minneapolis, an Iranian society devoted to the propagation of Iranian interests, and one of their big positions was that Iraq is all bad?"
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,836.293,836.854,"No, it is not."
1983.83-724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,878.322,882.821,"Well, these are factual assertions about the character of this organization."
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,889.77,893.567,"--I think the record shows, Justice White, that--"
1983.83-724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,893.567,896.83,"Well, apparently it didn't, or the Court of Appeals would have believed you."
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,896.83,908.326,"--Well, the record shows that the admissions practices of the Jaycees don't entail any sort of agreement with a particular issue."
1983.83-724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,908.326,926.1,"Well, at least the Court of Appeals thought there was something in the notion that the Jaycees were giving a male point of view, and that is was distinguishable enough that the State couldn't force them to take in women."
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,926.1,929.411,I think that the Court of Appeals made the erroneous assumption that because--
1983.83-724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,929.411,930.536,I know you--
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,930.536,934.549,"--men uttered something, that that was a man's point of view."
1983.83-724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,958.149,975.252,"--Going back to Justice O'Connor's question, what if the blacks decided that we should have our own Jaycee, because we ought to really promote black business participation in black businesses, and things like that?"
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,990.714,999.195,"If there's absolutely no difference between the organization in your hypothetical and the organization here, then I would say that they could not do that."
1983.83-724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,999.195,1002.193,"Well, the difference is that they're all black."
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1002.193,1007.895,That would make no difference for purposes of this application of this statute.
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1007.895,1012.174,You mean under the Minnesota Supreme Court of the matter and your view of the matter?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1012.174,1014.033,That's correct.
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1014.033,1019.562,"Under the Court of Appeals' view, they could do that, couldn't they?"
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1019.562,1020.124,That's correct.
1983.83-724,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1026.075,1034.727,Is that because you're elevating the type of speech involved to different levels of protection?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1059.609,1065.216,"I'm looking at that question, Justice O'Connor, from two points of view."
1983.83-724,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1093.359,1103.481,"Well, what if the Jaycees had taken a position that the Equal Rights Amendment is bad, and that women getting into the job market is a bad development?"
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1113.789,1119.708,I think what it would change would be the nature of the regulation that the state could impose upon them.
1983.83-724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1131.719,1136.562,"But you say they still couldn't just flatly ban women, is that right?"
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1136.562,1137.249,That's correct.
1983.83-724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1141.905,1143.293,"Yes, yes, yes."
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1149.432,1166.301,"For purposes of the First Amendment and for purposes of analyzing this case, as the jurisprudence of this Court has progressed this far, the answer is probably yes."
1983.83-724,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1169.814,1192.946,"Well, does that mean if an organization did have both social non-speech activities that it performed and certain advocacy functions that it performed, that the state could relate just the social non-speech activities within that organization?"
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1192.946,1193.899,"--It could certainly do that, yes."
1983.83-724,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1193.899,1197.366,Is that the effect of your state's law?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1197.366,1205.862,"In this particular case it is, yes, because there is no regulation of content based speech here."
1983.83-724,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1257.561,1265.854,"What about the occasion of voting, for instance, in the organization on what political positions the organization will take?"
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1267.65,1273.897,"Not in this particular instance, no, because voting is part of what you do as a Jaycee."
1983.83-724,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1291.452,1299.684,And the organization never takes a vote on what positions to espouse for political or advocacy purposes?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1299.684,1304.291,It does.
1983.83-724,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1365.877,1373.859,"Counsel, you refer frequently to the fact that the Jaycees are a business or a commercial organization."
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1394.413,1396.444,It's incorporated.
1983.83-724,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1396.444,1397.395,They are incorporated?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1397.395,1397.942,Yes.
1983.83-724,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1399.379,1399.957,Right.
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1406.642,1408.703,"The national, Justice White."
1983.83-724,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1409.89,1411.062,What are the chapters?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1413.498,1415.81,I don't know the answer to that.
1983.83-724,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1425.213,1426.477,Excuse me.
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1432.756,1434.786,I don't know.
1983.83-724,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1441.909,1445.611,"In that respect, is it any different from the Kiwanis Club?"
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1451.858,1453.404,Not the monetary types.
1983.83-724,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1453.404,1459.136,--Do they advertise in the newspapers and magazines for members?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1464.415,1467.586,I think that they might.
1983.83-724,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1469.632,1471.475,Does the record show whether or not they do?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1471.475,1474.069,I don't know.
1983.83-724,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1474.069,1475.067,You don't know.
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1491.078,1493.013,What I mean by that is that--
1983.83-724,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1493.013,1494.263,"You used the term ""buy""."
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1494.263,1495.278,--Yes.
1983.83-724,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1516.426,1518.846,What do they pay?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1522.486,1525.11,"--They pay a fee, a membership fee."
1983.83-724,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1535.544,1538.37,They're selling the training.
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1538.37,1541.619,"They market and sell that training, the Jaycees does."
1983.83-724,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1541.619,1548.288,Do they publish any annual reports showing profits and loss?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1548.288,1549.179,"Yes, they do."
1983.83-724,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1549.179,1551.614,Are those in the record?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1564.657,1569.404,I would characterize it as an annual report that a business puts out.
1983.83-724,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1575.698,1588.413,What other characteristics make these entities businesses rather than voluntary associations?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1588.413,1601.751,"Well, I think that what characterizes this as a business as opposed to a voluntary association or a private membership club is the commercial nature of the transaction that's involved."
1983.83-724,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1610.155,1623.429,"But churches train people for religion, and all sorts of organizations train for civic participation... Kiwanis, Rotary, Lions, Masons, whatever."
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1629.614,1634.425,I don't think any one factor is dispositive.
1983.83-724,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1634.425,1635.816,"Well, aside from training, what else?"
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1651.591,1655.354,What I'm trying to describe are the various aspects of that offering to the public.
1983.83-724,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1655.354,1666.428,"But they didn't rely on anything, as I read their opinion, for the business holding except for the fact of the public sale of memberships to anybody who was 18 to 35, male, and would pay the price."
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1676.252,1680.017,"Yes, but this organization doesn't make its money solely off of dues."
1983.83-724,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1716.969,1718.578,I understand.
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1729.981,1730.356,Yes.
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1743.476,1752.456,"How is it different, in what respect, from the Kiwanis, the Rotary, and 29 other luncheon clubs?"
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1752.456,1755.502,"Well, one thing that is--"
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1755.502,1763.046,"They purchase the membership, in your terms, for X dollars and pay so much every time they attend a luncheon."
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1763.671,1765.046,"--Yes, that's correct."
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1765.046,1790.333,"Now, in these clubs that Justice Powell and others have referred to, very frequently they take one lawyer, one doctor, one dentist, one hairdresser perhaps, and the purpose of that... there can't be much doubt about it... to promote business for the doctors, the lawyer, the banker, whoever."
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1796.235,1803.826,One of the problems with this case is that there is so much evidence about the Jaycees and so little about precisely these clubs that you've described.
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1814.448,1824.538,"Selectivity in one sense, that it's just one lawyer, so that he has a monopoly or a potential monopoly on that incoming business."
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1824.538,1831.144,"But if there's a privacy aspect that has to be protected here, it's protected because of selectivity."
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1845.434,1852.041,"Well, at least they assert that they're selective in that they want only males between the ages of 18 and 36 or something like that."
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1852.041,1852.838,That's correct.
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1861.788,1863.052,Who says it's too big a pool?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1863.052,1864.927,The composition of the pool.
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1864.927,1870.144,What authority says that's too big a pool in your terms?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1870.144,1873.563,It's too public a pool.
1983.83-724,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1907.456,1910.236,What about the Girl Scouts now in Minnesota?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1925.402,1937.101,"--If the Girl Scouts operate in the same fashion as the Jaycees operate in, they will probably be considered a public accommodation for purposes of the Minnesota Human Rights Act."
1983.83-724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1937.101,1939.583,"And the Boy Scouts, too."
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1939.583,1940.88,That's correct.
1983.83-724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1940.88,1960.154,"Well, do you... the District Court said that even if the Jaycees are interested in promoting only women's... only men's point of view... that the state interest is compelling and overrides that association freedom."
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1960.154,1960.871,Yes.
1983.83-724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1960.871,1962.012,Do you agree with that?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1962.012,1962.653,Yes.
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1962.653,1965.573,You think it's just like a hotel?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1965.573,1975.554,I see very little difference between what the Jaycees do and how they operate and being able to go into a hotel with a dollar and get a room or a meal.
1983.83-724,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1975.554,1979.49,Where can you go to a hotel for a dollar?
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1982.145,1983.55,"Not in this town, Your Honor."
1983.83-724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1985.644,1987.83,You can take that as a figure of speech.
1983.83-724,0,40665,richard_l_varco_jr,,1987.83,1992.234,I'd like to reserve the balance of my time if the Court has no further questions.
1983.83-724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1992.234,1996.576,Mr. Hall.
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,1996.576,2009.056,"If the Court please, Chief Justice and may it please the Court, our concerns in this case have been pretty much the same as those expressed by the Court here."
1983.83-724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2080.933,2086.509,"Well, isn't it young businessmen?"
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2086.509,2089.414,"No, it's not young businessmen?"
1983.83-724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2090.694,2091.632,Any young men.
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2093.616,2094.85,That's right.
1983.83-724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2096.256,2096.819,School teachers?
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2099.849,2108.252,"--Young school teachers, young doctors, young lawyers, young preachers, anyone who wants the organization can join and receive the benefits."
1983.83-724,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2129.461,2139.942,"Mr. Hall, can you identify any of those programs in which the sex of the participant supporting it would tend to make him either support or oppose the program?"
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2139.942,2143.784,I can't think of any program that would.
1983.83-724,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2155.795,2159.949,"Well, presumably, it would change the organization because they'd have women instead of just men."
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2163.978,2165.79,It could very well.
1983.83-724,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2185.846,2193.201,Which of the programs advances the interests of young men without equally advancing the interests of young women who might also be executives?
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2193.201,2197.027,"--As I said earlier, I don't know of any external program in that sense."
1983.83-724,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2199.089,2200.949,How about any internal objective of the organization?
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2200.949,2201.51,--It would indeed.
1983.83-724,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2209.101,2213.99,"Of course, the word 1920, didn't it?"
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2213.99,2214.49,That's right.
1983.83-724,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2214.49,2217.176,"When the word ""men"" was often used to cover both sexes."
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2217.176,2230.187,"And it has... and although the organization has voted three times on this question, the membership has still indicated they desire the organization to continue as an organization to advance the interests of young men."
1983.83-724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2230.187,2232.389,You say it would change the organization.
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2250.71,2259.3,"Of the majority of... they voted three times and, of course, the majority voted all three times."
1983.83-724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2271.264,2276.95,What interests are there of young men that would be frustrated by having women members?
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2276.95,2285.445,--I think the desire of young men simply to have an organization that they entirely run and promotes solely their interest.
1983.83-724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2285.445,2295.332,"So that's really sort of a club sort of a rationale, a privacy rationale, other than a First Amendment rationale, isn't it?"
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2295.332,2296.097,No.
1983.83-724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2305.359,2307.141,Whether it was communicating anything distinctive or not.
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2307.141,2311.404,"--This organization... we would advance that, but in this case it's more than that."
1983.83-724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2312.185,2319.571,"Well, I don't know that you... I thought you answered Justice Stevens that you don't know of anything that would be different externally."
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2323.163,2325.148,"--No, it's communications would not."
1983.83-724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2325.148,2325.601,What?
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2327.133,2340.267,"Well, the... as pointed out earlier, in the number of matters which the organization votes on not only nationally, but locally, each year number in the hundreds."
1983.83-724,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2351.091,2355.402,Can you name me one position that applies only to men?
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2355.402,2358.244,--Beg pardon?
1983.83-724,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2358.244,2363.649,One position that they have taken that applies only to men.
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2363.649,2382.281,"I can't think of a public commitment issue which is applied only to men, but I can foresee that the organization itself, if they take a vote on ERA or the draft or abortion, or any of those sensitive issues, they could very well take a different position."
1983.83-724,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2384.858,2387.186,Have they done so up to date?
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2387.186,2392.793,"--To my knowledge, they have not taken a vote on those sensitive issues, but they certainly are going to."
1983.83-724,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2392.793,2395.87,"The only position they've taken is, they don't have any interest in women."
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2395.87,2397.916,No.
1983.83-724,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2399.649,2402.508,Have they taken that vote or not?
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2402.508,2403.336,--Beg pardon?
1983.83-724,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2403.336,2405.102,"They haven't taken that vote, have they?"
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2405.102,2405.991,About interest in women--
1983.83-724,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2405.991,2406.6,Yeah.
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2406.6,2408.006,"--To my knowledge, they have not."
1983.83-724,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2408.006,2419.845,Would you respond to the view of the state that this is a business?
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2419.845,2422.031,"Yes, I will."
1983.83-724,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2422.031,2428.185,"I think that's an important question, since apparently that was a basic decision on which the state--"
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2428.185,2439.071,It is our position that the Jaycees is not a business; it's a bona fide membership organization like the thousands of others.
1983.83-724,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2450.051,2453.378,--Everything you've said so far could apply to a business.
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2458.158,2461.517,"There is no... well, it does not sell memberships."
1983.83-724,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2483.1,2486.145,But some organizations vote people in.
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2491.909,2494.736,"That's up, pretty much, to the local chapter itself."
1983.83-724,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2501.92,2505.653,"So anybody can walk in off the street and join, if you're male?"
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2505.653,2508.668,"That is possible, if you're 18 to 35."
1983.83-724,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2511.417,2513.853,"Well, they can't compare that with all those organizations you named."
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2513.853,2514.837,Beg pardon?
1983.83-724,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2514.837,2517.743,"Some of those organizations you named, one vote can keep you out."
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2517.743,2519.743,That's true.
1983.83-724,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2519.743,2520.32,Right.
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2521.195,2528.862,"In this case, there could be also... local people could be excluded on a de facto basis likewise, and that's in the record."
1983.83-724,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2528.862,2532.033,"Mr. Hall, may I ask you just a question?"
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2535.344,2535.891,Yes.
1983.83-724,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2535.891,2537.624,--In what sense are we asking that question?
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2547.152,2547.699,Yes.
1983.83-724,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2547.699,2550.793,So don't we have to accept that as that's where we start from?
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2550.793,2551.026,No.
1983.83-724,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2551.776,2554.868,Do we have the power to reinterpret the Minnesota statute?
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2554.868,2555.134,--Yes.
1983.83-724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2566.411,2575.875,"Why don't you just accept the fact that within the meaning of the Minnesota statute, this is a business?"
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2577.249,2584.122,"--Well, if that were accepted, we would abridge constitutional rights by just pure imposition of labels."
1983.83-724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2584.122,2585.122,Why?
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2587.683,2589.166,Well--
1983.83-724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2589.166,2592.838,Just because it's a business doesn't solve your constitutional question.
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2598.1,2606.114,"--Our point is the same as Judge Arnold made, that the label ""business"" is simply a distortion of the facts."
1983.83-724,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2606.114,2607.91,Suppose it is.
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2618.421,2619.139,Yes.
1983.83-724,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2621.576,2624.309,We determine the constitutional question--
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2624.309,2624.341,That's correct.
1983.83-724,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2624.341,2627.075,--not the Minnesota Legislature or the Minnesota Supreme Court.
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2627.075,2627.497,That's correct.
1983.83-724,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2627.497,2632.965,Because the Supreme Court of Minnesota says this is a business under Minnesota law.

1983.83-724,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2647.131,2652.3,"Mr. Hall, what about the selectivity question?"
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2658.485,2665.185,The organization does have a wide admission policies of young men 18 to 35.
1983.83-724,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2669.606,2669.793,Right.
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2674.275,2674.838,Yes.
1983.83-724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2724.413,2734.86,"Part of your submission is that the First Amendment protects private organizations, whether they're communicative organizations or not."
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2736.766,2743.607,"That is our position, although in this case, there is broad communication of controversial public issues."
1983.83-724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2745.84,2753.322,But none of which... none of which you can identify that would be different if women were--
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2753.322,2769.94,"--I can't identify... if the organization itself, it were required to comply with the Minnesota injunction and admit women, it is inconceivable... and I think you're rational to assume that the organization won't change and that its viewpoint won't change."
1983.83-724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2771.579,2773.766,"--Well, you haven't identified one yet."
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2776.109,2776.344,--Abortion.
1983.83-724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2776.344,2778.951,"Well, you don't know what its viewpoint is."
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2778.951,2782.685,"Well, they've never voted on it, but I can't predict the issues--"
1983.83-724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2782.685,2783.717,How do you know?
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2785.748,2791.994,--I can't predict what the viewpoint will be on any given issue that may come up next year or the year after that.
1983.83-724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2791.994,2794.587,But you just think it inevitably would be different?
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2794.587,2811.346,"I think an organization in which you change the membership from one which is all men, dedicated to voting the interests of men, and you change it to an organization which also includes women, I think it's only rational to assume that that organization is going to undergo a substantial change."
1983.83-724,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2811.346,2817.578,"But now, it seems to me that there's something that has to depend on the nature of the organization."
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2869.104,2884.535,"Well, the important point that I think perhaps I haven't made clear is that this organization's essential core purpose is to advance the interests of young men, just as there are women's organizations which central core purpose is to advance women."
1983.83-724,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2914.211,2918.709,"Aren't you just afraid that the women will ""take over""?"
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2918.709,2933.358,"Maybe that... that may be a... Judge Doyle of the Tenth Circuit suggested that may be a possible fear, and if it is, I think it's the kind of fear that would be legitimately protected by any group."
1983.83-724,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2938.529,2949.086,"Well, if the suffragette movement of a century ago had taken in men, they probably wouldn't have had the women's vote quite as soon as they did, would they?"
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,2949.086,2949.805,That's right.
1983.83-724,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2965.128,2977.965,"Mr. Hall, I'm afraid we're not giving you much chance to argue, but the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in its holding paragraph on page A2, says this:"
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,3002.003,3002.909,"Yes, it will."
1983.83-724,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3032.131,3039.363,"Mr. Hall, those exhibits are in the record, but not in any appendix that we have before us."
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,3039.363,3039.754,That's true.
1983.83-724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3044.751,3055.466,"But none of them can you identify as just male issues, as just promoting the interests of men."
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,3058.621,3058.995,--Yes.
1983.83-724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3058.995,3064.041,And yet all of your public positions... none of your public positions can you identify as
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,3068.148,3068.913,That's true.
1983.83-724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3093.123,3094.762,And associating with other young men.
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,3094.762,3097.338,--That's right.
1983.83-724,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3100.447,3104.07,"But aren't those projects designed to teach them to be good, effective executives?"
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,3104.07,3105.086,Beg pardon?
1983.83-724,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3105.086,3108.304,"That's part of their training to be effective executives, isn't it?"
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,3108.304,3110.069,And they learn by doing.
1983.83-724,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3110.069,3113.02,And I suppose women wouldn't learn the same thing?

1983.83-724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3124.033,3128.188,"Don't the associate members, the women, participate in these programs?"
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,3128.188,3131.609,The associate members do participate in these programs.
1983.83-724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3135.107,3138.34,"Well, I know, but they participate in all these training programs."

1983.83-724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3147.165,3155.209,"Sure, they run projects and they're trained, and they get the same exposure, except they aren't officers of the organizations and don't vote."
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,3155.209,3156.973,And do not vote or hold office.
1983.83-724,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3157.801,3161.675,"Well, tell me, what other right do they have, other than to pay their dues?"
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,3163.72,3164.392,I'm sorry.
1983.83-724,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3164.392,3167.672,"What other right do the women have, other than to pay dues?"
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,3167.672,3175.279,"Well, first of all, this is a voluntary organization, Justice Marshall, and the women don't have to join on that basis."
1983.83-724,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3189.896,3190.271,That's understandable.
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,3190.271,3194.802,"And I don't blame them for that, and that's their choice to make--"
1983.83-724,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3194.802,3195.769,I was wondering if you wondered.
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,3195.769,3197.035,--Beg pardon?
1983.83-724,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3197.035,3200.252,I was wondering if you did wonder why they didn't join.
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,3208.28,3212.886,Either... that was primarily in violation of the bylaws.
1983.83-724,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3218.993,3226.288,"But suffice it to say, in those organizations where the membership was opened up, the women joined in substantial numbers."

1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,3238.377,3238.956,That's correct.
1983.83-724,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3262.415,3270.02,"Well, now as I understand the state's attorney, he's not arguing that the state can dictate what the Jaycees advocate."
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,3273.566,3274.206,"--No, he doesn't."

1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,3310.801,3312.051,Yes.
1983.83-724,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3352.581,3357.719,You're basically asserting a First Amendment right.

1983.83-724,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3431.595,3435.156,"Well, but the constitutional analysis is what I'm trying to get at."
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,3438.405,3455.337,--You would apply the test of Griswold v. Connecticut and Shelton v. Tucker and other cases which have set forth the basic fundamental right of freedom of association to choose our own members.
1983.83-724,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3459.24,3464.379,"Well, but you have businesses that said we don't want to serve blacks."
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,3474.344,3475.469,"Yes, but--"
1983.83-724,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3475.469,3476.016,All right.
1983.83-724,1,19101,carl_d_hall_jr,,3480.842,3482.577,"--Well, the two situations are not comparable."
1983.83-724,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3507.487,3510.221,--Don't you think those were the arguments that were made in those cases?
