1979.78-1183,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.112,We will hear arguments first this morning in Carbon Fuel Company against United Mine Workers.
1979.78-1183,0,21037,david_d_johnson,,11.16,16.569,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1183,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,127.625,134.458,"Mr. Johnson, did you say the union has unilaterally structured itself."
1979.78-1183,0,21037,david_d_johnson,,149.485,162.392,"No, I think that when I say unilaterally I mean the union has control over its internal structure and that is very similar to many corporations or business forms."
1979.78-1183,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,162.392,164.905,Who are parties to the contractor?
1979.78-1183,0,21037,david_d_johnson,,164.905,183.456,"This International Union makes, signs and enters into the contract, it is the bargaining representative party of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association members are parties to the contract on the employers' side of the table."
1979.78-1183,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,183.456,189.645,Neither the district nor the locals are parties to the contract?
1979.78-1183,0,21037,david_d_johnson,,189.645,197.01,The districts I believe sign the contract as well as the International.
1979.78-1183,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,218.202,221.349,As parties to the agreement?
1979.78-1183,0,21037,david_d_johnson,,221.349,222.868,"Yes, I think they are parties."
1979.78-1183,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,239.616,252.059,You wouldn't say a shareholder in a corporation is a party to a contract which only the corporation has signed it just because a shareholder will ultimately benefit?
1979.78-1183,0,21037,david_d_johnson,,252.059,252.563,That is right.
1979.78-1183,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,289.81,297.264,Don't the locals have to approve the contract?
1979.78-1183,0,21037,david_d_johnson,,297.264,302.533,"Yes, the contract is ratified by the membership submitted to --"
1979.78-1183,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,302.533,304.505,It is binding upon them?
1979.78-1183,0,21037,david_d_johnson,,304.505,304.948,Sir?
1979.78-1183,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,304.948,306.678,It is binding upon them?
1979.78-1183,0,21037,david_d_johnson,,306.678,310.624,It is binding upon them and they ratify it.
1979.78-1183,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,310.624,317.208,"Are all the union parties, International, district and local all bound for example by the arbitration clause?"
1979.78-1183,0,21037,david_d_johnson,,317.208,319.0,"Yes, I think certainly they are."
1979.78-1183,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,319.0,320.918,And they could enforce it.
1979.78-1183,0,21037,david_d_johnson,,320.918,332.939,"They could enforce it by suit, they can -- they are bound by it, they have the benefits of it, they are obligated to comply with it."
1979.78-1183,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,555.918,561.933,Did they dispute the representation of the district representatives in doing that?
1979.78-1183,0,21037,david_d_johnson,,561.933,567.466,I think there is no evidence whatsoever that they acted in anything but good faith.
1979.78-1183,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,620.418,633.779,"Do you think your case is stronger or weaker against the district, the International or the locals respectively, or is it the same against all of them legally?"
1979.78-1183,0,21037,david_d_johnson,,633.779,650.334,"Well, it gets different I think that our case against the International is stronger let us say in the sense because the district is in the context of this case acting as an agent acting for the International."
1979.78-1183,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,682.281,686.679,Was the district in trusteeship?
1979.78-1183,0,21037,david_d_johnson,,686.679,694.673,The district was in trusteeship throughout most but not all of the period of time that we are involved with here.
1979.78-1183,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,707.101,710.578,It is agreed no disciplinary measures were ever taken?
1979.78-1183,0,21037,david_d_johnson,,710.578,718.274,No disciplinary measures were taken at Carbon's mine nor so far as the record indicates any mines in the Coal Operators Association.
1979.78-1183,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,808.653,812.63,Is it in effect an action for a specific performance?
1979.78-1183,0,21037,david_d_johnson,,812.63,815.623,"It is an action for damages, Your Honor."
1979.78-1183,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,815.623,817.11,Failing --
1979.78-1183,0,21037,david_d_johnson,,817.11,842.261,"It is an action for damages against the International district unions as well as the locals, but that issue is not here, for their failure to use the reasonable means available to them to prevent breaches of contract by their members and subordinate branches, specifically breaches of the no-strike clause of the contract."
1979.78-1183,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,843.924,846.747,How about the arbitration clause?
1979.78-1183,0,21037,david_d_johnson,,846.747,860.39,"Well, the arbitration clause -- of course when I speak of the no-strike clause I am speaking of the commitment in the contract that all disputes will be settled through our grievance and arbitration procedures rather than by strikes."
1979.78-1183,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,911.278,919.834,Wasn't there during the period from around 1950 a specific clause in the agreement to that effect which was later dropped?
1979.78-1183,0,21037,david_d_johnson,,919.834,920.694,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1183,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,976.649,984.102,You are relying on the Gateway language about the quid pro quo induces the employer to make the contract.
1979.78-1183,0,21037,david_d_johnson,,984.102,984.931,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1183,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,984.931,998.234,"Well, how do you refute the argument that there was once a specific provision in the contract that would have probably required the result that you sought, and that was dropped by consent of the parties?"
1979.78-1183,0,21037,david_d_johnson,,998.234,1005.601,The language -- the specific language referred to was in addition to the maintain the integrity clause language.
1979.78-1183,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1303.588,1305.06,Mr. Combs.
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1305.06,1317.656,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court."
1979.78-1183,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1413.569,1427.062,"Mr. Comb, you are not arguing for any Norris-LaGuardia Act type of limitation independent of the contrary, you are simply for proper construction of a voluntary reached agreement?"
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1427.062,1430.678,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that is correct."
1979.78-1183,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1441.207,1444.214,But then Norris-LaGuardia just deals with injunctions.
1979.78-1183,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1454.006,1461.81,You feel you must rely in part on Norris-LaGuardia and not just on an interpretation of the voluntarily reached agreement between the Parties?
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1461.81,1465.586,"No, we do not rely on Norris-LaGuardia for that purpose; no."
1979.78-1183,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1544.566,1550.219,"Mr. Coombs, would you have a different position of the contract had a no-strike clause?"
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1550.219,1553.876,"I think not, Your Honor, because none of this was authorized."
1979.78-1183,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1553.876,1567.434,And you would say that just a bare no-strike clause would not carry with it an obligation to take affirmative efforts to stop wildcat strikes?
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1567.434,1575.682,I would say just a bare showing that the union had authorized that strike would not be sufficient.
1979.78-1183,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1575.682,1581.24,"And an integrity clause wouldn't add anything to that, I take it you argue."
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1581.24,1584.799,That would be my argument; that is true.
1979.78-1183,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1584.799,1606.05,There is nothing in the last that would permit the operators from demanding a clause in the contract to require the International or the district to do everything in their power in every single situation subject only to the impossibility to prevent wildcat strikes.
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1606.05,1614.8,That would be a subject of permissive bargaining to decide on what steps the union would take in its internal structure to bring about these strikes.
1979.78-1183,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1619.27,1624.511,"Mr. Combs, the judgment here against the local union as I understand it."
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1632.992,1634.876,It does to this extent.
1979.78-1183,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1647.383,1647.707,I see.
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1651.456,1654.275,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens, that is our position."
1979.78-1183,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1654.275,1675.593,"Mr. Combs, my Brother White I suppose means that you accept the proposition that the contract at issue here did have the equivalent of an explicit, simple no-strike clause, i.e. by inviting the parties to settle their controversies otherwise than by strikes."
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1675.593,1679.163,We do not have an explicit agreement to that effect.
1979.78-1183,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1679.163,1691.09,"No, but in your answer to Justice White when you said that your argument would be no different if there were an explicit simple no-strike clause implied to me at least that you think this contract had the equivalent of it."
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1691.09,1697.233,To the extent that if the contract -- if the strikes in question here were authorized by the union --
1979.78-1183,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1697.233,1702.263,"Yes, yes; to that extent."
1979.78-1183,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1702.263,1709.59,"Mr. Combs, you are not asking us to reconsider our cases that say that a no-strike clause is implied --"
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1709.59,1711.1,"No, your Honor, we are not."
1979.78-1183,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1711.1,1713.56,"Lucas, Flower and -- whatever they were."
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1714.495,1714.896,Yes.
1979.78-1183,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1714.896,1716.879,That this was the equivalent of a no-strike clause?
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1716.879,1724.795,The arbitration provisions of grievance procedure was equivalent to an implied agreement that those disputes would be settled --
1979.78-1183,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1724.795,1727.928,"Well, it was equivalent to an explicit agreement."
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1727.928,1728.26,I guess --
1979.78-1183,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1728.26,1729.526,It was an implied agreement.
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1729.526,1733.023,"Implied or explicit, there is very little difference in those two terms."
1979.78-1183,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1733.023,1737.283,But you say that doesn't carry with it any promise to take any affirmative steps.
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1737.283,1738.351,That is correct.
1979.78-1183,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1738.351,1743.266,And that the integrity clause can't add another promise.
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1743.266,1751.901,That is correct and it is our position that the bargaining history and of course the Court decisions bear that out.
1979.78-1183,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2013.117,2027.073,But I take it from your argument -- and correct me if I have a misconception of it -- that your position would be the same prior to 1952 under that old contract.
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,2027.073,2034.06,Our position would be the same insofar as authorizing the strikes because because of the International Union.
1979.78-1183,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2034.06,2039.135,"So that puts you in disagreement, does it, with the basis of the Fourth Circuit's holding?"
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,2039.135,2043.888,"No; no, your Honor, the Fourth Circuit held that with reference to --"
1979.78-1183,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2043.888,2046.903,I am not quarreling with the opinion -- the basis of their opinion.
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,2046.903,2062.513,Their opinion was based upon the contract in which they said that the bargaining history of the clause and the construction of it was such that there was no contractual obligation on the part of the union to do anything.
1979.78-1183,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2142.653,2144.951,Was that the Benedict Coal case?
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,2144.951,2146.663,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1183,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2181.248,2187.477,That was before the contrary authority developed creating the conflict among the Courts of Appeals?
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,2187.477,2215.911,"Yes, Your Honor, the Court pointed out -- yes, Mr. Justice Black, and that is correct -- the Court pointed out, the Fourth Circuit did that the cases in the Third Circuit, U.S. Steel, Republic, that it was their opinion that the effect of those cases were to rewrite the contract and that they disagreed with them."
1979.78-1183,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2494.211,2506.648,What do you say the clause means when the International Union took on an obligation to guarantee the integrity of the contract?
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,2506.648,2537.091,"If the court please, we read that on page 19 and 20 of the brief and it cites -- the United States District Court of Appeals for D.C. stated it well, recites that the thrust of the whole thing is this both parties admit constantly since 1941 they negotiated this, they wanted to settle with us by collective bargaining."
1979.78-1183,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2555.027,2566.109,You mean the integrity clause has no consequence or meaning after the contract is signed but only beforehand in the negotiations?
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,2566.109,2589.399,"Well, it is clearly established -- it was clearly established that the elimination of the disciplinary and the best efforts clauses were for the purpose of preventing the union from being held liable for something that could admit trouble."
1979.78-1183,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2600.23,2603.353,"Tell me, just what do you think it does mean."
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,2607.253,2628.048,"Well, what it says specifically is that they will maintain both sides, will maintain the integrity of this agreement and it is to be -- these matters are to be settled by collective bargaining without recourse to the courts."
1979.78-1183,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2651.626,2660.298,Arguably it could mean if you just read the words that neither party will attempt to add any provisions to the contract.
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,2660.298,2662.95,That is right.
1979.78-1183,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2662.95,2676.946,Would it mean that the company would not be -- would not have any obligation under the integrity clause if the company refused to engage in arbitration?
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,2676.946,2688.457,"Well, to answer your question I think when you talk about arbitration both sides agree we will do our obligation to arbitration."
1979.78-1183,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2725.627,2735.413,Isn't there a general principle of contracts law that neither party will do anything to frustrate the legitimate expectations of the other arising out of the contract?
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,2735.413,2736.398,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1183,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2761.335,2767.684,"Mr. Combs, let me ask you a question about the litigation in the Third Circuit Republic Steel litigation."
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,2776.663,2778.584,That is correct; that is the way I read it.
1979.78-1183,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2778.584,2781.259,And then the case went back.
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,2784.389,2787.302,"Your Honor, that case is still on remand."
1979.78-1183,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2789.659,2790.718,I see.
1979.78-1183,1,26739,harrison_combs,,2793.178,2794.66,It is not tried to my memory.
1979.78-1183,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2796.448,2797.06,I see.
1979.78-1183,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2813.823,2816.189,Mr. Johnson.
1979.78-1183,2,21037,david_d_johnson,,2816.189,2825.573,"May it please the Court, I want to say a little bit furthermore about the meeting of the integrity clause which Your Honors have raised."
1979.78-1183,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2853.352,2862.055,"It really means to prevent the strike in the first place, they mixed the local and the district and the International on the same litigation, didn't they?"
1979.78-1183,2,21037,david_d_johnson,,2862.055,2864.461,You are referring to the Eazor Express case or --
1979.78-1183,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2864.461,2865.544,"No, the second one --"
1979.78-1183,2,21037,david_d_johnson,,2865.544,2866.719,The United States Steel case?
1979.78-1183,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2866.719,2868.404,Yeah -- that one.
1979.78-1183,2,21037,david_d_johnson,,2868.404,2885.827,"Well, my recollection is that in that case they said the maintaining integrity clause necessarily embraces an all reasonable means obligation and we think that that is the only means that can reasonably be attributed to it."
1979.78-1183,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2885.827,2891.955,Is it all reasonable means to prevent a strike from starting or to end once it started?
1979.78-1183,2,21037,david_d_johnson,,2908.704,2930.063,"Yes, Your Honor, our position is that the all reasonable means obligation embraces both an obligation to try to prevent strikes when there is reason to believe that strikes will occur and an obligation to stop them or to try to stop them when they do occur, and that it is twofold."
1979.78-1183,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2931.066,2933.487,"The manner half we have got involved here, of course."
1979.78-1183,2,21037,david_d_johnson,,2933.487,2934.474,That is right.
1979.78-1183,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3051.144,3058.756,I take it you wouldn't argue without the integrity clause the International would be liable.
1979.78-1183,2,21037,david_d_johnson,,3058.756,3071.054,"Our position is that the International is liable because there is inherent in the -- well, I may have misunderstood you, Your Honor."
1979.78-1183,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3071.054,3079.026,Let's assume that there is no integrity clause but there was an expressed no strike clause -- just a simple no strike clause.
1979.78-1183,2,21037,david_d_johnson,,3079.026,3112.414,"My position would be Your Honor, that whether there is an expressness strike clause or whether there is an implied no strike clause, whether the specific maintain the integrity language is used or not, that there is inherent in the no strike promise under our national labor policy and the implied commitment that the union that makes that promise will use the reasonable means available to it to prevent its subordinate branches and its member --"
1979.78-1183,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3112.414,3118.529,So in effect then you say the integrity clause doesn't add a thing.
1979.78-1183,2,21037,david_d_johnson,,3118.529,3119.746,I say that --
1979.78-1183,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3119.746,3121.273,It is just a --
1979.78-1183,2,21037,david_d_johnson,,3121.273,3121.593,You --
1979.78-1183,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3121.593,3125.754,-- it just expresses what is already there.
1979.78-1183,2,21037,david_d_johnson,,3125.754,3128.49,I think that that is essentially true.
1979.78-1183,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3168.881,3174.203,Even though at the same time they eliminated an express undertaking.
1979.78-1183,2,21037,david_d_johnson,,3174.203,3175.488,That is correct.
1979.78-1183,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3202.638,3212.005,"Well, was this the Third Circuit's position, was the Third Circuit's position the same as yours that the case would be the same without the integrity clause?"
1979.78-1183,2,21037,david_d_johnson,,3212.005,3237.3,It is my reading of the Third Circuit's decision that that they say the national labor policy and the fundamental principles of contract law require a reasonable effort by the International Union and that the maintain the integrity clause vitiates the union's argument that the parties did not intend any such obligation.
1979.78-1183,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3237.3,3245.074,Why don't you go further and say that the union guarantees in effect that there will be no strikes?
1979.78-1183,2,21037,david_d_johnson,,3245.074,3252.039,I think that it is not consistent with national labor policy to go that far.
1979.78-1183,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3252.039,3256.816,Where would you pull this national labor policy from; from out of the air?
1979.78-1183,2,21037,david_d_johnson,,3256.816,3282.045,"No, Your Honor, the Court of course long ago said that it is the function of the Federal courts in developing substantive law under Section 301 of the Taft-Hartley law to develop law to give effect to the national labor policy expressed in those laws."
1979.78-1183,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3282.045,3289.059,But it didn't say that you rewrite the contracts that people enter into in collective bargaining.
1979.78-1183,2,21037,david_d_johnson,,3289.059,3305.462,"No, but it says very clearly, Your Honor, that the labor policy is to make collective bargaining agreements enforceable and particularly commitments to settle disputes peacefully during the last contract and grievance procedure."
1979.78-1183,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3326.022,3326.8,"Thank you, gentlemen."
