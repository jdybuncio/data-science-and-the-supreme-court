1982.81-1032,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,42.312,Mr. Letter.
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,42.312,48.575,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1032,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,146.737,149.627,Is the term grand jury abuse a word of art?
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,154.235,157.249,"I do not think that it is a word of art, Your Honor."
1982.81-1032,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,252.055,259.693,"Before you do that, can I ask one question about the way the case developed... about when you say they came in and sought access, by that you mean they filed a motion in court?"
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,259.693,260.849,--That is correct.
1982.81-1032,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,260.849,266.643,Did they before doing that ask the United States Attorney in charge of the criminal prosecution just to turn the material over?
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,266.643,268.096,I do not believe they did.
1982.81-1032,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,268.096,272.953,"Now if you prevail in the case they could have done that, we would have avoided all of these issues, is that right?"
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,272.953,276.468,"They could have done it for the Civil Division attorneys, correct."
1982.81-1032,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,279.888,280.998,"There would have been an argument, yes."
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,283.623,283.967,--That is right.
1982.81-1032,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,298.836,303.083,"As long as you are interrupted, may I ask--"
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,303.083,303.864,Sure.
1982.81-1032,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,303.864,315.688,--It is your position that under your view the Civil Division attorneys could have these grand jury materials as a matter or right.
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,325.262,331.54,When you say support personnel meaning the attorney's secretary?
1982.81-1032,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,331.54,332.009,Yes.
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,332.009,333.602,"No, we do not believe so."
1982.81-1032,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,351.97,353.844,How about other people working for--
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,353.844,354.796,--I am sorry?
1982.81-1032,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,354.796,357.733,--How about other people working for them?
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,357.733,387.284,"Well, if we are talking about technical personnel like accountants, things like that, then, yes, they would need an order under Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i), but the secretaries would not because otherwise it would be difficult for the attorneys to even make a motion to the court because if the motion was going to discuss the grand jury material, the attorneys apparently would have to type it themselves, and we do not think that Congress ever intended such a thing."
1982.81-1032,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,387.284,389.189,That drastic a sanction?
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,389.189,390.173,Pardon me?
1982.81-1032,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,390.173,391.626,That drastic a sanction?
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,391.829,392.251,That would be--
1982.81-1032,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,392.251,395.406,"Mr. Letter, straighten me out, please."
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,398.561,399.842,--Correct.
1982.81-1032,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,399.842,404.403,"And, a division of the U.S. Attorney wants to see them?"
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,404.403,412.289,"When you say division of the U. S. Attorney, a division of the Department of Justice, obviously part of the same organization."
1982.81-1032,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,412.289,412.586,Right.
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,417.115,418.787,"That is our position, yes."
1982.81-1032,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,418.787,420.021,"Well, why did you file a motion?"
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,420.021,425.83,"We filed a motion, one, because we wanted access for assisting personnel, and also--"
1982.81-1032,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,425.83,430.251,You mean that the minutes are not open to anybody in the office?
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,430.251,436.843,--The minutes are certainly open to the assistant United States attorneys who--
1982.81-1032,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,436.843,438.81,"And, anybody in this office?"
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,438.81,439.888,--That is correct.
1982.81-1032,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,439.888,444.073,You want to give these notes to somebody outside of the office?
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,444.073,448.182,"We wanted to give them to the Civil Division attorneys in Washington, D. C.--"
1982.81-1032,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,448.182,450.774,"Well, that is in the United States Department of Justice."
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,450.774,453.053,"--That is correct, within the Department of Justice--"
1982.81-1032,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,453.053,456.286,You did not want to give them to anybody outside of the United States Department of Justice?
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,456.286,457.646,--We did.
1982.81-1032,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,468.517,472.328,You do not ever give anything to the Navy without a court order?
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,472.328,475.841,Under Rule 6(e)--
1982.81-1032,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,475.841,477.091,I do not care about any Rule.
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,478.419,480.371,"--No, it is not done--"
1982.81-1032,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,480.371,483.277,We are not dealing with 14 or 15 different animals.
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,489.712,491.804,"--No, Your Honor, we certainly did not."
1982.81-1032,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,491.804,497.911,It just looks to me like a law suit that just is a little unnecessary.
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,497.911,500.894,"As far as the attorneys for the government, we agree, Your Honor."
1982.81-1032,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,500.894,503.205,"Well, why did you file the motion?"
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,503.205,508.376,"We filed the motion because, as I say, we had to to show it to the Navy personnel."
1982.81-1032,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,508.376,511.358,"And, the only reason we got this case is because you filed a motion."
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,511.358,518.184,As far as why we have an appeal is because Respondents objected to the disclosure.
1982.81-1032,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,572.053,580.861,"In other words, the United States Navy, even though they have alot of lawyers is not charged with enforcing the criminal law of the United States?"
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,580.861,581.674,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1032,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,581.674,590.217,"If they see, or know, or have information on a criminal case, they can work only through the Department of Justice, is that it?"
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,590.217,590.936,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1032,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,599.246,601.776,Could the Navy have brought an action to see these minutes?
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,601.776,605.134,--Could the Department of the Navy have done so?
1982.81-1032,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,605.134,605.446,Yes.
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,605.446,607.867,"If they did, they would have had to seek--"
1982.81-1032,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,607.867,610.929,Is there anything in the statute that prevents them from doing it?
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,610.929,614.613,"--No, under Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i)--"
1982.81-1032,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,614.613,615.066,They could have?
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,615.066,615.644,--they could have.
1982.81-1032,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,629.124,642.29,"Mr. Letter, do you think the words, (3)(A)(i) that you just read to us have the same meaning as the words, ""attorney for the government"" in the general rule of secrecy provision about who can go into the grand jury?"
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,642.29,649.757,"I think that there are two ways of looking at that, and I think either one supports our position."
1982.81-1032,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,740.516,742.936,Is Rule 6(d) set out somewhere in your brief?
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,742.936,744.622,"No, it is not, Your Honor."
1982.81-1032,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,757.65,760.15,I am sorry.
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,764.102,764.43,--Right.
1982.81-1032,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,764.43,767.616,My question still is what do you think the correct answer is?
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,775.629,777.799,I believe it can.
1982.81-1032,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,797.088,797.541,Why not?
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,797.541,806.834,"As I say, we would like to avoid any appearance of impropriety... any appearance that we were using the grand jury for a purely civil purpose."
1982.81-1032,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,807.881,810.864,That is not a bad reason.
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,810.864,812.691,I agree.
1982.81-1032,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,816.455,822.031,"That has traditionally been the policy and the practice of the Department of Justice, has it not?"
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,822.031,822.953,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1032,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,960.74,974.859,"Mr. Letter, I take it, then, the government does not follow the practice of many private civil litigants of simply filing a law suit and getting rather extensive discovery to decide whether the law suit should have been filed?"
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,974.859,976.953,"--That is precisely correct, Your Honor, but--"
1982.81-1032,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,976.953,994.757,"Is that what all the fighting is about here because I had the impression from reading the briefs that if the government were precluded from doing what it did here it could have filed a civil action for fraud, gotten very extensive discovery and presumably gotten everything it could have gotten from the grand jury?"
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,994.757,998.88,"--Not entirely, Your Honor, but let me go through that."
1982.81-1032,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1036.834,1042.456,"Are those originals, then, that are before the grand jury of which the Defendant has no copy or anything?"
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1042.456,1052.531,"The Defendant might have a copy of some of it, but if it is some other witness, there is no guarantee that the Defendant has copies of--"
1982.81-1032,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1052.531,1054.374,"Well, but the witness would have a copy, wouldn't he?"
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1054.374,1055.483,--The witness might have--
1982.81-1032,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1055.483,1059.17,You could depose a witness as well as a party in your civil action.
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1059.17,1059.965,--It is possible.
1982.81-1032,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1208.452,1213.778,"But, of course, the question is whether their duty is duty under criminal law."
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1213.778,1218.668,"That is right, and that is where the next... plain language helps us again."
1982.81-1032,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1262.946,1265.023,It could have been a lot more cleared though couldn't it?
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1265.023,1267.476,"As with many provisions, yes."
1982.81-1032,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1267.476,1273.081,"Well, what about revealing the material to support personnel in a non-criminal case?"
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1273.081,1278.143,Then we would go to Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i)--
1982.81-1032,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1278.143,1280.329,And have to show particularized need?
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1280.329,1283.078,--We do not think that particularized need is the--
1982.81-1032,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1283.078,1285.109,"I know, but you would have to go to another section?"
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1285.109,1287.217,"--Right, we do have to go to another section--"
1982.81-1032,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1287.217,1290.076,You would not treat the supporting personnel as part of the lawyer?
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1290.076,1290.559,--That is right.
1982.81-1032,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1300.259,1312.801,What about the... What is the section you mentioned that does not have this... that do have the limiting phrases in?
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1312.801,1317.751,6(e)(3)(A)(ii)--
1982.81-1032,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1317.751,1318.345,(ii)--
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1318.345,1319.719,--6(e)(e)(B)--
1982.81-1032,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1319.719,1322.905,"--And, what does that (ii) say?"
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1322.905,1328.684,"--It is reprinted in the back of our brief at page 2A, and it says,"
1982.81-1032,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1339.259,1343.242,"Well, that would include a secretary, would it not?"
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1343.242,1344.913,"Yes, that would."
1982.81-1032,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1349.786,1350.973,Is the--
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1350.973,1358.828,"--The prosecutor's secretary, we would say, would be included under 6(e)(3)(A)(i)."
1982.81-1032,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1358.828,1372.761,"--I know what you said, but if you want to talk plain language, it seems to me that (ii) would apply to revealing the materials to a secretary."
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1372.761,1374.964,When we look at the legislative history--
1982.81-1032,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1374.964,1379.758,"That would be one of the personnel that you, a lawyer would think would be necessary to carry out your duties."
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1379.758,1387.473,--I think the legislative history of 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) shows that that is not what Congress was talking about.
1982.81-1032,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1389.004,1391.58,"Well, then, you have to get something beside plain language."
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1391.58,1393.516,"--For secretaries, certainly."
1982.81-1032,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1396.734,1398.562,But (ii) was limited to criminal--
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1398.562,1399.296,--That is right.
1982.81-1032,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1399.296,1400.265,--investigations--
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1400.265,1400.921,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1032,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1400.921,1402.185,--which does not apply here at all.
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1402.185,1402.841,That is right.
1982.81-1032,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1425.475,1435.594,"Mr. Letter, this case is related, of course, in a sense to the next one, the Baggot case."
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1478.359,1479.982,"No, it would not, Your Honor."
1982.81-1032,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1487.152,1488.573,How about IRS lawyers?
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1488.573,1490.791,"--IRS lawyers, same thing."
1982.81-1032,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1491.212,1493.181,"What do you mean, same thing?"
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1493.181,1496.772,--The same thing as any other IRS personnel for these Rules because--
1982.81-1032,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1496.772,1498.179,But not Tax Division lawyers?
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1498.179,1499.21,"--No, Tax Division lawyers--"
1982.81-1032,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1499.21,1501.802,I thought an IRS lawyer was a government lawyer.
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1501.802,1511.548,"--No, Rule 54(c) specifically defines attorney for the government, and it says, assistants of the Attorney General and assistants of the United States Attorneys."
1982.81-1032,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1532.976,1537.256,Wouldn't it likely do so indirectly?
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1541.785,1544.488,--We cannot reveal the information to them.
1982.81-1032,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1583.113,1593.859,"--Well, I assume the government could restructure a little bit and use Civil Division attorneys to staff these things like IRS investigations."
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1593.859,1600.044,"I do not think Civil Division attorneys could conduct an IRS investigation, Your Honor."
1982.81-1032,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1609.773,1615.334,Is there any other way IRS can operate in the courts except through the Civil Division?
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1615.334,1624.674,"In the United States District Court they operate through the Tax Division of the Department of Justice and through the United States Attorneys, I believe."
1982.81-1032,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1624.674,1625.799,That is what I thought.
1982.81-1032,0,21108,douglas_n_letter,,1625.799,1626.111,Right.
1982.81-1032,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1704.673,1714.186,Mr. Robbins.
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,1714.186,1716.231,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1032,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1751.716,1754.012,"Always subject to the Fifth Amendment, of course."
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,1754.012,1759.274,"--No, not subject to the Fourth and not subject to the Fifth and not subject to Invasion of Privacy, Your Honor."
1982.81-1032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1765.554,1768.85,You mean a person cannot invoke the Fifth Amendment before the grand jury?
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,1768.85,1777.549,"Not really, because they can give you immunity, either use or transaction, and make you answer."
1982.81-1032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1780.173,1786.124,"Well, they can invoke the Fifth Amendment, but then our cases have held that the immunity is a whole equal law."
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,1786.124,1786.389,I am sorry.
1982.81-1032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1794.059,1795.918,"Well, there are lots of things you may not want to answer."
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,1797.386,1797.884,True.
1982.81-1032,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1822.077,1827.544,"Suppose we had only one person as they once had, just one Attorney General of the United States."
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,1836.634,1840.336,That is a totally false argument that they raise.
1982.81-1032,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1840.336,1843.975,There was a time when we had only one Attorney General of the United States.
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,1843.975,1844.553,"I am not disputing that, Your Honor."
1982.81-1032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2015.953,2020.247,You say the government wants us to decide the case on the basis of legislative intent.
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2020.247,2020.529,Yes.
1982.81-1032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2020.529,2022.809,On what basis do you want us to decide it?
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2022.809,2025.948,"I want you to decide it on a constitutional ground and grounds, Your Honor."
1982.81-1032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2026.542,2027.464,Is that argued in your brief?
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2027.464,2030.305,"--Yes it is, and I will get to that."
1982.81-1032,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2080.973,2084.799,What would be your position about secretaries in the Criminal Division?
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2088.705,2093.858,"--Your Honor, I suppose, as a practical matter, that might happen."
1982.81-1032,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2095.123,2097.185,"Otherwise, they would have to do all of their own typing, wouldn't they?"
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2097.185,2098.685,I suppose so.
1982.81-1032,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2131.391,2133.702,Don't they already have it?
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2133.702,2136.154,--They have it as a criminal--
1982.81-1032,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2136.154,2137.747,You keep saying they are trying to get it.
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2139.247,2146.18,--As a criminal custodian in a temporary way as an assistant to the grand jury.
1982.81-1032,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2159.644,2164.173,"Well, who has custody of the copies of the grand jury minutes?"
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2164.173,2168.516,"The prosecutor has that, Your Honor, wearing his criminal hat."
1982.81-1032,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2168.516,2171.702,"I thought... I do not know what kind of hat he had on, but he had it."
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2173.373,2175.451,"But he is wearing a criminal hat, and that is the point."
1982.81-1032,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2176.872,2179.105,"He sees through the same eyes, doesn't he?"
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2179.105,2180.089,--Pardon?
1982.81-1032,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2180.089,2184.791,He sees through the same eyes whichever hat he has on.
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2184.791,2185.243,That is true.
1982.81-1032,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2234.708,2236.581,May I be sure I understand your argument here?
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2238.393,2239.878,"Yes, I am saying it is wrong."
1982.81-1032,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2239.878,2248.796,"And saying... For years and years the Anti-Trust Division used to run grand juries and sometimes they would indict and sometimes they would not, then they would bring a civil proceeding after."
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2256.668,2261.9,The question was raised in a sense in Proctor & Gamble.
1982.81-1032,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2261.9,2263.009,"Right, and I am just wondering how you answer that."
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2263.009,2264.696,"And, I will answer it this way."
1982.81-1032,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2272.176,2284.922,"Is it the thrust of your argument that if we had a similar situation and the Anti-Trust Division ran a grand jury, decided the evidence was not strong enough to indict, but that they thought they should bring a civil proceeding, could they or could they not bring a civil proceeding, in your view?"
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2284.922,2288.701,"--Of course, the allegations in that case were they never brought it for criminal in the first place, or if they did--"
1982.81-1032,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2288.701,2290.529,"Well, my hypothetical was rather clear."
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2292.497,2302.743,"--My position is that they should not be able to use the grand jury for civil purposes, and I must say that Proctor & Gamble does raise... I am going to give you a little gimme here."
1982.81-1032,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2331.95,2335.666,Do you think a fraud claim is less criminal than an anti-trust civil case?
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2335.666,2342.711,"I think we are talking here about the collection of money, and I think a fraud claim is less than... for this reason."
1982.81-1032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2366.591,2374.119,"Well, how about a gimme on the single-damage action by the government in the civil anti-trust case, just damages?"
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2374.119,2376.01,You mean versus the double damages?
1982.81-1032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2376.01,2378.274,"Well, I think the government can only get single damages."
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2378.274,2379.54,"No, they can get double damages."
1982.81-1032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2379.54,2380.226,Do they get double?
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2381.523,2383.007,In a civil courts claims action.
1982.81-1032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2383.007,2386.427,"--No, I mean in an anti-trust case."
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2386.427,2386.787,All right.
1982.81-1032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2386.787,2401.531,Would you say that that is beyond the rule if the government uses its criminal anti-trust investigation materials to bring a civil action to recover damages in an anti-trust case?
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2401.531,2409.73,"Yes, because we are talking about compensating somebody to make him whole."
1982.81-1032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2417.744,2420.211,"If I make the distinction, I do not see how in the world it applies to your case."
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2420.211,2422.835,"Well, I am not trying to apply it to my case other than the fact--"
1982.81-1032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2422.835,2424.49,How it applies to your reasoning?
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2424.49,2438.563,"--Well, Your Honor, the give me that I made was an injunction aspect of it to prevent an ongoing wrong which was criminal itself."
1982.81-1032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2440.515,2447.636,"If it is an ongoing wrong that is criminal in itself, why did the government abandon its criminal anti-trust prosecution?"
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2447.636,2450.464,Are you talking about Proctor & Gamble?
1982.81-1032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2450.464,2452.635,"No, I am talking about your hypotheticals."
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2466.832,2474.985,"Well, if you prosecute criminals you are going to send somebody to jail or impose a fine, one of the two, or a cease and desist order which gets into the quasi area."
1982.81-1032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2953.448,2959.804,Are you referring to Justices of this Court who have written opinions by their last names only?
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2959.804,2961.584,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2963.13,2964.942,"As far as I am concerned, you are."
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2964.942,2973.985,"Well, I am saying Justice Whittaker, and I--"
1982.81-1032,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2973.985,2979.343,Please refer to them as Justice Whittaker or Justice Harlan.
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,2979.343,2979.733,--I am sorry.
1982.81-1032,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3470.598,3472.379,But the grand jury is still here.
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,3472.379,3474.049,The grand jury is still here?
1982.81-1032,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3474.049,3474.487,Right.
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,3474.487,3475.205,Yes.
1982.81-1032,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3517.828,3519.422,"Your time has expired now, counsel--"
1982.81-1032,1,16805,arlington_ray_robbins,,3519.422,3520.952,"--Thank you very much, Your Honor."
1982.81-1032,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3520.952,3523.733,"--Do you have anything further, Mr. Letter."
1982.81-1032,2,21108,douglas_n_letter,,3523.733,3525.233,I have several brief points.
1982.81-1032,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3642.574,3644.074,Thank you gentlemen.
