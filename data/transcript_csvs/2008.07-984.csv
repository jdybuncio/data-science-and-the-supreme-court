2008.07-984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,13.991,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 07-984, Coeur Alaska v. The Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, and Case 07-990, Alaska v. The Southeast Alaska Conservation Council."
2008.07-984,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,15.01,43.243,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The expert agencies charged by Congress with implementing the Clean Water Act have concluded that the discharge of fill material, like the mine tailings at issue in this case, should be permitted by the Army Corps of Engineers under section 404 of the Act, and are not -- are not subject to the effluent guidelines applicable to permits issued by the EPA under section 402 of the Act."
2008.07-984,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,57.003,64.506,"If the discharge comes from a single pipe, is it always one or the other, or can it ever be both fill and--"
2008.07-984,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,64.506,67.525,"Justice Kennedy, it's always one or the other."
2008.07-984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,89.391,92.676,That's a legal answer to Justice Kennedy's question.
2008.07-984,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,101.199,120.51,"As a practical matter, for example, if you take the -- the slurry in this case, which is 55 percent solid by volume, there is going to be liquid coming out of that pipe with the slurry, but under -- under the definition that the agencies administer of ""fill material"", this is fill material under that definition."
2008.07-984,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,120.51,123.195,"Fill material trumps effluent, in other words?"
2008.07-984,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,123.195,124.397,Fill material trumps effluent.
2008.07-984,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,124.864,129.183,But it does -- here's the -- here's the problem that I'm -- I'm having and I think others may have.
2008.07-984,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,223.611,224.429,"--Sure, Justice Souter."
2008.07-984,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,237.67,250.645,"--Well, let's -- let's assume -- and I -- I don't mean to cut you off there, but before you're done -- I am at least raising it because I find it very difficult to get a handle on this case without dealing with that problem."
2008.07-984,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,257.234,257.568,--Sure.
2008.07-984,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,278.814,297.876,"How could it be settled, because isn't it -- isn't it a fact that, before 2002, if the primary purpose was disposing of waste, that the 402 permit applies?"
2008.07-984,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,297.876,299.311,"--That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.07-984,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,303.313,311.285,"So it's not any 30 years' experience, and when it was disposing of waste, it was under 402 until 2002."
2008.07-984,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,311.285,317.789,I think the -- the EPA has always adopted and applied an effects test for determining whether or not a discharge is fill material--
2008.07-984,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,317.789,327.545,"But in fact, was -- was there ever a permit by the Corps of Engineers when the purpose was disposal of waste?"
2008.07-984,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,340.472,347.225,"--There was a period, of course, Justice Ginsburg -- you're right -- where the Army Corps of Engineers adopted a primary purpose test."
2008.07-984,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,440.587,447.407,"Yes, but that's -- that's pretty cold comfort when -- when you treat as an impoundment area a natural lake."
2008.07-984,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,458.946,461.098,"--Well, any -- we're talking about--"
2008.07-984,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,461.098,463.917,This is a long way from a settling pond.
2008.07-984,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,463.917,466.119,"--Well, let me address that in two different ways."
2008.07-984,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,479.542,483.413,"Yes, but what's that -- what's that got to do with the definition of ""impoundment area""?"
2008.07-984,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,483.413,483.763,--Well--
2008.07-984,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,483.763,493.286,My problem is that you are treating -- the Corps is treating as an impoundment area a whole natural lake as distinct from a -- a settling basin.
2008.07-984,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,493.286,499.59,"--The statute refers to specified disposal sites, and what you -- what you have here -- you're right -- is a lake."
2008.07-984,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,519.669,521.871,You -- you say they're -- they're rigorous.
2008.07-984,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,535.513,535.965,--That's true.
2008.07-984,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,535.965,541.75,"And -- and the -- the Corps comes along and says, oh, when it's all over, you know, it will come back."
2008.07-984,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,558.478,571.804,"Well, that's true, Justice Souter, but -- but it's important to keep in mind that the reason why the lake -- the fish in the lake are not going to survive is because of the fill effect of the material, not because of the -- any toxics put into the water."
2008.07-984,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,572.22,572.737,"No, but the--"
2008.07-984,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,572.737,573.37,--going to be the case--
2008.07-984,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,573.37,585.445,"--But the -- as I understand it -- and you correct me if I am wrong here -- I -- I thought ""suspended solids"", I guess is the buzz word for it, is -- is a form of pollution."
2008.07-984,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,595.3,599.204,--At any time you have fill material going into the waters of the United States.
2008.07-984,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,605.441,607.31,"Yes, but this comes back to my initial question."
2008.07-984,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,635.294,639.881,I think what the agencies have done to reconcile their definitions is to apply this effects test.
2008.07-984,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,642.983,660.26,"Yes, but if you applied the effects test, the legal effect, is it not, is to define one form of pollution as no longer existent so long as that form of pollution falls within the Corps of Engineers' definition of ""fill""?"
2008.07-984,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,660.26,661.312,--I don't think that's correct.
2008.07-984,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,661.312,661.828,Isn't that correct?
2008.07-984,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,661.828,665.564,The legal effect is to regulate that pollution under section 404.
2008.07-984,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,665.564,674.002,"Well, General Garre, I don't want to take up your rebuttal time, but what was -- what's the environmental alternative to what was done here?"
2008.07-984,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,674.002,678.156,The primary environmental alternative considered was a dry tailings alternative.
2008.07-984,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,735.026,747.718,"But weren't they then thinking of fill material as material that was used either to fill in, to reclaim land, or in a construction project?"
2008.07-984,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,765.012,766.881,--Not the Environmental Protection Agency.
2008.07-984,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,801.485,821.699,"There's one question that -- that Justice Souter raised and, before you sit down, I would like to get your answer, and that is, can anything, any water of the United States that the Corps of Engineers decides is appropriate to be used as a disposal place -- can any waterway be a settling pond?"
2008.07-984,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,831.74,837.81,"--I think, as a practical matter, if you put discharge into a river, it may not change the bottom elevation."
2008.07-984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,924.499,925.149,"Thank you, General."
2008.07-984,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,925.149,927.968,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2008.07-984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,927.968,929.737,Mr. Olson.
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,929.737,934.974,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me reemphasize one point."
2008.07-984,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,972.663,978.217,But doesn't the EPA have a veto power over a fill material permit?
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,978.217,979.467,"--Yes, it does, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-984,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,979.467,981.253,So they're not totally mutually exclusive then.
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,981.253,988.09,"Well, it's mutually exclusive in terms of the issuer -- issuing agency, and I think that's a very important point."
2008.07-984,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1057.669,1062.471,Could they -- could they veto it due to its failure to comply with effluent limitations?
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1062.471,1071.743,"--No, they could not do that, Justice -- Chief Justice Roberts, because the -- Congress made a choice under section 404 and 402."
2008.07-984,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1123.175,1127.663,What happens if the agencies disagree as to whether it's fill?
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1127.663,1128.146,--The--
2008.07-984,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1128.146,1131.365,The Corps says it's fill; EPA says it isn't.
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1133.733,1135.533,--The -- the -- yes.
2008.07-984,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1170.873,1177.327,"But there are still going to be cases, I would assume very close cases, even under the present standard, where there could be disagreement."
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1177.327,1187.202,"Well, there could be disagreement, but I was just about to say that this rule was jointly adopted by the Corps of Engineers and the EPA in 2002."
2008.07-984,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1199.425,1205.746,"The -- the definition that was adopted, if I have it right, was the EPA definition."
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1232.747,1240.336,"--That's -- that's -- except in the early stage, as I understand it, the Corps and -- the Corps also used the effects test."
2008.07-984,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1248.206,1259.714,"But in application, that never included filling a lake, raising the elevation of a lake simply for the purpose of disposing of waste."
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1259.714,1263.785,"--That's -- that's -- until that point, that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.07-984,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1305.862,1307.897,Here's -- I -- I'm perhaps missing this.
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1326.525,1327.258,That's correct.
2008.07-984,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1327.258,1327.758,Okay.
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1334.464,1335.614,"No, I don't -- that is not--"
2008.07-984,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1335.614,1337.166,There's some -- there's some number of feet.
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1337.166,1338.566,--I don't know where you got that.
2008.07-984,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1341.168,1342.418,That's the result of this case.
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1363.817,1364.267,--Cholesterol.
2008.07-984,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1364.267,1365.3,What?
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1417.052,1418.985,"Yes, I will, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1452.708,1457.677,But it could contain it so long as it's -- as it -- as it is not transitory.
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1457.677,1457.96,No--
2008.07-984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1457.96,1467.551,"I mean, isn't it arguable that the best place for -- for really toxic stuff is at the bottom of a lake so long as it stays there and is not carried--"
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1467.551,1475.741,"--Well, that -- that may be, but the rule 404(b)(1) guidelines addressed both that point -- and I understand your point, too."
2008.07-984,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1498.32,1498.837,They're identical.
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1500.106,1500.889,Pardon me?
2008.07-984,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1500.889,1504.574,I -- I heard you say before that it was not identical.
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1523.387,1523.921,Every -- every--
2008.07-984,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1523.921,1525.554,So there must be something missing in that.
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1525.554,1526.506,"--Yes, there is because--"
2008.07-984,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1526.506,1527.089,What?
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1527.089,1528.823,--it's a different set of regulations.
2008.07-984,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1528.823,1530.558,What is the most important thing that's missing?
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1530.558,1541.183,The -- there's not -- it's -- the most important thing that's present is that Congress decided that these regulations that the -- fill was different stuff.
2008.07-984,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1547.887,1548.937,I think what might be missing--
2008.07-984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1548.937,1550.872,--Is nontoxic covered by 402?
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1550.872,1551.522,--Pardon me?
2008.07-984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1551.522,1553.991,Nontoxic is covered by 402.
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1563.247,1563.913,"Yes, yes."
2008.07-984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1563.913,1566.715,And under 404 it's only toxic.
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1566.715,1567.815,That's correct.
2008.07-984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1567.815,1569.417,"Well, that's a big difference."
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1569.417,1569.751,That's correct.
2008.07-984,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1591.764,1594.216,But it's going to kill every living creature in the lake.
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1594.799,1595.984,Putting -- putting sand or rocks--
2008.07-984,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1595.984,1596.534,Wait a minute.
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1597.968,1599.103,"--Yes, it is, Justice Souter."
2008.07-984,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1613.696,1618.414,And how do we know that the life will ever be restored?
2008.07-984,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1620.116,1649.036,"It's a -- it's a condition for the permit, and every agency which examined this, including the Fisheries Department, the -- the conservation agencies of the State of Alaska -- and specifically said in the administrative record that under the worst-case scenario they believe that all of that is going to take place, and there will be more fish in a bigger lake and more livable living conditions for the fish and aquatic life after this process is finished."
2008.07-984,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1649.036,1650.436,"Thank you, Mr. Olson."
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,1653.988,1673.651,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In section 306(e), Congress enacted an unqualified prohibition against operating any new source in violation of any standard of performance applicable to the source."
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1690.946,1694.981,"Of course, the provision that authorizes permits begins by saying,"
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,1707.686,1711.99,Because that's only a statement about whether section 402 applies.
2008.07-984,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1729.518,1735.855,"The standard has to be -- the standard has to be applicable, and this is an EPA regulation, isn't it?"
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,1735.855,1737.022,--Yes.
2008.07-984,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1737.022,1741.426,And the EPA has said this isn't applicable to this situation.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,1741.426,1746.561,But that determination was based on a misinterpretation of the Clean Water Act.
2008.07-984,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1762.839,1773.814,"So your -- your position requires us to determine that EPA's interpretation of those -- the statutory regime that you are talking about, 306 and 402, is -- is contrary to the statute."
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,1773.814,1778.532,--That the interpretation as it's presented in this case is contrary to the statute.
2008.07-984,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1778.532,1789.49,"If EPA were to amend the performance standard to say that it doesn't apply in the situation in which the fill rule applies, would that be a valid regulation?"
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,1789.49,1806.451,"Well, I -- I doubt that EPA could -- could lawfully under the Clean Water Act enact such a thing, because the Clean Water Act requires EPA to regulate suspended solids, and EPA has always regulated suspended solids through effluent limitations."
2008.07-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1806.451,1816.391,Could -- could the EPA allow a point source to discharge sand slurry -- there's nothing in it but sand -- into a river?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,1822.561,1826.532,If it -- I'm sorry.
2008.07-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1826.965,1828.282,I want to discharge.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,1836.221,1836.888,--Yes--
2008.07-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1836.888,1837.721,Would that violate--
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,1837.721,1839.304,--That's -- that's a discharge of a pollutant.
2008.07-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1840.09,1841.04,--Discharge of a pollutant.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,1841.04,1841.44,Yes.
2008.07-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1841.906,1863.621,"Now, if I do the same thing in a -- in a lake, because I want to fill the lake, what -- of what possible application is the fill standard unless it permits what would otherwise be prohibited under -- under the earlier sections?"
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,1863.621,1870.692,"--Well, the Corps of Engineers has the authority under section 404 to grant fill material permits--"
2008.07-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1870.692,1873.477,Even though it violates effluent standards.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,1873.477,1875.513,"--No, not when it violates effluent standards."
2008.07-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1875.513,1880.298,"But you say -- you say that if you discharge sand into -- into a river, it -- it violates effluent standards."
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,1880.298,1880.848,"Oh, oh, no."

2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,1958.398,1959.348,"Oh, absolutely."
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1966.337,1972.241,"Well, I guess, I mean, does suspended solids mean there's some liquid involved?"
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,1972.241,1977.895,"That implies some liquid, right; that -- that the solids are present in a liquid, like the discharge here."
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1977.895,1978.678,Like the discharge here.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,1984.382,1985.132,By weight.
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1987.501,1993.405,Is there a point at which it's proper to speak of it as a solid rather than a suspended solid?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,1998.225,2002.51,"Well, the -- the standard in this case prohibits a discharge of process wastewater."
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2002.51,2002.943,Right.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2002.943,2004.609,"And so, if--"
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2004.609,2007.745,You wouldn't think something that's 90 percent solid is wastewater?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2007.745,2018.203,--There might be some point at which the liquid content of a solid waste is so small that EPA wouldn't regard it as process wastewater anymore.
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2040.616,2052.84,"So if they were just putting whatever it is that doesn't have any water, concrete, into this lake, then you agree that it would be just the Corps of Engineers through the fill -- fill provisions that would govern that?"
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2052.84,2055.876,"--As long as there's no effluent limitation governing it, yes."

2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2064.898,2067.767,It depends on if EPA has adopted an effluent limitation for it.
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2078.872,2083.443,"I guess I'm just curious how that makes any sense, since we're talking about putting something into water."
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2090.597,2091.465,"--Well, EPA--"
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2091.465,2103.357,"Either way, I guess your friends on the other side would argue, I assume, that it's properly regarded as fill material, because that is the effect of it, rather than as effluent subject to 402."
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2103.357,2119.449,"--EPA has always regulated industrial sources that -- whose raw process wastewater contains high levels of suspended solids, high enough that it would have the effect of fill material and could be considered fill."
2008.07-984,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2144.315,2152.338,So do we decide -- we decide this case on the assumption that this is fill?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2153.89,2155.023,"--Yes, it's both."
2008.07-984,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2159.876,2168.28,"Well, then the question that we put earlier as to whether or not a single pipe contained both, you -- you say that it can contain both."
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2168.28,2170.398,"Well, it's -- it's one slurry."
2008.07-984,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2170.398,2171.098,I know.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2171.098,2172.1,It meets both definitions.
2008.07-984,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2175.135,2179.687,"It's one -- visibly, it's one stream, but you say it consists of two things?"
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2179.687,2185.09,"Well, it is -- it is a slurry that contains water, chemicals--"
2008.07-984,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2185.09,2185.573,Is it both slurry--
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2185.573,2186.007,--metals--
2008.07-984,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2186.007,2188.942,--Is it both fill and non-fill?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2188.942,2192.311,--It's -- it's fill and it's process wastewater.
2008.07-984,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2192.929,2199.25,"Well, if it's both, who gets to -- do you agree that there can be only one permit; there can't be a 402 and a 404 permit?"
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2199.25,2200.067,No.
2008.07-984,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2203.785,2204.369,All right.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2231.304,2248.414,"--If there's an effluent limitation applicable, it will end up having to be EPA that issues the permit, and that's -- that's simply because the Corps of Engineers just doesn't have the tools available to apply effluent limitations in its 404 permits, except for toxic substances."
2008.07-984,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2248.414,2251.366,Where do you find that in the statute--
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2251.366,2252.05,Well--
2008.07-984,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2252.05,2261.906,"--that where -- where there's a situation where possibly there could be a 402 and a 404 permit, the 402 permit trumps the 404 permit?"
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2261.906,2274.131,"--Well, it's -- where I would find that is in section 306(e), which says -- which is a prohibition against operating sources in violation of performance standards."
2008.07-984,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2276.083,2280.701,This wouldn't be an operation in violation of a performance standard.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2281.653,2282.487,--The performance -- right.
2008.07-984,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2283.587,2285.622,It could be put in a 402 -- it could be put in a 402 permit.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2285.622,2286.072,--Oh.
2008.07-984,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2302.316,2309.804,And 402 doesn't make any application for -- for the 404 regulations.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2309.804,2317.493,"Yes, that's correct, but -- but it does provide the tool for EPA to apply those effluent limitations that you were asking about."
2008.07-984,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2322.98,2330.134,Where does it make the -- where does it make provision for application of the standards that should apply to fill under 404?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2330.134,2337.037,"--Well, those standards apply if you have fill material that's not subject to some effluent limitation."
2008.07-984,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2340.239,2342.539,Where does the statute say that?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2342.539,2346.574,--Where does it say -- I'm sorry.
2008.07-984,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2347.774,2348.107,Where does it say that?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2356.113,2360.065,It's -- it is an absence of a provision in 404.
2008.07-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2407.897,2408.497,So can you go back--
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2408.497,2408.981,No one--
2008.07-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2408.981,2412.283,--Could you go back for a second to my discussion with Mr. Olson?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2433.93,2434.715,--Yes.
2008.07-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2434.715,2435.315,All right.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2439.584,2441.436,It doesn't even have to fill it up very much--
2008.07-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2441.436,2441.803,"No, I know."
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2442.269,2442.719,--Just a tiny bit.
2008.07-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2442.719,2443.221,Okay.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2457.578,2458.03,That's the--
2008.07-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2458.03,2459.964,"Now, this has only been going on for 40 years."
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2462.032,2462.866,--That's exactly right.
2008.07-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2462.866,2464.734,And -- and so I don't understand.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2473.257,2473.94,"Well, let me -- I think--"
2008.07-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2473.94,2474.64,All right.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2514.751,2519.386,--The Corps of Engineers only applies toxic effluent limitations.
2008.07-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2521.188,2521.788,Okay.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2550.507,2556.328,"--Well, that's not, and let me explain how they have been operating, because I think that will help clarify it."
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2574.055,2576.824,Even when they -- even when they fill -- even when they fill a lake?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2576.824,2582.561,"--Absolutely, and let me explain that, because you hear this statement a lot: EPA never regulates fill material."
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2616.532,2630.809,"So when EPA regulates -- or it has regulated these for 40 years, which I assume is up to 2002 -- then it -- it's because they don't go into lakes; it's because they go into settling ponds."
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2630.809,2631.326,Settling ponds.
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2631.742,2633.928,Which are not navigable waters of the United States.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2633.928,2634.544,Exactly.
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2634.544,2645.986,"So the new regulation says that EPA does not regulate it when it goes into -- I can understand why the Army Corps of Engineers doesn't care if it's an impoundment pond or a settling pond, but they do care when it's a lake."
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2645.986,2653.741,"When they adopted the new regulation, they were very clear that they intended to continue their past practice."

2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2692.199,2692.666,Which--
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2692.666,2693.516,--anything that contradicted--
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2693.516,2694.099,--which -- I'm sorry.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2695.618,2699.57,--The -- I'm talking about the Federal Register preamble and the--
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2699.57,2700.186,Yes.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2711.558,2711.808,--Right.
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2712.158,2713.391,"The applicable definition, not the preamble."
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2713.391,2715.51,"--the definition of ""fill material"" is simply a definition."
2008.07-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2721.914,2745.529,"Yes, but -- but do you have a case over these 40 years where a company was trying to use the emission from the mine as a fill material in a lake rather than in a settling pond and where the EPA, despite the fact that it was using it to fill a lake, applied its effluent standards?"
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2745.529,2749.897,"No, it's been -- it's been prohibited."
2008.07-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2749.897,2750.264,"Well, then--"
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2750.264,2751.047,It's been prohibited.
2008.07-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2756.068,2756.751,--Evidently not.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2772.328,2776.632,"--Well, if any -- I don't know if anyone ever asked to do that, but if they did the answer would have been no."
2008.07-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2780.75,2784.552,But your -- your 40 years of experience then really don't -- don't cover this case.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2801.564,2802.13,"No, no, no."
2008.07-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2818.542,2819.092,Do you agree with--
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2819.092,2819.676,--an even more--
2008.07-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2819.676,2821.493,--the description of that effect?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2836.837,2846.793,"--Yes, it has -- it does have adverse impacts, but it's -- in EPA's view and in our view, is not as bad as filling up a lake and killing all the fish and aquatic life in the lake and--"
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2846.793,2847.728,All the fish.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2849.745,2850.163,--Yes.
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2850.163,2850.68,Right?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2850.68,2851.647,"Right, and--"
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2851.647,2853.215,Those aren't endangered fish.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2855.199,2856.001,--That's right.
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2856.001,2857.201,Okay.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2857.201,2870.158,"But it's -- also an important point for us here is that this is a national rule, and EPA considered these kind of alternative land use requirements as an effect of its no-discharge rule."
2008.07-984,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2897.994,2903.481,Wasn't there a decision in the lower courts that the alternative was unacceptable as well?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2910.318,2911.837,"--Oh, we've already taken that position, yes."
2008.07-984,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2918.341,2920.859,--It was never your position that that was unacceptable?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2920.859,2921.409,--I'm sorry?
2008.07-984,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2921.409,2933.334,It was never your client's position that creating this -- permanently destroying wetlands and creating a mound that was bigger than the Pentagon was an unacceptable solution to this--
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2933.334,2948.343,"I don't want to make any representations about what a client might have said over the last 20 years of this mine, but I can tell you that we were working with the agencies and with Coeur to identify an alternative site."
2008.07-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2958.549,2970.774,--Why -- why do you say the EPA preferred the -- the solution of filling in the wetlands and creating an ash Pentagon?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2970.774,2984.033,"When -- when the Corps of Engineers proposed the draft 404 permit, EPA commented on it and said, we disagree with your conclusion that filling up the lake is the least environmentally damaging alternative."
2008.07-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2984.033,2987.801,"Well, if it really felt that way, couldn't it -- couldn't it simply have vetoed the permit?"
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2987.801,2989.051,"Yes, EPA can veto if it's--"
2008.07-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2989.051,2990.617,So it couldn't have felt very strongly about it.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2990.617,2995.705,"--Well, EPA -- its -- the veto authority is a discretionary authority--"
2008.07-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2995.705,2996.321,Right.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,2996.321,2998.74,--if it finds unacceptable adverse consequences.
2008.07-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3011.247,3015.118,"Well, it couldn't have preferred it very much, or it would have vetoed this one."
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3015.118,3023.724,--It -- apparently not enough to come to the conclusion that it was one of those situations where they wanted to veto based on unacceptable adverse consequences.
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3023.724,3028.009,Is there -- is there any aquatic life in this lake other than the thousand fish?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3028.009,3028.859,"Well, sure."
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3031.609,3032.661,Microinvertebrae?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3032.661,3037.513,"--I mean, all sorts of the things that fish feed on, plant life and animal life and all that stuff."
2008.07-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3037.513,3038.148,Plankton and stuff.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3038.148,3038.615,Yes.
2008.07-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3049.688,3050.172,Is it right--
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3050.172,3051.422,--all be destroyed.
2008.07-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3051.422,3067.048,"--Is it right -- now, I am back on my hobby horse -- but if it's right that this slurry is pushing into this lake 50 feet or 75 feet covering the bottom with some stuff, a lot of it's dirt, and some of it's the worst chemical ever, except it's not toxic."
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3086.71,3090.013,EPA can veto for unacceptable adverse consequences.
2008.07-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3092.799,3093.199,Why not?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3093.965,3095.917,Because that's all 404(c) says.
2008.07-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3095.917,3111.177,"--I know it comes under a different statute, but in any instance where in fact they see that some of their rules that they promulgate are being violated and they think the Corps of Engineers is not paying attention to those rules, they can veto it."
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3111.177,3112.361,"Well, but--"
2008.07-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3112.361,3115.479,"And if they don't veto it, then that would be a way of reconciling these two things."
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3115.479,3133.424,"--The -- the position that EPA has taken in this case, unfortunately, is that, if the discharge meets that definition of ""fill material"", no matter how bad the consequences are for water quality, it's fill material, and it's therefore exempt from effluent limitations--"
2008.07-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3133.424,3134.459,So couldn't they veto it?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3134.459,3140.946,"--Only if it was for -- well, it was for -- they found adverse -- unacceptable adverse consequences--"
2008.07-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3140.946,3145.732,And wouldn't an unacceptable adverse consequence be that it puts all this effluent in the water?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3145.732,3150.236,--It's a -- it's a different standard from whether it violates an effluent limitation is all I'm saying.
2008.07-984,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3173.635,3180.289,"--Isn't that the -- isn't that the p H at the point where it's discharged, and not the general p H in the lake?"
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3180.289,3181.205,--It'll dilute in the lake.
2008.07-984,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3186.707,3188.142,What was the answer -- what's the answer to the question?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3193.027,3196.665,"--Oh, it'll -- it'll dilute in the lake, so it will revert to normal levels--"
2008.07-984,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3196.665,3197.615,--Within how long?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3197.615,3198.465,--correct.
2008.07-984,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3206.902,3210.037,So the p H -- so the p H you just cited was the -- was the p H--
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3210.037,3210.822,--Of the slurry.
2008.07-984,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3210.822,3211.939,--just at the point of the discharge?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3211.939,3212.556,Of the slurry.
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3248.829,3252.447,"Just to follow up, that's -- that's the same point, though, that Justice Alito made."
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3255.566,3255.816,--No.
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3266.005,3267.374,"I'm sorry, I didn't understand you."
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3278.312,3294.274,"--They took that slurry, they let the solids settle down to the bottom, and then they tested those solids for what effect it would have on some fresh water organisms, because they were trying to determine whether the lake would be able to recover from depositing all these solids into the lake."
2008.07-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3361.05,3370.821,"But, in fact, if you have this mix and it -- it goes as an effluent part and a fill part, in your view, what?"
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3377.375,3384.346,"If there's an effluent limitation, the effluent -- there's a performance standard under section 306."
2008.07-984,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3390.516,3394.404,You say -- you say this is 404; it's not 402--
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3394.404,3394.787,--No.
2008.07-984,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3394.787,3395.92,--It is 306?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3395.92,3401.907,404 is not appropriate here because there is an effluent limitation.
2008.07-984,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3402.657,3404.509,"No, but it is fill."
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3404.509,3411.663,"--It's fill material, but it's not fill material that is available for -- for a section 404 permit."
2008.07-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3426.006,3429.458,So fill material is only that material as to which no effluent standard applies?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3429.458,3430.777,"No, it's fill material."
2008.07-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3435.629,3440.081,404 material is material such that it is fill material and there is no effluent standard applicable?
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3440.081,3441.616,"Yes, that's correct."
2008.07-984,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3442.166,3451.489,"So if it's 95 percent solid but there's an effluent limitation, your position is that there can't be a 404 permit; it has to be a 402 permit."
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3451.489,3451.889,--It depends.
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3461.244,3462.446,Go ahead.
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3463.062,3463.679,Okay.
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3496.5,3497.317,"Thank you, Mr. Waldo."
2008.07-984,2,43472,thomas_s_waldo,,3497.317,3498.6,--Thank you.
2008.07-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3498.6,3501.738,"Mr. Olson, you have three minutes remaining."
2008.07-984,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3501.738,3523.834,"What the Respondents would wish to do is to have this Court disagree with the agencies' interpretation of the statutes which they administer, their consistent interpretations of those statutes, and the factual findings that a whole slew of agencies made with respect to the subject matter of these permits."
2008.07-984,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3581.121,3588.594,But I thought -- I thought your brother would say: But that does not respond to 306 effluent.
2008.07-984,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3588.594,3611.042,"--The 306 provisions in the statute are not made applicable to 404 permitting, and the consistent regulatory history from 1973 -- and it's all set out on page 27 of the -- or summarized on page 27 of the government's brief -- are that 301 and 306 are not applicable under the 404 process."
2008.07-984,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3650.864,3668.39,"Why does that mean anything more than you've got to get a 404 permit, without addressing the question whether you can get a 404 permit if it has, in effect, the -- the -- if it has the effects which are supposed to be regulated by the effluent limitations?"
2008.07-984,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3668.39,3684.001,"--That precise question, Justice Souter, is addressed on pages 143, 144, and 145 of this memorandum from top officials of the EPA, applicable to this particular mine and these particular discharges--"
2008.07-984,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3684.001,3685.535,Where is -- where is that in the appendix?
2008.07-984,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3685.535,3689.989,--That's on pages 141 through 145a of the joint appendix.
2008.07-984,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3689.989,3694.107,"But as I read that sentence, Mr. Olson, it says they're subject to both permitting."
2008.07-984,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3694.107,3694.791,"No, it doesn't."
2008.07-984,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3708.867,3710.153,I'm talking about the last sentence on--
2008.07-984,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3710.153,3713.105,"--There is a 402 permit in this case, too."
2008.07-984,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3722.711,3723.661,"Thank you, Mr. Olson."
