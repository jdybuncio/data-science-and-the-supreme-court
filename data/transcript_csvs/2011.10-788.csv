2011.10-788,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.92,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 10-788, Rehberg v. Paulk."
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,8.67,12.491,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-788,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,57.27,64.706,The problem I have with your argument is that I don't really know what a complaining witness is in the grand jury context.
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,71.446,74.214,I think there -- there can be.
2011.10-788,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,78.366,91.424,"A complaining witness I would think is a person who files a complaint, who causes -- in the Federal system it would be someone who files a complaint and attests to it under Rule 5."
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,118.343,137.405,"Well, Your Honor, the common law confronted precisely the same situation, and after public prosecutors came into being and when grand juries were empaneled by them, the common law concluded that, both in 1871 and in the present, that there can be a person who is the motivating force behind the prosecution."
2011.10-788,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,137.405,138.824,A -- a person?
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,159.404,170.293,"Well, Your Honor, at -- at common law the complaining witness was more than just someone who gave evidence that was necessary for the warrant or the indictment to issue."
2011.10-788,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,185.385,189.006,"Well, let me give you another example that I think happens with some frequency."
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,213.639,217.441,"Well, again, Your Honor, there can be."
2011.10-788,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,218.191,219.026,Which one is it?
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,219.026,219.776,--It could be both.
2011.10-788,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,219.776,220.443,Both?
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,220.443,223.078,It could be one or -- it could be -- it could be one or the other.
2011.10-788,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,230.683,233.202,"Mr. Pincus, you said -- I think you used the words"
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,279.597,292.574,"--Well, Your Honor, I -- I don't think we know, because the complaint also alleges that Mr. Paulk knew that his testimony was false and -- and made it -- and gave his testimony anyway."
2011.10-788,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,292.574,298.728,"But if he did it -- if he did at the prosecutor's bidding, then he is not the prime mover."
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,298.728,306.315,"Well, the -- the complaint also alleges that they were conspiring together to bring this complaint."
2011.10-788,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,324.126,324.793,But do you--
2011.10-788,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,324.793,340.305,"What if an important witness is reluctant to testify, but is issued a subpoena by the United States attorney to appear before the grand jury, and then with reluctance he comes forward, but under oath provides all of the key testimony necessary to indict."
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,341.338,343.857,"I think some lower courts have said no, Your Honor."
2011.10-788,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,345.007,347.908,"Well, what's the test we are supposed to use to decide?"
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,347.908,354.814,"--Well, the -- the test that this Court has set forth is whether the complaining witness is someone who sets the prosecution in motion."
2011.10-788,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,367.888,369.674,"In the hypothetical I gave, what's the answer?"
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,369.674,377.078,"--I would say in the hypothetical you gave, Your Honor, that that person is not a complaining witness, because he did nothing other than come forward when he was subpoenaed."
2011.10-788,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,385.934,387.535,"Urges, urges a prosecution."
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,411.834,416.303,--That -- that person may be a complaining witness.
2011.10-788,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,418.671,423.559,"No, he says -- he or she says at the time, I -- I don't want prosecution to go forward."
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,427.361,431.062,--Then -- then that fact would obviously mitigate against her being a complaining witness.
2011.10-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,432.08,433.53,Mitigate?
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,434.513,435.032,--Yes.
2011.10-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,435.682,437.465,Does it make her not a complaining witness?
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,437.465,439.434,"--Yes, she would not be a complaining witness, Your Honor."
2011.10-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,439.434,439.984,Okay.
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,439.984,440.75,But I -- just to step back--
2011.10-788,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,440.75,449.59,The holding -- the holding that you are asking for isn't going to do very much good if the -- if the mere issuance of the grand jury subpoena renders the person not a complaining witness.
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,449.59,450.356,--I don't think--
2011.10-788,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,450.356,452.542,"In that situation, then why not subpoena everybody?"
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,452.542,470.436,"--I don't think the mere issuance of the subpoena does negate things that might -- take the hypothetical where there is someone who goes to the prosecutor, says there should be a prosecution here, maybe does the things that the hospital is alleged to have done in this case, and then subsequently is subpoenaed."
2011.10-788,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,491.5,496.837,"--In a case where the prosecutor is the prime mover, can there ever be a complaining witness?"
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,501.656,504.424,"--I think there can be, Your Honor."
2011.10-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,538.164,541.016,Is the prosecutor a complaining witness?
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,541.016,547.519,The prosecutor can't be a complaining witness because the complaining witness is the person who provides the impetus.
2011.10-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,547.519,549.288,Who instigates the prosecutor.
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,549.288,549.671,Yes.
2011.10-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,549.671,550.171,Okay.
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,552.84,558.311,I'm not -- I'm not sure of the--
2011.10-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,558.311,563.113,"Well, somebody who comes up to somebody and says: You know, you ought to -- you ought to try to start a prosecution against this person."
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,563.113,563.879,--At common law--
2011.10-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,563.879,567.5,"They say: Yeah, that's a good idea."
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,571.052,575.871,--And at common law that person could be -- could be liable for malicious prosecution because--
2011.10-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,575.871,577.539,The person who instigates the instigator?
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,577.539,590.196,"--The person who in testimony -- a complaining witness, as Your Honor pointed out in -- in your opinion in Kalina, a complaining witness does not have to actually participate in the judicial proceedings."
2011.10-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,597.869,602.338,So the instigator of the instigator is -- is a complaining witness or can be?
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,602.338,602.923,--Can be.
2011.10-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,602.923,605.808,"And you know what the next question's going to be, right?"
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,605.808,607.325,But tort law -- I mean--
2011.10-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,607.325,609.944,The instigator of the instigator of the instigator.
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,611.629,612.312,"--I think that's right, Your Honor."
2011.10-788,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,651.818,666.263,"The -- the -- instigator, what you call the complaining witness, would have been -- immunity, identical testimony at the trial itself, right?"
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,666.263,676.218,"Yes, trial -- because -- because -- well, the trial testimony could not be the basis for finding the person a complaining witness because by that point the prosecution has gotten rolling."
2011.10-788,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,684.574,691.478,It's only -- it's only what you call the complaining witness that gets this special treatment?
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,695.782,696.699,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-788,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,703.47,706.155,"Could I make sure I understand what you just said, Mr. Pincus."
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,716.043,718.045,"No, Your Honor, it could be the testimony alone."
2011.10-788,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,737.293,741.845,"Rely on testimony, but rely on testimony exclusively; do you have he a cases that do that?"
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,741.845,747.415,"Well, the cases are -- the case are a little bit obscure, Your Honor, about what the facts are that they are relying on."
2011.10-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,751.383,751.952,I really don't understand.
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,751.952,752.985,--But I think it's a matter of logic.
2011.10-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,752.985,754.335,I don't understand this.
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,764.693,765.51,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2011.10-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,765.51,767.728,Just on the basis of the testimony alone?
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,767.728,768.178,Yes.
2011.10-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,772.616,776.501,"So it's pretty risky to testify in a grand jury proceeding, then, right?"
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,776.501,777.534,"--Well, the same--"
2011.10-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,777.534,781.722,Because even though you haven't -- you don't care whether it comes out that way or not.
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,787.057,796.064,--It's the same risk that the affiants bore in Kalina and Malley and it's the same risk that the common law imposes on complaining witnesses.
2011.10-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,796.064,799.266,"Well, the affiants came forward."
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,821.613,824.232,"Your Honor, maybe I confused the hypotheticals."
2011.10-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,831.153,831.654,Yes.
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,831.654,836.206,I think it would be very hard for that person to be labeled a complaining witness.
2011.10-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,836.206,836.806,Hard or impossible?
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,836.806,837.391,Impossible.
2011.10-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,837.391,839.674,Hard or impossible?
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,839.674,842.293,"I think it would be impossible, because I don't think there's any evidence that that person--"
2011.10-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,842.293,843.212,"That's a different word, thank you."
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,845.512,847.78,--Compelled testimony alone.
2011.10-788,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,852.168,859.405,You said that the issuance of a subpoena in itself is not sufficient to make somebody not a complaining witness.
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,870.196,870.713,"No, Your Honor."
2011.10-788,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,885.472,886.355,If somebody--
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,886.355,898.713,"And then the third situation -- excuse me Your Honor, I was just -- the third situation is where there is pre-testimony evidence and there is also the fact that that person testified under subpoena."
2011.10-788,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,910.805,928.766,"What is the reason why, if we give absolute immunity to the witness at a trial, we give absolute immunity to the prosecutors and government officials at the trial, and a grand jury is sort of like a trial, at least it's testimony under oath."
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,957.633,960.401,"Well, I think there are two reasons, Your Honor."
2011.10-788,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,968.257,969.657,Suppose I don't accept that.
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,990.673,998.193,"--Well, one -- one brief disagreement with your question, Your Honor."
2011.10-788,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1000.545,1001.778,You can't disagree with my question.
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1004.514,1005.449,But--
2011.10-788,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1005.449,1006.432,I would like an answer to my question.
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1006.432,1008.218,--The answer is several-fold.
2011.10-788,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1062.203,1069.44,"Well, I thought the whole point of the grand jury was to protect citizens from unwarranted prosecutions."
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1088.253,1107.398,"I -- I think -- well, we talk about them, I think, because of the reality that there are cases and the common law recognized that there were cases where the reason the prosecution got rolling was because either a private person or a government person was the person who was pushing it along."
2011.10-788,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1107.398,1108.432,"Well, somebody's is not--"
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1108.432,1109.85,It's true that the grand jury -- I'm sorry.
2011.10-788,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1109.85,1110.584,"--No, go ahead."
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1110.584,1126.126,"--the grand jury's decision is a step in the chain, but the Court has not said that, for example, the judge's decision in Kalina and Malley to issue the warrant broke the causal link between the false testimony in the affidavits in those case."
2011.10-788,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1155.146,1158.431,The question is where do you locate the grand jury?
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1186.95,1191.988,"Well, the first reason, Your And Honor, is because that's what the common law did."
2011.10-788,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1228.677,1235.515,--At common law did any grand jury witnesses have absolute immunity from a claim for malicious prosecution?
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1235.515,1243.353,"Well, common law -- at common law -- at common law it wasn't a question of immunity."
2011.10-788,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1246.138,1246.988,"Well, could--"
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1246.988,1249.007,The only liability was for malicious prosecution.
2011.10-788,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1249.007,1256.594,"--And could there be malicious prosecution liability for a witness before a grand jury who was not a ""complaining witness""."
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1256.594,1259.965,"No, and that's the source of the distinction that the Court drew in Malley and Kalina."
2011.10-788,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1259.965,1263.85,"So you are not really asking us to adopt the common law rule, are you?"
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1278.777,1281.811,"No, Your Honor, we're not."
2011.10-788,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1294.969,1299.69,"So if I understand your answer, that you're not -- that this whole business about complaining witness is irrelevant."
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1302.808,1303.525,"No, Your Honor, it's complaining witnesses."
2011.10-788,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1338.165,1346.185,A complaining witness could -- who would satisfy the elements of the malicious prosecution tort could be liable?
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1346.185,1346.752,Yes.
2011.10-788,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1346.752,1348.204,All right.
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1349.287,1367.515,"Well, what the Court has said, it said in Malley and Kalina, and what we're relying on here, is that those -- those people also -- Congress would have recognized in 1871 that there could be liability for people who fell into this category -- and so--"
2011.10-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1367.515,1373.754,"Well, you're saying that the only people who would be subject to suit for the malicious prosecution tort were complaining witnesses?"
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1373.754,1374.288,--Yes.
2011.10-788,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1374.288,1389.948,"Mr. Pincus, you in answer to one of Justice Kagan's questions, you noted that you really can't find a case where a court relied exclusively on the grand jury testimony."
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1398.803,1400.921,"I think that's right, Your Honor."
2011.10-788,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1403.623,1421.069,Could you tell me what -- the United States as amica is supporting a vacatur and remand on the ground that there might be adequate independent evidence from the grand jury testimony in this case to sustain a cause of action.
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1441.815,1459.444,"Well, there -- there is independent evidence in this case, Your Honor of -- before the Respondent testified before the grand jury there were -- there are allegations that he conspired with the district attorney and others to fabricate the -- the evidence that he gave."
2011.10-788,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1460.377,1468.9,"Now, the court below took that into account and said: You are only relying on the grand jury testimony to prove the conspiracy and that's not enough."
2011.10-788,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1468.9,1486.177,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that what the Eleventh Circuit said was because this was all directed to the grand jury testimony, we're not going to separate, uphold -- hold that there could be liability based on that alone."
2011.10-788,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1554.339,1555.005,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,1558.473,1560.142,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2011.10-788,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1595.582,1610.023,"You would acknowledge that if someone instigates the grand jury proceeding but does not testify, that person could be sued if indeed the instigation was malicious?"
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,1610.023,1616.846,--If it's outside of the grand jury -- and I go for the but-for test like the--
2011.10-788,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1616.846,1619.714,"No, no, no, just answer my question."
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,1634.724,1638.259,"--Yes, that person could be sued under the but-for standard."
2011.10-788,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1638.259,1646.015,"So all he has to do to get himself off the hook is, after instigating it, he should testify, right?"
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,1649.833,1651.033,"No, that isn't."
2011.10-788,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1651.835,1660.358,"So all you are arguing, then, is that there has to be some evidence other than the mere testimony; is that your point?"
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,1660.358,1661.691,--That is my point.
2011.10-788,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1661.691,1662.291,Okay.
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,1662.291,1665.177,That there has to be some evidence other than the mere testimony.
2011.10-788,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1671.331,1695.379,"Then you agree with the position that the United States took, which is you can -- if there was evidence outside of the grand jury proceeding that this person was the instigator, that that could be the basis for a malicious prosecution 1983 claim?"
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,1712.074,1725.467,"The way I understand the Solicitor General's position was that if the only way that you could prove the allegation was to use the grand jury testimony, then indeed you could not bring a suit under 1983."
2011.10-788,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1742.86,1744.112,"But, Mr. Jones, do you--"
2011.10-788,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1744.112,1749.683,"Well, do you agree that we should vacate and remand according to the suggestion of the Solicitor General?"
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,1749.683,1750.216,"--No, Your Honor."
2011.10-788,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1750.216,1751.649,And why is that?
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,1751.649,1752.385,Well--
2011.10-788,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1752.385,1757.02,"Is it just because of your view of the evidence, that there is no evidence to justify the remand?"
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,1757.02,1758.788,"--Well, that's certainly one of the issues."
2011.10-788,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1769.929,1773.214,Are you saying that this was waived is just not in the case?
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,1776.85,1782.32,"--That's correct, it was waived and it's -- and it's not before the Court and that's not why cert was granted."
2011.10-788,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1782.32,1783.537,I don't understand how it was waived.
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,1787.208,1794.212,It was never presented by any side at any -- to any place in the court below.
2011.10-788,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1794.212,1813.775,"Well, but if -- if there is -- if there is a theory of liability and we find that there is -- that that theory is baseless, we don't generally dismiss the complaint if there are other allegations in the complaint that could support liability on another theory."
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,1813.775,1820.612,"Well, certainly, I mean, this case has to be -- it's going back to the district court anyway, as Your Honor is well aware."
2011.10-788,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1828.535,1843.294,"--So, Mr. Jones, could I understand your responses to these questions, because you said to Justice Scalia the fact that there's been testimony at the grand jury does not, if you will, immunize the person from suit based on other acts."
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,1849.531,1854.683,"If you look at common law, that's exactly what happened."
2011.10-788,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1897.095,1908.57,"So all you are saying is that there is absolute immunity for a suit based exclusively on grand jury testimony, and if the suit is based on something else the grand jury testimony can come in."
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,1908.57,1915.241,"That is correct, if indeed it's an independent cause of action outside of the court, yes."
2011.10-788,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1915.241,1924.262,"I don't know what an independent cause of action could be, because it is the grand jury proceeding that initiates the action."
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,1980.616,1990.991,"First of all, to respond, one, our position with respect to the Solicitor General on that issue, I don't see it as any different."
2011.10-788,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2027.93,2034.184,"Is it different from -- I mean, I find the Solicitor General -- it's my fault, I'm sure -- I don't understand the position they're taking."
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,2098.443,2102.495,--I hope I have as well.
2011.10-788,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2115.405,2124.511,"When you say absolutely immune, I'm thinking of a typical case as follows: Smith says to his friend: I hate that rat Jones."
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,2158.165,2162.051,First of all -- and it might be a difficult time.
2011.10-788,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2212.802,2214.102,But there's always something else.
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,2234.315,2251.427,"--Sure, but the case law says that if the prosecutor would not have taken the case, or would not have done the case but for the conduct for the individual, then indeed you cannot bring the cause of action."
2011.10-788,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2251.427,2253.96,I have the same -- I have the same concern as Justice Breyer.
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,2284.398,2306.177,"It does exist, because typically when you have an investigation in any type of district attorney's office, what you have is investigators going out and investigating a case, bringing the material to the district attorney, then the district attorney looks at the material, and then the district attorney is the one that makes an independent decision."
2011.10-788,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2306.177,2308.613,"--Well, let's go back one stage."
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,2347.838,2382.577,"The distinction in Malley is -- is this: First of all, the -- in Malley and when you go apply for a warrant, the -- at that point in time the investigator is, he is determining -- he or she is determining the time, place, and manner in which to go to the judge and also possibly he can, he or she can select the judge that the person wants to go for."
2011.10-788,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2410.429,2428.306,"Suppose -- suppose we had, instead of a grand jury proceeding and an indictment, an accusation to begin the prosecution and a supporting affidavit in connection with the accusation."
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,2439.348,2447.452,"If I understand your question, and I'm not sure I heard it exactly, are you saying if there's an affidavit that went before the grand jury?"
2011.10-788,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2447.452,2447.952,No.
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,2488.179,2496.351,"Once again, that's a scenario essentially in Malley and Kalina, where you had those individuals coming before."
2011.10-788,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2503.788,2515.346,But you -- you cited a provision of the Georgia Code that seems to equate what's called an accusation with an indictment.
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,2561.643,2580.639,"And -- and I'm not positive I understand the question, but as I understand it what you have in a Malley situation is again you have somebody that is merely coming before the judge in the hope of getting a warrant to issue."
2011.10-788,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2638.993,2643.697,"So explain to me again -- over here, Mr. Jones."
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,2674.649,2681.736,"It is the position that it can be, and -- and I hate to say -- equivocate there."
2011.10-788,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2704.765,2705.351,"No, no, no, no."
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,2736.304,2738.589,"--Under that scenario, no."
2011.10-788,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2760.186,2761.438,I don't understand.
2011.10-788,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2761.438,2763.554,You have a time sheet that shows that the prosecutor met with--
2011.10-788,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2763.554,2764.723,Yes.
2011.10-788,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2764.723,2766.273,--the investigator?
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,2766.273,2767.858,I'm sorry?
2011.10-788,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2767.858,2768.692,You have a time sheet.
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,2779.9,2788.171,"I mean, do you need a witness to come and testify as to whether they had a communication?"
2011.10-788,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2788.171,2788.638,"Yes, exactly."
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,2789.705,2796.359,It -- it would appear that that would certainly be an element that you would have to establish.
2011.10-788,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2802.013,2808.0,Do you regard the grand jury as a judicial proceeding?
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,2808.0,2808.919,"Yes, I do."
2011.10-788,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2823.928,2824.611,But there's no judge.
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,2843.923,2854.464,"Well, it has many more of the trappings of a trial than, say, coming before a judge like in the Malley scenario."
2011.10-788,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2904.997,2913.436,Is the prosecutor immune -- I know the prosecutor is not immune or the complaining witness is not when they get an arrest warrant.
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,2919.84,2920.573,Yes.
2011.10-788,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2920.573,2921.508,He is immune?
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,2921.508,2921.992,Yes.
2011.10-788,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2921.992,2922.708,All right.
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,2927.846,2928.479,That is correct.
2011.10-788,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2928.479,2932.564,"Of course, this isn't a prosecutor; this is a subordinate."
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,2935.683,2940.237,"No, the person here is the investigator who is employed by the prosecutor."
2011.10-788,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2980.547,2995.056,"--Is there any subordinate government official involved when a prosecutor gets an information, files an information or -- the way you get somebody indicted is you have an indictment, which is the grand jury, I guess."
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,2995.056,2995.556,Right.
2011.10-788,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2995.556,2996.34,Or an information.
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,2996.34,2996.873,Right.
2011.10-788,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2996.873,2997.606,All right.
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,3005.012,3006.462,There can be.
2011.10-788,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3006.462,3007.964,"--There can be, okay."
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,3019.272,3025.843,Just if he's asking for an arrest warrant; is that what--
2011.10-788,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3025.843,3027.076,"No, he's not immune."
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,3030.011,3033.096,--He files the information and it's not in a grand jury setting.
2011.10-788,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3033.096,3033.698,No.
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,3033.698,3039.335,"Then indeed, I would suggest it's very similar to the Malley scenario, where he would have qualified immunity."
2011.10-788,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3039.335,3041.819,"And that would go for the prosecutor, too, right?"
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,3041.819,3043.221,No.
2011.10-788,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3043.221,3045.239,For the information?
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,3070.821,3071.871,Yes.
2011.10-788,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3091.552,3096.356,Why isn't an arrest warrant intimately associated?
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,3096.356,3104.878,"Well, an arrest warrant in the -- like in the Kalina and Malley situation, you didn't have a prosecutor going before them."
2011.10-788,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3115.35,3130.01,"Paragraph 29 of the complaint alleges Mr. Paulk and Mr. Hodges, acting under color of law, in retaliation and wrongfully influenced and instigated the prosecutorial decision to bring charges against Mr. Rehberg."
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,3143.253,3159.446,"Because -- just because they allegedly conspired together to do this doesn't mean the act was completed until after, in this case, Mr. Hodges and it was actually Kelly Burke, actually performed what they did."
2011.10-788,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3203.391,3206.51,"Mr. Jones, I feel as though now we are just arguing about facts."
2011.10-788,1,31188,john_c_jones,,3230.209,3231.209,No.
2011.10-788,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3331.757,3332.907,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-788,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3334.709,3336.911,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-788,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3440.476,3449.851,"Suppose this a jurisdiction that didn't have grand juries, but returned felony indictments by means of the preliminary hearing, would a witness at a preliminary hearing have absolute immunity?"
2011.10-788,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3452.234,3465.142,"--A -- a complaining witness, I don't think -- if that is the proceeding that sets the prospect, determines whether or not there is going to be a prosecution, I think an ordinary witness would be absolutely immune but a complaining witness would not be."
2011.10-788,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3465.142,3467.775,Are there States that have that?
2011.10-788,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3475.098,3476.281,"Yes, there are."
2011.10-788,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3478.8,3480.151,Today are there a lot?
2011.10-788,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3480.151,3481.684,--There are -- I don't know the number.
2011.10-788,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3481.684,3483.786,"I mean, is there any way to find out what's happened?"
2011.10-788,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3491.123,3491.49,Well--
2011.10-788,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3491.49,3494.994,Can you give me an example of one or two States that allow these actions?
2011.10-788,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3494.994,3497.879,"--Well, I can -- I can't give you an example of States."
2011.10-788,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3503.6,3504.383,For how long have they had that?
2011.10-788,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3504.383,3504.95,--Excuse me?
2011.10-788,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3504.95,3505.717,For how long?
