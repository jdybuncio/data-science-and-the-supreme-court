1999.8_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.754,"We'll hear argument next in No. 8, Original, the State of Arizona v. the State of California."
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,29.685,32.72,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.8_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,70.744,80.135,"Mr. Minear, where do we find the best map showing the boundaries of the land in question?"
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,80.135,87.622,"I think the...  the best map would be that that is appended to the tribe's brief, the red-colored brief."
1999.8_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,87.622,88.372,Okay.
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,88.372,90.741,There are two maps here.
1999.8_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,94.443,98.929,"Well, the big one is just...  it's too small to see."
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,105.417,110.221,"I was looking at locator map number 2 that's also included here, yes, the one that you're showing me there."
1999.8_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,110.221,118.225,And are the...  is it blue boundary that...  in that map that shows the land in question?
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,118.225,122.629,"I believe that's so, although it's actually more complicated than that because due to a number..."
1999.8_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,122.629,127.783,I just couldn't find anything that really showed me what we were dealing with.
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,131.568,138.288,"Yes, with...  with the understanding that there are a number of allotments and other lands that are excepted from that area."
1999.8_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,138.288,138.854,Yes.
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,138.854,139.673,The actual lands...
1999.8_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,139.673,143.708,"But...  and the total is some 25,000 acres?"
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,143.708,144.894,That is correct.
1999.8_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,147.66,160.734,"And is all of that land practicably irrigable as the...  the cases deal with that term, all 25,000 acres, or some smaller portion of it?"
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,160.734,161.901,"A smaller portion of it, Your Honor."
1999.8_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,161.901,165.186,And we don't know how much because it hasn't been determined?
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,165.186,166.138,That is correct.
1999.8_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,182.981,189.57,"And the preliminary studies show how...  how much in acre-feet of water year are we talking about, probably?"
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,189.57,193.289,"I think it could be as much as 70,000 acre-feet."
1999.8_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,193.289,199.859,And how would that impact on existing distribution and users?
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,201.795,207.715,"It's a relatively small amount, but of course, we're dealing with a part of the country where all water is quite precious."
1999.8_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,242.638,259.397,"Well, Mr. Minear, now the Government takes the position here with respect to the preclusion claim which the Master rejected; that is, the change of position on the part of the Government when the Interior Solicitor changed his mind."
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,273.507,276.276,"That hasn't been our...  been our argument, no."
1999.8_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,296.689,304.112,"Mr. Minear, I think that the States are saying there's some kind of special preclusion rule that they call a statutory preclusion."
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,315.068,322.674,"Your Honor, the...  the State parties are referring to the provisions for claim preclusion that exist in the Indian Claims Commission Act."
1999.8_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,387.949,413.33,"Do you think it really was the...  the intent of the legislation that established the Indian Claims Commission that the United States should acquire a judgment which lets the United States off and settles matters as far as the Government is concerned but leaves all of the settlers who...  who are on the reservation entirely up in the air as to whether...  you know, what their rights are with respect to the land?"
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,413.33,415.532,"Well, first, with regard to this claim, none of those..."
1999.8_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,415.532,418.801,It doesn't seem to me that a...  that a just...  just Government would do something like that.
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,418.801,423.705,"None of those issues...  in this case those issues will not arise, and the reason is this."
1999.8_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,448.254,450.437,How are they protected by the Secretary's '78 order?
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,451.054,466.466,"The...  the Secretary's '78 order, followed by the Secretary's 1981 order, identified the particular tracts of land that are owned by private persons that the tribe has no claim to, and the tribe has...  has indicated that it agrees with that...  that outcome."
1999.8_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,469.767,472.285,"Well, they might change their mind in the future."
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,480.656,488.729,"Well, I don't believe they changed their mind about this, that the tribe's positions...  they've put forward alternative positions, but they have been consistent."
1999.8_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,488.729,491.329,"Well, the Secretary certainly changed his mind about this."
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,491.329,496.483,"The Secretary did change his mind, but the position since 1978 has been consistent."
1999.8_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,496.483,515.879,"Now, what if...  what if the...  what if we were to accept the State's submission that the Special Master's ruling on that aspect of res judicata was wrong and that the fact that the Government changed its mind is not a basis for going back into the case again?"
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,522.049,534.358,"Well, I think that our position here is that the...  the Secretary was entitled...  this matter had not been determined and had been preserved by this Court's decision in Arizona I in its decree in 1979."
1999.8_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,534.891,547.934,"Yes, but the...  the...  it was argued to the Special Master that the Secretary's changing his mind, not just the Solicitor's changing his mind, was something that avoided the effect of res judicata."
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,547.934,550.6,"No, I'm afraid I don't understand that argument."
1999.8_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,553.152,568.162,"I...  as I read these...  the Master's report, it said that the...  it was an unforeseen circumstance that the Margold opinion would be reversed by a...  a later Solicitor and that, therefore, res judicata didn't apply."
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,568.162,574.018,That was...  that was the ruling that the Master gave in rejecting the State's argument with regard to res judicata.
1999.8_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,574.018,574.284,Right.
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,574.284,579.17,"I think the Master's decision, his judgment, should still be affirmed for a quite different reason, and that is that this Court in Arizona I made clear that the boundary land issues would simply not be reached in this litigation in Arizona I."
1999.8_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,602.685,610.024,"Well, what was the reason then for arguing preclusion on this basis before the Master if it didn't make any difference?"
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,610.024,615.511,"Well, we think that the...  the Master simply misunderstood the law and the prior proceedings here."
1999.8_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,639.393,643.678,"Well, it said boundary land issues with regard to reservations, other than this one."
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,647.214,650.768,"In 1963, they addressed two boundary land issues..."
1999.8_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,650.768,651.134,Right.
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,651.134,651.818,the Fort Mojave...
1999.8_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,651.818,652.151,Right.
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,652.151,654.22,and the Colorado River Indian Reservation.
1999.8_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,720.678,727.332,How does that...  that's the...  when you say judicial review...  maybe you could answer this later if I'm not right on the point.
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,746.58,747.546,That's basically correct.
1999.8_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,747.546,749.515,But suppose we accept your arguments completely.
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,759.303,759.887,That's...
1999.8_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,759.887,761.505,And so what's supposed to happen next?
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,773.813,774.413,That's correct.
1999.8_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,774.413,774.832,All right.
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,777.482,788.688,"Right now at the...  after the...  the California case, the Ninth Circuit decision, this Court appointed Special Master McGarr to decide these issues and we thought to decide them on the merits."
1999.8_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,788.688,789.956,"So, he's supposed to decide."
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,798.145,798.678,Yes.
1999.8_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,806.149,809.101,I know but you can't get the water till you decide who owns the land.
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,809.101,809.601,Yes.
1999.8_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,809.601,813.588,"And...  and so, it's...  I just wanted to know who is supposed to decide that if you are right."
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,813.588,814.221,Yes.
1999.8_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,814.221,815.471,And the answer is the Special Master.
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,815.471,816.607,The Special Master should decide it.
1999.8_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,816.607,820.409,"Well, actually this Court should decide it upon the..."
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,820.409,821.844,Recommendation.
1999.8_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,821.844,823.377,recommendation of the Master I assume.
1999.8_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,823.377,824.062,"Correct, correct, correct."
1999.8_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,824.062,824.662,Is that correct?
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,824.662,825.812,That is...  that is correct.
1999.8_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,825.812,827.697,I don't think we should do it without sending it back.
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,827.697,832.149,"To...  to be specific, obviously this Court acts with the assistance of the Special Master."
1999.8_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,842.707,862.268,"Now, there was a case from the Ninth Circuit in the Pend Orielle case that seemed to apply issue preclusive effect to the Indian Claims Commission judgment in a suit between the tribe in that case and third parties."
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,871.793,874.159,"Well, Your Honor, I think there's a distinction here."
1999.8_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,880.479,880.963,Cannot be.
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,882.079,882.579,There cannot be.
1999.8_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,915.486,923.073,"So, you say if...  if the Claims Commission procedure had really dealt specifically and expressly with the issues, then fine."
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,923.073,924.04,That's correct.
1999.8_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,924.04,924.592,Preclusion.
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,924.592,925.158,That's right.
1999.8_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,925.158,926.992,But that that didn't happen here?
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,926.992,928.21,That's correct.
1999.8_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,942.534,943.72,What...  what page are you reading from?
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,943.72,946.755,"This is 66a of the gray brief, our exceptions brief."
1999.8_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,946.755,947.455,Thank you.
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,947.455,950.573,Judgment is rendered for plaintiff in the amount of $ 15 million.
1999.8_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,967.85,976.372,"Well, can...  can a court limit the preclusive effect of its judgment, I mean, by simply saying this shall not have preclusive effect?"
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,976.372,979.926,"Well, I think that a court can...  has that power."
1999.8_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,987.596,989.532,Let me just get one thing clear.
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1005.042,1007.326,It certainly was not actually litigated and determined.
1999.8_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1007.326,1012.897,"It wasn't litigated, but was it an issue that conceivably the settlement might have been intended to resolve?"
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1012.897,1014.88,"Well, there are two...  two different approaches, yes."
1999.8_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1039.397,1042.599,The judgment itself didn't say which of those two views it was taking.
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1042.599,1043.567,That's correct.
1999.8_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1043.567,1052.522,"They may have gotten money either for the taking or for the fact that although it hadn't been taken, the Government had occupied it temporarily for some time."
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1052.522,1053.272,From the judgment...
1999.8_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1053.272,1055.157,You can't tell which of the two they were given the money for.
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1055.157,1056.04,You cannot from the judgment.
1999.8_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1064.396,1071.084,That...  that was put in...  that second theory...  by an amendment later on.
1999.8_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1075.386,1075.886,No.
1999.8_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1097.651,1098.667,"Very well, Mr. Minear."
1999.8_orig,1,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1100.186,1104.821,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.8_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1159.558,1162.091,"This is...  this is...  where were you reading from, Mr. Morisset?"
1999.8_orig,1,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1162.091,1164.86,This is...  this is page 10a of our red brief.
1999.8_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1166.379,1167.612,Whereabouts on the page?
1999.8_orig,1,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1167.612,1170.68,"The very top of the page, top of page 10a."
1999.8_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1170.68,1171.698,"Oh, thank you."
1999.8_orig,1,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1171.698,1181.221,"Now, if the question to me is...  and I think this is implied...  does the tribe have a claim against settlers, the answer is no."
1999.8_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1200.133,1203.652,What about that provision at the end of the opinion?
1999.8_orig,1,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1211.84,1224.131,"Well, if...  I think it would be useable in the sense that you need to look beyond...  behind the agreement to see what happened at the time and whether or not the tribe has any claim left on those kinds of claims."
1999.8_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1225.833,1227.452,"So, it useable then."
1999.8_orig,1,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1227.452,1229.802,I don't think it's useable by the tribe.
1999.8_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1232.171,1239.51,"That doesn't square with my understanding of that provision at the end of the...  at the end of the settlement agreement, but..."
1999.8_orig,1,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1239.51,1240.41,Well...
1999.8_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1240.41,1240.993,it would be nice.
1999.8_orig,1,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1243.562,1256.888,"I think it...  I think it's clear from the language and the underlying facts that at the time the tribe and the United States were in complete agreement on who owned the land, and the answer was the United States in trust for the tribe."
1999.8_orig,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1344.058,1350.478,"Mr. Morisset, would you explain that to me in relation to the famous 1978 decision?"
1999.8_orig,1,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1385.518,1408.251,"Well, the...  Special Master Tuttle found...  and I don't think that that would be overturned on a...  a new remand to a new special master...  that in fact there were...  there was some irrigable acreage and there was a great deal of technical discussion about what that meant, having to do with soil types, whether you could get water there, whether you could grow crops or not."
1999.8_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1446.476,1449.678,"Mr. Muys, we'll hear from you."
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,1449.678,1454.482,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.8_orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1622.992,1633.93,But it also included the tribe's claim that it was their land all along and the damages were for trespass on land to which they held or the Government as trustee held title.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,1633.93,1635.049,"That is correct, Justice..."
1999.8_orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1635.049,1637.584,And it settled that claim too.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,1637.584,1647.373,"It had a whole array of claims in their petition, including all the language I think from the Indian Claims Commission Act, unfair and dishonorable dealings with the Government."
1999.8_orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1657.129,1657.979,How do you know that...
1999.8_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1657.979,1667.77,"Well, I...  I suppose the usual rule is that when lands are...  are taken and there...  there is...  is a finding in favor of the previous owner, the Government ends up owning those lands."
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,1673.857,1674.54,No.
1999.8_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1713.815,1714.251,Is that right?
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,1726.742,1727.292,Yes.
1999.8_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1727.292,1734.296,"And a settlement can't transfer title unless...  unless, you know, these certain formalities are...  certainly wouldn't cut off third parties."
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,1747.306,1750.924,"Well, they're something special in the Indian Claims Commission Act, Justice Breyer."
1999.8_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1750.924,1751.24,All right.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,1757.727,1758.427,Quite correct.
1999.8_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1758.427,1758.927,All right.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,1766.0,1774.57,"Well, the words of that act make it clear that the...  the claims brought by the tribe against the United States are extinguished as against the United States."
1999.8_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1774.57,1774.856,No.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,1779.074,1779.608,Correct.
1999.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1795.283,1795.685,Okay.
1999.8_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1795.685,1801.855,That's the part I don't quite see because why be extinguished as except against the United States?
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,1806.207,1810.159,Because otherwise the act's finality purposes would be utterly frustrated.
1999.8_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1821.683,1823.168,"If litigated, absolutely."
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,1824.602,1838.762,"Well, the act does not...  we agree with the Government and the tribes that under collateral estoppel you need a litigated, adjudicated issue before you...  there's any preclusion, but not under the Indian Claims Commission Act."
1999.8_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1861.96,1867.714,"So...  so, all settlements under the Indian Claims Commission Act must be treated as adjudications?"
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,1867.714,1879.589,"I think as a practical matter, that's...  that's the result of the statute and that's the way the Ninth Circuit and the Eighth Circuit have interpreted final judgments by the Claims Court on Indian Claims Commission..."
1999.8_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1879.589,1882.624,Are you relying on the Pend Orielle case?
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,1882.624,1883.474,"Yes, Pend Orielle..."
1999.8_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1883.474,1886.426,"But there, there was specific..."
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,1886.426,1888.176,There were specific findings.
1999.8_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1888.176,1891.478,"litigation of the issue and findings, and we don't have it here."
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,1898.048,1913.926,"Well, you have...  you have the judgment and the...  I read the part of the judgment that says all the tribe's claims are...  that could have been asserted can no longer be asserted against the United States or in any future action, which we read as against anybody."
1999.8_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1929.853,1933.038,"But that's of those cases, if you're looking at it."
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,1933.038,1933.455,Right.
1999.8_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1933.455,1936.609,Is there any one...  I grant you the Ninth Circuit says this sort of thing.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,1936.609,1937.075,Right.
1999.8_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1937.075,1937.741,And that...  that's their law.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,1937.741,1938.308,Right.
1999.8_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1938.308,1948.281,"But in the cases themselves, is there any case that doesn't involve either a litigated matter or findings that have the equivalent effect?"
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,1948.281,1963.642,"Well, the...  the cases the Special Master relied on, Gemmill and Pend Orielle, were settlement judgments, but there had been earlier litigation on liability in which there were findings made by the Indians Claims Commission."
1999.8_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2021.062,2045.51,"Mr. Muys, the problem I have...  I...  I can accept your...  your proposition that the...  that settlements under the Claims Commission Act are...  are different and that even if the matter is not litigated, it...  it is binding on the parties, and if they say so, as they did here, as against other parties as well."
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2061.722,2064.091,"Well, the fact..."
1999.8_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2064.091,2073.53,"the land was taken away from us and you owe us damage for taking it away, or the land wasn't taken away from us and you owe us damages for trespassing on it."
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2086.521,2088.473,"We say all of the above, Your Honor."
1999.8_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2088.473,2089.989,"Well, you can't."
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2091.658,2101.014,"Five of the laundry list of all sorts of claims, but the judgment says that I quoted...  and this is at page 18 of our reply brief."
1999.8_orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2117.106,2118.106,But if you say...
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2130.93,2131.48,Right.
1999.8_orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2131.48,2140.669,"for the special preclusion effect of these settlements, as far as I know, none of them put forth this alternative."
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2161.415,2174.057,"There is, and...  and I think we...  we tried to emphasize, as the Ninth Circuit and we think this Court in approving the Ninth Circuit's several Dann decisions agreed, that the Indian Claims Commission Act is something unique."
1999.8_orig,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2174.057,2186.531,"But even...  even on the Indian Claims Act preclusion, shouldn't we consider in fact...  or may we not at least consider, for whatever value it may have, the...  the amount of money that they got?"
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2251.64,2255.175,"Well, we think it's not appropriate to go behind the judgment, Your Honor."
1999.8_orig,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2256.242,2259.144,The...  the judgment includes the $15 million.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2259.144,2262.679,"Yes, but it also says $15 million is for all claims that were asserted."
1999.8_orig,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2266.5,2268.782,Because you can't have it...  you say all of the above.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2321.384,2324.586,You mean figure out what $ 15 million may have bought?
1999.8_orig,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2324.586,2339.329,"Well, figure...  take the $ 15 million as support for the claim that they...  the argument that they are making here, that the only thing they settled was the trespass claim plus incidentals."
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2345.935,2363.211,"Well, actually on...  on your point, Your Honor, the tribe concedes...  and the fact is that the...  if you were paying for 25,000 acres of raw desert land that was taken in...  in 1893, it would be worth...  I believe something in the record...  about 50 cents an acre."
1999.8_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2369.098,2370.15,"Well, also that whole..."
1999.8_orig,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2370.15,2372.0,You're saying you can't reason that way.
1999.8_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2372.0,2376.97,That whole analysis assumes that the tribe is 100 percent correct in...  in its...  in its legal position...
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2376.97,2377.57,That's right.
1999.8_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2377.57,2380.589,without any discount for the fact that it may be wrong.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2380.589,2396.118,"When you look at the...  what happened after this Court's decision in Arizona II, as we point out in our brief, the Government backed away from what it says was its complete agreement with the tribe that...  conclusively...  the tribe conclusively got title in the 1978 Secretary's opinion."
1999.8_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2405.64,2411.21,That's entirely fair to play it both ways as against the Government.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2455.322,2458.608,"We don't think they lead to inconsistent results, Your Honor."
1999.8_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2462.576,2462.893,"Sure, they do."
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2475.218,2488.543,"But when the tribe brings a claim for a taking and the Government pays them for that claim and a whole bunch of other claims, and then the Government and the tribe draft an unambiguous judgment which says all claims, everything in there, are gone..."
1999.8_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2488.543,2493.179,"Well, I thought...  I thought they brought a claim for more than a taking, that they have..."
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2493.179,2493.697,They did.
1999.8_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2493.697,2494.764,alternative theories.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2513.009,2515.861,It would have been very easy to say what they were settling in the judgment.
1999.8_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2515.861,2517.563,"Well, but they're telling us now."
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2522.599,2539.326,"But...  but it's their...  it was their judgment, and I guess if the parole evidence rule means anything and if finality of judgments means anything, as Judge McGarr said, if a final judgment that says you're getting $15 million and your title is extinguished means anything, this argument is completely specious."
1999.8_orig,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2544.297,2546.23,Why does it mean your title is extinguished?
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2546.23,2547.249,Because that's what...
1999.8_orig,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2547.249,2548.649,It means you don't have a claim against the Government.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2550.868,2565.211,"Well, the Ninth Circuit, which...  this is the circuit that done most of the interpreting of the act, has said that the effect of the compensated judgment under the Indian Claims Commission Act, when you had a...  a takings claim is to extinguish the tribe's title."
1999.8_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2565.211,2565.744,Is that...  is that...
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2567.413,2568.013,Not in...
1999.8_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2568.013,2573.666,"it were only a takings claim, but it wasn't only a...  it was an alternative claim for either a taking or...  or a trespass."
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2584.105,2584.822,"Well, but what is..."
1999.8_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2584.822,2586.057,because they were alternative theories.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2586.057,2587.041,the basis for even going behind the judgment?
1999.8_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2592.445,2594.897,I...  I assume you're right about that.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2594.897,2595.297,Yes.
1999.8_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2595.297,2601.717,"I assume you're right about that, but I still want to go in just a little bit to ask you about the Ninth Circuit's holding..."
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2601.717,2602.334,Certainly.
1999.8_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2602.334,2612.441,"because has the Ninth Circuit said that the Indian Claims Commission, when in...  in a situation like this, it extinguishes claims of third parties?"
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2613.908,2614.558,Yes.
1999.8_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2614.558,2616.993,"In other words, title passes as against the world?"
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2642.878,2644.344,"Well, they didn't..."
1999.8_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2644.344,2647.595,You're saying that...  that was Justice Souter's question.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2674.515,2681.252,"Well, all I can say, Your Honor, is that Congress was very concerned about having finality come to these Indian claims."
1999.8_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2681.252,2681.719,Sorry.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2699.597,2704.882,"Well, they said it quiets title as against the world as far as the tribe's name."
1999.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2706.834,2709.119,You're...  you're not arguing here that the world is...
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2709.119,2709.402,No.
1999.8_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2709.836,2712.921,"That's...  so, that was the answer to Justice Souter's question."
1999.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2714.273,2719.558,"Well, you're simply saying that the tribe is bound because it was a party to the thing."
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2719.558,2722.11,"Right, and the judgment extinguished their title."
1999.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2722.11,2728.164,There's no third party...  no third party relying...  going against the judgment.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2728.164,2728.531,No.
1999.8_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2731.985,2733.235,Then...  then that is my question.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2733.235,2733.735,that's the end of it.
1999.8_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2733.735,2733.901,All right.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2752.463,2765.27,Because the Indian Claims Commission Act superseded ordinary common law rules of collateral estoppel and res judicata and established a statutory bar that takes effect when payment is made to a tribe for their claims.
1999.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2781.815,2782.199,Mr. Muys?
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2782.199,2783.882,but it was resurrected somehow...
1999.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2783.882,2786.867,Are you going to cover the State's other res judicata argument?
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2786.867,2788.636,"I'd be happy to move that, Your Honor."
1999.8_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2873.622,2880.192,"But the so-called omitted lands...  correct me if I'm wrong...  were...  were not within the disputed boundary areas, were they?"
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2880.192,2880.792,They were not.
1999.8_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2882.744,2891.167,And...  and I...  I had thought that the decrees of the Court in Arizona I and II indicated that it was not conclusive as to the boundary lands.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2891.167,2892.667,It's true.
1999.8_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2906.51,2912.931,"So, it seems to me that...  that the Court's treatment of omitted lands and boundary lands for preclusive purposes is quite different."
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,2912.931,2918.167,"Well, no...  no preclusion argument was made with respect to boundary lands, Your Honor."
1999.8_orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2992.033,3008.677,"It's kind of ironic for you to be making that claim when you woke up later, and you do acknowledge that...  that any preclusion claim is ordinarily an affirmative defense, and if you don't raise it on time..."
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,3008.677,3009.377,Correct.
1999.8_orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3009.377,3011.696,"at the first opportunity to do so, you lose it."
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,3011.696,3013.262,"We do, Your Honor."
1999.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3028.306,3029.424,And we are ourselves...
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,3029.424,3030.641,You are the trial court.
1999.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3030.641,3031.508,the trial court here.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,3031.508,3036.145,"So, we say if you feel we waived it, we urge you to, on your own motion, invoke it."
1999.8_orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3036.145,3036.962,Why?
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,3036.962,3040.179,Because it's...  it's consistent with the whole principle of res judicata.
1999.8_orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3043.065,3050.654,"The...  the whole principle of preclusion, as I understand it, is it ordinarily follows a party presentation."
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,3065.414,3067.164,"Well, we are late, Your Honor."
1999.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3067.164,3069.514,"Well, the...  the Master treated it on the merits, didn't he?"
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,3069.514,3069.714,He did.
1999.8_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3070.282,3070.816,He didn't...
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,3070.816,3074.068,he found we hadn't waived it and that we weren't untimely.
1999.8_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3148.032,3149.399,May I ask one question?
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,3149.399,3149.818,Yes.
1999.8_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3149.818,3153.536,The settlement that we're trying to puzzle out occurred in 1983 I think.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,3176.551,3188.859,"Well, the...  the parties to the settlement, the Government and the tribe, of course adopted and supported, indeed, obtained the final Solicitor's opinion that reversed the three earlier Solicitor's opinion and held that the tribe had title to those lands."
1999.8_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3190.126,3191.228,That was before the settlement.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,3191.228,3192.128,That's before the settlement.
1999.8_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3192.128,3192.611,That was before the settlement.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,3196.28,3201.834,"Well, they didn't...  they...  I don't think anything has changed on the ground."
1999.8_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3207.571,3216.426,"So, there was no conduct post-1983 in which the tribe, in effect, moved the boundary lines back to say, I guess, we've given up title to this land."
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,3217.41,3219.462,They haven't...  they haven't gone out and developed it.
1999.8_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3219.462,3223.18,But your theory is that they did give up that part of the reservation in the settlement.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,3223.18,3225.199,Yes.
1999.8_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3226.734,3227.268,Yes.
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,3227.268,3231.703,Nothing has happened to that land in the disputed area since 1983 decision.
1999.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3254.668,3255.835,"Thank you, Mr. Muys."
1999.8_orig,2,31993,jerome_c_muys,,3255.835,3256.587,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1999.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3256.587,3259.122,"Mr. Minear, you have 2 minutes remaining."
1999.8_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3259.122,3260.972,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1999.8_orig,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3280.286,3285.171,I thought it only said boundary lands with respect to two other reservations.
1999.8_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3288.725,3293.593,It implicitly...  I think that you could read that implicitly into the...  into what the Court determined.
1999.8_orig,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3378.882,3389.44,"It isn't just the judgment doesn't say it, it's also that one of the claims that they made was...  was the claim that was just inconsistent with the...  with the fact that they accepted the Solicitor's new opinion."
1999.8_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3389.44,3394.392,"That's absolutely right, and I think that the point that you made is well taken that there's a contradiction here."
1999.8_orig,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3394.392,3394.928,Thank...  thank you.
