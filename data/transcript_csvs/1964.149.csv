1964.149,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,19.149,"Number 149, R. Wright Armstrong, Jr., Petitioner, versus Salvatore E. Manzo."
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,19.149,21.716,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court --"
1964.149,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,21.716,24.276,Mr. Smith.
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,24.276,29.152,It is a very high professional honor for me to appear before this Court.
1964.149,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,428.756,437.96,(Inaudible)
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,437.96,439.275,"Yes, Mr. Justice Goldberg."
1964.149,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,446.068,452.788,(Inaudible)
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,452.788,453.991,He did not have any knowledge.
1964.149,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,453.991,454.608,(Inaudible)
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,454.608,457.41,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1964.149,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,457.41,462.698,Your Court as I understand it held this was obscure kind of hearing that --
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,462.698,462.821,"Yes, Your Honor --"
1964.149,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,462.821,464.267,(Inaudible)
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,464.267,466.161,"Yes, Your Honor, we did."
1964.149,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,466.872,469.012,Did he get approval to --
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,469.012,472.405,He got a full hearing on a motion for a new trial.
1964.149,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,480.776,486.727,Well my theory had resulted from that hearing a setting aside of the order of adoption?
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,486.727,488.365,"Possibly, Your Honor."
1964.149,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,488.365,490.308,But I mean with evidence taken and --
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,490.308,491.324,Evidence was taken.
1964.149,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,491.324,495.14,And bearing on the fitness of the adoptive parents and all those other --
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,495.14,502.99,That you can search this record in vain for any evidence as to the fitness or as to the welfare of the child.
1964.149,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,502.99,504.114,Well what happened at the hearing?
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,505.517,507.289,This kind of evidence was taken.
1964.149,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,550.242,554.066,To what issue was that evidence directed?
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,554.066,558.3,Nonsupport commensurate with his financial ability.
1964.149,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,558.3,558.639,In other words --
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,558.639,561.043,All the testimony was directed toward that facti --
1964.149,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,561.043,565.167,And is that -- was that the only purpose of the hearing?
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,565.167,582.956,"The hearing of course was the purpose is as we see it, the motion for new trial was filed to completely set aside this proceeding, to show that the evidence which the Court based his decision upon was not sufficient evidence to make this decision."
1964.149,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,582.956,586.181,"Well on the issue of nonsupport, it may not have been --"
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,586.181,587.811,But the constitutional question was raised also.
1964.149,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,587.811,594.268,Well the other -- or that -- that whether other factual issues to which evidence show -- was directed?
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,594.268,601.27,"No, Your Honor except to show the -- there was evidence put on to show the stealthy manner in which the thing was conducted that they (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,601.27,609.937,But you had it simply but your client had an opportunity to address himself to the fitness of the adopting parents.
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,609.937,612.248,"No, Justice White, not a full opportunity."
1964.149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,612.248,612.934,Why not?
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,612.934,615.045,Because he had the burden of proof where he would not have had to put --
1964.149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,615.045,618.701,"Oh, yes, but I mean he could have put on evidence just -- aside from the burden of proof."
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,618.701,623.155,No question that he could have put on any evidence that the Court would have allowed him to take.
1964.149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,623.155,624.036,I'm not making --
1964.149,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,624.036,625.333,(Inaudible)
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,625.333,625.525,Sir?
1964.149,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,625.525,633.589,(Inaudible)
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,633.589,639.861,"Well, on the technical attack, on the evidence itself, the Court completely ignored the constitutional ground."
1964.149,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,666.958,669.639,What is open to him on a motion for new trial?
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,672.057,677.524,"Your Honor, there are eight different ways that this motion for new a trial is more burdensome."
1964.149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,701.5,725.38,"Well, you are suggesting then that suppose the statute said required notice to the father in these circumstances but said that it if he has failed to contribute substantially his support to the child for two years that he still have the burden of proof at the hearing."
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,730.914,731.114,"Well, firstly I --"
1964.149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,731.114,734.891,-- that was triggered by nonsupport would the unconstitutional?
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,734.891,741.308,"Firstly I'll say this that if the statute provided for notice, that would go a long way to accruing this up."
1964.149,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,759.188,769.216,"Mr. Smith, I hope you -- when you get to argue on the assumption that the Court would hold that he's entitled to notice."
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,769.216,771.133,Yes sir.
1964.149,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,771.133,782.989,"And then could he in this fashion, suppose the law of Texas, has been said to be this or it happened in this case, the judge had said, â€œAlright, I -- they issued this without notice."
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,803.767,805.428,"Procedurally, he can't do that, Your Honor."
1964.149,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,805.428,805.494,"Well, I'm not talking about --"
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,805.494,806.36,He's got to settle (Voice Overlap) --
1964.149,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,806.36,807.398,-- procedurally.
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,807.398,811.191,Yes sir.
1964.149,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,811.191,814.843,I should think a judge could do that procedurally in any state.
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,814.843,815.641,Well --
1964.149,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,815.641,822.841,"He could say on this motion for a new trial, I'm going to look at it on its merits again to see about it."
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,827.801,828.451,I don't --
1964.149,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,828.451,833.733,-- point out why they didn't forgetting the original fact --
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,833.733,834.019,Alright sir.
1964.149,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,834.019,836.866,-- that there was no notice.
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,836.866,841.819,Let me put some of the incidents of a motion for new trial under our practice before the Court.
1964.149,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,880.556,881.764,Now which parent?
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,882.333,883.284,The natural parents.
1964.149,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,883.284,885.27,These natural parents were divorced?
1964.149,0,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,885.27,890.401,"Yes sir but nevertheless the natural parents, even though they'd be separated by divorce."
1964.149,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,906.772,906.984,Why aren't the --
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,1576.472,1586.028,"If the Court please, let me take first the subject of what happened in this case and I'll come in a moment to talk --"
1964.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1586.028,1595.371,"Do you deny -- firstly, do you deny that a father is entitled or a mother entitled to notice for that child who was adopted by somebody else?"
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,1595.371,1596.484,A notice certainly should have been given here.
1964.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1596.484,1597.73,(Inaudible)
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,1597.73,1598.715,Yes sir.
1964.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1599.514,1603.299,That issue is not between you.
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,1603.299,1611.801,"No, it should have been given in this case and should be given in any case where it's physically possible in any manner that do so."
1964.149,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1756.676,1762.588,"You mean by that, that he did it as if there had never been an order of adoption was reentered?"
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,1762.588,1770.97,"That is -- what is of -- we say the record shows here, Your Honor because he heard the testimony just as the Texas cases said that he must."
1964.149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1792.904,1795.264,What was the order of proof at the hearing?
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,1795.264,1797.94,The order of proof?
1964.149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1816.016,1817.367,"Well, how did it actually happen (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,1817.367,1817.542,"Well, they picked --"
1964.149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1817.542,1819.015,Did they put on this evidence first?
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,1819.015,1824.103,"They put it -- they picked up the burden of proof, it is true."
1964.149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1824.103,1826.269,Did the other side put on any the evidence?
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,1826.269,1827.907,Yes our parties put on the evidence.
1964.149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1827.907,1830.111,"Well, what kind of evidence?"
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,1830.111,1835.955,"By the deposition testimony in Fort Worth, there was a full inquiry into this basic question (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1835.955,1841.037,Did either side put on any evidence in regard to fitness?
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,1841.037,1841.931,No sir.
1964.149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1846.668,1851.427,"Well, would it been an issue if -- would have been an issue at the original hearing, wouldn't it, and it was."
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,1851.427,1866.44,"Well, it was because of course as the record will show here, the trial court initially went through the procedure of appointing an investigator to go and inquire into the fitness and report that back to the Court, and so forth as the standard Texas procedure."
1964.149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1866.44,1869.477,Did -- were there any new findings entered after this hearing?
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,1869.477,1876.443,"Yes sir, there were -- by them requested findings -- they requested findings of fact, conclusions of law of the trial court."
1964.149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1876.443,1877.175,Were they made?
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,1877.175,1879.31,"Yes, they're made and entered, and they're in the record."
1964.149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1879.31,1883.432,"Were they -- well, had there been findings at the original hearing?"
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,1883.432,1885.762,No sir.
1964.149,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1885.762,1894.253,Was there any point made at this hearing for -- on the motion for a new trial as to who had the burden of proof?
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,1894.253,1896.406,"No sir, there was not."
1964.149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1931.588,1940.708,"Well, was the question my Brother Douglas raises, was it -- was that mooted at all or raised at all in the Court of Appeals?"
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,1940.708,1941.957,That is the question of fitness?
1964.149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1941.957,1945.264,"No, about the burden of proof."
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,1945.872,1945.936,No sir.
1964.149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1945.936,1950.677,"-- if anything in its opinion that deals with the burden of proof, you just said there was a full hearing."
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,1950.677,1962.171,There was not any matter or signs specifically to the Court of Civil Appeals in regard to the burden of proof and no writing on that subject that I recall at the moment in the Court of Civil Appeals.
1964.149,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1962.171,1970.373,"So you don't know of any Texas case which deals with this burden of proof, the matter on a motion for a new a trial after adoption without notice?"
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,1970.373,1987.213,"No sir, except the cases that say in the first place that the party coming in to prove the nonsupport must prove it by fluent satisfactory evidence or proof what I call the grounds for the adoption by a full and satisfactory evidence."
1964.149,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1987.213,2005.846,"Well, suppose this man had come in and made his motion for a new trial and set the fact, and then offered no evidence, what would have happened in this case?"
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,2005.846,2009.812,"Well, just on a motion if the Court had nothing to apprise if the --"
1964.149,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2009.812,2014.457,"Well, you made a motion for a new trial, now you were totally been talking about the burden of proof."
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,2030.532,2033.006,"Well, there maybe several things that might happen."
1964.149,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2044.084,2050.433,Do you think the Court would sustain its motion without having sustained his motion without him putting on any evidence at all?
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,2050.433,2076.126,"Well if we had a affidavit of motion as we have for instance in the jury misconduct cases where you come in and show the Court something that would justify or call upon him to go into evidence, then I think the Court would likely rule perhaps on the motion in their favor if it were just a motion setting out unsworn paragraphs, I would assume that a court would overrule it."
1964.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2076.126,2080.072,"But supposed it showed there was no notice, (Inaudible)?"
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,2080.704,2086.445,"Well, excuse me, I was con -- I was answering it in a context of this subject of nonsupport."
1964.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2104.017,2105.767,Should have been set aside.
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,2105.767,2112.559,"Yes sir, the motion should be sustained to grant a new trial or to give a new hearing, give a -- the full hearing that the Texas case is talking --"
1964.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2112.559,2118.83,"Whatever was -- that would in effect as I understand it, set aside the former judgment."
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,2118.83,2119.784,Yes sir.
1964.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2119.784,2123.754,"(Inaudible) to a new trial, of course, he would've been if the notice was unconstitutional, wouldn't he?"
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,2123.754,2125.269,Yes sir.
1964.149,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2125.269,2128.387,"Well, it's not quite correct, is it?"
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,2137.397,2137.777,No sir.
1964.149,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2137.777,2140.518,"-- Courts don't hold that it need be, is that it?"
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,2143.793,2147.248,"Well I didn't mean to if I did, Your Honor."
1964.149,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2153.61,2154.689,Set aside the judgment of (Voice Overlap) --
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,2154.689,2156.306,Or sustain the motion for new trial.
1964.149,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2157.129,2157.412,No.
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,2158.976,2168.07,Well the parties came in and had witnesses and were ready to go in to a trial so they went in to a trial and they put on live testimony and took the day and so forth.
1964.149,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2168.07,2168.914,Right.
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,2174.376,2175.328,It was not set aside.
1964.149,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2186.172,2207.106,"Mr. Duncan, there is in the field of practical difference here, though, isn't there -- if the Court had set aside the adoption judgment, then of course, the party seeking adoption would have had to go forward again and show why they were entitled to adoption, the burden would be on them."
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,2224.515,2225.555,Yes sir.
1964.149,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2225.555,2240.309,"And the party who had incurred the adoption doesn't go forward with any evidence at all to show why he was entitled the adoption except to rebut the case that the party who did not get notice puts in, isn't that correct?"
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,2240.309,2241.081,Yes sir.
1964.149,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2241.081,2243.344,Then that's really the difference.
1964.149,1,44455,william_duncan,,2243.344,2258.984,"Yes sir and as you said, there's a practical difference or practical problem involved and that was also in the fact that the judges are human and maybe they are inclined to say, ""Well, in the back of my mind, what I'm looking for here is evidence to support my prior judgment""."
1964.149,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2276.461,2276.532,You're asking --
1964.149,2,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,2867.159,2872.491,"I might just say one or two things in conclusion, Your Honor."
1964.149,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2879.528,2881.461,"Well, it was in Johnston too as I read that opinion."
1964.149,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2881.461,2883.447,Well we've got a confused situation there.
1964.149,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2884.977,2885.793,It's not important.
1964.149,2,23125,ewell_lee_smith_jr,,2885.956,2888.23,-- to allow those sayings.
