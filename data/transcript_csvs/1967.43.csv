1967.43,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,117.603,118.125,Was that the newsboy?
1967.43,0,25206,gray_l_dorsey,,119.884,125.278,"These -- Mr. Justice Black are news carriers, they are adults."
1967.43,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,137.875,140.755,All of them?
1967.43,0,25206,gray_l_dorsey,,140.755,149.617,"I don't know whether all of them are but in general, these are adult carriers and they're -- they have in the neighborhood about 1200 customers."
1967.43,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,155.677,157.559,We don't have them in submission.
1967.43,0,25206,gray_l_dorsey,,157.559,158.127,I beg Your Honor?
1967.43,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,158.127,160.645,We don't have them as the independent merchants here?
1967.43,0,25206,gray_l_dorsey,,160.645,161.571,No.
1967.43,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,180.001,183.089,Did they have employees or do they do all the work themselves?
1967.43,0,25206,gray_l_dorsey,,183.089,186.314,Mr. Albrecht is the only one of whom I know.
1967.43,1,34576,lon_hocker,,1952.551,1954.285,I thank you sir.
1967.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2133.679,2149.115,"Well, are you going so far as to say that the constitution prohibits a United States District Court in a treble-damage case from directing a verdict?"
1967.43,1,34576,lon_hocker,,2149.115,2149.904,Of guilty?
1967.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2151.2,2153.063,"Not of a -- not of guilty, this is a civil case."
1967.43,1,34576,lon_hocker,,2153.063,2163.163,"Well, the label which is put upon it, this Court has held many times Mr. Justice Fortas, does not control the constitutional effect."
1967.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2184.261,2187.651,There have been other treble-damage cases.
1967.43,1,34576,lon_hocker,,2187.651,2194.144,"Why of course, yes Your Honor."
1967.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2563.06,2565.194,Why must he choose Mr. Hocker?
1967.43,1,34576,lon_hocker,,2565.194,2565.94,I beg your pardon?
1967.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2565.94,2567.681,Why must he choose?
1967.43,1,34576,lon_hocker,,2578.153,2579.345,Because we said so.
1967.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2579.345,2580.466,I see.
1967.43,1,34576,lon_hocker,,2580.466,2583.518,"No sir, this is -- there no legal reason why."
1967.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2609.66,2620.808,But why did -- why didn't the -- why wasn't the fact that his lowering it or his raising his price to your -- lowering his price to your level sufficient for you?
1967.43,1,34576,lon_hocker,,2620.808,2627.114,It would've been sufficient to us Justice White but we never knew about it until the trial.
1967.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2641.342,2644.196,Even if he hadn't agreed to keep it there?
1967.43,1,34576,lon_hocker,,2644.196,2652.447,"Oh yes, it was never -- there has never been a suggestion anywhere in this case of the requirement of an agreement by anybody."
1967.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2679.33,2685.875,"Mr. Hocker, let me see if I understand your theory and let's move it over to another commodity."
1967.43,1,34576,lon_hocker,,2685.875,2686.488,Yes sir.
1967.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2686.488,2693.299,Let's suppose that General Motors has a distributor of its Chevrolet cars.
1967.43,1,34576,lon_hocker,,2747.915,2761.144,"Answer to the first question, yes it would be because it would involve an agreement and in the second place, it is not like this case for reasons which -- I'll interrupt myself to state if Your Honor will permit me."
1967.43,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2776.838,2778.203,Mr. who?
1967.43,1,34576,lon_hocker,,2778.203,2783.913,"Mr. Gesell, a member of this Court, Gerhard Gesell."
1967.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2783.913,2784.085,Did he --
1967.43,1,34576,lon_hocker,,2784.085,2784.331,I --
1967.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2784.331,2786.906,"-- argue the Parke, Davis case?"
1967.43,1,34576,lon_hocker,,2786.906,2788.716,I really don't know.
1967.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2788.716,2789.435,He did?
1967.43,1,34576,lon_hocker,,2789.435,2802.24,"That he -- he says, I think the second point that I would make about antitrust cases is that the Court is more interested in the economic significance of what you're talking about than about the law."
1967.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2820.052,2821.92,Is that your answer to my question?
1967.43,1,34576,lon_hocker,,2821.92,2826.252,Yes sir.
1967.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2872.749,2877.432,I was hoping you'd give me a legal answer to my question.
1967.43,1,34576,lon_hocker,,2883.164,2884.456,Yes sir.
1967.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3075.789,3076.793,Who is George Kroner?
1967.43,1,34576,lon_hocker,,3076.793,3089.507,George Kroner was a man who delivered the 300 newspapers which were obtained by the Globe-Democrat by competition with Albrecht.
1967.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3113.126,3115.1,He bought and resold the paper company?
1967.43,1,34576,lon_hocker,,3115.1,3115.996,Yes sir.
1967.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3117.922,3120.294,And set his own prices on it?
1967.43,1,34576,lon_hocker,,3120.294,3130.429,"And set his own prices although as he said, I recognized the Globe-Democrat's suggested retail price and abided by it."
1967.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3367.468,3369.872,Mr. Dorsey.
1967.43,2,25206,gray_l_dorsey,,3369.872,3388.2,"Mr. Justice Fortas said, our brief, pages 13 and 32, I think that there is the answer to the question that you raised awhile ago but Mr. Hocker is correct that in our prayer we did not asked alternatively for a new trial."
1967.43,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3420.21,3427.1,Do you think if the word reasonable has anything to do with the case?
1967.43,2,25206,gray_l_dorsey,,3427.1,3442.917,"Well, I don't to see at the moment how reasonable would it come in except in the kind of situation that I believe Mr. Justice White was asking me about, could they do a little something more than just terminate."
1967.43,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3444.069,3445.977,What about the Standard Oil case?
1967.43,2,25206,gray_l_dorsey,,3445.977,3446.633,I beg your pardon?
1967.43,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3446.633,3448.24,What about the Standard Oil case?
1967.43,2,25206,gray_l_dorsey,,3450.237,3452.369,"Well, yes Your Honor --"
1967.43,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3452.369,3455.733,-- that somebody must decide whether they are reasonable (Inaudible).
1967.43,2,25206,gray_l_dorsey,,3455.733,3480.717,"Well, I simply would be -- I think that applies in this way that it is unreasonable per se when price fixing has occurred and there's no need to inquire whether this price-fixing affected a substantial amount of the market and that's their -- I think there's no need to inquire in this case with respect to that."
