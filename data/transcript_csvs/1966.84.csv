1966.84,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,27.097,"Number 80, number 84, Obed M. Lassen, Commissioner, State Land Department, petitioner versus Arizona in the relation of Arizona Highway Department."
1966.84,0,30403,john_p_frank,,29.828,34.616,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.84,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,317.377,324.344,"The ones that are still -- the land share which is still on up held by the state, are they rented?"
1966.84,0,30403,john_p_frank,,324.344,326.11,"No, these are (Voice Overlap)."
1966.84,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,342.703,345.538,And it does not produce very much income.
1966.84,0,30403,john_p_frank,,345.538,352.776,"No, these are non-income producing lands being held for use, a million acres has been disposed of in a fashion which I have described."
1966.84,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,352.776,361.767,"Mr. Frank, does this trust fund differ and essentially from the school lands in other western states?"
1966.84,0,30403,john_p_frank,,361.767,362.738,"No, Your Honor."
1966.84,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,713.167,715.668,Is that true that as a general matter under your state law?
1966.84,0,30403,john_p_frank,,715.668,717.171,"No, far from it Your Honor."
1966.84,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1233.044,1235.778,Mr. Frank (Voice Overlap).
1966.84,0,30403,john_p_frank,,1251.175,1280.115,"Yes, Your Honor and that only says that the -- not only that the Constitution says so but the Enabling Act says so that any transfer is null and void and whether in those circumstances Mr. Lassen will be able to bring some appropriate action to try to recover as to those things whether it's a matter of policy will do so I must say I think we don't know whether there will be any retrieval because this practice of dribbling away our trust funds has been going on for 20 years."
1966.84,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1280.115,1304.812,What is a matter of theory or principle in your opinion does that mean that title to those lands transferred in violation of the Enabling Act in the Constitution in regards forthwith to the trust fund or does it mean that it's voidable in the sense that state action has to be brought.
1966.84,0,30403,john_p_frank,,1304.812,1313.935,"Your Honor, I must say in candid that I am in doubt because the state is simply not considered how to deal with this problem or at least has not advice."
1966.84,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1313.935,1315.65,Nothing like this is the reason --
1966.84,0,30403,john_p_frank,,1315.65,1316.641,This is not the reason.
1966.84,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1346.672,1349.581,Aren't these lands subject to eminent domain?
1966.84,0,30403,john_p_frank,,1349.581,1365.767,"Well, I want to turn to that Your Honor and with some care, as to the eminent domain face of the matter, there is a division of authority on that and with your permission since that that becomes a major part of my discussion I like to -- may I reserve that one question for just a moment Mr. Justice?"
1966.84,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1489.959,1492.138,"Well, that's not before us anyway, is it?"
1966.84,0,30403,john_p_frank,,1530.106,1532.991,No I think not Mr. Justice.
1966.84,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1862.759,1863.771,What is this case?
1966.84,0,30403,john_p_frank,,1863.771,1876.826,"That is the case of Ervien, Your Honor, which is discussed in our brief at pages 16 and 17 the citation here is 251 U.S.41."
1966.84,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1995.332,1997.147,You may continue your argument.
1966.84,0,30403,john_p_frank,,1997.147,1998.815,Thank you.
1966.84,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2011.332,2012.164,Except there is mind a grazing in short term leases.
1966.84,0,30403,john_p_frank,,2012.164,2016.396,There are leases but they don't graze it.
1966.84,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2016.396,2017.064,Yes.
1966.84,0,30403,john_p_frank,,2017.064,2030.051,"Now, I would like to take the bulk of my few remaining minutes if I can save a tiny bit I shall but I may be unable to answer Justice White's question which raises the one I think really have a problem in the case."
1966.84,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2322.759,2324.743,Mr. Weisl.
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,2324.743,2328.374,"Mr. Chief Justice, Justices of this Court."
1966.84,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2556.202,2563.136,Would you apply that principle to private taking of a private property?
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,2563.136,2572.704,The doctrine of benefits Mr. Justice Fortas is applied in many instances in eminent domain proceedings.
1966.84,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2603.695,2616.639,"Well, would you agree that whatever the principles are in the field of eminent domain with respect to private property that those are the principles that have to be applied here?"
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,2616.639,2632.324,"I think we go a little bit further because in eminent domain proceeding, generally, the remaining property benefit that has to be closer physically and in relation in terms of use to the property actually taken."
1966.84,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2632.324,2633.664,"Well, why do you do that?"
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,2635.212,2645.959,Because the purpose Mr. Justice is to preserve a trust of a certain value so that it can earn a certain amount of income to provide for public school.
1966.84,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2645.959,2646.861,I am not certain.
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,2673.829,2680.004,I think we agree on the latter part of your statement that value judgments have to be made.
1966.84,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2699.54,2732.09,Suppose a utility company condemns a track of land in an enormous ranch for a utility or right of way for its supposed (Inaudible) and I suppose that almost every time that brings a good deal of benefit to -- on the land and the offset is are you telling me that you offset the benefits to a land that is not taken?
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,2732.09,2744.335,"Yes Your Honor, that is the rule in condemnation and I -- it was first enunciated by this Court as early as 1897, in the case called, not cited in our briefs Bowman against Ross."
1966.84,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2765.16,2816.324,"Well, I was hopefully could make that into -- find it unnecessary to pass on these questions and I am not sure that I am not still inclined to believe that we can because it seems to me that for the highway department's position to prevail when we have to indulge in assumption that there's a complete offset because if there is any discrepancy to the value of the land taken in the incremental value as a result of building a highway then their case falls, it seems to me, we don't have to go any further."
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,2816.324,2817.567,I agree completely.
1966.84,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2850.468,2865.812,"Mr. Weisl, I was wondering about another situation now that question temporary when the railroads came through they were given land grants of every order of the section for 20 miles on each side of the right of way."
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,2884.584,2889.685,They are treated I believe Mr. Chief Justice although I can't say this with great confidence.
1966.84,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2911.258,2913.273,Less liberal.
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,2913.273,2928.592,"I say a more liberal rule of benefits can be applied in these trust lands when a state, another state agency is taking them that is if you look through the benefits of the trust as a whole rather than to immediately adjacent parcel of property."
1966.84,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2928.592,2940.158,Well what rule would be applied to those land grants that were granted for the sole purpose of developing the country?
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,2942.66,2949.597,"I think they apply these exact same rules I believe to other lands that are in normal, private ownerships."
1966.84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3078.543,3110.748,"Well, can the same -- by the same token I suppose then the state could give 100 acres of land to IBM to build a plant because once the IBM plant is there, the surrounding property will be three times as valuable and there will be a great -- sort of a nucleus where an industrial development in the (Inaudible) expert real estate testimony that supported those values I suppose it would take the same approach?"
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3110.748,3118.471,Well I wouldn't really because the enabling act speaks as to actual voluntary I think dispositions by the state.
1966.84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3132.351,3140.466,So you would go to line between -- between increments attached to a disposition?
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3140.466,3140.727,Yes.
1966.84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3140.727,3143.476,An increment that arises from the state's own use?
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3143.476,3145.021,"Yes, some of the Acts for example --"
1966.84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3145.021,3155.443,"Do you say that the state could take the property, 500 acres of it for a golf course because the surrounding property would be contend as valuable?"
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3155.443,3173.744,"I think if it is for a recognized public purpose for which the state has the condemnation power, I would say that that would be correct whereas the enabling act specifically require a minimum most of them do anyway, require minimum payments for disposition to private persons."
1966.84,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3173.744,3180.276,If that is so why (Inaudible) anything for -- when it takes for a highway?
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3180.276,3192.442,Because of the I think clear congressional purpose to create a trust for schools to preserve the value of that trust so that the intent of Congress which was to have a trust for schools be continued.
1966.84,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3192.442,3199.324,Are you saying that all the procedures and standards of the Act don't apply to that kind of a taking?
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3199.324,3199.963,"Yes, sir."
1966.84,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3199.963,3202.204,And apply only to a private taking?
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3202.204,3222.19,"Well, I think that the requirement for preservation of a trust through some form of compensation remains in eminent domain the compensation on occasion can be in the form of benefits to the remainder which are so great as to outweigh the amount of cash loss to the particular track of land."
1966.84,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3222.19,3231.3,"Well, is your position that if you can -- is your position the same as Mr. Frank's in this respect or is it different?"
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3231.3,3235.29,We agree that the compensation must be paid.
1966.84,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3250.057,3257.895,"Well, does he agree of the procedure of the standards of the Act do not apply to a taking for a governmental purpose?"
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3260.498,3273.493,"You would then -- you would take a far harsher view, we would say that virtually every safeguard in the act applies to the sale of the private people, persons apply."
1966.84,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3296.72,3306.262,Suppose you were (Inaudible)?
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3306.262,3311.039,"Federal government would, yes Your Honor and I believe that this doctrine obtained in Arizona, yes."
1966.84,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3311.039,3316.484,"Your theory is that since you do have the power of eminent domain, you play that?"
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3316.484,3317.432,Yes.
1966.84,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3317.432,3323.228,"Despite the enabling act, the eminent domain (Inaudible) rather than a sale."
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3323.228,3329.121,"Well, despite the eminent domain is different than a sale."
1966.84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3384.295,3396.314,"By the way Mr. Weisl, in terms of paying cash, when does the federal highway interstate highway for example, who has to pay for the exhibition of these --"
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3396.314,3397.947,The federal government pays that.
1966.84,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3397.947,3400.903,That's the reason for the government (Inaudible)?
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3400.903,3406.874,"Mr. Justice Brennan, I represented this Court but that was never in our mind at least my --"
1966.84,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3406.874,3431.876,"I just wonder Mr. Weisl, I take it it's not because the highway went through anything else but these school lands which perhaps are worth -- Arizona got them at 25 cents an acre and now worth $5 an acre, you wouldn't say the state can give away $100,000.00 worth because of what's left is still worth a lot more than (Inaudible)?"
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3431.876,3433.747,"No, sir I would not."
1966.84,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3448.649,3465.441,Can you say the State of Arizona would have powers to build highways to these schools on land and assess the school lands for their benefit confirmed?
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3465.441,3466.393,"No, sir I do not."
1966.84,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3466.393,3468.536,"Well, if not why can they do it the other way?"
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3468.536,3477.755,"Well, because I believe that the value of the trust is preserved if actual benefits accrue the remainder and therefore --"
1966.84,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3477.755,3484.74,"But then that, the way to test that out is to test it out under the general laws of the state."
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3484.74,3489.023,"Well, I think that in essence --"
1966.84,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3489.023,3492.405,Like they build that highway?
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3492.405,3494.975,"I think, in essence that is what would happen."
1966.84,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3514.452,3532.477,"I may find it a little bit difficult to say that the state can't directly assess the school lands, the value of the highways built through them or next to them be a little difficult to leave over there and say they could do it indirectly by the method you suggest."
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3532.477,3557.733,"Well, all I can say is that to assess them would be to actually deprive them of money which is not authorized by the enabling act where as to offset benefits to them would be to preserve the value of the trust intact so that it would still have the capacity to earn the same amount of money for the state school system or perhaps even more than it did before the taking."
1966.84,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3557.733,3573.852,So that will leave it up to the state to fix school lands that given to the state for school purposes only intact but nothing else will work and that's the state decide when it build roads there and then make them pay for it.
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3573.852,3583.084,"Well, I think if a requirement is maintained that the burden is on the state to establish these benefits and that the --"
1966.84,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3583.084,3585.491,But I am talking about special benefits.
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3596.982,3598.457,"That, I think that's correct."
1966.84,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3608.365,3609.193,If it pays.
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3609.193,3611.857,If it pays for which and I just -- I simply said that manner.
1966.84,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3611.857,3613.885,That maintain money?
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3613.885,3627.618,I still simply say that the manner of payment sometimes can be and in the context of the state ought to be a recognition that the lands are compensated by the benefits resulting from the improvement.
1966.84,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3627.618,3635.497,Those raise him there problematic method of computation in order to protect the state's interest and the school's interest?
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3635.497,3638.782,"Well, the benefit -- the burden should be on the authority which is taking the land."
1966.84,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3638.782,3643.362,"Well, whether you have the burden (Voice Overlap) you still just prevent the complications of this."
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3643.362,3646.223,It does indeed and these are difficult problems.
1966.84,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3647.02,3653.353,"All these are difficult to protect the states interest or school's interest to possess -- to pay money, isn't it?"
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3653.353,3657.216,I would say that it certainly is simpler and I would not --
1966.84,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3657.216,3659.211,And most certainly they have it isn't it?
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3659.211,3663.119,It is certainly safer and far more certain.
1966.84,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3682.918,3686.029,(Voice Overlap) is not usually good as much?
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3686.029,3686.917,"Well, that is true."
1966.84,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3692.078,3695.947,"Mr. Weisl, may I ask you one other question."
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3712.471,3714.744,I think the states would be left to their normal procedure.
1966.84,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3731.089,3739.96,"But in other words, would they have to treat this trust fund the same as they would any other property that they take from the states?"
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3739.96,3741.093,"No sir, I don't think so."
1966.84,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3765.862,3778.559,"Well, you will have -- you rely on anything in the act, well the act does say that for purposes of the U.S.irrigation projects some of these lands can be turned on to the United States, isn't that right?"
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3778.559,3779.625,Yes.
1966.84,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3779.625,3787.521,But the Congress didn't say anything about the state thing that would have taken without paying money.
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3792.36,3809.683,The state -- yes I think the mere fact that the state never even -- the Enabling Act never given came to grips with eminent domain providing that the lands can only be disposed of through public auction is not really an indication that the Congress intended to foreclose the eminent domain.
1966.84,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3818.748,3827.163,Are you relying on something that's not in the act instead and you're saying that if Congress intended to cover it they would cover it.
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3827.163,3840.434,I think that if the eminent domain power is so inherent the power of the sovereign such as the state that we ought to require a great deal of Congress before we rule that the state has been deprived of them.
1966.84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3840.434,3843.971,"Mr. Weisl, what do you do about Ervien?"
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3847.77,3848.624,Yes.
1966.84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3848.624,3852.528,And it seems to me that Court almost squarely rejected it.
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3852.528,3855.458,"Well, I think that Ervien is different from this reason."
1966.84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3866.591,3870.538,They were saying -- as they were saying they will back -- they will get back a little more than that.
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3870.538,3876.581,"Precisely the point I made about the benefits or I tried to make, perhaps I have no doubt to do that inadequately."
1966.84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3924.562,3928.137,"What are we talking about out there in Arizona, about 40,000 acres?"
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3928.137,3929.743,"9,100,000 acres."
1966.84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3929.743,3935.345,No I mean the number of acres that have been taken for roads up to date?
1966.84,1,23415,edwin_l_weisl_jr,,3935.345,3937.556,I don't believe I have that figure.
1966.84,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3948.357,3953.786,Mr. Lee.
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3953.786,3957.1,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.84,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4023.331,4030.885,Well you are starting off with the agreement that the state highway department has applied?
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4030.885,4032.256,That is correct Mr. Justice Fortas.
1966.84,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4056.045,4058.715,Where does the standard come from?
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4080.856,4083.2,"Well, I would like to make two observations."
1966.84,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4087.996,4088.93,I am aware of that.
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4088.93,4099.415,"In the second place, what we are talking about, we may borrow on the principles to a certain extent and in eminent domain there are as I understand it two different rules."
1966.84,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4127.375,4132.011,"Well, would that rule apply here, would the Arizona eminent domain apply here?"
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4132.011,4138.046,We contend not simply because we contend that it is not eminent domain that is the applicable rule.
1966.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4289.73,4293.818,Is that your only way of saying they are not --
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4293.818,4294.98,Not at all.
1966.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4344.413,4357.917,"Well, Mr. Lee how about if the state takes 1000 acres of the land and because we're going to use this as a park and the wide built camp ground and things like that, it's not available for anything else."
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4361.879,4362.284,Alright.
1966.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4362.284,4366.818,"Now, would you say that that -- is that subject to the sale or an auction."
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4366.818,4370.774,"Here is my answer, here is my answer, -- let me answer it in two steps."
1966.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4395.997,4398.266,But why is this even a sale or disposition.
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4406.153,4406.291,Because
1966.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4406.291,4408.055,"No sale, no lease, no nothing?"
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4408.055,4418.646,"Because in all fairness, Mr. Justice White, I think that the overall purpose of this value provision is this that this is the basic concept underlying a value provision."
1966.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4430.334,4431.279,You don't need to rely.
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4460.133,4462.865,Conceivably so but this is not the only restriction.
1966.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4493.467,4495.39,You can't find that in the Act.
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4497.295,4506.437,"Well, I think it's also implicit in this paragraph which says that these shall not be disposed of except for value though the language has not expressly written in that regard."
1966.84,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4855.45,4858.211,Was it in effect in New Mexico?
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4858.211,4859.808,"No sir, it was not."
1966.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4988.524,4989.342,May I say to you --
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4989.342,4990.549,Yes sir.
1966.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4990.549,5004.973,"That's one of the simpler thing about that (Inaudible) you say certain part of the lands would bear the entire brunt which cause it, should all the people from the sale or all the people there."
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5020.279,5026.432,"Well, if this in fact were the case Mr. Justice Black it would bother me too."
1966.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5031.972,5037.68,I understand there have been 9 -- how many acres already taken with that (Inaudible)?
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5037.68,5042.869,Mr. Justice Black I have no idea how many acres have already been taken.
1966.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5042.869,5048.079,But wasn't that to be borne broad building as the job to all the people of the state.
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5048.079,5048.897,That is correct.
1966.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5071.661,5077.524,But it will benefit the people all over the state and the people -- the nation (Inaudible) highway?
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5077.524,5078.092,Yes.
1966.84,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5091.04,5096.026,Are these -- the highways conceded here have a limited access highway?
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5096.026,5098.127,There are all kinds Mr. Justice Brennan.
1966.84,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5098.127,5101.77,"Well, I suppose some of them go some 50 miles before it gets to an exit?"
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5101.77,5102.551,That is very correct.
1966.84,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5102.551,5105.955,"Now, I wonder how much good does that --"
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5105.955,5112.122,Oh a limited access highway where you might go 50 miles before you get to an exit.
1966.84,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5112.122,5113.686,Maybe 50 is too many?
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5113.686,5122.385,"Well, this simply points out the problem that the posture of this case is not proper for the consideration of this particular issue."
1966.84,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5129.165,5132.665,You mean the court below was wrong.
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5132.665,5134.975,I am going to get to that in just a moment.
1966.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5146.314,5149.243,"Well, then --"
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5149.243,5150.874,I assure you Mr. Justice White I will get to that.
1966.84,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5150.874,5154.95,Let me ask you this question Mr. Lee.
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5163.201,5164.205,That is correct.
1966.84,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5164.205,5177.003,"Now, when you are -- when you are determining what the value of this property is and what it might gain or lose by reason of a highway."
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5195.514,5197.303,I will be over that in more detail in a moment.
1966.84,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5308.254,5312.615,Well that partly answers the question I asked you --
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5312.615,5313.337,Excuse me Mr. Chief Justice.
1966.84,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5313.337,5315.817,-- about the checkerboard here.
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5363.421,5366.421,We consider the added value to all the school lands.
1966.84,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5373.333,5379.924,Would you do that if it was a private utility or a private individual?
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5379.924,5381.198,"No, Your Honor, we would not."
1966.84,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5381.198,5382.294,What is the distinction?
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5382.294,5385.202,The distinction is this.
1966.84,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5437.508,5446.858,But how do you do -- what do you do with the fact that the Enabling Act does contain two specific provisions about public use.
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5463.391,5465.29,I'm glad you asked that Mr. Justice Fortas.
1966.84,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5465.29,5468.567,I don't know why.
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5468.567,5471.459,Because I have an answer for it.
1966.84,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5500.995,5518.34,"This is clearly noble (Inaudible) statutory construction, isn't it that is to say would you ordinarily say that to the extent that Congress did not specifically cover state use meant for the generality of the statute to the government."
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5518.34,5525.218,I would agree were it not for the fact that Congress did provide that those transactions are in substantial conformity.
1966.84,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5554.029,5566.226,On what would you rely to the show that Congress could not have anticipated the need for public roads in this great western country.
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5566.226,5566.615,"Well, --"
1966.84,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5566.615,5573.323,In 1910 after the automobile that came along and was really developed --
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5573.323,5575.446,This of course is not my point Mr. Chief Justice.
1966.84,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5616.043,5626.275,Why would they anticipate reclamation projects and not be able to recognize the possibility of roads?
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5626.275,5632.044,Presumably because the reclamation projects had someone who had a good lobby there and anticipated the problem.
1966.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5761.795,5767.592,What about the land intervening between that you told the chief about?
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5767.592,5771.6,Well that those lands that are being in between Justice Black I was just referring to other school lands.
1966.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5771.6,5774.241,But I am talking about private lands.
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5778.216,5783.276,"Well, in our view it's not a matter of who has to pay how much."
1966.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5784.953,5786.793,Not whose benefits.
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5796.714,5802.865,"Well, because of peculiar Arizona rule and it may exist in other instances."
1966.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5802.865,5815.237,"But that couldn't keep it, that peculiar Arizona rule couldn't keep that from putting a cost on road construction on land that others are just somewhat responsible for --"
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5815.237,5823.536,I agree with you but on the other hand if it has been determined by a competent process and I'd like to deal just briefly with what is a competent process.
1966.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5832.015,5833.225,Trust lands and other lands.
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5833.225,5840.61,And other lands that trust lands considered just and by themselves are worth more by virtue of the bare fact that that road has been constructed in the process.
1966.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5840.61,5843.365,"Well, what about the intervening lands, are they worth more?"
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5843.365,5844.254,They may be.
1966.84,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5858.543,5860.406,Does it now?
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5860.406,5863.966,"Mr. Chief Justice, it does not."
1966.84,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5879.55,5885.819,"Mr. Lee in the federal highway program, I suppose a lot of these lands are used in that?"
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5885.819,5888.315,"I presume it would be so, yes."
1966.84,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5888.315,5897.172,The value of the land I think somebody said that the value of the land is counted as part of the state contribution.
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5897.172,5898.654,There's nothing in this on the record.
1966.84,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5903.971,5914.955,You know whether the State of Arizona puts a value on these trust lands for purposes of the federal highway program?
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5933.629,5938.711,"I'm informed by my co-counsel who spends time, full time in highway department matters."
1966.84,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5939.89,5940.832,But it's not done.
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5945.877,5947.169,Well --
1966.84,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5947.169,5948.348,"Well, maybe you don't know."
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5948.348,5950.264,Yes.I really don't know it.
1966.84,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5950.264,5953.187,Did the federal government do it?
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5953.187,5958.344,There is no evidence on this record as to what the procedure is and I am really not familiar with the procedure Mr. Chief Justice.
1966.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5958.344,5964.864,"But if the state has to pay for it, we'll say, who is going to pick up the tab eventually if the state have to pay for it?"
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5964.864,5966.141,"Pay for what, Mr. Justice White?"
1966.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5966.141,5968.108,These rights of way.
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5968.108,5970.374,"Well, --"
1966.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5970.374,5980.008,"Let's assume that you're wrong and that they can't take these for nothing, they have to pay some money, who's going to pay eventually, the state or the federal government?"
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5980.008,5987.673,"In the case of an interstate highway then pursuant to the terms of the act, part would be paid by the federal government and part would be paid by the state."
1966.84,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5987.673,5988.531,By 90%?
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5988.531,5990.372,In accord of whatever the percentage would be.
1966.84,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5990.372,5991.966,That's 90% by the federal government?
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,5991.966,5996.385,"Well, there are cases where there would be more Mr. Justice Brennan."
1966.84,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5996.385,6003.318,"But so far as the state is concerned, who gets the whole benefit if the other side prevails?"
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,6003.318,6005.846,The other side prevails then the benefit goes to the trust.
1966.84,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6005.846,6008.736,Suppose the public schools of Arizona.
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,6008.736,6009.77,That is correct.
1966.84,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6009.77,6017.068,So wouldn't that pay more of a benefit to the state than when you prevail?
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,6017.068,6023.853,"Yes, there is no question Mr. Chief Justice that it would be more of a benefit but we submit that is not the issue in this case."
1966.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6301.361,6328.031,"May I ask you, considering these two or three plan you had on this line, which on in your judgment can complete the function, will most surely guarantee but not a dime of the school plan will be spent for anything except school funds."
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,6328.031,6344.075,"Mr. Justice Black, if we are correct in our theory I would think that they would be equal in achieving this purpose because of the fact that a dollar increment to a surrounding land is just as effective as a dollar actually paid for lands that are taken for that purpose."
1966.84,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6344.075,6347.946,But you don't take them all into consideration.
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,6358.191,6370.811,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice I would like to say that we consider the total impact on the value of all of the lands taken as a whole, all of the trust lands."
1966.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6389.13,6392.264,Why isn't there a question of bookkeeping?
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,6411.123,6411.888,That's right.
1966.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6412.988,6425.627,"And the question of bookkeeping I should say the burden, the likelihood will always exist that the state funds can -- that funds can be best protected following the statutory method lend and pay money."
1966.84,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,6425.627,6450.507,"The extent that it is a matter of bookkeeping Mr. Justice Black in answer to your question then I would contend that since the ultimate burden is going to be born by the State of Arizona, the state should be allowed to incorporate into its total overall scheme that interpretation of the enabling act which best fits within its overall scheme so long as insubstantial conformity with the provisions of the act which we submit this is."
1966.84,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6450.507,6452.922,"Mr. Frank, you have a few moments."
1966.84,3,30403,john_p_frank,,6452.922,6455.45,Thank you Your Honor.
1966.84,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6503.076,6510.762,Well would those private lands would have to -- would the -- if you went through one of these sections which are privately owned I take it you have to pay for it.
1966.84,3,30403,john_p_frank,,6510.762,6523.817,"You'd have to pay for it Your Honor and you wouldn't get the very enhancement which they are claiming here by expressed provision, we have set forth the statute in the interpretive cases in our reply brief at page 4."
1966.84,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6570.06,6574.233,"Mr. Frank, could I ask you just about one situation?"
1966.84,3,30403,john_p_frank,,6628.711,6630.797,You bet and when it applied to this whole section.
1966.84,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6636.88,6639.47,"Well, this is just one section deal."
1966.84,3,30403,john_p_frank,,6639.47,6639.903,That's right.
1966.84,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6647.162,6654.531,But what we're dealing is trying to get the section in condition itself.
1966.84,3,30403,john_p_frank,,6659.975,6667.444,"The answer is that we have carried this traditionally in such fashion that if we improve these lands, we do them out of the general funds."
1966.84,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6671.761,6683.273,I know but I said suppose they extend the trust money in improving trust lands so they will bring in higher price.
1966.84,3,30403,john_p_frank,,6683.273,6683.301,Yes.
1966.84,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6683.301,6691.096,"Like developers do subdivide it rather than selling it.Subdivide it, got a lot of money on it, and then they sell it."
1966.84,3,30403,john_p_frank,,6700.44,6717.667,Yes and our position on the score Your Honor would be that the trust lands if they are going to be sold after improvement but nonetheless require payment for the totality of them and there isn't any system under this Act whereby you can ship away some acres.
1966.84,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6717.667,6730.165,"So you would say -- you would say that the moment they purported to designate some of these lands permanently for use of streets, they -- the state hold some money in the process?"
1966.84,3,30403,john_p_frank,,6730.165,6733.605,Not Your Honor when they designate but when they dispose of.
1966.84,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6745.412,6750.341,"Well, that doesn't much any difference then but the fact is you would say they have to pay for those roads."
1966.84,3,30403,john_p_frank,,6750.341,6760.195,"That must be paid for and it is our position you gave Your Honor the example of the golf course when you say that one part of a golf course, one section to develop and improve the area they have to pay for it."
1966.84,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6783.874,6785.269,How could Congress change it?
1966.84,3,30403,john_p_frank,,6785.269,6786.107,Pardon?
1966.84,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6786.107,6786.967,How could Congress change it?
1966.84,3,30403,john_p_frank,,6786.967,6788.318,"It should be done, Your Honor."
1966.84,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6798.107,6802.245,"In other words, Congress can withdraw its gift?"
1966.84,3,30403,john_p_frank,,6802.245,6803.66,The Congress -- no.
1966.84,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6810.022,6812.746,But you do put on that addition that it has to be mutual.
1966.84,3,30403,john_p_frank,,6812.746,6813.57,You bet.
