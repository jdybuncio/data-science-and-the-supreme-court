1972.71-1637,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,15.522,"We’ll hear arguments this morning in number 71-1637, City of Burbank and others against Lockheed Air Terminal and others."
1972.71-1637,0,40519,richard_l_sieg_jr,,18.873,20.818,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1972.71-1637,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,235.584,242.584,"Well, it’d be a little more difficult to predict the pattern of private aircraft, would it not?"
1972.71-1637,0,40519,richard_l_sieg_jr,,242.584,244.847,"Yes, Your Honor, it would."
1972.71-1637,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,253.533,256.991,"When you say nighttime, do you mean sunset to sunrise?"
1972.71-1637,0,40519,richard_l_sieg_jr,,256.991,283.798,"Yes, the testimony as it found in the record refers to the fact that 60 aircrafts, corporate jet aircraft, took off during the nighttime hours, and that word was specifically used, and I followed that answer with a question as to how many of these occurred during the proscribed hours and the President of Lockheed was unable to state how many."
1972.71-1637,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,773.569,785.278,"Mr. Sieg, that right of privacy, if it was mentioned in those cases, was a right against governmental action, weren’t they?"
1972.71-1637,0,40519,richard_l_sieg_jr,,796.881,799.036,"It is, in this respect."
1972.71-1637,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,831.852,852.589,"I still have a little problem seeing why an executive jet, by a private company takes off, how that’s governmental action because that’s what’s the-- the noise from that jet owned by the XYZ Corporation that invades which you call a right of privacy, and that’s not government invading the right of privacy, is it?"
1972.71-1637,0,40519,richard_l_sieg_jr,,852.589,854.856,"I agree with that, Your Honor."
1972.71-1637,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,873.952,874.823,It’s a freedom.
1972.71-1637,0,40519,richard_l_sieg_jr,,877.492,878.276,That is correct.
1972.71-1637,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,878.276,880.611,But--
1972.71-1637,0,40519,richard_l_sieg_jr,,880.611,881.194,And the declaration--
1972.71-1637,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,881.194,884.394,"So the invasion is by a private corporation, not by government."
1972.71-1637,0,40519,richard_l_sieg_jr,,884.394,891.865,"The invasion of a declaration of preemption is by the government, the Federal Government."
1972.71-1637,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,907.927,918.606,Are you saying that the government action is the prohibition by the Federal Government of any effort on the part of the local people to protect themselves?
1972.71-1637,0,40519,richard_l_sieg_jr,,918.606,920.001,That is correct.
1972.71-1637,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,920.001,920.855,That’s the governmental action?
1972.71-1637,0,40519,richard_l_sieg_jr,,920.855,934.053,"That’s the governmental action, Your Honor, and I would submit to you-- now, I recognize in Roe versus Wade we have a certain right of privacy."
1972.71-1637,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,991.518,998.034,Which then also apply to obey the Federal Government to clean up the inevitable scream?
1972.71-1637,0,40519,richard_l_sieg_jr,,998.034,1016.15,"I have indicated something along that line in my brief, and I thought it best since I had this problem of presentation that I restrict myself to noise pollution because noise pollution does invade the right of privacy."
1972.71-1637,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1030.897,1035.953,Not by the noisy railroad train.
1972.71-1637,0,40519,richard_l_sieg_jr,,1035.953,1048.549,"If it produced the volume and the effects of jet aircraft, yes, but I-- there is no proper comparison between the two."
1972.71-1637,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1048.549,1052.479,"Well, they do have jet engines now."
1972.71-1637,0,40519,richard_l_sieg_jr,,1052.479,1056.211,"I was not aware of that, Your Honor."
1972.71-1637,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1056.211,1060.946,Would you the same rule apply to the jet engine described in the locomotive?
1972.71-1637,0,40519,richard_l_sieg_jr,,1060.946,1061.462,If it produced--
1972.71-1637,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1061.462,1063.262,In interstate commerce?
1972.71-1637,0,40519,richard_l_sieg_jr,,1063.262,1071.174,"If it produced the same kind of problem that the jet engine in an aircraft produces, yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1637,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1071.174,1076.439,"You’d have to do a little business with quite a few cases, would you?"
1972.71-1637,0,40519,richard_l_sieg_jr,,1076.439,1086.072,Not if the rule that I hope to present to the Court is adopted by the Court.
1972.71-1637,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1126.597,1137.87,"Well, Mr. Sieg, supposing that there had-- were no issue of federal preemption here at all, that Congress had said nothing and there really weren’t any argument that Congress had preempted the matter."
1972.71-1637,0,40519,richard_l_sieg_jr,,1149.104,1150.01,"Not-- no, sir."
1972.71-1637,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1555.674,1562.651,"Your argument is going way, way beyond the issues in this case, isn’t it, at least your arguments you’re now making?"
1972.71-1637,0,40519,richard_l_sieg_jr,,1562.651,1566.512,"It is only-- yes, it is."
1972.71-1637,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1592.38,1604.001,"Thank you, Mr. Sieg."
1972.71-1637,1,37344,nicholas_c_yost,,1608.123,1611.379,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1637,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1938.548,1939.627,Isn’t it-- Mr. Yost.
1972.71-1637,1,37344,nicholas_c_yost,,1939.627,1939.726,Yes?
1972.71-1637,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1939.726,1962.453,"Isn’t it one thing to say that a local ordinance can’t regulate a federal activity that isn’t otherwise covered by statute just by virtue of the Supremacy Clause, and it’s another thing to say that a local ordinance is negated by an affirmative federal statute which, itself, occupies the field?"
1972.71-1637,1,37344,nicholas_c_yost,,1962.453,1966.149,"I’m not sure that I follow that, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1972.71-1637,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2002.746,2029.662,"As I understand the appellees’ contention though, it’s not just that the FAA Tower order was preempted but that the whole federal statutory scheme was preempted, and the contrast I was trying to draw was between that type of an argument and, say, an argument that the City of Burbank couldn’t regulate military take offs -- take offs of military planes quite apart from any statute just because that’s a federal activity."
1972.71-1637,1,37344,nicholas_c_yost,,2029.662,2033.056,I think those are both aspects to it.
1972.71-1637,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2362.189,2384.745,"Mr. Yost, as I -- As I have understood your argument, it’s directed to the appellees’ claim in this case that there is a preemption and the specific conflict between federal and state, and federal and local law which was the basis on which the Court of Appeals tried at this case."
1972.71-1637,1,37344,nicholas_c_yost,,2393.367,2403.048,"Well, only insofar as in viewing a commerce burden issue."
1972.71-1637,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2417.01,2426.181,"There’s nothing in those enactments, is there, that authorizes what would otherwise be an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce?"
1972.71-1637,1,37344,nicholas_c_yost,,2426.181,2427.038,They--
1972.71-1637,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2427.038,2435.809,"You could argue, I suppose, that the necessary implication of the legislation is, but I don’t-- you haven’t argued that, have you really?"
1972.71-1637,1,37344,nicholas_c_yost,,2435.809,2464.974,"Well, I think I have not argued it, but I will argue it, that it becomes sort of ridiculous to put aside the recent congressional enactments in the area if you then say that it’s got to be viewed-- the burden question has to be viewed in sort of abstract apart from what Congress’ most recent--"
1972.71-1637,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2464.974,2466.582,"Oh, it is a separate issue."
1972.71-1637,1,37344,nicholas_c_yost,,2468.252,2469.518,That is an accurate statement.
1972.71-1637,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2470.25,2477.668,"And your argument has been directed, has it not, of this primarily to the preemption and the conflict aspects of this case?"
1972.71-1637,1,37344,nicholas_c_yost,,2477.668,2479.054,That’s correct.
1972.71-1637,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2479.054,2492.083,"But I suppose you could argue equally well that if Congress has authorized local regulation, commerce-- Congress with its plenary power over interstate commerce has removed any commerce argument from the case."
1972.71-1637,1,37344,nicholas_c_yost,,2492.083,2493.208,That’s right.
1972.71-1637,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2493.208,2507.771,"You could argue that Congress have authorized local government to impose what would otherwise be an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce, and since the congressional power is plenary over interstate commerce, presumably it has complete power to do so."
1972.71-1637,1,37344,nicholas_c_yost,,2507.771,2508.742,That’s correct.
1972.71-1637,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2511.581,2512.487,Excuse me.
1972.71-1637,1,37344,nicholas_c_yost,,2518.983,2529.586,"I would take the same view that the United States has, Justice Marshall, that each airport would have to be viewed by itself on the Commerce Clause issue."
1972.71-1637,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2529.586,2543.675,"Well, this airport in this case had had an ordinance on it barring all jet aircraft."
1972.71-1637,1,37344,nicholas_c_yost,,2543.675,2552.049,I am reluctant to venture on an opinion on something which we haven’t pried and there’s no record on.
1972.71-1637,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2571.349,2575.709,"Well, assume it did have half and half."
1972.71-1637,1,37344,nicholas_c_yost,,2585.87,2597.549,"I think, and again looking at the US analysis of that, the Solicitor General’s analysis, that, as a generality, the answer is yes."
1972.71-1637,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2607.581,2616.575,"Thank you, Mr. Yost."
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2618.592,2623.04,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2726.256,2728.175,Your amicus below or the FAA--
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2728.175,2732.292,The FAA was an amicus in both the District Court and the Court of Appeals.
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2732.292,2755.349,"Because, certainly, I would imply no criticism in this question because, paraphrase to Justice Frankfurter, you-- one should welcome wisdom even though it comes late, but it does kind of-- this rather is alien to the adversary system of justice, isn’t it?"
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2773.621,2777.396,"Well, I think, Mr. Justice, we feel we have an obligation to this Court."
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2777.396,2779.578,"No, I’m saying I’m not being grateful at all."
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2779.578,2781.38,To present to this Court the point of view that we think is the right--
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2781.38,2790.76,"But the end result is, perhaps, that the-- it’s a little bit unfair to the whole judicial adversary system."
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2790.76,2800.785,"If I may simply just to rephrase it, I think that it’s unfortunate that the case developed this way, but before this Court there has been a complete development of the fullest adversary positions."
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2801.8,2809.007,And it amounts to 100% confession of error on the part of the amicus.
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2809.007,2810.284,"You might say that, Mr. Justice."
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2810.284,2812.43,"No, I’m stating that’s what it is.[Laughter]"
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2812.43,2820.318,"On the other hand, our opponents have filed a separate brief, a long 43-page brief specifically answering our point."
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2825.803,2828.534,Except not-- but not in the District Court of Appeals.
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2828.534,2833.066,"Not in the District Court and the Court, but there’s no question, Mr. Justice, in this case with respect to any of the facts."
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2864.781,2866.463,It’s never a happy--
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2866.463,2867.618,It is not a happy situation--
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2867.618,2867.964,Situation.
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2867.964,2869.337,But it’s one that we feel it’s our obligation--
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2869.337,2870.942,"It is practical impact, I mean."
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2870.942,2881.192,"And, of course, the governmental interest involved in this case, also the interests of the Department of Transportation which are broader perhaps than those of the Federal Aviation Administration."
1972.71-1637,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2881.192,2906.89,"This sometimes happens even in fields which are not evolving and changing fields, doesn’t it, when a United States attorney takes a position, perhaps in the Southern District of California, and when the case finally gets to you in Washington you come to us and take a different position and then we now send it back and let you tell the government’s to the Trial Court all over."
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2906.89,2907.392,That--
1972.71-1637,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2907.392,2909.056,Or the Court of Appeals.
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2909.056,2912.16,"That has happened, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.71-1637,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2970.652,2978.398,Then you could-- you would concede that any airport control all noise the same.
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2978.398,2989.997,We-- our position is that the airport has the authority to control all noises with the exception that it’s the control power of-- at the airport it has no power to control flight of aircraft.
1972.71-1637,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2991.774,3005.941,"I would bring some studies made in Long Island on detected noise from airports on public school children, and that was more disturbing than anything I’ve seen in this record."
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3018.943,3032.914,"I would think, as far as preemption is concerned, just as far as preemption is concerned I would think that the state would have the authority if it wished to prohibit jet flights in and out of a particular airport."
1972.71-1637,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3049.358,3051.486,I was talking about commerce.
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3051.486,3054.714,"No, commerce is another issue, but I’m just talking about preemption."
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3063.961,3074.33,"We’re talking-- we’re mixing up two very important things, and that is the right of an airport to shut itself down or to limit the hours of flights or to limit all jets."
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3087.232,3087.698,Well--
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3087.698,3094.432,"I think it’s-- as I read the briefs and the statutes and the legislative history, there may be a considerable difference between those two things."
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3094.432,3111.783,"Our position, Mr. Justice, is that, under the statutes, the Congress has not thus far preempted the local governmental bodies from dealing with the question of noise at the airport level."
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3155.425,3160.619,"I mean, here-- the point is, here, the airport operator does not want this curfew."
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3168.904,3173.567,"Well, Mr. Justice, if I may respond on two levels to this."
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3178.314,3186.889,"Well, except-- as I again read the facts of the matter, 99.5% of the airports in the country are operated by governmental agencies."
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3187.107,3187.98,That--
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3187.98,3189.444,So this question doesn’t arise.
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3193.342,3194.08,"That is correct, Mr.--"
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3194.08,3195.914,Here’s a private commercial airport--
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3195.914,3195.967,Yes.
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3195.967,3196.791,A private airport--
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3196.791,3196.898,But--
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3196.898,3203.267,"Privately owned, serving scheduled airlines which is almost unique."
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3203.267,3203.693,But--
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3203.693,3204.172,Isn’t it?
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3204.172,3204.4,Mr. Justice--
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3204.4,3205.458,Factually?
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3205.458,3206.263,"Factually, yes."
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3214.9,3215.659,Maybe it would be.
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3217.077,3238.016,"Well, but I suggest, Mr. Justice, the question is whether the Congress has manifested an intention to preempt this field and, under the analysis of the Court of Appeals in this case, the effect is that Congress has preempted only basically the Burbank airport."
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3257.272,3258.487,Because that’s what the law is.
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3259.551,3281.42,"That’s-- we think, Mr. Justice, that when the various committee reports referred to the authority of the airport owner of local municipal body as the proprietor of the airport, they were not attempting to draw the distinction between the local government body as proprietor of the airport and the local government body exercising its police power."
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3296.546,3299.556,"And the statements talked about operators of airports, didn’t it?"
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3299.556,3301.753,"The statements talked about operators of airports, but--"
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3301.753,3310.708,"And then the theory was that the owner and operator of an airport, that’s his property and he can do with it of how he wishes."
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3314.382,3318.505,"I don’t, in all fairness, agree with that, Mr. Justice."
1972.71-1637,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3364.596,3368.21,"Mr. Friedman, I’m still not clear."
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3389.171,3393.232,"In so far as the question of preemption is concerned, our answer is yes."
1972.71-1637,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3393.232,3396.214,Insofar as any federal regulation is concerned?
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3396.214,3399.392,"Well, there may be a problem under the Commerce Clause, we don’t know."
1972.71-1637,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3548.241,3573.923,"Mr. Friedman, is it a fair paraphrase of your answer to Mr. Stewart that insofar as the preemption point is concerned with congressional interest in uniform policy, it really doesn’t make any difference whether the local initiative comes from the voluntary action of an airport owner or from a municipal ordinance imposing a local requirement on a private proprietor?"
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3573.923,3574.74,Yes.
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3576.262,3589.798,"Do you-- you, too, have not really addressed, except in your answer to Mr. Justice Powell, but your basic argument has not addressed the claim that this is an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce, do you?"
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3589.798,3590.315,Just--
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3590.315,3591.316,"In your brief, I know you say that you--"
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3591.316,3591.92,We have this--
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3591.92,3593.768,You studied airport by airport.
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3593.768,3595.089,We have discussed this in our brief.
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3595.089,3595.148,Yes.
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3595.148,3598.504,"Unfortunately, with the limited time available I couldn’t cover it but our answer--"
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3598.504,3601.47,"No, I just want to be sure that I understood your argument."
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3602.925,3603.487,That is correct.
1972.71-1637,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3604.935,3606.842,I understand.
1972.71-1637,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3606.842,3607.439,Thank you.
1972.71-1637,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3607.439,3611.156,"Thank you, Mr. Friedman."
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,3612.409,3617.874,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3943.483,3951.992,"So far, everything you’ve told us is really what the ships and the personnel had to have in the Huron Portland Cement."
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,3960.659,3973.135,"The fundamental difference between that case and this, Your Honor, is that in that case the federal regulation was directed solely at safety on the seas and the waterways."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3973.135,3977.563,"I suppose that’s what an airworthiness certificate is directed to, isn’t it?"
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,3977.563,3990.063,"Yes, Your Honor, but the FAA, under both the 1958 Act and the 1968 Act, is explicitly required to balance not only those interests, environmental interests as well."
1972.71-1637,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4212.472,4230.965,"Mr. Christopher, what if the Burbank Airport had voluntarily on its own motion decided to impose the same restriction on flights between 11 and 7, would it-- would that decision be acceptable under your line of analysis?"
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,4230.965,4239.445,"Mr. Justice, that raises the question which is not here as to the scope and extent of the power of an airport proprietor."
1972.71-1637,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4297.278,4318.151,"Are you suggesting, Mr. Christopher, that a private airport, having been licensed, becomes something of a common carrier in the sense that it must receive all flights that are authorized by the FAA?"
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,4318.151,4326.179,"Well, the private airport would be in substantially the same situation as other public airports, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.71-1637,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4477.735,4486.059,"Mr. Christopher, do you agree that nothing has been done to establish curfews by the Federal Government, and I emphasize the word “nothing”?"
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,4486.059,4498.599,"Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, the Federal Government acting through the Federal Aviation Agency and the manager, being the manager of national airport, has established a curfew at national airport."
1972.71-1637,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4509.762,4514.479,"Well, I-- may I exclude the Federal Government in Washington?"
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,4514.479,4516.841,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1637,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4548.097,4552.067,But you don’t agree that they haven’t done anything about noise abatement.
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,4552.067,4554.812,I certainly don’t agree that they haven’t done anything about noise abatement.
1972.71-1637,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4562.939,4572.232,"They haven’t done anything because people want to sleep between 11 and 7 in this particular town of Burbank, which is Mr. Sieg’s point as I understand it."
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,4572.232,4575.365,"Well, Your Honor, I could not agree that they’ve done nothing there."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4671.855,4681.882,Is that-- that letter is printed I guess in several places in the brief. Can you just tell me one place in one of the briefs?
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,4681.882,4682.241,Yes.
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4685.374,4687.876,Government’s brief?
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,4687.876,4700.242,"No, it’s printed at the back of the Burbank brief, Your Honor, the appellants’ brief."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4700.242,4707.935,"There are quite a few briefs in this case, didn’t you know?"
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,4707.935,4710.463,"We’re at least partly responsible for that, Your Honor."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4711.834,4711.914,Yes.
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,4711.914,4720.653,"The back of the grey brief of the appellants’-- their main brief, and it’s in the first appendix."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4728.365,4729.584,Right.
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,4729.584,4741.485,"But, down at the middle of the page, you see the sentences, HR3400 would merely expand the government’s role in a field already preempted."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4751.605,4752.576,"And, however--"
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,4752.576,4760.202,"And, however, the proposed legislation will not affect the rights of a state and local public agency as a proprietor of an airport, and so on."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4760.202,4763.91,"Right, and this was a letter from the Secretary, was it?"
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,4763.91,4764.451,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4787.344,4790.774,The Secretary was over there testifying and then he remembered he--
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,4790.774,4791.113,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4791.473,4792.344,He went on.
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,4795.482,4796.027,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4796.027,4798.097,"And the letter, you say, was adopted in the committee report."
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,4798.097,4799.811,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4799.811,4800.572,As its own.
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,4800.572,4819.954,As its statement of the respective rights of the local and state governments.
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4934.813,4939.418,This doesn’t become a very important case then if that’s the distinction.
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,4949.993,4952.441,"Your Honor, I’m glad to have a chance to address that question."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4970.835,4973.694,"In other words, Kentucky can pass along to the Cincinnati airport."
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,4973.694,4991.333,"That’s right, and we’ve shown in our brief at page 35 and 36 the very many examples there are of airports which are operated by cities or by counties but which exists, at least all or in part, in other jurisdictions: San Francisco, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Atlanta."
1972.71-1637,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4991.333,5000.452,"Yet that’s a question that really isn’t here, isn’t it, Mr. Christopher because, as I gather, the Burbank Airport is almost entirely in the confines of the City of Burbank."
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,5000.452,5002.727,"The question is here, Mr. Justice."
1972.71-1637,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5015.6,5032.453,But wouldn’t other constitutional and statutory principles come into play if you had the State of Kentucky enacting an ordinance that purported to affect an airport that was operated on the Ohio side of the river or something like that?
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5032.453,5032.941,"No, but it’s on the Kentucky side."
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,5035.329,5044.038,"Others might, Mr. Justice, but this own certainly would and I think that’s a fundamental position that we’ll be taking throughout the case."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5088.104,5098.354,"Then do I understand you to be saying, Mr. Christopher, conceding that if your client, the owner-operator of the airport which is the what, Lockheed Corporation or the City--"
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,5098.354,5099.862,Yes.
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5099.862,5112.099,"If your client wanted to impose this curfew, it could freely do so without running into any problems of either preemption or conflict?"
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,5112.099,5124.132,"Your Honor, I would have to say that the scope of the proprietor’s rights depends upon state law, and you’d have to examine very carefully whether or not there might be some conflict with existing federal regulation."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5133.902,5135.884,"Well, I’m talking about preemption or conflict."
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,5148.823,5154.968,"Your Honor, I would say that that’s more true of preemption than it is of conflict."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5184.464,5186.017,But there is no such--
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,5186.017,5187.174,There is no such restriction.
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5187.174,5190.347,In either in this case or anywhere else I see in the briefs.
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,5207.887,5209.733,"That certainly is our position, Your Honor."
1972.71-1637,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5227.911,5243.026,"Well, then is this reservation of the power in this Secretary’s letter and other things that you rely on to private airport proprietors really kind of an illusory thing that doesn’t amount to much in practice?"
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,5243.026,5243.68,Not at all.
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5256.323,5275.914,"You point out, if under the law the airport proprietor is liable to adjoining property owners for under the cases of this Court, he certainly should have the commencery power to seize the conduct that would the liabilities, isn’t it correct?"
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,5275.914,5276.334,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1637,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5517.288,5524.621,"What was the time sequence, Mr. Christopher, between the issuance of the FAA order and the enactment of the municipal ordinance?"
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,5524.621,5531.606,"Well, the FAA order was substantially before the enactment of the ordinance."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5582.701,5585.217,Maybe you said this and I didn’t hear it because I wasn’t attentive.
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,5596.316,5597.518,"Your Honor, I know of none."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5601.918,5605.364,"And that, apparently, in your submission, not even a curfew."
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,5606.832,5618.238,"Yes, that’s a voluntary agreement, but the most significant aspect of it, to me, is imposed by the airport proprietor and it’s imposed by the National Airspace Manager of the Federal Aviation Agency."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5618.238,5628.721,"Would you-- I suppose you not only would concede but would insist on the power of the FAA to do this if it wanted to, wouldn’t you?"
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,5628.721,5630.755,"Yes, by all means, Your Honor."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5659.289,5665.235,"Because there are many small airports, are there not still, that cannot be and are not operated at night for safety reasons?"
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,5665.235,5666.294,"Absolutely right, Your Honor."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5667.668,5668.894,Right.
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,5668.894,5676.691,"What we are saying is that this is a question of power, not a question of whether there should be curfews but who has power to impose them."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5850.027,5868.268,"Your argument basically relies on the inevitable interrelationship of the airports around the country because of speed and time and you suddenly can’t takeoff from the west coast then it can’t takeoff from somewhere else during the daytime, and so on."
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,5868.358,5869.763,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5869.763,5871.336,So basic interrelationship?
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,5871.336,5886.552,"Basic interrelationship, and we say that that is a reason independent of burden-- independent of a burden analysis for holding here that the Commerce Clause requires that these restrictions be imposed, if at all, by a centralized authority."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6045.333,6051.44,That was in a case that Massachusetts-- an opinion of the justices having to do with proposed legislation.
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,6051.44,6051.988,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6061.019,6063.481,And did the-- the Court advised--
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,6063.481,6063.792,The Court--
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6063.792,6066.272,There would be unconstitutional legislation.
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,6066.272,6068.743,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6288.248,6290.25,Bibb case?
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,6290.25,6291.936,"Yes, the Bibb case is very much in point."
1972.71-1637,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6291.936,6293.241,It helps you in this aspect of your argument.
1972.71-1637,3,44339,warren_christopher,,6293.241,6295.003,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1637,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6407.197,6412.657,Was Continental affected at all by simply the application of the Burbank curfew?

1972.71-1637,4,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7029.604,7030.017,That’s right.
