1962.511,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,31.096,"Number 511, James E. Bush, Petitioner, versus Bruce Allen -- versus Texas rather."
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,32.818,36.106,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1962.511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,157.291,177.335,"Mr. Wright, I know you're here trying to prevail on what seemed to you important constitutional questions, but I trust that before your argument is finished, youâ€™ll tell us what do you think is the effect of the supplemental brief which had been filed for the respondent yesterday I think, showing that --"
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,177.335,180.726,"I'd be very glad, Justice Stewart, to tell you that immediately."
1962.511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,285.369,294.481,"I was thinking, Mr. Wright, not so much of mootness as I was of a -- the equivalent of a confession of error."
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,311.392,313.486,"October 21st, 1960."
1962.511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,313.486,325.931,"So that's certainly within many years, however many years it is and -- isn't this then a finding by the State's expert that the -- that the -- this person was probably not guilty?"
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,325.931,331.385,"It is surely that -- if we'd that finding at the time of the trial as we asked, I think, we would never have been here."
1962.511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,331.385,332.272,But we do have it now (Voice Overlap) --
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,332.272,333.089,We do have it now.
1962.511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,333.089,346.301,"And it -- as I understand your briefs, your earlier briefs, the Texas law is clear and I suppose the law of every state is clear that the person cannot be convicted of the criminal offense if indeed he was not responsible for his acts at the time of the alleged offense."
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,346.301,347.228,Entirely clear.
1962.511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,347.228,355.239,Is this a -- was this the [Inaudible] continued on by [Inaudible] or would there have to be a collateral proceeding.
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,357.816,371.369,"So far as I'm advised, Mr. Justice White, and since I received the brief on Sunday, I'm not fully briefed on the point, but as best I can determine, I can find no collateral procedure available under Texas law by which this can be brought up."
1962.511,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,399.658,400.24,"Well, Mr. Wright, what are --"
1962.511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,400.24,400.701,"Well, what if --"
1962.511,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,400.701,408.491,"-- suppose we would've vacated this judgment of conviction and remand to the Court of Criminal Appeals, that's where it would go, would it?"
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,408.491,409.157,"It would, Your Honor."
1962.511,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,409.157,417.312,"For reconsideration in light of the dispatch now represented to us by the Attorney General, I take it is that -- of Texas?"
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,417.312,424.488,"Mr. Justice Brennan, the Attorney General perhaps can speak with more authority as to what course the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals would take."
1962.511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,497.687,497.882,Yes.
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,515.799,517.671,"Mr. Justice White, I can't answer that with regards to this case --"
1962.511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,517.671,527.564,"And one of the [Inaudible] to this appeal is before the Texas Court was whether or not this man was insane at the time of the crime, wouldn't it, right on the merit?"
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,527.564,528.22,Absolutely.
1962.511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,528.22,531.872,That's still is one of the issues in the case?
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,531.872,533.874,It is clearly one of the issues.
1962.511,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,537.506,544.24,"Mr. Wright, what was the procedure utilized in the Bush case in 313 [Inaudible]"
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,544.24,550.009,"That was a petition, Mr. Justice Clark, for habeas corpus alleging that he had not had a lawyer."
1962.511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,567.931,569.925,What's that Gibbs citation?
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,569.925,574.79,"Gibbs v. Texas, it's 308 S.W.2d 515, it's a 1958 decision."
1962.511,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,574.79,583.585,"Well, do I -- do I correctly infer from your answers Mr. Wright, that you're not sure what would happen if you were to send -- vacate this [Inaudible]"
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,583.585,591.268,"I -- that is -- in part, I think, a very accurate statement of my present state of knowledge Mr. Justice Brennan."
1962.511,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,600.006,617.184,"They could, could they not, in view of the situation and the reason, vacate that judgment as there's no acts or no way for them to proceed or send it to the trial court to determine this new issue again?"
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,637.31,645.868,"I should like to believe, Mr. Justice Black, Texas procedure is flexible enough so that it can provide some redress under those circumstances."
1962.511,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,673.939,685.272,"Mr. Wright, the tenor of this is not alone that he was insane at the time of trial, but indeed that he was insane at the time of the commission of alleged offense, is it?"
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,685.272,699.385,"It depends entirely on what Doctor Hug means by many years and also what he means when he says at most partially responsible, whether or not this could be sufficient responsibility to meet the right or wrong test of the Texas statutes."
1962.511,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,699.385,704.333,Am I right that there was a finding that he was insane in this particular case?
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,704.502,716.178,"There were two findings, Mr. Justice Clark, on two successive days, two different juries found him to -- insane both at the time of the event and at the time of trial."
1962.511,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,716.178,733.792,"So you might have a complication, might you not, because I suppose that the question here would be whether he had the process and that he's only given the 20 minutes or whatever it was to have a psychiatrist and the State didn't provide a psychiatrist as I understood it rather than they often did in the county --"
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,733.792,734.407,It can be helpful [Inaudible]
1962.511,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,734.407,736.894,"-- doctors, whatever you call it."
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,749.531,764.057,"I think Mr. Justice Clark, I would have a hard time persuading the Court of Criminal Appeals, but a doctor's report in 1963 demonstrates that the Court committed error in 1961 in making the finding which it did."
1962.511,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,789.058,796.597,What Court was -- that heard the Bush case before in the 333?
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,796.597,798.946,That was the Court of Criminal Appeals.
1962.511,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,798.946,799.502,Which court?
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,799.502,801.257,"The Court of Criminal Appeals, sir."
1962.511,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,801.257,808.226,"I mean it found the facts, it was the trial court, wasn't there in the Texas procedure?"
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,811.891,818.122,"I'm advised, Mr. Justice Clark, that there was a District Court, yes, in, I believe Johnson County."
1962.511,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,818.122,818.722,Johnson?
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,818.722,819.758,Yes.
1962.511,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,819.758,821.123,"That's a different district, isn't it?"
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,821.123,822.481,Yes it is.
1962.511,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,822.481,823.445,"This is in Ellis, isn't it?"
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,823.445,826.339,This is in Ellis County.
1962.511,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,826.339,831.452,Thank you.
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,831.452,852.552,"The States -- if the Court wishes to listen to argument on the merits at this time, the State's position as I understand it, is that they gave petitioner an adequate opportunity to sustain his plea of insanity that the county health officer testified."
1962.511,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,894.201,947.781,[Inaudible]
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,947.781,948.768,"It was, Your Honor."
1962.511,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,948.768,952.87,[Inaudible]
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,952.87,953.077,Yes sir.
1962.511,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,953.077,954.294,[Inaudible]
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,954.294,955.06,Gasoline.
1962.511,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,955.06,956.547,[Inaudible]
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,956.547,958.666,"Gathered from Dallas, that's a given."
1962.511,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,958.666,971.755,[Inaudible]
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,971.755,974.554,"That is the fact, Mr. Justice Goldberg."
1962.511,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,996.153,1025.301,"So, in this case [Inaudible], if that is so, we have the [Inaudible]"
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1025.301,1027.43,"There is that question in the case, yes."
1962.511,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1027.43,1028.685,[Inaudible]
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1028.685,1050.15,"The trial judge in qualifying the bill of exceptions after the trial at page 38 of the record refers to Dr. Dial, a supposed expert and says that he had ample time to make whatever examination he needed to make, that's after Dr. Dial had testified that his examination was entirely inadequate."
1962.511,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1064.376,1069.089,[Inaudible]
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1069.089,1071.27,"Yes, Your Honor, the motion was made."
1962.511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1670.979,1673.188,How far do you think those implications go?
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1703.381,1715.085,"Mr. Justice Stewart, I can accept that sentence from Griffin at least as an expression of the ideal to which we strive of the practical problems of course are very difficult."
1962.511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1743.938,1762.995,"Well, the rules still does -- I mean, the facts whatever the rule may be and whatever the ideal may be, the facts of life are that for better or for worst, the kind of a trial a man gets does to an extent depend on how much money he has and how good his judgment is in selecting lawyers and doctors, isn't that true?"
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1762.995,1763.651,I'm sure it's true.
1962.511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1763.651,1768.798,And all the rules in the world aren't going to change those facts of life.
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1768.798,1774.788,Well that the rules could do a good deal toward minimizing the disparity.
1962.511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1783.115,1788.763,It's a matter of degree then because here you did have a physician who had studied psychiatry in medical school.
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1792.549,1798.39,That is correct and had referred people with more serious emotional problems to specialties.
1962.511,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1810.626,1820.143,[Inaudible]
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1820.143,1822.025,"I agree, Mr. Justice Goldberg."
1962.511,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1822.025,1832.655,[Inaudible]
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1832.655,1832.974,Correct.
1962.511,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1832.974,1840.86,[Inaudible]
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1840.86,1843.547,The trial on the merits had been set April the 24th.
1962.511,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1848.331,1854.463,[Inaudible]
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1854.463,1854.641,Yes.
1962.511,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1854.641,1855.505,[Inaudible]
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1855.505,1855.842,Yes.
1962.511,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1855.842,1867.716,You filed a [Inaudible]
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1867.716,1868.027,Yes.
1962.511,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1868.027,1880.615,[Inaudible]
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1880.615,1881.206,That is correct.
1962.511,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1881.206,1881.839,[Inaudible]
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1881.839,1882.151,Yes.
1962.511,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1882.151,1888.756,[Inaudible]
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1888.756,1895.105,That's right.
1962.511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1895.105,1900.444,"On the merits, that jury also -- your defense was not guilty by reason of insanity."
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1900.444,1901.28,That's right.
1962.511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1901.28,1910.376,"And that jury heard substantially the same evidence except not -- but not Doctor Dial and the police chief instead of the jailer or something like that, the sheriff --"
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1910.376,1911.797,Because the evidence was virtually the same --
1962.511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1911.797,1912.458,And virtually the same --
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1912.458,1913.823,Without a change --
1962.511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1913.823,1917.886,"Plus however, plus the finding of the previous day's jury."
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1917.886,1923.865,"The judgment from April 24th, in which the jury found him to be sane as introduced in evidence in April 25th."
1962.511,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1956.438,1958.281,How was he court appointed?
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1958.281,1963.445,He was appointed -- the record reflects about three week before the case was set for trial.
1962.511,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1971.658,1982.412,Had nothing to show that he -- that Bush wasn't available before April 21st for an examination by anybody that Moore was able to produce.
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1982.412,1992.727,There is nothing to show that Mr. Justice Clark nor is there anything to show that there was any examiner available who would come to make the examination prior to that time.
1962.511,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2019.742,2022.847,Had there been a continuance before?
1962.511,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2022.847,2027.323,"No, not so far as the record reflects."
1962.511,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2036.912,2042.821,Mr. Allen.
1962.511,1,17404,bruce_allen,,2042.821,2043.114,Mr. Chief Justice.
1962.511,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2043.114,2051.844,Do you mind addressing yourself first to the question of that latest brief of yours?
1962.511,1,17404,bruce_allen,,2051.844,2054.945,"No, Your Honor, I would say this."
1962.511,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2095.042,2096.739,Does that have any legal effect?
1962.511,1,17404,bruce_allen,,2096.739,2100.538,"I don't think it does, I'm glad you asked that question, I like to answer that now."
1962.511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2206.156,2210.204,"he had about -- he had about six years experience in general practice, is that it?"
1962.511,1,17404,bruce_allen,,2210.204,2210.704,Yes sir.
1962.511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2234.694,2237.947,In medical school and then he had about six years practice.
1962.511,1,17404,bruce_allen,,2237.947,2239.009,Six years practice in which he --
1962.511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2239.009,2248.723,"Now, doesn't the record also show that in order to become a psychiatrist and I know your point that in Texas there is no such a thing."
1962.511,1,17404,bruce_allen,,2248.723,2250.017,That's right.
1962.511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2250.017,2255.489,"But in order to become a fellow or whatever it is, it takes five or six years of post graduate study after (Voice Overlap) --"
1962.511,1,17404,bruce_allen,,2255.489,2257.859,"I believe he's had four to six, yes Your Honor."
1962.511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2257.859,2259.17,Four to six years?
1962.511,1,17404,bruce_allen,,2259.17,2259.764,That's right.
1962.511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2259.764,2261.46,Before you're allowed to practice at all?
