1983.83-305,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.285,We will hear arguments next in California against Trombetta.
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,78.381,79.416,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1983.83-305,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,367.003,371.824,"Mr. Kirk, how widespread is the use of the Intoxolizer around the country?"
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,371.824,378.244,"As far as I know, Your Honor, it is used virtually from shore to shore."
1983.83-305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,402.026,403.961,"General Kirk, would you just help me out on one thing?"
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,415.686,426.542,"--Your Honor, that is talking about the indium tube device or actually the gas chromatograph, which analyzes an indium tube as part of the process."
1983.83-305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,430.26,431.112,I see.
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,434.48,435.13,"No, Your Honor."
1983.83-305,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,435.697,436.447,--in California?
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,436.447,457.393,"--It is not widely used in California, and there is only one single county which has ever made any kind of continuous use, and that is the county of San Bernadino, which since 1973 has used it because of the difficulty of collecting breath samples in a widespread county."
1983.83-305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,818.98,820.766,"General Kirk, may I just ask this?"
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,827.336,837.876,"Well, Your Honor, as a practical matter that has to be sent to a laboratory and analyzed there before it is of any value to us."
1983.83-305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,837.876,841.328,"Supposing that was done, and after they got through they just threw it away, they just made a record of it."
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,843.463,852.302,"Well, I certainly think that it would expose the state to challenge as to the validity of the results."
1983.83-305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,870.08,872.032,Just a matter of credibility--
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,872.032,872.699,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,872.699,873.799,--as to the weight of the evidence.
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,892.379,898.682,"Well, again, I don't think that due process requires us to resort to any particular procedure."
1983.83-305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,907.038,911.09,"The question I am really getting up to is, why don't you do that?"
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,911.09,912.692,Because we do not believe it is possible.
1983.83-305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,914.376,915.478,"They do this in Colorado, don't they?"
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,915.478,922.048,"--In Colorado, according to the statistics that I have cited to the Court in the Montoya case, there is an 80 percent error."
1983.83-305,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,934.206,942.878,How long would blood remain in a static condition so that it could be tested and retested weeks later?
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,942.878,948.949,"Under our regulations, Your Honor, it can be stored as long and is kept as long as one year."
1983.83-305,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,948.949,952.651,"Well, stored, but it must be refrigerated, must it not?"
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,952.651,960.923,"Yes, it has preservatives in it, and it is stored under refrigerated conditions, and it can be retested for up to one year accurately."
1983.83-305,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,960.923,966.577,And then you have about five days of tests as to what the preservatives due to it.
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,966.577,969.427,"That does happen, frankly."
1983.83-305,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,969.427,970.329,Don't you?
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,970.912,975.683,"Now, due process is the concept of fair play."
1983.83-305,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,995.244,998.862,"Is this your own idea, or are you quoting from something?"
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,998.862,1005.368,"Well, I am slightly paraphrasing some decisions of this Court, Your Honor."
1983.83-305,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1034.804,1040.189,"General, is there any procedure for keeping this air?"
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1040.189,1044.16,"In the opinion of the state of California, no, Your Honor."
1983.83-305,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1044.16,1047.712,No evidence was produced in this case?
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1047.712,1059.336,"In this case there was some evidence, but there were no findings by the trial court to that effect, as contrasted with, for example, the State of Colorado case--"
1983.83-305,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1059.336,1061.62,"First of all, I would like to know how you catch it."
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1064.655,1067.073,"--Well, that's one of the--"
1983.83-305,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1067.073,1069.441,There is nothing here in the record that will help me on that?
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1069.441,1084.285,"--In the record, Your Honor, I believe there is some testimony from a defense expert, with which we would not agree by any means, suggesting that you could capture it with an indium tube or with silica gel."
1983.83-305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1110.935,1117.606,"Well, but you can capture the air with a different machine."
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1119.224,1119.824,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-305,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1169.307,1172.509,And you also say it is not required by the constitution.
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1172.509,1178.33,"Yes, because due process and fair trial does not require only one kind of procedure."
1983.83-305,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1193.672,1201.862,"This sounds to me like a very amorphous concept you are talking about, a fair opportunity to challenge the state's case."
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1218.055,1222.792,"That has been the traditional rule in this country, Your Honor."
1983.83-305,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1222.792,1235.249,"I just don't see how a vague phrase like ""a fair opportunity to challenge"" moves the ball much in this rather particular situation, where we are talking about, I take it, whether Brady against Maryland should be extended."
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1235.249,1243.105,"Well, what we are talking about here is what process is due, what is fair."
1983.83-305,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1243.105,1249.609,But we don't have to start all over with the adoption of the Constitution in every case we hear argued.
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1254.08,1255.73,Certainly.
1983.83-305,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1258.115,1260.365,"Well, it is your case to argue."
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1260.365,1280.194,"When physical evidence is lost or destroyed, it is true that the defendant can no longer see it for himself, but neither can the jury, and the absence of the physical proof both diminishes the weight of the state's case and exposes it to doubts arising from the loss."
1983.83-305,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1341.619,1354.41,Is each report in some way coated so that the identification number of the particular machine as well as the operator is part of the permanent record?
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1354.41,1354.927,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-305,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1426.958,1431.243,Are you sure that these machines are available to the public?
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1431.243,1435.914,"These machines can be commonly purchased by anyone, Your Honor."
1983.83-305,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1437.997,1441.134,"I thought it cost around $2,200."
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1441.134,1443.55,"This particular machine costs $4,000."
1983.83-305,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1443.55,1444.252,That's right.
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1444.252,1459.012,"Now, the average person obviously is not going to go out and buy one, but he has access to them through private laboratories and the courts permit him to have access to the particular machine that he was tested on."
1983.83-305,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1459.012,1459.896,The average person knows that?
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1459.896,1460.779,I beg your pardon?
1983.83-305,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1460.779,1462.963,The average person knows that?
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1462.963,1473.771,"I would not hazard to guess that, Your Honor, at all, but as a matter of fact when he gets into court he will know that he can go and test that machine if he wishes."
1983.83-305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1473.771,1476.171,"General Kirk, can I ask you a question--"
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1476.171,1476.807,"Yes, sir."
1983.83-305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1476.807,1478.373,--on that procedure?
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1485.913,1486.363,Correct.
1983.83-305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1486.363,1503.207,"--and made its new ruling just prospective only, and it relied in part, at least the concurring judge did, on the failure to tell the arrested person that he had a choice between this procedure and the either blood or urine sample as opposed to a breath sample."
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1512.996,1515.932,"In my view, that is a state requirement."
1983.83-305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1545.467,1556.425,"Well, if that is the case, is it not possible that this judgment, at least insofar as the particular people before the court are concerned, rests on the state ground that they failed to give the advice required by state law?"
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1556.425,1557.159,"Oh, no."
1983.83-305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1561.977,1562.696,I see.
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1562.696,1574.404,"It strictly says that you must preserve a sample, and because you didn't in this case, that violates due process and the evidence must be excluded."
1983.83-305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1576.071,1584.326,"I understand that is what the majority opinion says, but it is true that the officers did also violate state law in a way set forth in the concurring opinion."
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1584.326,1584.676,No.
1983.83-305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1592.348,1592.915,I see.
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1592.915,1595.717,And I do not believe the concurring opinion says that.
1983.83-305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1606.442,1607.325,I see.
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1607.325,1613.429,"This is what the concurring opinion does, but that was not the state of the law at the time, and the decision does not rest on that at all."
1983.83-305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1613.429,1613.912,I see.
1983.83-305,0,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,1613.912,1638.311,"Now, the additional part of Trombetta, the collection part, casts the state in the role of an agent for the defense, and causes a serious distortion of the adversary process, and an incredible tension between competing interests and duties on the part of the officer."
1983.83-305,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1646.781,1647.733,Very well.
1983.83-305,1,31731,john_f_de_meo,,1653.637,1686.608,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, petitioner argues for a rule on the due process duty to preserve which in the final analysis would permit law enforcement to choose unilaterally methods of testing which in effect would use up or consume or discard or destroy the evidence which is vital on the issue of the guilt or the innocence of an accused in the driving under the influence case."
1983.83-305,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1686.608,1698.499,Would you find it constitutionally objectionable if the officers were trained to take a blood test and... take a blood test right on the scene?
1983.83-305,1,31731,john_f_de_meo,,1698.499,1701.118,"I would not, Your Honor."
1983.83-305,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1721.595,1726.149,"Do they now take blood tests right at the time of the arrest, out on the road?"
1983.83-305,1,31731,john_f_de_meo,,1726.149,1727.416,"No, they do not, Your Honor."
1983.83-305,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1764.108,1765.908,May I stop you right there?
1983.83-305,1,31731,john_f_de_meo,,1765.908,1766.626,--Yes.
1983.83-305,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1766.626,1772.53,"Does the government destroy this evidence, ""destroy""?"
1983.83-305,1,31731,john_f_de_meo,,1772.53,1776.148,"In effect, that's what happens, Your Honor."
1983.83-305,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1776.148,1776.882,"Well, why don't you say it?"
1983.83-305,1,31731,john_f_de_meo,,1778.132,1779.017,"Yes, they--"
1983.83-305,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1779.017,1779.917,They don't do a thing.
1983.83-305,1,31731,john_f_de_meo,,1784.338,1785.321,--They don't preserve.
1983.83-305,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1785.321,1792.491,"You want to put an affirmative duty on them, not to stop them from doing something, but to make them do something."
1983.83-305,1,31731,john_f_de_meo,,1795.043,1850.446,"Your Honor, what I do want them to do is, when they embark upon the process of a collection of evidence which bears directly on the guilt or innocence of the accused, I want them then in that case to be sure that they preserve a sample of that evidence or its equivalent so that the defendant on the trial is not placed in the position where he must only be permitted to cross examine the machine that was used or a piece of paper where the results of the test are reported to cross examine as to whether or not it is connected up or not with this defendant, or perhaps there was an error, or whether or not in effect the expert who is testifying may not have made an error in Calibrating the machine."
1983.83-305,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1871.675,1876.043,"Well, there is one way he could do that if he wanted to spend $4,000 to buy a machine and carry it in the car with him."
1983.83-305,1,31731,john_f_de_meo,,1877.745,1880.864,"Yes, Your Honor, I suppose that would."
1983.83-305,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1887.518,1888.101,"Well, Mr. DeMeo--"
1983.83-305,1,31731,john_f_de_meo,,1888.101,1888.735,Yes.
1983.83-305,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1888.735,1896.973,--why is it impractical for someone who has plenty of his own breath still on his body to preserve it for himself if he wants to?
1983.83-305,1,31731,john_f_de_meo,,1896.973,1899.408,"Excellent, Your Honor."
1983.83-305,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1899.408,1908.781,People who are arrested for DWI often resort to their own requested blood samples or breath tests.
1983.83-305,1,31731,john_f_de_meo,,1910.716,1911.883,"You can, Your Honor."
1983.83-305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2009.297,2016.319,But the fact that the government had the means to do it and it is simple certainly does not mean it is constitutionally required.
1983.83-305,1,31731,john_f_de_meo,,2026.008,2028.293,"Well, not nice, Your Honor."
1983.83-305,2,19331,charles_rb_kirk,,3563.981,3568.035,"No, Your Honor, I don't, unless the Court has any further questions."
1983.83-305,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3568.035,3569.052,"No, counsel, we do not."
