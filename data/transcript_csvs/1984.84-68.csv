1984.84-68,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.504,We will hear arguments next in Kerr-McGee against Navajo Tribe of Indians.
1984.84-68,0,17054,alvin_h_shrago,,89.741,109.554,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, at issue in this case is whether an Indian tribe may unilaterally, without any approval whatsoever from the Secretary of the Interior, impose taxes on non-Indian oil and gas lessees."
1984.84-68,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,481.497,484.199,Did the Tenth Circuit also reverse?
1984.84-68,0,17054,alvin_h_shrago,,484.199,507.213,"Yes, Justice Blackmun, the Tenth Circuit, before the Ninth Circuit rendered its decision, had rendered a decision in the case of Southland Royalty versus Navajo Tribe of Indians in which it had reversed the decision of the Federal District Judge in Utah, and the Ninth Circuit incorporated by reference the reasoning and the result in the Tenth Circuit's decision."
1984.84-68,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,533.597,544.321,"Mr. Shrago, do you think the Merrion decision recognized only a limited sovereign power to tax conditioned on the requirement of the Secretary's approval?"
1984.84-68,0,17054,alvin_h_shrago,,544.321,552.01,"I think, Justice O'Connor, that the Merrion decision recognized that Indian tribes generally have an inherent power to tax."
1984.84-68,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,564.918,578.744,"Well, your answer to my question is basically no, and if that is the case, why should we distinguish among tribes governed by the Indian Reorganization Act and tribes that aren't?"
1984.84-68,0,17054,alvin_h_shrago,,578.744,598.705,"--Because as this Court held in Merrion, the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 set forth a procedure whereby tribes should adopt constitutions and then if they wish to tax non-Indians, announce their intention to tax non-Indians and have their taxing ordinances approved by the Secretary of the Interior."
1984.84-68,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,620.238,627.642,"Well, is there any specific provision of the Indian Reorganization Act that requires Secretarial approval of taxes?"
1984.84-68,0,17054,alvin_h_shrago,,627.642,629.261,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.84-68,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,698.838,701.857,But that was of a tribe that had adopted a constitution.
1984.84-68,0,17054,alvin_h_shrago,,701.857,717.484,"No, Your Honor, this was in connection with a proposed constitution that was being drafted and circulated to the Secretary for his review, the constitution that was being proposed for the Navajos to adopt under Section 6 of the Navaho Hopi Rehabilitation Act."
1984.84-68,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,718.934,723.638,And what was the Secretary's opinion with respect to that proposed constitution?
1984.84-68,0,17054,alvin_h_shrago,,723.638,729.126,The proposed... the Secretary had a number of opinions with respect to that proposed constitution.
1984.84-68,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,729.126,730.476,But the one you just adverted to.
1984.84-68,0,17054,alvin_h_shrago,,730.476,745.736,"Yes, he did observe that there were some powers that were articulated in this proposed constitution that should be subject to Secretarial review, and he had some criticisms about the constitution that had at that time been drafted."
1984.84-68,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,745.736,756.276,"Well, did he express the view that there was some statute on the books that would require them to be subject to Secretarial review as opposed to simply having it desirable as a matter of choice?"
1984.84-68,0,17054,alvin_h_shrago,,756.276,779.725,"He expressed the view that the language existing law, vesting tribes with authority to exercise powers according to existing law, the same language that had been used in the 1934 Act, necessarily included the understanding that those powers, before they could be exercised, must be approved by the Secretary of the Interior."
1984.84-68,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,848.786,852.405,But the Congress didn't require the tribes to adopt constitutions.
1984.84-68,0,17054,alvin_h_shrago,,852.405,854.19,"That is correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.84-68,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,860.444,867.015,"And the tribes retained, if they didn't adopt a constitution, certain sovereign powers, did they not?"
1984.84-68,0,17054,alvin_h_shrago,,867.015,869.45,"Your Honor, there is a difference between--"
1984.84-68,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,869.45,870.45,Did they not?
1984.84-68,0,17054,alvin_h_shrago,,870.45,871.235,--I would say yes.
1984.84-68,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,871.235,871.919,Okay.
1984.84-68,0,17054,alvin_h_shrago,,876.62,880.34,"I believe that question has been answered in Merrion, and we are not--"
1984.84-68,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,880.34,883.626,"And the Court said, yes, it includes that."
1984.84-68,0,17054,alvin_h_shrago,,883.626,917.28,"--That's correct, but the Court also went further and said that before the power to tax could be exercised, it had to be approved by the Secretary of the Interior, and in fact Justice Marshall in the opinion in Merrion explicitly made the distinction between the existence of a sovereign power to tax, which he explained, that neither the tribe's constitution, in that case the Jicarilla Apache Tribe, nor the Federal Constitution is the font of any tribal sovereign power to tax."
1984.84-68,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1048.867,1050.617,"We will resume there at l: 00 o'clock, counsel."
1984.84-68,0,17054,alvin_h_shrago,,1050.617,1051.136,--Thank you.
1984.84-68,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1051.136,1070.431,"You may continue, counsel."
1984.84-68,0,17054,alvin_h_shrago,,1070.431,1074.216,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.84-68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1174.098,1180.902,"Well, the Navajos maybe knew what they were doing."
1984.84-68,0,17054,alvin_h_shrago,,1180.902,1190.043,"That is exactly the point I am trying to make, Justice White, that if you adopt the argument that has been made by the Ninth Circuit--"
1984.84-68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1190.043,1191.01,"Well, they just knew better."
1984.84-68,0,17054,alvin_h_shrago,,1191.01,1199.482,--That they knew better than the draftsmen of the legislation and the Congress I think is a remarkable conclusion to reach.
1984.84-68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1199.482,1201.065,May be.
1984.84-68,0,17054,alvin_h_shrago,,1201.065,1219.396,"Nevertheless, if that conclusion is reached, then the majority of Indian tribes in this nation that adopted constitutions under the IRA have been frankly tricked by the Congress, by President Roosevelt, by Commissioner Collier, by the federal government for 50 years."
1984.84-68,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1612.566,1615.618,Has that yet happened with any tribe?
1984.84-68,0,17054,alvin_h_shrago,,1615.618,1632.647,"Yes, in fact, Justice Brennan, the United States points in its brief that it is now engaged in a process of encouraging tribes to eliminate the provisions in tribal constitutions calling for Secretarial review."
1984.84-68,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1664.066,1676.407,"Well, would it be your view that once having adopted a constitution, the tribe may not of itself in any event disband the constitution?"
1984.84-68,0,17054,alvin_h_shrago,,1676.407,1677.691,"No, Your Honor."
1984.84-68,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1774.755,1779.457,Ms. Bernstein.
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,1779.457,1804.422,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the Navajo Tribal Council enacted the broad-based tax laws at issue in this case because it is badly in need of funds to provide essential governmental services, including police, fire protection, roads, health care, clean drinking water, to a reservation of over 25,000 square miles."
1984.84-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2093.961,2106.435,"What is the explanation or the speculation as to why the tribes, some tribes or perhaps all of them who adopted constitutions put in this requirement of Secretarial approval?"
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2106.435,2110.073,"Well, first of all, Your Honor, it was not the case that all tribes did so."
1984.84-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2166.592,2177.967,What authority would the Secretary have under federal law to approve or disapprove a taxing ordinance even though the tribal constitution required it to do?
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2181.835,2184.787,The Secretary's--
1984.84-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2184.787,2195.16,"I would think the Secretary would say, I don't see any federal statute that gives me any power to approve or disapprove of a taxing ordinance of any tribe."
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2195.16,2207.135,--The Secretary's position appears to be that as part of its duties with respect to the Indian tribes it is willing to review tribal ordinances in the event that that is the tribe's wish.
1984.84-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2215.406,2244.926,"Well, then, what do you make out of the statement in Merrion that the Secretary's, at least in connection with that tribe, the Jicarillas... it sounded from reading that opinion as though the Secretary had legal authority to turn down a taxing ordinance with respect to the Jicarillas."
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2244.926,2248.295,"Well, because there was a provision in the Jicarilla constitution--"
1984.84-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2248.295,2249.813,Why would that give the Secretary authority?
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2249.813,2261.454,"--The tribe in that case, by adopting that constitution, was voluntarily conditioning its own powers on Secretarial approval."
1984.84-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2261.454,2271.41,"I know, but how could the Secretary... why would the Secretary purport to approve or disapprove in the absence of some statute?"
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2271.41,2278.499,I suppose it could be questioned whether the Secretary ought to be doing so even in those cases.
1984.84-68,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2286.753,2289.939,What standard does the Secretary use in that situation?
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2289.939,2306.733,"--Well, the Secretary has recently issued guidelines which state what standards the Secretary will use, and the standard is essentially one of seeing whether or not the tribal law violates any other law, the tribal law... the tax law in question--"
1984.84-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2306.733,2313.254,"Well, if the Secretary is purporting then to exercise its authority, I just again wonder where he think he gets it."
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2325.73,2329.765,--But the Secretary's authority is a very different question.
1984.84-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2347.227,2354.964,Do you think Congress has authorized the Secretary to approve or disapprove any Indian taxing ordinance?
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2354.964,2370.092,"--I think that the question obviously doesn't arise, at least as between a tribe and the Secretary, if the tribe is willingly saying--"
1984.84-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2370.092,2373.21,"It has now arisen, the question has."
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2373.21,2387.035,"--In other words, even if a tribe has constitution which requires Secretarial approval, I think that given--"
1984.84-68,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2387.035,2391.672,"Well, is there some authority--"
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2391.672,2393.322,--I don't mean the question doesn't arise.
1984.84-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2399.695,2404.647,"--Well, the question arises whether the Secretary has Congressional authority to perform that function."
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2407.682,2415.601,We are not questioning the Secretary's authority to act--
1984.84-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2415.601,2423.191,"I know you aren't, but where is the Congressional authority that you say is necessary for the Secretary to perform that function?"
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2423.191,2434.499,--I have not said that express Congressional statement is necessary in order to empower the Secretary to act in those situations.
1984.84-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2474.457,2479.444,"I take it your bottom line, then, would be that if the Secretary turns it down, the tribe may put it into effect anyway."
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2479.444,2483.413,I would--
1984.84-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2483.413,2485.115,Insofar as federal law is concerned.
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2485.115,2504.493,--I would question the authority of the Secretary in the absence of a Congressional delegation to veto a tribal ordinance where Congress had not said that tribal exercise of that kind of power was conditioned on Secretarial approval or disapproval.
1984.84-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.493,2513.182,"So the provisions in these constitutions is just, we want to submit the ordinance and approve it if you want to but you are not authorized to disapproved it."
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2513.182,2515.217,"No, that is not the provision in the constitution."
1984.84-68,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2534.698,2538.916,"This is a delegated power from the tribe to the Secretary, isn't it?"
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2542.451,2547.772,"No, they do not have to do so, and they do not have to do so under the Indian Reorganization Act."
1984.84-68,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2547.772,2556.378,"Then it is a delegated power in effect like appointing an agent, is it not, appointing the Secretary as agent for the tribe for certain purposes."
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2557.744,2565.967,"I think that the Secretary is still functioning as an agent of the United States, that Congress has delegated to the Secretary the power to--"
1984.84-68,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2565.967,2574.923,"Well, have they delegated... has Congress delegated any power with respect to this particular transfer of authority from the tribe to the Secretary?"
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2574.923,2590.951,"--Congress has not... has never expressly stated that, so far as I know, that the Secretary is to act on tribal taxing ordinances in any particular situation."
1984.84-68,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2628.207,2631.259,Can the tribe withdraw that delegated authority any time it wants to?
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2631.259,2639.115,"--Well, it depends on how the tribe has stated that authority."
1984.84-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2674.355,2684.227,"Ms. Bernstein, are these leases, tribal leases to Kerr-McGee or other private... are they subject to approval by the Secretary?"
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2684.227,2710.028,"The leases are subject to approval by the Secretary, and I want to specifically address the argument that has been made by Kerr-McGee that when Congress says to the Secretary, you should approve tribal leases of land, and of course... excuse me, that when it says that, that it means that the Secretary must approve or disapprove anything that the tribe does that bears on those lessees."
1984.84-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2750.855,2767.983,"Normally in administering these mineral leases or oil and gas leases, if Kerr-McGee or the lessee refused to live up to one of the terms of the lease, what happens?"
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2773.452,2787.128,"The Secretary's regulations specifically provide the Secretary is to be involved in termination of leases, but the Secretary's role under these kinds of leasing statutes is limited and directed to proprietary matters."
1984.84-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2789.663,2803.406,"I suppose if this tribal ordinance is as valid as you suggest it is, and Kerr-McGee refused to pay it, to pay the tax, I supposed the tribe would think it should be able to cancel the lease."
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2803.406,2809.394,--There is no cancellation of lease provision asserted in the tax laws.
1984.84-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2815.298,2818.666,And none of which would require the Secretary's approval.
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2818.666,2820.25,"I am not sure of that, Your Honor."
1984.84-68,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2879.888,2887.208,Your opponent contends that they have no real way of challenging those things because of the Santa Clara case.
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2887.208,2920.013,"Well, of course, they are, first of all, ignoring tribal forums entirely, which was exactly the remedy that was suggested in the Santa Clara case, and I think it is significant that it is in the Indian Civil Rights Act, not in the Mineral Leasing Act or in any other law by which the Secretary is supposed to protect tribal property, it is in the Indian Civil Rights Act that Congress has specifically directed itself to what protection should persons, non-Indians or Indian, within tribal jurisdiction have from the Indian tribes."
1984.84-68,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2929.904,2934.106,"So you say that your opponent is right, that they don't have any way of challenging."
1984.84-68,1,22019,elizabeth_bernstein,,2934.106,2936.058,"No, they have tribal forums to go to."
1984.84-68,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2986.472,2993.809,Mr. Claiborne.
1984.84-68,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2993.809,3047.11,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, petitioners have, in my view and perhaps in the Court's view, never really explained what their argument is, whether it is that the power of Indian tribes to tax which survived dependent status was conditioned, hobbled, limited for the first time in 1934 or 1938, depending upon whether they are relying on the Indian Reorganization Act or the Indian Mineral Leasing Act, or whether their argument is that long before that and independent of those Acts of Congress the power of Indian tribes to tax non-Indians doing business on a reservation was always subject to Secretarial or federal approval."
1984.84-68,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3170.174,3182.399,"Mr. Claiborne, in your view, what is the source of the Secretary's authority to approve any tribal tax?"
1984.84-68,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3182.399,3221.69,"Justice O'Connor, in the particular case of provisions in IRA constitutions, it seems to me that the source is the IRA itself insofar as Congress said the constitution adopted pursuant to this Act shall be valid only when approved by the Secretary, and impliedly Congress presumably permitted the Secretary or the tribe or the two together to include within such constitutions further approval requirements with respect to certain kinds of legislation."
1984.84-68,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3221.69,3238.069,Is it presently the Secretary's view that tribes with a written constitution under the IRA can amend their constitution and the Secretary will approve it if the amendment is to withdraw Secretarial approval to impose taxes?
1984.84-68,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3238.069,3273.309,"Exactly so, Justice O'Connor, and as counsel for petitioners correctly stated, our brief recites that it has been the policy of the Department of Interior for some years now not merely to approve amendments to constitutions to remove what as a matter of federal law are unnecessary Secretarial review provisions, but to encourage amendment of tribal constitutions to that end, and a substantial number of tribal constitutions have recently been amended with that in mind."
1984.84-68,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3376.708,3392.485,"Does the Secretary think there are any other overriding provisions of federal law, constitutional or otherwise, that might impact on the exercise by the tribe of its taxing powers?"
1984.84-68,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3392.485,3394.67,Justice O'Connor--
1984.84-68,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3394.67,3397.122,The commerce clause or anything else?
1984.84-68,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3397.122,3412.397,--This Court in the Merrion case was somewhat undecided as to whether the commerce clause in a full-fledged way limited the exercise of taxing power by Indian tribes.
