1960.96,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,6.233,"-- Kossick, Petitioner versus United Fruit Company."
1960.96,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,8.525,12.514,"Mr. Chief Justice, Justices of the Supreme Court."
1960.96,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,167.039,171.501,I have to pursue the petition -- what happened below?
1960.96,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,171.501,177.975,"The plaintiff, the petitioner here was a chief steward working for the United Fruit Line."
1960.96,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,304.146,305.589,And by New York law.
1960.96,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,305.589,309.789,Yes and we take the position that this is a contract.
1960.96,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,353.264,362.622,"Mr. Rassner, is there any claim at all that the petitioner's original condition was the result of any breach of duty on -- on the part of --"
1960.96,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,362.622,364.496,"No, Justice Stewart, there is not."
1960.96,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,364.496,366.18,Just the illness and the --
1960.96,0,32702,jacob_rassner,,366.18,367.559,That is true.
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1100.689,1103.826,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1960.96,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1214.371,1218.965,Would you mind stating it again why there is no question of cure?
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1220.119,1221.503,"Yes, sir, yes, sir."
1960.96,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1235.02,1238.661,"But as I understand, that is a challenge isn't it Mr. Underwood?"
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1238.661,1239.826,I can't quite tell.
1960.96,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1252.265,1265.409,"What do you say on the merits whether making appropriate provision for his entering -- entering into then marine hospital, does that take care of the obligation to furnish cure?"
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1265.409,1266.941,I -- I say that it does.
1960.96,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1277.052,1279.701,But are we concerned with that question here?
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1286.375,1287.552,"That is correct, sir."
1960.96,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1287.891,1288.821,You're at the end of it?
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1288.821,1289.321,"Yes, sir."
1960.96,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1314.909,1319.753,"(Inaudible) whether it's a Maritime contracts or not, (Inaudible)?"
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1319.753,1322.542,"Possibly so, that's one view."
1960.96,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1343.235,1356.553,"(Inaudible) as I understood you, a minute ago in answering Mr. Whittaker, you said the discontinuance of the second account was a discontinuance of claims for maintenance and cure."
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1357.179,1357.417,"Yes, sir."
1960.96,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1358.514,1367.61,"But as I understand the -- Judge Magruder's opinion, he said you can't -- didn't deal with maintenance and cure but just deal maintenance."
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1380.428,1385.373,"That is -- that is the cure point, Judge Hawkes' opinion in Barker said that that complies with the shipowner's duty--"
1960.96,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1385.373,1388.857,Which was cited in -- which was cited in (Inaudible) wasn't it?
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1388.857,1389.839,"Yes, it was sir."
1960.96,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1389.839,1400.987,"So the cure point is definitely by Judge Hawkes in Barker and the maintenance point insofar as it is dealt with, it dealt with by the discontinuance without the prejudice of the second count."
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1400.987,1407.261,My recollection is sir that the second cause of action included maintenance and cure and that that has been discontinued.
1960.96,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1408.934,1410.349,That is what Justice Magruder said.
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1410.349,1411.017,But it all -- yes sir.
1960.96,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1411.017,1443.922,(Inaudible) does say that on record 22 in the last paragraph in his opinion where he says as to the obligation for his maintenance to the (Inaudible) point second count (Inaudible) defendant failed and the (Inaudible) maintenance and cure was in the order of (Inaudible) the second cause of action to discontinue without prejudice and without (Inaudible)
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1443.922,1457.005,"If the Court please, on page six of the record, in the middle of the page where the second cause of action paragraph 22nd, alleges that it was the duty of the defendant to provide the plaintiff for the expenses in his maintenance and cure."
1960.96,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1470.077,1474.386,What I'm suggesting is that Judge Magruder took it distributively or not conjunctively.
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1474.386,1476.844,"Well, that -- that just may be sir."
1960.96,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1493.059,1496.988,What has happened to Erickson since it was decided?
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1505.219,1510.066,It's very rarely been cited if the Court please and I have no quarrel with Erickson.
1960.96,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1533.015,1537.227,That's really the -- that was an agreement for employment as a --
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1537.227,1542.174,-- as the master of a ship and you could hardly get anything more maritime than that.
1960.96,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1542.174,1545.617,The local variation certainly would not be tolerated as to that.
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1545.617,1555.328,I should think that would be true although the application -- the -- this Court's refusal to apply the statute to that case has been criticized by some of the text writers.
1960.96,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1555.328,1556.808,Anyhow that's not this?
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1556.808,1558.942,"No, sir, no sir."
1960.96,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1581.973,1589.746,Is there any maritime law regarding the subject matter of what the Statute of Frauds deals with?
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1589.746,1601.025,"No, sir except -- none that I'm aware of except the statutes that required that seaman's articles being writing, I know of no other."
1960.96,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1787.031,1796.951,"In other words, if there any ill consequences of discharging his duty by way of a public health hospital be left to the local law authority, is that it?"
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1796.951,1798.711,"Yes, sir."
1960.96,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1799.134,1810.173,"What you're saying here, what you were arguing here is that this agreement is really an agreement to deal with those consequences which without agreements would be left to the local law."
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1810.173,1812.341,Yes and there would be no consequences.
1960.96,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1812.341,1821.492,"But I mean if there is incompetence on the part of surgeon, (Inaudible)"
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1821.492,1824.997,This man had a perfectly complete and adequate remedy.
1960.96,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1866.472,1875.829,"Well, not quite that, there is a allegation here that you promised that you all -- that you promised to do that, that you promised to stand over the physician and make good any harm (Inaudible) commitment?"
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1875.829,1876.366,Oh yes.
1960.96,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1918.772,1921.854,"Mr. Underwood, is the making of this (Inaudible), is that it?"
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1921.854,1923.737,"Oh no sir, no, sir."
1960.96,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1925.187,1927.76,"-- As to this case I suppose it is, isn't it because it's --"
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1927.76,1930.668,"Oh, by virtue of the pleadings for the purposes of this argument, yes."
1960.96,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1930.668,1932.516,Alleged in the complaint and the â€“
1960.96,1,23325,eugene_underwood,,1932.516,1946.119,"yes the purposes of this argument, it is admitted but as Judge Bick said in his opinion, we all think there is a strategem to get around the tort three-year statute."
1960.96,2,32702,jacob_rassner,,1946.753,1950.889,I wonder if might my answer to Justice Frankfurter's questions?
1960.96,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1950.889,1951.296,Yes.
1960.96,2,32702,jacob_rassner,,1951.296,1961.121,"Mr. Justice Frankfurter, you asked us to the Union Fish company case Erickson, Judge Ryebell referred to that case."
