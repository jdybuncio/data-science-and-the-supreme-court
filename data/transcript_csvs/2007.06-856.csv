2007.06-856,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.67,"We'll hear argument this morning in case 06-856, LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg & Associates."
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,10.689,18.878,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me begin with the first question on which this Court has granted certiorari."
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,30.769,32.554,What are the code numbers of those?
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,44.16,49.814,"I never thought the day would come, Justice Scalia, when I was described as working with ERISA all of the time, but I will tell you the code provision."
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,74.798,75.664,Thank you.
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,75.664,86.189,"Now, the statute plainly states that ""any losses to the plan"" may be recovered if they were caused by fiduciary breach."
2007.06-856,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,104.667,108.535,"But the plan itself is nowhere in the record, is that right?"
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,108.535,111.653,"Well, the summary plan description was attached to the complaint."
2007.06-856,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,111.653,112.486,"Right, the summary."
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,126.663,129.365,"Respectfully, Mr. Chief Justice, that's not true."
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,147.326,148.292,But that wasn't in the record.
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,148.292,149.526,It is in the record.
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,149.526,150.111,It is in the record.
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,150.111,150.744,Yes.
2007.06-856,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,152.578,153.996,Where in the record is it?
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,153.996,157.615,--It is page 19a of the--
2007.06-856,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,157.615,162.169,"No, that's in the opposition to certiorari, and I don't believe that's in the record."
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,162.169,167.371,--It is in the record; it was attached to the complaint that was filed by Mr. LaRue in this case.
2007.06-856,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,167.371,168.906,"Oh, that's the summary of the plan."
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,168.906,170.489,"The summary plan description, that's correct."
2007.06-856,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,179.928,193.854,"The summary on the page you mentioned says that you will be able to... you have certain investment choices are available to you, and that the administrator will provide you with information on what they are and how you can change it."
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,193.854,194.671,That is correct.
2007.06-856,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,194.671,196.389,"But we don't know those details, correct?"
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,196.389,199.008,"That's true, but this case was decided at the pleading stage."
2007.06-856,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,209.381,213.916,"It would also presumably more obviously constitute a breach of the plan, correct?"
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,213.916,217.118,"Yes, that's correct; and that is a fiduciary breach."
2007.06-856,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,225.105,232.793,"Your position is anything that is remediable, if that's a word, under (a)(1) can also be pursued under (a)(2)?"
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,232.793,234.443,"No, that is not my position."
2007.06-856,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,235.912,236.695,Let me step back.
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,240.483,246.97,"--I think that's far from clear, but what is clear is that we could not recover what we wanted under (a)(1)."
2007.06-856,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,254.707,257.909,Where does it say that (a)(1) is available only against the plan?
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,257.909,261.378,The specific language of (a)(1) doesn't state that.
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,282.809,288.713,"That's fine, so why doesn't he proceed first under (a)(1)(B), against the plan?"
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,288.713,289.48,Well--
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,289.48,292.665,Because the plan owes him this money.
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,302.938,307.342,--I think the answer to that... I think there are two reasons why that's incorrect.
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,316.797,319.649,I'm talking about (a)(1)(B).
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,319.649,320.349,--Right.
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,337.628,359.893,"Well, there is... there is this to suggest that only... only that manner of proceeding preserves the structure of... of the legislation which is that you're supposed to first apply to the plan and exhaust your remedies there before you come into court; and interpreting it that way would preserve that... that exhaustion requirement."
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,366.63,374.653,"Well, what I would say to that, Justice Scalia, and is that this administrative exhaustion requirement that you're referring to is a judicial gloss on the statute."
2007.06-856,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,387.627,399.332,"Your approach, if can you go under (a)(2)... you're right that we judicially have developed a number of glosses on (a)(1), including I think most importantly the Firestone deference principle."
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,409.04,416.86,--I would not agree with that characterization because there are very few cases where the specific conditions for (a)(2) are met.
2007.06-856,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,428.954,433.906,You told me earlier that any breach of the plan was a fiduciary duty.
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,433.906,434.589,That's correct.
2007.06-856,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,434.589,439.559,Now you're... the... what is it... the obverse or the converse of that you're saying is not true.
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,439.559,440.761,"No, that's not true."
2007.06-856,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,459.306,466.143,Could I ask you whether the (a)(2) argument would be available to you on remand even if we agree with your interpretation of that provision?
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,477.518,480.469,--I don't read the Fourth Circuit's decision that way.
2007.06-856,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,501.28,507.1,"Well, maybe... maybe they've waived the waiver, but Judge Wilkinson is a careful writer, and if you use the subjunctive there..."
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,512.754,517.289,"--Not in my opinion, but that's an issue that the Fourth Circuit and the lower courts will need to resolve."
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,530.133,540.239,Let me come back to your earlier point that the second requirement of (a)(2)... it's actually a requirement of 1109--
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,540.239,540.889,That's correct.
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,541.572,543.523,--is not met.
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,563.954,564.471,Yes.
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,566.554,568.506,And that would be a loss to the plan.
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,568.506,568.756,No.
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,573.958,574.41,Right.
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,574.41,579.778,--there are no assets that you have an entitlement to as a beneficiary.
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,579.778,584.099,I have an entitlement to certain... certain welfare payments.
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,584.099,588.134,That's... you have entitlement to a contractually provided benefit.
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,597.572,598.055,Right.
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,598.055,598.221,"--Or,"
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,599.305,599.821,Right.
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,599.821,604.356,--that breach doesn't cause any diminution in value in plan assets.
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,604.356,619.133,"It does if you sue the plan and require the plan to pay what the plan has committed to pay, whereupon the plan would have a right of action against the fiduciary, I assume, for the fiduciary's failure to do what he was supposed to."
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,619.133,623.686,"Well, that may be true, but with respect, I think that that is... that's the tail wagging the dog."
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,630.854,636.558,"Well, but that would preserve the necessity of going through the exhaustion requirement first."
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,649.299,654.186,"--Let me take a step back because I think we are 100 percent in agreement, but I want to be clear what our position is."
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,694.763,698.048,"Well, it isn't just if the money is payable to him today."
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,705.821,706.487,--That is correct.
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,706.487,716.843,"And if there's no money in his account, it seems to me he could bring an action to clarify that even if there is no money in his account the plan owes him future benefits in that amount."
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,716.843,719.628,"And then one of two things at that point would happen, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,728.066,728.566,Right.
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,728.566,735.487,"--which is perfectly legitimate, but my response to that is there is no language in the statute to suggest that that is required."
2007.06-856,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,747.028,752.516,I... I'm not sure about your characterization that he would pick the pockets of the other plan participants.
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,760.705,768.209,"Well, a defined contribution plan is nothing more than a collection of assets that have been allocated to a group of participants."
2007.06-856,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,785.087,786.772,"Well, it may or may not have the money."
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,801.532,807.15,"--Well, I think under the example that you just gave, Mr. Chief Justice, there would not be a loss to the plan."
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,833.865,836.983,But the plan wouldn't necessarily pay out any money.
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,850.541,852.16,"Well, I would say two things about that."
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,903.008,906.626,What would happen if the trustee does not have the money?
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,921.618,922.868,I think that that--
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,922.868,927.288,"By picking, as you put it, by picking the pockets of the other plan participants?"
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,927.288,931.074,"--I think in an individual account plan, that presents a very difficult question."
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,931.074,932.259,What's the answer to it?
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,932.259,934.876,I think probably he would not be able to recover that money.
2007.06-856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,949.351,950.318,They participated in the plan.
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,957.891,959.743,I don't think there's any evidence for that.
2007.06-856,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1033.255,1035.957,"If we agree to you on (a)(2), is there any need to get to (a)(3)?"
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,1035.957,1040.759,"Certainly if you agree with us on (a)(2), the court of appeals can be reversed on that issue."
2007.06-856,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1083.371,1084.055,What would that be?
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,1084.055,1094.912,"Well, our theory of surcharge, and it's also the government's theory, is that surcharge is a make-whole remedy for pecuniary losses that are caused by a breach of trust."
2007.06-856,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1129.384,1135.37,I thought your own argument was that (a)(3) is the catchall.
2007.06-856,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,1172.161,1176.296,"Well, the Court certainly may choose not to reach the (a)(3) issue, so I can't speak to that."
2007.06-856,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1214.904,1216.44,"Thank you, Mr. Stris."
2007.06-856,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1227.462,1240.186,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: ERISA authorizes a participant in a defined contribution plan to sue to recover losses to the plan caused by a fiduciary breach even if the losses are attributable to the participant's individual plan account."
2007.06-856,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1240.186,1242.722,"But that means every participant, right?"
2007.06-856,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1250.375,1261.433,It's... that's theoretically possible because the loss to the... loss to this individual account is a loss to the plan.
2007.06-856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1284.196,1299.974,"Wouldn't the theory be that if ultimately the other accounts could be robbed to sort of make up for at least part of the loss of this one, that for a loss to any account is a threat to all the others?"
2007.06-856,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1299.974,1307.044,"--Well, we agree that a loss to any account is a threat to the plan as a whole, but I think for a different reason."
2007.06-856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1333.278,1340.099,"Mr. Roberts, Section (a), (a)(1)(B)--"
2007.06-856,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1340.099,1340.732,--Yes.
2007.06-856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1340.732,1349.955,"--Unlike Section (a)(2), which refers you to 1109, does not say who gets sued."
2007.06-856,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1369.0,1369.883,"Yes, but--"
2007.06-856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1369.883,1374.07,I think the implication there is that the suit... the suit is against the plan.
2007.06-856,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1374.07,1380.473,--The implication is that the suit is against the plan or against a fiduciary in... under (a)(1)(B).
2007.06-856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1386.127,1386.994,Where?
2007.06-856,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1386.994,1403.506,"If you can't sue the fiduciary under (a)(1)(B), that just reinforces the point even... even more, Your Honor, that Petitioner's cause of action here arises under (a)(2) because he is seeking relief for the plan not relief from the plan."
2007.06-856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1403.506,1404.356,It may well.
2007.06-856,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1412.029,1418.432,"Under (a)(1)(B), most courts require that the suit be brought against the plan."
2007.06-856,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1432.09,1439.346,How do we know that this is a breach of fiduciary duty under (a)(2) without having the plan before us?
2007.06-856,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1462.877,1471.281,"And if it's not a breach of fiduciary duties, Petitioner will lose on the merits or on remand in their motion for summary judgment based on facts that could be decided."
2007.06-856,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1471.281,1477.637,But I thought his argument... his argument reduces to the fact that it's a breach of fiduciary duty because it's a breach of the plan.
2007.06-856,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1480.07,1492.396,"It's a breach of fiduciary duty both of a failure to follow the terms of the plan and a breach of the duty of prudence, because when a plan provides that participants can direct their investments--"
2007.06-856,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1492.396,1495.894,--So we need to know... we need to know what the plan provides before we can decide.
2007.06-856,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1495.894,1500.966,"--The case was dismissed on the pleadings, Your Honor, and it alleges that there was a breach of fiduciary duty."
2007.06-856,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1509.839,1511.858,The pleadings don't include the plan.
2007.06-856,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1515.893,1522.999,"--Yes, but the inferences shouldn't be construed against the plaintiff in motion to dismiss on the pleadings, Your Honor."
2007.06-856,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1538.758,1541.127,But we don't know under what terms.
2007.06-856,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1546.614,1548.483,"That's certainly true, Your Honor."

2007.06-856,2,42755,thomas_p_gies,,1988.916,1996.437,"Well, because neither (a)(2) or (a)(1)(B) were invoked in the district court and the case comes up on a very spares record, it's hard to--"

2007.06-856,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2260.692,2266.06,And they're saying they are careful and interrelated provisions mean that you got to go under subsection (2).

2007.06-856,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3162.152,3164.087,"Even if it was 90 percent, you'd give the same answer?"
2007.06-856,2,42755,thomas_p_gies,,3164.087,3175.479,I could imagine a situation where the percentage gets so high that the assets might be held in such a way that they could be more easily seen to be a loss to the plan as a whole.
2007.06-856,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3178.145,3183.233,"So just one individual, as far as we know it's a very small percentage of the total."
2007.06-856,2,42755,thomas_p_gies,,3186.835,3188.47,"--That... that's correct, Justice Stevens."
2007.06-856,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3202.296,3219.306,"You know I could understand your case if you said even if there were a hundred diamonds, each of them in an individual plan, there still is no loss to the plan until the plan itself has been held liable to make up for the loss."
2007.06-856,2,42755,thomas_p_gies,,3241.338,3242.388,"Well, we certainly--"
2007.06-856,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3242.388,3244.373,Prior to that it's just a loss to the individual account.
2007.06-856,2,42755,thomas_p_gies,,3260.181,3263.868,"--I'm fortunate to have that not as my job, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-856,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3277.426,3288.365,"I know, because in making this, hitching your wagon to the (a)(1)(B)... I thought you were arguing... what did you say the remedy for this person would be?"
2007.06-856,2,42755,thomas_p_gies,,3296.97,3297.62,Right.
2007.06-856,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3297.62,3299.089,What is his remedy?
2007.06-856,2,42755,thomas_p_gies,,3299.089,3307.861,That's a very difficult question to answer because this is a defined contribution plan and not a defined benefit plan and this is a claim for lost profits.
2007.06-856,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3321.353,3322.121,Is that what you argue in your brief?
2007.06-856,2,42755,thomas_p_gies,,3322.121,3323.855,"We did not, but our amici did."
2007.06-856,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3323.855,3326.407,"So what did you argue is his remedy, in your brief?"
2007.06-856,2,42755,thomas_p_gies,,3326.407,3333.061,What we argue in our brief and what we still say is that he could have pursued equitable relief under (a)(3).
2007.06-856,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3333.061,3334.744,What would that be?
2007.06-856,2,42755,thomas_p_gies,,3334.744,3344.683,"He could have picked up the telephone and called and said, like I think most of us would, say I asked you to sell my sells of stock and it hasn't happened yet."
2007.06-856,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3345.119,3346.519,He didn't know until he got the report.
2007.06-856,2,42755,thomas_p_gies,,3346.519,3359.628,"--Well, that's not so clear from the record, Justice Ginsburg, but in any case what equitable relief under (a)(3), just as (a)(1)(B) would permit him, is to get an injunction to force the trade to be executed."
2007.06-856,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3359.628,3360.944,But it's much too late.
2007.06-856,2,42755,thomas_p_gies,,3364.096,3377.987,"It may or may not be much too late, Justice Ginsburg, which we think is another reason why as to (a)(2), we think it's unlikely that Congress intended every one of these he said/she said cases to give rise to a cause of action for damages."
2007.06-856,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3382.039,3395.363,"Let's take, because this case was tossed out on the pleadings, the... there are forms to fill out and says I want this set of investments as opposed to that set of investments."
2007.06-856,2,42755,thomas_p_gies,,3415.676,3418.962,"Well, certainly injunctive relief under (a)(3) would have been available."
2007.06-856,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3418.962,3420.664,Enjoining him to be careless?
2007.06-856,2,42755,thomas_p_gies,,3420.664,3425.716,Enjoining him to execute the trade was clearly a remedy available.
2007.06-856,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3427.568,3438.792,"If you say I want these funds invested in this particular set of shares for this period, for this six-month period, then two years later you can have that trade made?"
2007.06-856,2,42755,thomas_p_gies,,3439.809,3445.795,"--Well, we think the fact that it took him so long to sue is another reflection of the fact that this is a claim for damages."
2007.06-856,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3458.02,3459.753,What's done meanwhile?
2007.06-856,2,42755,thomas_p_gies,,3465.99,3467.723,And we think the Congress--
2007.06-856,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3467.723,3468.473,--no remedy?
2007.06-856,2,42755,thomas_p_gies,,3468.473,3475.127,--We think that Congress did not want those kinds of claims to be brought under (a)(2) precisely for that kind of reason.
2007.06-856,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3503.444,3505.162,You view it as a lost profits claim.
2007.06-856,2,42755,thomas_p_gies,,3517.035,3526.374,We think we have a different situation indeed if there actually had been a distribution here and the amount of the account had gone down between the alleged mistake and the distribution.
2007.06-856,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3573.868,3576.22,And never available in a court of law.
2007.06-856,2,42755,thomas_p_gies,,3576.22,3578.087,--And never available in a court of law.
2007.06-856,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3578.922,3579.739,"Well, then what is it?"
2007.06-856,2,42755,thomas_p_gies,,3580.856,3588.362,"Well, I think what it was, as I understand the history of the equity jurisprudence, is that you could only sue the trustee in the equity courts."
2007.06-856,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3594.766,3596.232,This isn't like a cleanup.
2007.06-856,2,42755,thomas_p_gies,,3596.232,3597.718,"It is not, Your Honor."
2007.06-856,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3654.526,3654.854,"Thank you, Mr. Gies."
