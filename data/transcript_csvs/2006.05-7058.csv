2006.05-7058,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.013,"We'll hear argument next in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton."
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,6.998,9.95,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-7058,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,81.187,91.277,"Suppose the district court finds that in its experience, 80 percent of the claims are ones that are unexhausted, just assume that."
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,109.768,114.173,"--I think that would be correct, and that would be consistent with the Court's habeas jurisprudence."
2006.05-7058,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,114.173,121.936,The court could ask for a pleading which set forth the facts of exhaustion?
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,121.936,123.982,I believe that's true.
2006.05-7058,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,123.982,135.852,"Then why isn't this... this is just the same if the court has said, you know, in order to make our screening function efficient, we just have to know about exhaustion."
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,135.852,143.24,"Well, first of all, when Congress created the various screening provisions in the PLRA, it noticeably omitted exhaustion."
2006.05-7058,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,149.877,157.0,"How about, what, if you concede the district court could do it in individual cases or in most cases, why can't the Sixth Circuit do it?"
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,157.937,172.495,"--Well, what sets the Sixth Circuit's rule apart from I think the hypothetical you propose, and also from this Court's habeas jurisprudence is that in both of those scenarios the plaintiff, the prisoner, is given a chance to respond."
2006.05-7058,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,197.671,210.213,The briefs point out that a number of district courts have form complaints that are often used in these cases and that these forms call on the prisoner-plaintiff to address the issue of exhaustion.
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,224.457,245.621,"With respect to the form, I don't think that the form is improper, but I think it would be improper for a court to dismiss the prisoner's case if the prisoner failed to fill out the section of the form that asks him about exhaustion because exhaustion is an affirmative defense in both administrative law and habeas, and there's no indication in this statute that Congress--"
2006.05-7058,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,245.621,256.099,"If it's an affirmative defense, then why is it... why is it proper for a district court, for a district court, to have a form that calls on the plaintiff to negate the affirmative defense?"
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,256.099,261.457,--I think the district court can ask the plaintiff pretty much whatever the district court likes.
2006.05-7058,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,267.767,271.812,"Well, we know under the statue they can dismiss a case because it's frivolous, right?"
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,271.812,272.375,Absolutely.
2006.05-7058,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,272.375,282.652,"Regardless of the substance of the claim on the merits, if you know that you've just ignored the exhaustion requirement isn't that a frivolous claim?"
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,282.652,292.102,We would certainly concede that if it is clear on the face of the complaint that a prisoner has not exhausted his or her administrative remedies then that claim can be dismissed.
2006.05-7058,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,310.906,318.434,Probably the reason they do this is that there are lots and lots of claims by prisoners in Federal courts that are hard to decipher.
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,355.029,359.887,--The problem is that it conflicts with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 8.
2006.05-7058,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,369.336,374.912,So your point would be that they can do this if we amend the Federal Rules.
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,376.959,378.222,I think that's correct.
2006.05-7058,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,379.971,384.688,"If we amended the rules that way, in effect it would no longer be an affirmative defense."
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,397.278,398.058,--Right.
2006.05-7058,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,403.946,415.692,But Rule 8 and the normal rules weren't addressed to the unusual situation under the PLRA where the district court has an affirmative obligation screen on its own before the defendant even gets involved.
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,429.39,441.072,"It may be a reasonable means, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's permissible, because Congress had exhaustion in mind when it enacted the PLRA and noticeably absent from all the PLRA screening provisions is the term ""exhaustion""."
2006.05-7058,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,441.072,449.46,"Well, but you just told me earlier that if it was a case in which exhaustion is required and not done that would be a frivolous claim, and the statute does refer to frivolous claims."
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,466.999,468.513,"Right, I think I understand."
2006.05-7058,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,517.01,532.301,"Well, what about 1997(e) and (g), which prohibits, seems to prohibit a case from getting beyond the complaint, not even to the answer unless the district court finds that the plaintiff has a reasonable opportunity to prevail on the merits."
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,537.065,539.938,"I don't think so, Justice Alito."
2006.05-7058,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,578.517,582.234,Would your answer be different if amendment were allowed?
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,600.118,605.038,"I think if the circuit were to, Sixth Circuit were to allow amendment it would certainly mitigate the situation."
2006.05-7058,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,630.668,646.521,"Mr. Andre, didn't you have in one of that's cases that the exhaustion was spelled out by the defendant, there was a complaint that alleged exhaustion, generally but not in all detail."
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,693.752,694.174,Yes.
2006.05-7058,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,708.342,717.539,You talk about the lack of statutory direction on the first two points but there is a very explicit statute on the third question.
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,727.16,736.282,"Well, I... we concede that an action that contains unexhausted claims or a mixed action shouldn't have been brought in the first place, but it's there."
2006.05-7058,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,753.213,755.369,This is a very different statutory scheme.
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,775.566,785.124,--I guess I should be clear at the outset that we are by no means advocating that a prisoner can shoe horn in unexhausted claims with exhausted claims.
2006.05-7058,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,787.044,792.62,"Well right, but you provide under your approach no incentive for the prisoner to leave those claims out."
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,802.631,812.737,"Well, it's been our experience and from reading the case law it appears that prisoners don't intentionally try to shoe horn in unexhausted claims with their exhausted claims."
2006.05-7058,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,851.269,853.751,Why does it hurt if you dismiss the whole thing?
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,854.814,859.311,"Well, it hurts for a couple of reasons."
2006.05-7058,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,867.73,867.964,No.
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,904.402,906.057,--It doesn't hurt if the--
2006.05-7058,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,906.057,906.854,Is that true?
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,907.76,912.759,"--Well, I guess there is two different versions of the total exhaustion rule as it's termed."
2006.05-7058,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,928.269,930.002,Why is that draconian?
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,930.002,938.202,It's draconian because by the time the prisoner refiles his or her action there could be a statute of limitations problem.
2006.05-7058,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,941.762,943.918,Does he have to file a new filing fee?
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,943.918,947.932,"--Not in the Sixth Circuit anymore, and not in the Fourth Circuit."
2006.05-7058,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,947.932,950.805,How many prisoners pay the filing fee in the first place?
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,950.805,952.68,I believe they all do.
2006.05-7058,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,954.226,955.773,They are not entitled to IFP status?
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,955.773,959.958,"--If they get IFP status, all that means... well, first of all, they only get to do that three times."
2006.05-7058,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,964.614,966.722,"Is that a draconian rule, do you think?"
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,969.814,971.266,"No, no, no."
2006.05-7058,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,987.932,993.758,"Well, I guess this is probably not a question for you, but a question for your friend on the other side."
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1007.502,1009.672,"--I think that's exactly right, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-7058,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1009.672,1017.155,"No, well, the reason it would hurt is because it's difficult for the judge to go though this complaint that he can't quite make sense out of."
2006.05-7058,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1034.521,1044.954,"And the other incentive is if you adopt your rule, the incentive on the prisoner is to put in every possible claim, even if it is not exhausted because maybe it will get through, maybe it won't."
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1049.454,1065.758,"But I think at least, at least under that scenario, the district court still only has to take one look at the case and then it can move forward, it deletes the unexhausted claims."
2006.05-7058,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1085.737,1097.857,"Is there any argument that if the state does not insist on exhaustion or plead exhaustion, that it just drops out of the case?"
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1104.385,1105.198,--I think there is.
2006.05-7058,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1126.032,1160.505,"If... if we accept your first two arguments, then if there is no heightened pleading rule and you don't have to name the specific defendants in the administrative grievance that you end up naming in the complaint, if you prevail on both of those, then isn't the third question, have you, what happens when you haven't properly exhausted, is really not alive anymore in this case, because you will have properly exhausted."
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1165.284,1169.36,"Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg, it's unfortunately more complicated than that."
2006.05-7058,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1197.162,1208.111,"But the Sixth Circuit obviously would have been wrong; if he has totally exhausted; they have, gave that as a no alternative grounds, but if they are wrong on the first one and he has exhausted."
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1209.25,1230.507,"--The Sixth Circuit... and it's not really clear from this opinion, because it's an unpublished opinion, but the Sixth Circuit appears to have adopted the magistrate judge's finding which is based on respondent's motion to dismiss that Jones substantively, for lack of a better word, didn't exhaust all of his claims, so... I'm sorry."
2006.05-7058,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1231.554,1241.956,"That was the case where the, where the defendant estate, wasn't that the case where they put in all the papers from the administrative record?"
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1241.956,1242.456,Yes.
2006.05-7058,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1251.232,1252.685,"Yes, but they were wrong about that."
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1274.225,1275.536,"--I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-7058,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1327.485,1334.277,"You would have no problem, I assume, if the state simply requires that you name the individuals?"
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1334.277,1338.947,I guess broadly speaking no; in certain cases yes.
2006.05-7058,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1338.947,1340.306,"To the extent possible, I suppose."
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1340.306,1341.056,Right.
2006.05-7058,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1343.617,1347.226,"Then, then there would not be exhaustion unless he had named the individuals."
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1347.226,1348.82,--I believe that's correct.
2006.05-7058,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1350.677,1354.708,"So we may not be, may not be litigating about a whole lot here."
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1354.708,1355.269,"--No, right."
2006.05-7058,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1411.434,1426.24,"And you have in one of these cases, the person has said: I didn't know who was the person who said I couldn't have the operation until the prison identified him."
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1426.24,1427.694,That's correct.
2006.05-7058,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1435.518,1435.737,Yes.
2006.05-7058,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1456.524,1457.119,--Right.
2006.05-7058,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1502.381,1503.397,"Thank you, Mr. Andre."
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,1505.395,1510.191,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2006.05-7058,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1576.165,1580.162,"May I ask you, what is a typical administrative record that is developed in these proceedings?"
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,1582.208,1584.614,--I've never seen a transcript.
2006.05-7058,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1612.712,1618.991,Is there normally a statement of reasons for the denial of relief or are they just denied in many cases?
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,1618.991,1622.849,--For the most part they attempt to address the issue.
2006.05-7058,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1622.849,1628.223,Are the opinions a page or two or just a sentence or two?
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,1629.894,1633.096,Typically they are--
2006.05-7058,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1633.096,1639.547,"I'm just wondering how, how much help that will give the judge later on in processing the case."
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,1639.547,1655.32,"--In the last 12 months there have been 13,000 grievances processed by the Michigan Department of Corrections at the third step, and that's for people who appeal all the way through to the third step."
2006.05-7058,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1665.285,1668.362,"How many of the 13,000 are of that variety?"
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,1668.362,1675.032,"--I haven't read all 13,000, but typically the response would be about a half a dozen lines."
2006.05-7058,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1675.032,1675.407,I see.
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,1680.591,1690.946,"Last... in the last year that ended June 30th, 12 months, we had approximately 200 cases."
2006.05-7058,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1690.946,1692.571,"200 out of 13,000?"
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,1692.571,1693.103,Correct.
2006.05-7058,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1707.176,1714.813,"Can you explain what the disincentive or other reasons for there being just 200 lawsuits out of the 13,000?"
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,1714.813,1717.186,These 200 are ones that we were served with.
2006.05-7058,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1723.044,1723.544,I see.
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,1723.544,1728.121,This only includes ones where a defendant was actually served with process.
2006.05-7058,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1728.121,1731.806,"Basically, I mean you've heard the question and so forth."
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,1760.436,1768.994,"When it's a dismissal without prejudice, it's improper to characterize it as draconian."
2006.05-7058,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1768.994,1771.869,"It could be, because the statute of limitations could have run."
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,1781.958,1798.342,"This Court in Neitzke versus Williams took a look at the previous version of the in forma pauperis statute and that statute allowed sua sponte dismissals for only two reasons, frivolous and malicious cases."
2006.05-7058,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1836.982,1841.043,But that doesn't include failure to exhaust.
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,1841.043,1844.729,It didn't specifically include failure to exhaust.
2006.05-7058,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1844.729,1859.958,"And if you follow the normal rule, that that's an affirmative defense, then, then the burden would be on the prison to do just what it did in the Jones case."
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,1909.656,1924.696,"Congress dealt with that in 1997e(g), the waiver of reply provision, which confirmed what the 1997e(c) dismissal provision provides."
2006.05-7058,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1941.706,1949.516,"If Congress meant to reverse the ordinary burden on pleading exhaustion, why didn't it put that in?"
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,1963.65,1968.101,"--Well, exhaustion is the very first provision and it's--"
2006.05-7058,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1968.101,1971.24,It's not in the screening.
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,1975.223,1981.971,"--It's not specifically there, but the exhaustion provision is a precursor."
2006.05-7058,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1988.624,1991.655,"But there are other provisions than ""no action shall be brought""."
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2007.304,2015.488,The courts have interpreted statutes of limitations consistently to be in the category of an affirmative defense.
2006.05-7058,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2042.227,2046.163,"Well, all the criteria are there, but failure to exhaust is not."
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2046.163,2051.864,"--Not specifically, but failure to exhaust could be construed as a--"
2006.05-7058,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2051.864,2056.784,But last time... and you said before the statute was there were only frivolous and malicious.
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2069.014,2082.773,"--Congress put the screening provision as number one, where you cannot even bring a case to court unless you have exhausted administrative remedies."
2006.05-7058,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2092.379,2110.607,"Miss Olivieri, you also rely on the ""no action shall be brought"" language to justify dismissal of the entire action, all claims, even though only some of them have not been exhausted."
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2136.298,2152.417,"Habeas corpus is another situation where there is a provision that says no relief shall be granted, no writ shall be granted, absent exhaustion of... exhaustion of state court remedies."
2006.05-7058,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2169.503,2170.191,Right.
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2170.191,2176.501,"--which was in the statute before Congress passed the PLRA, and Congress actually took out the stay in abeyance provision."
2006.05-7058,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2199.289,2210.736,What is the basis in the habeas context for dismissing the entire habeas application despite the fact that some of the claims have been exhausted?
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2217.016,2224.045,There is... I believe it's under the exhaustion requirement.
2006.05-7058,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2239.149,2241.648,And that's not... the statute doesn't settle that.
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2289.143,2295.375,I think because Congress did revoke the stay in abeyance provision in the PLRA.
2006.05-7058,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2295.375,2297.282,"But your answer was it shouldn't, I think."
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2299.155,2299.967,Pardon me?
2006.05-7058,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2299.967,2313.774,"I think she is saying that we should treat this area the same way we treat habeas, so that the whole case should be dismissed rather than just the individual claims, which is what I think you want; isn't it?"
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2313.774,2314.571,"Yes, that is my argument, yes."
2006.05-7058,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2314.571,2314.774,Okay.
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2315.54,2315.821,Okay.
2006.05-7058,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2316.181,2326.052,I was suggesting that in habeas it is the prisoner's option to say I don't want the whole case dismissed.
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2358.273,2384.012,"--I don't want the prisoner to be allowed to choose to lop off the unexhausted claims, that is true, or to amend, to delete them, because then there is absolutely no incentive for the prisoner to improve the quality of the litigation by stopping and thinking, being careful to exhaust all his claims, and being careful to plead only claims that are exhaustive."
2006.05-7058,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2384.012,2385.543,"The same arguments apply in habeas, don't they?"
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2385.543,2395.415,But in habeas you have the stay and abeyance provision that was specifically removed--
2006.05-7058,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2395.415,2396.398,Not if you had your way.
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2396.398,2397.586,--Remove... well--
2006.05-7058,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2397.586,2400.959,I think you're making an argument that it would preclude that too.
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2400.959,2402.036,--Right.
2006.05-7058,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2402.036,2415.797,"So it seems to me that if we accept your response to Justice Ginsburg, we've got to go back and to the extent that we can do anything about it, we'd better toughen up habeas so that these things get thrown out more readily."
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2415.797,2434.024,"Habeas does deal with a person's liberty whereas the PLRA is simply dealing with people basically for the most part trying to get some sort of relief, either injunctive or monetary relief, that does not deal with their basic freedom."
2006.05-7058,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2435.632,2447.643,"One reason to require total exhaustion is because, I would assume the prisoner may get sufficient relief if the claims are exhausted, that he doesn't feel the need to go forward with litigation."
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2462.34,2467.275,"--It could be... I mean, it's obviously both."
2006.05-7058,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2481.036,2485.034,And then sometimes it's impossible to complete the exhaustion.
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2489.985,2519.13,"That can also be the case, and under Woodford versus Ngo, now that they have to do proper exhaustion, there will be more of those cases where it probably, there wouldn't be anything left to do after it's dismissed except for the plaintiff to be the one to go through the maybe 20 claimed complaints and call out the claims that are not exhausted, rather than putting that burden on the court, which is contrary to Congress's purpose, to streamline this system."
2006.05-7058,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2519.13,2531.812,"May I ask you about, there's another question you haven't really touched on yet, the requirement that the prisoner name every defendant that he intends to sue in the exhausting, in the internal procedure."
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2567.532,2582.041,"Medical care is... well, for one thing, prisoners do have counselors, and so if they're not sure who is responsible for something, that's one of the things that they're supposed to do is talk to their counselor to find out."
2006.05-7058,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2592.6,2602.985,"And what if he does talk to the prison guard and the guard says I don't know, I don't know who's responsible for that decision, that's in the warden's office, or something like that."
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2604.032,2619.526,"If the prisoner makes inquiry and just simply can't find out who it is, then he should state that in his grievance and indicate that somebody in the medical department is denying me the surgery."
2006.05-7058,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2635.848,2636.645,What if he doesn't?
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2666.304,2669.429,He has to make a good faith attempt to find out.
2006.05-7058,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2679.455,2680.33,What is the purpose of that requirement?
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2696.433,2713.098,"That goes back to 1997e(g), the waiver of reply, where it says that no defendant can be made to respond to the complaint unless the court can certify that the prisoner has a reasonable opportunity to prevail on the merits."
2006.05-7058,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2717.081,2719.345,"Well, no, it's standard law of agency."
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2735.245,2739.555,--The Sixth Circuit rule basically says name or identify.
2006.05-7058,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2765.075,2773.636,"Why is it that the Sixth Circuit rule requires the identification, for complete exhaustion requires the identification to be made at the first stage?"
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2773.636,2776.978,--The Sixth Circuit rule does require that.
2006.05-7058,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2776.978,2783.319,"So to make sure I understand this, in a case, let's say at stage one he names Dr. X."
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2822.1,2829.489,The Sixth Circuit probably would say that that he would be out of luck with respect to Y.
2006.05-7058,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2829.489,2830.94,What justification is there for that?
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2853.98,2875.235,"The Sixth Circuit adopted that rule probably in a case like the Walton case here, where Mr. Walton had a problem with his slot restriction and said, you know, Deputy Warden Bobo put this restriction on me."
2006.05-7058,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2893.119,2893.869,"Yeah, but that wasn't my hypo."
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2910.378,2928.059,"I think I was probably giving too much explanation, but I think from my understanding of how this should operate, he is all right in that case to sue Mr. Gearin, who actually did put the slot restriction on him, and he had the wrong name at step one."
2006.05-7058,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2938.71,2963.091,"In my case, you said you understood that the Sixth Circuit would say that although he identified X and Y in stage two and at stage three, and there had been merit for adjudication at those stages, understanding who the named respondents were, the Sixth Circuit would nonetheless say you had failed to exhaust because back at stage A you mentioned X but not Y."
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2968.729,2974.243,I don't think the Sixth Circuit had that type of case in front of them when they issued--
2006.05-7058,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2974.243,2978.725,"But that apparently, if I understand your answer, is what the result would be."
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2989.939,2990.923,--I'm saying there is none.
2006.05-7058,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2994.405,2996.701,"Well, how about Y in my example?"
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2996.701,2997.342,Pardon me?
2006.05-7058,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2997.342,2998.639,Does he have a good claim against Y?
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,2998.639,2999.982,Y?
2006.05-7058,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2999.982,3002.371,In the Federal court in my hypo--
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,3002.371,3003.589,Okay.
2006.05-7058,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3005.651,3008.681,I think Y is Mr. Gearin.
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,3008.681,3011.26,"--Y is Mr. Gearin, yes."
2006.05-7058,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3011.26,3011.664,--Okay.
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,3011.664,3013.508,So he's got a claim against--
2006.05-7058,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3013.789,3017.663,Even though the Sixth Circuit would throw it out for failure to exhaust.
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,3017.663,3029.267,"I disagree with the Sixth Circuit on that, but I don't disagree with the Sixth Circuit in that when he actually got to court, he sued four other people who were never mentioned in any grievance by anybody."
2006.05-7058,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3029.267,3034.577,"How about Jones, who really did not know who was the doctor who said no surgery?"
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,3054.679,3062.894,"I'm agreeing with you that the Sixth Circuit, both that the Sixth Circuit would say that that won't fly, and that in fact it should fly."
2006.05-7058,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3062.894,3069.579,"So Jones did properly exhaust, then, if you just made that confession, then Jones properly exhausted?"
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,3069.579,3077.106,"Jones properly exhausted against the doctor who actually denied the medical treatment, denied the surgery."
2006.05-7058,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3084.76,3091.664,"Counsel, you've mentioned in your brief that there has been a change in the Michigan grievance policy with respect to naming individuals."
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,3097.037,3105.923,"It will, it will be the same basic philosophy that I've been stating here."
2006.05-7058,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3122.651,3129.086,I thought one of the objections to the Sixth Circuit rule from your friend was that this requirement of naming the individuals came out of thin air.
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,3134.318,3137.77,It does make a difference in proper exhaustion.
2006.05-7058,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3137.77,3139.723,"It's not an absolute policy, though."
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,3146.985,3150.296,Michigan doesn't say you have to name him at the first step.
2006.05-7058,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3152.701,3156.841,Isn't there an exception when you couldn't find out?
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,3156.841,3169.523,"--And if they say they can't find out, and they've made reasonable inquiry, you know, there's somebody at the top of the chain of the medical, that's understandable that they may not know, because they may have never seen Dr. Pramstaller."
2006.05-7058,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3169.523,3173.444,Did the Sixth Circuit have the current Michigan policy before them when they made their decision?
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,3173.444,3175.598,"Not on these three cases, no."
2006.05-7058,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3185.516,3200.651,"I take it from your answer to Justice Ginsburg that back in my Dr. X, Dr. Y case, under the new policy if they got to stage 2 and Y was identified, that Michigan would process the complaint?"
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,3200.651,3203.712,"We would process the grievance, absolutely."
2006.05-7058,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3203.712,3204.743,The grievance.
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,3204.743,3204.946,Yes.
2006.05-7058,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3225.704,3230.983,Now you say the primary purpose is to relieve the courts of the burden rather than determine whether there is merits to the grievances?
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,3230.983,3236.543,"The, the purpose of the Prison Litigation Reform Act was to relieve--"
2006.05-7058,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3236.543,3238.293,"Was to reduce the volume of litigation, period?"
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,3238.293,3242.136,--To reduce the volume to provide more--
2006.05-7058,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3242.136,3246.352,Wasn't there any interest in determining whether the complaints have merit?
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,3261.424,3263.688,"--Well, we do have an interest."
2006.05-7058,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3281.275,3287.007,"But these rules that are challenged here are primarily to benefit the courts, not the profits... the process."
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,3287.007,3307.982,"--They are to, to benefit the courts by taking resources that had previously been spent on meritless cases and spending those instead on cases with merit, to efficiently screen these cases so that the courts are not spending a lot of time asking us for responses and so forth."
2006.05-7058,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3315.732,3316.402,"Thank you, Counsel."
2006.05-7058,1,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,3316.402,3316.887,Thank you.
2006.05-7058,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3316.887,3319.37,"Mr. Andre, you have five minute remaining."
2006.05-7058,2,28860,jean_claude_andre,,3319.37,3329.226,"Justice Ginsburg, you asked earlier about who is better equipped to plead and show exhaustion."
2006.05-7058,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3336.223,3337.285,How is that?
2006.05-7058,2,28860,jean_claude_andre,,3341.674,3348.125,The prisoner may know best whether or not he or she filed a grievance and whether or not he appealed.
2006.05-7058,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3373.724,3386.562,"This seems to me to be a stretch to say that the prison, which has how many prisoners under their jurisdiction, is in a better position to know in individual cases, an individual prisoner, what this prisoner did or didn't do with respect to the grievance process."
2006.05-7058,2,28860,jean_claude_andre,,3391.56,3396.277,He may be able to aver generally but with specificity there are many cases in which he won't be able to.
2006.05-7058,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3439.791,3453.27,"It requires, it requires response in all the cases, and as this subsection G indicates, part of the purpose of the act was to eliminate the necessity of responding to frivolous complaints."
2006.05-7058,2,28860,jean_claude_andre,,3465.389,3477.947,But to go back to Justice Ginsburg's point earlier Congress could have included unexhausted claims among those types of claims that the court could screen out and dismiss or among those claims for which a court could--
2006.05-7058,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3477.947,3479.618,That's a different argument.
2006.05-7058,2,28860,jean_claude_andre,,3488.645,3497.079,"--Or again, it may be more efficient to have them aver generally, but as far as having a prisoner comply with a heightened pleading requirement, we don't think that that makes sense."
2006.05-7058,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3498.314,3509.559,"If it's an affirmative defense doesn't that mean that the prisoner is going to have to file, and the individuals defendants are going to have to file an answer in every case and assert all of their defenses?"

2006.05-7058,3,34910,linda_m_olivieri,,3520.133,3529.269,"They would have to file an answer and motion to dismiss raising whatever affirmative defense they want to raise, but at least it gives them a choice and gives them the opportunity to frame this argument as opposed to putting it on, putting that burden on the court."
2006.05-7058,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3542.515,3548.09,"With respect, with respect to the naming of the individuals, is that claim moot because of the change in the policy?"
