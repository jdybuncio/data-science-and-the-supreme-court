1986.86-341,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,65.292,"You may proceed whenever you're ready, Mr. Yavis."
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,65.292,78.1,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents for decision the conflict between ERISA and a Maine statute upheld by the Maine Supreme Judicial Court."
1986.86-341,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,210.087,220.693,"Mr. Yavis, is the employer's compliance with that statute subject to ERISA?"
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,228.131,241.022,I don't believe that the ERISA regulations would apply because ERISA in our opinion would preempt the application of the statute.
1986.86-341,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,241.022,242.141,Make believe it doesn't.
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,249.212,251.997,The statute does not call for that.
1986.86-341,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,253.714,255.499,But does ERISA call for it?
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,255.499,256.666,ERISA does--
1986.86-341,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,256.666,258.151,"If it's not preempted by ERISA,--"
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,258.151,259.25,"--Yes, ERISA then--"
1986.86-341,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,259.25,262.019,--would there have to be compliance with any ERISA regulations?
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,262.019,277.564,--ERISA does cover severance pay plans expressly and that's in 3(1)(A) where some courts have held that ERISA covers severance benefits as benefits as benefits in the event of unemployment.
1986.86-341,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,277.564,278.264,Which means what?
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,282.783,300.161,"There would be, for example, disclosure to employees, reporting, there would be fiduciary standards, there would be access to federal courts, there would be potential intrusion by the Federal Department of Labor."
1986.86-341,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,303.363,321.074,"I assume it's also true that if there were no state statute, but if a private employer had a plan, a severance pay plan precisely the same as what the statute requires that private employer would also be covered by ERISA."
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,321.074,321.76,That is correct.
1986.86-341,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,321.76,322.576,xxx to that plan.
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,322.576,330.616,"I should add, Your Honor, that there are alternative grounds in the statute for including severance pay as an ERISA benefit."
1986.86-341,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,484.93,487.548,"May I just interrupt you, Mr. Yavis for a second."
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,503.075,512.448,"Well in this case, Your Honor, the plan has been initiated by the statutory action of the state of Maine."
1986.86-341,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,512.448,519.936,Do you think that this language in ERISA covers that plan established or maintained by the state of Maine.
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,519.936,529.809,If the plan were solely established by the state of Maine and not maintained by the employer then perhaps the answer would be no.
1986.86-341,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,531.477,535.046,"Say for, take for the example, say you didn't have a plan at all."
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,545.837,550.289,"--Yes, it would because we would be required to maintain that plan."
1986.86-341,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,568.167,570.036,"Not to establish it, but to maintain it."
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,570.036,570.552,--That's correct.
1986.86-341,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,570.552,575.873,And you say the act of the writing the checks is enough to be maintaining a plan?
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,575.873,576.873,"Yes, and--"
1986.86-341,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,576.873,579.975,"If you know who the employees are when you fire them, I'm sure."
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,579.975,582.66,--But there may or may not be eligibility.
1986.86-341,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,590.1,595.103,"But that's not a plan that the employer, that's all a matter of statutory compliance isn't it?"
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,595.103,603.709,"--Well those are, what we say is that the statute in effect presents the plan to the employer, that the employer must thereby maintain that plan."
1986.86-341,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,603.709,609.327,"You say that, in other words, what you're saying is compliance with the statute is equivalent to maintaining a plan."
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,609.327,609.946,That is correct.
1986.86-341,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,619.552,620.818,Well if you had it voluntarily--
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,620.818,621.168,"Yes, yes."
1986.86-341,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,621.168,621.868,--there's no problem.
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,625.872,627.022,That is correct.
1986.86-341,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,627.022,627.872,--If you had said--
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,627.872,634.376,We are compelled to do it by the force of the statute.
1986.86-341,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,634.376,639.846,"--But here of course, the employer did have some sort of ERISA plan in effect."
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,639.846,640.38,Yes it did.
1986.86-341,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,674.417,677.853,Tell me what it takes to maintain the plan other than writing checks?
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,679.605,681.107,"No you do not, Your Honor."
1986.86-341,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,685.275,687.243,ERISA doesn't require that either?
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,687.243,688.377,--It does not.
1986.86-341,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,697.716,713.109,"So even if a private employer set up the same kind of a plan under his own authority without a statute compelling it, he would be doing no more than what your client does writing a check."
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,713.109,727.802,"Right, Your Honor, a person subject to such a plan should go through the publication and disclosure aspects, but up to the time of payment there is no requirement for funding, no requirement for a trust."
1986.86-341,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,735.991,738.093,Does the Maine statute require you to do that publication?
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,738.093,738.759,"No, it does not."
1986.86-341,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,738.759,739.409,It does not?
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,739.409,741.395,Does it require you to do what?
1986.86-341,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,741.395,744.597,To do the same kind of publication and notification that ERISA does.
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,744.597,745.58,"No, it does not."
1986.86-341,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,745.58,755.738,So unless your plan is covered by ERISA those duties of the employer would be eliminated.
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,755.738,761.375,"That is correct and those are, of course, the duties considered important by ERISA."
1986.86-341,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,761.375,773.099,"But if it were held, and I am not saying it should be, but if it were held that there is no preemption here then those duties wouldn't apply to compliance with the Maine statute."
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,778.753,779.503,I suppose that's right.
1986.86-341,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,780.936,783.872,You wouldn't have to give notice or any of that.
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,783.872,792.994,The structure of ERISA supports the congressional intent to have broad preemption of any and all state laws.
1986.86-341,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,847.481,849.267,xxx.
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,849.267,858.639,"Your Honor, 514(C)(2) is at page 66 of the jurisdictional statement appendix."
1986.86-341,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,905.87,915.709,"So you would make the same argument if the state just said, we're not going to say anything about what should be in a plan, but you have to have a severance plan."
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,915.709,916.375,Yes.
1986.86-341,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1063.27,1065.672,May I ask you another question if I may?
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,1098.709,1099.661,I believe so.
1986.86-341,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1112.686,1114.987,Do you conclude that from the preemption clause?
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,1116.204,1116.689,--In part.
1986.86-341,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1118.189,1124.36,Well would you be arguing the same if the expressed preemption clause wasn't even in ERISA?
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,1124.36,1143.774,"Well I would think that would be a, certainly a more difficult case but the intent of the statute expressed in the policy in Section 2 and if the same legislative history were there it would be hard to conceive the same legislative history without the expressed preemption provision."
1986.86-341,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1147.626,1161.616,"Well couldn't you say in this case that the Maine law is not preempted in the sense that it may require the employer to have a severance pay policy but that once he establishes it, it's subject to ERISA?"
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,1161.616,1164.801,I don't believe that decision was left to the states.
1986.86-341,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1165.503,1166.087,Well I know.
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,1176.759,1184.882,"--I believe that if we accepted that plan, yes, it would be a severance pay plan under 3(1)(A) or 3(1)(B)--"
1986.86-341,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1184.882,1188.267,"And, ERISA, Maine doesn't say that it wouldn't, does it?"
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,1196.44,1197.808,--Well conceivably--
1986.86-341,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1197.808,1198.924,Isn't that right?
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,1198.924,1200.141,--I'm not sure if that's right.
1986.86-341,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1249.091,1250.774,What is 514(C)(2)?
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,1250.774,1252.243,--514(C)(2)?
1986.86-341,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1252.243,1257.28,You have them published in your Appendix with the 29 U.S.C. numbers.
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,1257.713,1264.101,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, that is at page 65."
1986.86-341,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1523.77,1528.238,"--I suppose you get severance pay even though you go right to another job too, don't you?"
1986.86-341,0,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,1528.238,1528.938,That's right.
1986.86-341,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1584.142,1585.594,"Thank you, Mr. Yavis."
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,1597.319,1605.573,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'm going to concentrate this morning as Mr. Yavis did on the ERISA preemption argument."
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1681.723,1688.309,I understand your position is that Maine does require the type of a plan that ERISA would reach?
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,1688.309,1689.411,--That's correct.
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1689.411,1702.052,And if an employer on his own established precisely the kind of plan that the Maine law requires you say that would not be covered by ERISA?
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,1702.052,1704.254,"It would depend, if--"
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1704.254,1711.342,Say the union and the employer negotiated and said anytime somebody leaves he gets a week's pay period.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,1711.342,1716.479,"--In that case, Your Honor, I think that there is a difference in that and what the Maine law requires."
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1723.3,1726.685,"Well, let's assume that, let's assume in some other state--"
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,1726.685,1727.203,--Okay.
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1727.203,1734.357,--a union and an employer negotiates a severance pay plan and it's identical with what the Maine law requires.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,1734.357,1742.629,"If it were, if all you had was a provision in a contract that said in the event of a plant closing we would--"
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1742.629,1750.533,"Well, I'm just saying if the plan requires precisely what, sets up exactly what the Maine law requires."
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,1750.533,1755.621,--Well then that would be a plan which applied only in the event of a plant closing.
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1755.621,1756.187,Uh-huh.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,1756.187,1760.841,"And in that case, we think that it probably would be covered by ERISA."
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1760.841,1761.541,"ERISA, yes."
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,1772.565,1774.165,"Well that's not quite right, Your Honor."
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1774.165,1775.517,Well that's what you said a while ago.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,1775.517,1779.469,"I hope I, what I, let me clarify."
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.9,1799.266,Well that may be so.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,1803.602,1808.572,"Well, if an employer creates a plan, they exempt themselves from the Maine law."
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1817.361,1825.783,"Well, so that isn't a plan at all if he just recognizes his obligation under the law to make a payment."
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,1825.783,1827.902,"Well, what we're really suggesting is this."
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1839.56,1839.893,Why?
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,1851.184,1854.552,I think in that instance it would probably be covered.
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1854.552,1854.869,Okay.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,1881.72,1885.006,Well we really think that's only true in this context and--
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1885.006,1885.372,Oh.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,1885.372,1886.022,--let me explain me why.
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1886.022,1887.358,Well that's nice.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,1887.358,1889.642,It's true in this context for one reason.
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1913.175,1916.293,"I don't care what they were focusing on, I care about the law they wrote."
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,1921.345,1930.969,"What we're suggesting, Justice Scalia, is that the wording of the statute has to be interpreted in light of the underlying policies of the ERISA statute."
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1930.969,1948.764,"What word would enable this distinction that you can yank a, what would otherwise be a covered severance plan out of ERISA simply by adopting a state statute that covers it but you can't yank anything else out of ERISA by adopting a state statute that covers it?"
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,1948.764,1963.441,"What you've got, the definition of an ERISA plan is a plan or fund which provides certain kinds of employee benefits and which is either established or maintained by an employer."
1986.86-341,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1980.717,1991.091,"You would draw a distinction, as I take it, to follow up on Justice Scalia's hypothetical, the Maine statute said you must create a fund and pay benefits out of that in certain periodic payments."
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,1997.512,2001.364,I think if you have an ongoing benefit program--
1986.86-341,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2001.364,2001.899,So they couldn't.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2001.899,2004.685,"--that, payable to employees over time--"
1986.86-341,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2004.685,2005.418,But your point is that--
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2005.418,2006.068,--But that would be something--
1986.86-341,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2006.068,2008.57,--This statute doesn't require them to establish or maintain any plan.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2008.57,2009.403,--It does not.
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2011.589,2016.742,As much of a plan as a severance plan ever is.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2019.86,2022.127,"Well I don't think that's correct, Justice Scalia."
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2022.127,2022.396,"Oh, okay."
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2023.596,2024.462,I think that was what Mr. Yavis--
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2024.462,2025.062,That's right.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2025.062,2028.383,"--if it were, if you had an ERISA coverage severance pay plan--"
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2028.383,2029.3,It would have to be funded?
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2029.3,2049.813,"--totally, privately created it would be subject to all of the obligations and all of the terms and conditions of ERISA and that would include the requirement of maintaining the assets in a separate entity under a trust fund with the various disclosure obligations that would be entailed and we don't think that any of those--"
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2049.813,2056.617,"Well the big difference, if I understand is, under your position the employer then would have made a promise to pay some benefits on a certain contingency arising."
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2056.617,2057.117,--That's correct.
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2057.117,2059.219,And there's no such promise here.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2059.219,2060.601,That's correct.
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2060.601,2077.897,"Well, say if the employer did set up a plan in response to this statute, but he established it and he wrote out a plan and arranged for funding you would think that wouldn't be an ERISA plan."
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2077.897,2079.149,Well if an employer--
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2079.149,2081.601,It would be reached by ERISA.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2081.601,2086.32,"--It would be an ERISA plan, or it could be an ERISA plan and in that instance the Maine law--"
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2086.32,2100.729,"Well I don't understand why Maine is so insistent on saying that an employer's response to this statute, his obedience to the statute does not create an ERISA covered plan."
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2100.729,2101.879,"--Your Honor, I think--"
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2101.879,2102.531,Because I don't know.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2114.322,2130.749,"--Well, I guess if I understand your question, what we are suggesting is that an employer independently, on his own, creates an ERISA plan or reaches a contract with his employees to pay severance pay, that would have two effects."
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2142.389,2147.543,"But here's an employer who doesn't have a plan, he doesn't want one, but the law requires him to pay severance pay."
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2152.397,2153.031,That's correct.
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2153.031,2157.316,"And he thoroughly intends to obey the law, and he does."
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2163.737,2170.593,If an employer creates an ERISA plan in response to the Maine statute that would be an ERISA plan.
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2178.479,2183.3,"Well, the union says to him, do you intend to live up to this Maine statute."
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2189.12,2189.854,--According to the Maine statute.
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2189.854,2190.17,--Yes.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2190.17,2193.608,We don't think that that bare fact constitutes an ERISA plan.
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2193.608,2195.674,Well why is that important to you?
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2197.576,2205.663,"Well, if it were an ERISA plan I think that an argument could be made that in that point the Maine law was relating to the ERISA plan, or forcing it--"
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.663,2210.881,So then Maine could no longer then require them to maintain the plan.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2210.881,2218.801,"--Well Maine, if the Maine law were interpreted to relate to an ERISA plan then the Maine law would be preempted."
1986.86-341,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2218.801,2228.926,"I take it a state could not, a state like Maine, can't say to employers within the state, we want you all to set up ERISA plans that meet this minimum standard."
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2232.544,2236.496,"I think that that would create a preemption problem, Your Honor, yes."
1986.86-341,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2239.031,2266.866,"Well, Mr. Warren, the Solicitor General of the United States has also filed a brief in this case suggesting that this Court's opinion in Shaw v. Delta Airlines indicates that the ERISA preemption provisions also prohibit and preempt state laws which simply require employers to provide certain specific benefits to employees."
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2266.866,2267.784,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-341,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2267.784,2273.371,"Regardless of the question of whether it requires, whether Maine's law requires you to set up a plan, or not."
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2273.371,2276.823,"I think that is what the Solicitor, the position taken by the Solicitor General."
1986.86-341,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2276.823,2277.173,Right.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2289.814,2293.785,He would and let me explain why I think that's wrong.
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2346.651,2359.791,"It's important to me, this is going back over earlier ground whether a plan adopted by the employer under the statute is the same as a plan that he might adopt under ERISA."
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2386.176,2389.395,"--I think that's, it might, Your Honor."
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2390.93,2392.763,--Do welfare plans have to be funded?
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2392.763,2394.799,I believe they do.
1986.86-341,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2470.13,2473.251,You mean plan as defined in ERISA?
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2473.251,2475.434,--I mean plan as defined in ERISA.
1986.86-341,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2481.987,2490.743,"And in the statutory context you have both employee welfare benefit plan and employee pension benefit plan, don't you?"
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2490.743,2491.228,That's correct.
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2510.89,2511.792,I'm sure of that.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2541.811,2542.645,--Your Honor--
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2542.645,2549.149,It is not the mandating of it by the state alone that can possibly take it out of ERISA right here.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2549.149,2549.865,--No.
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2572.264,2582.888,"xxx even though other pension plans, or even though other severance plans are subject to ERISA, this one is not subject to ERISA."
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2585.757,2596.046,If all the employer does is comply with the Maine law then we would say that the employer is not subject to any ERISA obligation.
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2596.046,2599.315,Do we know what position the Secretary takes on this?
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2599.315,2610.722,"I think the Secretary's position is that the Maine law itself requires the creation of an ERISA covered plan and following from that premise, it would argue that the Maine law is preempted."
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2613.241,2614.574,"Or, put it put differently."
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2622.363,2625.299,"--That is, I think, the Secretary's position."
1986.86-341,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2628.517,2646.545,"Well, I'm not sure that's accurate because apparently the Solicitor General's speaking for the Secretary would say that states cannot direct specific benefits to be provided if they are the type of benefits covered by ERISA."
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2646.545,2666.559,"--And I think that's both right, Justice O'Connor, and what I'm really suggesting is that the Secretary's position, or at least as reported by the Solicitor General, seems to be that merely requiring a benefit is, that statement alone, that requirement alone is sufficient to create an ERISA covered plan."
1986.86-341,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2666.959,2686.122,"One of the things that the Solicitor General relies upon is the fact that in ERISA and in the preemption section, Congress specifically carved out Hawaii's law which provided for a specific kind of health benefit."
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2686.122,2687.139,--That's correct.
1986.86-341,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2687.139,2692.359,And opted not to protect any other type of state law.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2706.267,2717.992,Well the Hawaii Pre-paid Health Care Act which is the Act that you're referring to is an Act which really goes way beyond what Maine does.
1986.86-341,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2838.104,2853.263,"Mr. Warren, you have fairly complicated definitions of plan and do you think it really lends itself to these kind of generalizations that this was what Congress was getting at or wasn't getting at rather than kind of a parsing of the section?"
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2853.263,2870.559,"--I think you have to do both, Your Honor, but as Mr. Yavis stated that the term plan itself is not defined in ERISA and I think to gain enlightenment as to what Congress was worrying about you have to look at the congressional findings and declaration of policy--"
1986.86-341,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2870.559,2877.063,The term employee welfare benefit plan and the term employee pension benefit plans are both defined.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2877.063,2877.998,--They are indeed.
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2879.848,2884.569,Why does that definition reach severance plans at all?
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2884.569,2898.761,--Well the argument that that reached the severance plans is based upon the incorporation within the definition of a reference to certain benefits provided under the Taft-Hartley Act.
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2898.761,2900.344,186(C).
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2900.344,2901.446,186(C).
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2907.684,2914.771,So you don't dispute that ERISA does reach severance arrangements.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2914.771,2929.43,--We don't dispute that ERISA would govern a plan which provided severance benefits and what we're suggesting is that ERISA does not necessarily cover the entire topic of severance benefits.
1986.86-341,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2929.43,2929.747,I see.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2929.747,2937.369,"Going back to the issue of whether this creates a plan, it seems to me that you first got the question of private arrangements."
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2960.833,2962.183,Not a severance plan under ERISA.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2968.553,2970.355,--From the point of view of each employee--
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2970.355,2970.788,Right.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2970.788,2973.29,"--it might be a one shot severance pay, but--"
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2973.29,2974.24,Well the same with the statute.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2974.24,2982.746,"--Well from the point of view of the employer, the ordinary severance plan is paid to a group of employees as they depart the employment relationship over time."
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2984.198,2984.781,I see.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2984.781,2986.883,--they're talking about administering the payment of benefits over--
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2986.883,2988.55,You're talking about a plant closing.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2988.55,2991.668,--I'm talking about a plant closing and that's exactly what Maine law is talking about.
1986.86-341,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2991.668,2992.454,And that is one shot.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,2998.774,3008.964,"But for the same reason, we agree that ERISA does and it's the, from the point of view of the beneficiary, Justice O'Connor, the death benefit is probably a one payment."
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3091.784,3092.819,Say that again.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,3095.419,3096.854,If this--
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3096.854,3097.921,"Beginning with the, if."
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,3097.921,3098.437,--Right.
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3109.662,3110.045,Right.
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,3110.045,3120.803,"--which it, itself creates then that law would be preempted even in the case of an employer who had no absolutely no existing ERISA plan at the time."
1986.86-341,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3130.926,3142.65,"Why would that be any stranger than any other state law that proscribes or specifies, let's say a standard retirement plan?"
1986.86-341,1,43429,thomas_d_warren,,3156.16,3167.384,"It seems to me that if a state requires something and it doesn't relate to a plan within the meaning of Section 514, then the state's proscription is not preempted."
1986.86-341,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3375.018,3376.484,"Thank you, Mr. Warren."
1986.86-341,2,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,3380.47,3394.98,"Your Honor, I'd very briefly like to clarify the pension plan aspect versus the welfare benefit plan aspect as they relate to severance pay."
1986.86-341,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3434.14,3437.592,But doesn't that mean that the employee contributes to it.
1986.86-341,2,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,3437.592,3440.627,"No, no."
1986.86-341,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3545.861,3549.848,No separate entity either as Mr. Warren referred to xxx.
1986.86-341,2,33712,john_c_yavis_jr,,3549.848,3551.148,"No separate entitles required, Your Honor."
1986.86-341,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3556.085,3558.502,"Thank you, Mr. Yavis."
