2006.06-8120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.154,"We'll hear argument next in 06-8120, Brendlin versus California."
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,7.387,9.856,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleast the Court:"
2006.06-8120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,35.321,38.458,"Well, it wouldn't apply in a taxicab, right?"
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,45.462,56.837,"Whether or not you can get out and catch another cab is sort of a separate issue, but at the moment that the car comes to a stop you've been stopped by a Government means intentionally applied, and I believe you are seized at that point."
2006.06-8120,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,68.727,70.394,And would that apply if a bus was pulled over?
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,70.394,71.179,If a bus--
2006.06-8120,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,71.179,72.512,Everybody on the bus is seized?
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,72.512,79.952,"--Once again, a forward motion stopped by government means intentionally applied is a seizure under this Court's holding in Brower."
2006.06-8120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,79.952,88.206,But you would have no reason if you were a passenger on a bus in the normal case to assume that the officer was concerned about you.
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,95.045,100.699,"With all due respect, I believe at that point what you believe is not necessarily the dispositive issue."
2006.06-8120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,105.333,125.081,"Well, are you saying then that in a case in which the bus is stopped, the car is stopped and so on, the role for the test about whether a reasonable person would regard himself as free to leave is a test to determine when the, when the seizure ends, as distinct from when the seizure begins?"
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,125.081,125.864,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2006.06-8120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,125.864,128.098,There's no other role for that test.
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,128.098,129.098,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2006.06-8120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,140.624,146.394,"Yeah, but you're taking the position that whenever you are in a vehicle that is stopped, you are seized?"
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,146.394,147.377,--Exactly.
2006.06-8120,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,148.196,162.439,"In this case, is it correct to view this as... to view it this way: As soon as the officer approached the car, as I understand it, he recognized the Defendant as a potential parole violator."
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,162.439,162.956,Yes.
2006.06-8120,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,162.956,173.212,"And there would be reasonable suspicion then from that moment on, for at least a brief detention of the individual to determine whether in fact there was a warrant for the individual."
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,183.352,186.887,"In terms of determining when Mr. Brendlin was seized, yes."
2006.06-8120,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,188.553,192.791,"In other words, any seizure after that point would be supported by reasonable suspicion?"
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,192.791,197.409,"--Well, except in this case of course, it would be fruit of the poisonous tree, since the State has continued--"
2006.06-8120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,197.409,198.695,"Well, that's the question."
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,201.445,206.765,--The arrest itself... the arrest itself is still a product of the exploitation.
2006.06-8120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,206.765,208.716,Do you concede that the arrest was lawful?
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,213.787,214.604,Yes.
2006.06-8120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,215.687,226.528,Do you have any case in which we exclude the evidence seized incident to an arrest when the arrest is lawful?
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,226.528,231.166,"Well, Your Honor, I don't have a case that has these specifics in it."
2006.06-8120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,232.199,234.784,"I didn't think you did, and that's my concern."
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,265.303,274.509,"--Well actually, I would turn to the cases that talk about searches incident to arrest and also, go back to the rationale for the intended--"
2006.06-8120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,274.509,276.259,Can I have one please?
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,276.259,279.377,"--Well actually, let's look at Thornton and--"
2006.06-8120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,279.377,283.246,"Thornton, I'm not familiar with immediately."
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,283.531,290.852,--Thornton and Knowles are two cases that this Court has decided relatively recently where you talk about the rationale for searches incident to arrest.
2006.06-8120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,302.842,303.392,"No, no."
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,333.279,335.98,--If I can divide this into two issues.
2006.06-8120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,361.231,370.321,"Well, it's a direct product of the arrest, and if the arrest is legal, then it seems to me the search incident to the arrest is legal."
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,390.3,391.25,--And--
2006.06-8120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,391.25,392.467,So the arrest is legal.
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,396.288,405.894,"--Well, I think we have to look, as I said, at the purpose... the rationales for allowing a search incident to arrest are the need to disarm the suspect or take him into custody, and the need to preserve evidence for trial."
2006.06-8120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,416.867,425.14,What authority do you have that the operation of the exclusionary rule depends on the offense for which he was arrested?
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,425.14,429.525,"Well, the search incident to an arrest is an exception to... to the exclusionary rule."
2006.06-8120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,429.525,433.127,Do you have any authority for the proposition you just offered?
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,433.127,434.996,The proposition--
2006.06-8120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,434.996,442.0,"The search incident to an arrest leads to an exclusion in one case and not in another case, depending on the charge on which he was arrested?"
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,442.0,453.375,"--Well, if what we are talking about is whether or not the exclusionary rule should apply, we look to the purposes of the exclusionary rule which is to deter unlawful police conduct."
2006.06-8120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,477.256,489.398,"Well, but why... why doesn't plain view kick in just as readily, once it is conceded as it has to be, that at the point that he was making the arrest, the officer was acting lawfully?"
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,515.298,517.317,"Well, I believe you misunderstood me."
2006.06-8120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,524.904,525.423,"No, I realize."
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,623.836,626.519,"--Well, first, Your Honor, a slight correction."
2006.06-8120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,635.541,635.825,Okay.
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,640.177,640.677,--Yes.
2006.06-8120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,640.91,641.143,Okay.
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,641.143,642.309,Issued by the Board of Prison Terms.
2006.06-8120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,642.309,642.593,All right.
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,642.593,652.515,"But in terms of why we don't do this, it's the reason we exclude evidence in general when it's unlawfull seized, when it is the direct result of a... of a stop that is illegal from its inception."
2006.06-8120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,652.515,666.506,"Well, all right, but you're simply saying we give, we put the greatest emphasis on act A, stopping the car rather than act B, lawfully arresting, regardless of the legality of stopping the car."
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,666.506,668.691,Well... well actually we have a test for this.
2006.06-8120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,688.771,693.925,"But do we, do we have do we have in any of the cases... I, frankly I don't recall."
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,741.721,746.275,"--Well, Your Honor, I think, actually I'm not sure that the driver in this case is going to have a remedy."
2006.06-8120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,785.883,791.168,"Well, do we have an... an argument that something was seized from the driver that should not have been seized from his person?"
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,791.168,794.905,"--The driver is not a party to the appeal, but she was convicted, and... and... and--"
2006.06-8120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,794.905,796.039,"Well, but I mean, that's not before us."
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,796.039,796.705,"--No, it's not."
2006.06-8120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,796.705,798.791,We're talking about evidence seized from the defendant.
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,798.791,799.357,"No, Your Honor."
2006.06-8120,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,815.05,826.608,"The California Supreme Court as far as I could tell was thinking that it turns, if you stop somebody, you stop somebody, if you make him think he isn't free to go."
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,853.657,855.975,--Have they been stopped by the initial seizure?
2006.06-8120,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,855.975,857.06,No.
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,857.06,858.91,"The initial stop of the car, yes."
2006.06-8120,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,858.91,859.076,Okay.
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,866.063,867.596,"Well, I think the Brower decision--"
2006.06-8120,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,867.596,868.479,Brower--
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,868.479,869.348,--The Brower opinion has a very--
2006.06-8120,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,869.348,870.615,"--What, what were the facts there?"
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,870.615,872.883,"--Well, in Brower there was a roadblock--"
2006.06-8120,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,872.883,873.9,There was a roadblock.
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,873.9,875.002,--The car crashed into it.
2006.06-8120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,879.121,883.489,"What if the car... you know, the car doesn't come to a complete stop."
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,900.617,906.271,I think then we'd have a totality of the circumstances test and whether someone feels free to leave and jump out of a moving car.
2006.06-8120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,906.638,913.544,"So you're putting all the eggs into the basket that the, the car came to a complete stop and therefore they have been seized."
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,920.281,921.398,--That's how--
2006.06-8120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,921.398,931.838,"Any elimination of motion in a vehicle in which you are the passenger constitutes, at the request of the authorities, constitutes a seizure?"
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,931.838,934.89,"--If it is by means intentionally implied, yes."
2006.06-8120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,936.909,939.492,"But not if you're still rolling a little bit, a foot a minute."
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,940.361,942.327,"--Well, then it would be totality of the circumstances test."
2006.06-8120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,942.327,947.545,"It seems to me that you're, you're blending two tests together, and tell me if I'm wrong."
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,956.801,957.503,Yes.
2006.06-8120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,957.503,958.937,And those are the motion cases.
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,1017.625,1032.098,"I agree with you that they are two independent tests, and as I went through this Court's precedents I frankly could not find a single case in which a person had been in motion and stopped and came to a stop, the physical stopping of motion, in which this Court did not find that a seizure had occurred."
2006.06-8120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1032.098,1032.233,Okay.
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,1042.49,1043.04,Well--
2006.06-8120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1043.04,1044.875,A reasonable person would have felt.
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,1044.875,1050.096,"--I think that what we have here, is... as I said it's really the way we look at it with drivers as well."
2006.06-8120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1059.182,1071.157,"No, but aren't... you are saying, I thought by agreeing with you what you were saying was once the car is stopped, a reasonable person under those circumstances would not have felt free to leave."
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,1071.157,1072.923,--I think that's true.
2006.06-8120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1072.923,1073.307,Okay.
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,1073.307,1074.275,I think a reasonable person would not feel free to leave.
2006.06-8120,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1074.275,1078.827,"What if the officer went, before even approaching the car got on the loudspeaker and said:"
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,1081.429,1089.201,"I think under the totality of the circumstances any court would have a hard time saying the passenger is not free to leave then, unless there is some other intervening, some other factor."
2006.06-8120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1089.201,1092.32,But you would state he is still seized because the car is stopped.
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,1092.32,1093.57,"He is seized by the stop, absolutely."
2006.06-8120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1093.57,1097.538,"Well, then you're... you're blending the two tests together again."
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,1097.538,1098.14,"Well, the two different--"
2006.06-8120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1098.14,1101.342,You have either got to accept their analytical distinction or not.
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,1101.342,1103.96,"--I do accept their analytical distinction, Your Honor."
2006.06-8120,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1118.018,1136.598,"What's the difference between that situation where the police officer says on the loudspeaker passenger remain, driver you're free to go, and the example that the State has in their brief, in which a car is stopped and as a result of the way it's stopped on a narrow road, the other cars behind that car are for some other period of time prevented from going forward?"
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,1138.881,1141.55,That difference is actually addressed directly in Brower.
2006.06-8120,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1154.56,1173.605,"So what it says here, getting out their quote from it, is it says it does not occur whenever there is a governmentally caused termination in individual's freedom of movement, nor even where there is a governmentally caused and governmentally desired termination of an individual's freedom of movement."
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,1206.576,1213.33,"Your Honor, where you're looking at... we have to look at the objectively observable facts, which in this case are the flashing lights."
2006.06-8120,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1225.204,1228.256,"Well, the passenger, you also have to have two things."
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,1265.177,1266.846,"Well, my response is the same as it has been."
2006.06-8120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1286.925,1288.961,"Well, does that make a difference?"
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,1304.471,1305.337,"--No, Your Honor."
2006.06-8120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1308.506,1311.791,So then why are we pointing out that they didn't know?
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,1313.493,1315.377,"Well, I don't think it makes a difference one way or the other."
2006.06-8120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1326.467,1338.025,"Well then, if all that matters is the physical stop, what do you do about the cases that were talked about earlier where the other cars have to stop because of the way... that's a physical stop and yet our cases indicate you're not seized in those situations."
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,1338.025,1348.416,"--That's a physical stop, but it's not... it's not the... the means intentionally applied portion of the test doesn't work or it doesn't satisfy it."
2006.06-8120,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1348.416,1359.272,"Well, how do you explain the justification for stopping if there is the seizure, for stopping the innocent passenger because the driver has committed a traffic violation?"
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,1366.211,1366.727,No.
2006.06-8120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1388.891,1391.592,What about a shutdown of an airport?
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,1416.29,1417.273,"No, Your Honor."
2006.06-8120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1424.843,1429.414,"Okay, just the people who were trying to leave the airport."
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,1436.201,1441.471,"--I would say some of those people would be in the position of the passer-by, the passers-by identified in Brower."
2006.06-8120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1452.327,1457.314,"Well, it turns out that there wasn't a bag of explosives and that no reasonable person would have thought."
2006.06-8120,0,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,1470.658,1483.048,"--Given the extreme leeway given in airports, if it's so bad that there wasn't reasonable suspicion to shut it down, I'd say that's probably a reasonable result for shutting down entire airports for no reason whatsoever."
2006.06-8120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1520.155,1521.423,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,1524.125,1527.327,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2006.06-8120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1573.239,1592.02,"Even, even when the reason the driver is stopped is that a police officer whose car was alongside, he looks over there and he sees that it is some notorious felon who is in the back seat, and the only reason he stops the car is so arrest that felon?"
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,1600.708,1609.564,"Justice Scalia, the way I'd answer that question is to say yes at the outset, because the driver is in control of the vehicle."
2006.06-8120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1618.754,1619.254,That's the right answer.
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,1623.455,1624.855,--Thank you.
2006.06-8120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1624.855,1637.965,"Well, consistent with that answer, consistent with that answer, what we're concerned with in these cases is not, in cases like this, is not literally the moment of the stop, but the moment of the stop plus one."
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,1674.888,1683.344,"Justice Souter, I think the, the pervasiveness and the commonplace nature of a routine traffic stop gives--"
2006.06-8120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1683.344,1684.195,Have you ever been stopped?
2006.06-8120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1686.829,1690.599,Tell the truth now.
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,1690.899,1693.718,--Yes.
2006.06-8120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1694.401,1694.818,Okay.
2006.06-8120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1696.003,1697.353,Okay.
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,1701.155,1702.824,"But I was the driver, I was the driver."
2006.06-8120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1702.824,1722.286,"--Don't you think that a reasonable passenger at that point would assume that the officer is in control and that, in the absence of some affirmative indication that the passenger can go, that he's supposed to sit there until this thing gets over with?"
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,1724.671,1726.189,"No, Justice Souter, I don't think so."
2006.06-8120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1765.332,1766.164,The fact that the action--
2006.06-8120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1766.164,1770.801,"Well, but the policeman usually tells the drive and anybody else in the car: Stay in the car."
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,1793.065,1799.405,"Well, I think, Justice Scalia, I think if the officer did tell you to stay in the car--"
2006.06-8120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1799.405,1800.171,"Well, even if he didn't tell me."
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,1811.963,1814.915,"--Well, I, I'm not sure that I agree with that."
2006.06-8120,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1814.915,1817.867,What if there's a suitcase in the back seat?
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,1834.642,1845.45,"Well, again, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that if, if the officer... our position is that if the officer does something to the passenger to indicate--"
2006.06-8120,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1845.45,1847.219,I'm talking about the suitcase.
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,1860.194,1864.245,"--I'm not sure that a passenger, though, is like a suitcase."
2006.06-8120,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1868.632,1887.611,"You're representing the State of California and you want to establish the proposition that any time there is a traffic stop in the State of California or I guess anywhere in the United States all the passengers are free to immediately leave, absent some further countermanding officer... order by the officer."
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,1915.196,1927.771,"Well, though it's not cited in our brief, Justice Kennedy, we have talked with the California Highway Patrol who make over a million stops a year in California and they treat passengers as free to leave."
2006.06-8120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1927.771,1931.39,"But I mean, the question... so I want to know how to decide this case."
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,1965.343,1973.966,"Well, I mean... but I think that prudent behavior... just because it's prudent to do something doesn't make it a seizure."
2006.06-8120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1973.966,1978.687,Right.
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,1993.03,1995.047,"I mean, I think, I think again that--"
2006.06-8120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1995.047,2013.543,"--Mr. Zall, let's say we have just an intelligent reasonable person reads the newspaper and says: Oh, they handed down a decision today that said the police can order me to get out of the car, the police can order me to stay in the car."
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2028.203,2037.475,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I'd say that, you know, in the Court's seizure jurisprudence there is this notion of a consensual encounter."
2006.06-8120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2068.411,2071.03,Does it matter if they're on the Santa Monica Freeway?
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2071.03,2074.415,I don't think so.
2006.06-8120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2074.415,2077.802,I mean it would be pretty dangerous to get out.
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2077.802,2081.754,"Well, but that would be a reason why you don't get out."
2006.06-8120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2107.47,2108.903,May I ask this question?
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2117.759,2118.511,Yes.
2006.06-8120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2127.383,2133.02,Doesn't it mean that the authority to cause the person to stay in the car existed throughout the stop?
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2133.02,2135.42,--The authority?
2006.06-8120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2141.091,2142.459,Let me ask you this.
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2153.951,2155.751,"Well, it depends, Justice Stevens."
2006.06-8120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2165.824,2168.193,Is there a difference between legal authority and factual authority?
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2168.193,2170.443,--I don't think in this context there is.
2006.06-8120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2171.812,2173.328,If there's no difference then there's legal authority.
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2173.328,2174.764,"--I'm sorry, Justice Stevens?"
2006.06-8120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2174.764,2181.418,"If there's no difference then there's legal authority, which would mean the person is subject, is in custody of the officer."
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2181.418,2194.476,"No, I don't think so, any more so than Mr. Drayton was in the Drayton case, where his compatriot was arrested and the police continued to engage him, and this Court found that that was a consensual--"
2006.06-8120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2194.476,2197.011,How are we supposed to... I think it's quite interesting.
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2232.367,2246.175,"--Well, Justice Breyer, I mean, I think that in this Court's... to be consistent with this Court's consensual encounter jurisprudence, with Rodriguez, with Royer, with Drayton, with Bostick--"
2006.06-8120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2246.175,2261.684,"But those are encounters in an airport where there are pedestrians; there's no authority to make the person stay, where here I think you've conceded that there is legal authority to require the person to stay where he was."
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2261.684,2264.402,"--Yes, yes, I do, Justice Stevens."
2006.06-8120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2264.921,2267.621,And if it wasn't a seizure what's the source of the legal authority?
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2267.621,2273.325,"--Well, again, I think, though, that it's a question of seizable versus seized."
2006.06-8120,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2306.729,2312.533,"If it's not, if the opposite is true, then it is a seizure even though they stop the car?"
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2312.533,2336.415,"--Then, Mr. Chief Justice, I would say that it's a seizure that at the outset, again per Justice Scalia's hypothetical, that the, the driver only is seized at the outset, but then once the police make it clear that their interest is with the passenger then the passenger would not feel free to leave, and then the passenger would be seized."
2006.06-8120,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2336.415,2338.85,"Even if they make that, even if they make that interest clear prior to the stop?"
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2338.85,2343.152,"Yes, I think it would sort of happen instantaneously."
2006.06-8120,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2343.152,2344.421,No.
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2352.325,2356.562,"So they direct their action, they direct their attention at the passenger at the outset."
2006.06-8120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2386.081,2390.366,"It may be that you can walk away, you're not in an enclosed space."
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2409.113,2418.719,"Well, in your hypothetical, Justice Ginsburg, the passenger would not be an innocent passenger and the Court's test presupposes an innocent person."
2006.06-8120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2423.187,2430.36,"So it could be, it could be sometimes the attention is directed at the driver, but that's not always the case."
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2430.36,2437.681,"Again, I... as Justice Souter indicated, I think you have to, you have to break it up."
2006.06-8120,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2454.558,2465.883,"But on your earlier answer to Justice Ginsburg, there's no authority in this Court to say that whether you deem yourself stopped or not depends on whether think you're innocent."
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2468.818,2469.268,That's correct.
2006.06-8120,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2469.268,2470.085,Correct me if I'm wrong.
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2470.085,2470.635,"No, that's correct."
2006.06-8120,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2483.411,2490.998,"Going back to Justice Stevens' question, the passenger knows the minute the red light goes on that the police can either tell them to get out or tell him to stay in."
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2497.569,2514.864,"Well, again I think factually citizens when they encounter police always know... I mean, the policeman in any encounter is armed, is typically armed, and has apparent authority over you."
2006.06-8120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2522.12,2529.356,"Yes, but isn't your case he doesn't in fact have the authority, he has apparent authority, but in this case he has actual authority, not just apparent authority?"
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2529.356,2543.783,"--But Justice Stevens, again I don't think that the reasonable innocent passenger is... this Court has never said it's the reasonable innocent passenger that knows the Supreme Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence by heart."
2006.06-8120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2544.7,2546.652,You're saying he doesn't have actual authority.
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2560.078,2562.614,--I think that is the current state of the law.
2006.06-8120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2564.897,2575.337,"What if I feel, even though that's the current state of the law, I wouldn't think of opening the door and walking away without asking the policeman, do you mind if I open the door and walk away?"
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2580.139,2582.175,"No, I don't think so, Justice Scalia."
2006.06-8120,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2586.043,2590.431,It's not the police who have authority over the passenger; it's the driver.
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2596.835,2598.62,"Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.06-8120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2605.023,2613.462,"So now perhaps I'm having so much difficulty, and maybe others are, because you've actually reached a question of law where facts matter."
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2660.61,2667.514,"I think, Justice Breyer, again I would keep coming back to the Court's consensual encounter jurisprudence."
2006.06-8120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2683.491,2686.677,Maybe we can just pass until the studies are done?
2006.06-8120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2688.76,2692.831,"Mr. Zall, assume, and I--"
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2710.21,2711.043,That's correct.
2006.06-8120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2711.043,2711.46,Okay.
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2713.912,2730.421,"Well, I think that even were this Court to rule that the passenger were subject to a seizure, that the presence of the arrest warrant attenuates any taint and therefore the evidence was... was not suppressible."
2006.06-8120,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2730.421,2740.395,"--Well, maybe our questions took your colleague representing the Petitioner beyond the question presented."
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2753.037,2757.624,"I wouldn't, I wouldn't think there would be a need to send the case back."
2006.06-8120,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2757.824,2762.942,"Well, why, if we have serious doubts whether or not the evidence is suppressible?"
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2769.03,2772.584,--I concede that that's true.
2006.06-8120,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2772.584,2776.219,"While the questions indicate that even if the passenger is detained, who cares, it's a lawful arrest."
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2776.219,2792.295,"Well, I think that because it's fairly clear that the arrest would, would remove the taint from the seizure, that there would be little reason to send the case back to the California Supreme Court."
2006.06-8120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2792.295,2793.913,"Well, that question hasn't been argued here."
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2793.913,2801.234,"Well, I think it's subsumed in the question presented and I think it was raised in our opposition and the parties have briefed it."
2006.06-8120,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2801.234,2818.029,"Well, but there's... you know, our Brown case establishes a multifactor test for determining when the illegal seizure has been attenuated and the Court hasn't applied that, the California Supreme Court hasn't gone through that test in this case."
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2818.029,2837.007,"That is correct, but again I think because the warrant is such a clear intervening circumstance that has nothing to do, you couldn't in any way say it's an exploitation of the, of the illegal stop."
2006.06-8120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2837.007,2840.376,But don't we have two problems if we go to that stage?
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2890.744,2894.613,"Certainly you could take that position, Justice Souter."
2006.06-8120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2907.103,2911.138,But the question that's presented is kind of a standing question.
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2954.215,2956.917,"--Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg, I agree."
2006.06-8120,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2982.968,2985.753,No seizure of a passenger or a driver?
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,2985.753,2986.303,Of anybody.
2006.06-8120,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3061.735,3067.388,What is this period of time that we are talking about when Mr. Brendlin might or might not have felt that he was free to leave?
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,3076.56,3078.362,"That's... that right, Your Honor."
2006.06-8120,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3144.721,3161.516,"Well, it may be that we would say because of the exclusionary rule dynamic, we have very little interest in applying the exclusionary rule to this but I'm not so sure that we should bend the concept of seizure and say that the passenger hasn't been seized."
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,3174.84,3180.578,"Justice Kennedy, I wouldn't think you're distorting the law of seizure by saying the passenger isn't seized."
2006.06-8120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3194.571,3206.295,"Suppose 10 or 20 years ago we had this case and we decided your way and decided passengers are not seized, and then subsequently we had the question of whether an officer could order a passenger out of the car."
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,3225.542,3226.625,Yeah.
2006.06-8120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3245.587,3254.775,"But in most situations where an officer meets a person, unless there is a crime scene or something like that, he can't order them to cross the street or go someplace else, can he?"
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,3257.994,3262.048,But again--
2006.06-8120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3262.048,3263.464,But he can issue orders to passengers even though they are not seized.
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,3263.464,3281.759,"--But Justice Stevens, I think that's because of, the Court recognized in Mimms and in Wilson that there is something inherently dangerous about the traffic stop situation, and there may be weapons in the car that the officer can't see, and so that's why this Court found in Wilson that you could order the--"
2006.06-8120,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3281.759,3284.21,"Yes, but in that case there was a blanket rule."
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,3304.874,3313.111,"--I don't think, Justice Kennedy, that the Court ever indicated that the passenger was seized in Wilson prior to the order out."
2006.06-8120,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3329.322,3329.856,Finish your sentence.
2006.06-8120,1,20440,clifford_e_zall,,3331.306,3338.678,"--the Court just felt that the weighty interest in officer safety justified the order out, regardless of whether the passenger was seized at the outset."
2006.06-8120,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3338.678,3339.745,Thank you Counsel.
2006.06-8120,2,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,3342.297,3344.047,Thank you.
2006.06-8120,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3390.027,3394.663,"So that... so that, still then, it's just begging the question of whether or not his Fourth Amendment rights were violated."
2006.06-8120,2,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,3406.804,3429.217,"--Because Your Honor, this Court has... this Court held in Delaware versus Prouse, the Court recognized the passengers as well as drivers have a liberty interest in free travel on the highways, and because if we look at every case this Court has decided in the last 20 or 30 years regarding when a seizure occurs, the case of a passenger in an auto test... in an auto stop meets the test."
2006.06-8120,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3443.91,3461.355,"What have we done in a case, and maybe we haven't had it, but what have we done in a case where there is a warrantless entry in violation of the Fourth Amendment of somebody's apartment, and there is a suitcase in there that does not belong to the owner of the apartment?"
2006.06-8120,2,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,3469.294,3474.346,"If the person has no expectation of privacy in that suitcase that is correct, Your Honor."
2006.06-8120,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3503.449,3506.901,"Well, but there was only one, there was just the driver in the Brower case."
2006.06-8120,2,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,3506.901,3507.534,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-8120,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3507.534,3508.603,There was no passenger as I recall.
2006.06-8120,2,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,3508.603,3509.386,No.
2006.06-8120,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3515.607,3517.809,"Well, but I mean in the case it's just not directly on point."
2006.06-8120,2,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,3519.792,3520.41,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-8120,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3539.289,3541.424,So that's just another case that doesn't help us.
2006.06-8120,2,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,3541.424,3544.859,"I think it certainly informs the discussion, Your Honor."
2006.06-8120,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3544.859,3558.786,"But what of the question that was raised about well, a passenger is locked in for the moment, but so are all the cars that are backed up behind the car that's been stopped?"
2006.06-8120,2,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,3561.119,3570.058,"In that case, Your Honor, there hasn't been an intentional impeding of those people's free, free movement by the officer."
2006.06-8120,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3625.359,3629.846,The California Supreme Court didn't have to reach that issue because it found there was no seizure.
2006.06-8120,2,22054,elizabeth_m_campbell,,3629.846,3630.029,--No.
2006.06-8120,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3636.081,3636.781,"Thank you, Counsel."
