1990.89-7272,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.057,"We'll hear argument now in No. 89-7272, Ronald Allen Harmelin v. Michigan."
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,10.429,14.161,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-7272,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,61.835,69.999,"Ms. Johnson, does the State allow commutation of sentences by the Governor or something of that sort?"
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,72.352,78.477,"Every State in the Nation has commutation by the Governor for any crime, whether it be a mass murderer or a serial rapist."
1990.89-7272,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,79.325,83.9,Is that ever... is that a provision that is used on occasion in Michigan?
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,83.9,89.466,--It is... it is... it has never been used in a drug offender scenario by our Governor.
1990.89-7272,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,89.466,92.217,Is it used in some circumstances in Michigan?
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,92.217,94.739,It has been used very infrequently in Michigan.
1990.89-7272,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,125.039,135.007,"Well, Ms. Johnson, Solem against Helm was a 5 to 4 decision, and it cut back on Rummel against Estelle, which was also a 5 to 4 decision."
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,143.254,147.579,I don't think that this Court should treat stare decisis too cavalierly.
1990.89-7272,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,147.579,152.841,"Well, do you think they did treat it... how do you think they treated stare decisis in Solem against Helm?"
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,152.841,157.485,I don't think that Solem v. Helm reversed or even narrowed Rummel.
1990.89-7272,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,174.677,177.859,You see no conflict in the reasoning of the cases?
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,183.733,188.186,"--Well, the majority in Solem v. Helm said that there was no conflict."
1990.89-7272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,273.747,274.188,Maybe--
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,274.188,275.139,There is some sort of discretion.
1990.89-7272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,275.139,281.514,--Maybe Michigan has a bigger problem with drugs than Oregon and most of the other States do.
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,288.147,289.519,Yes.
1990.89-7272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,302.028,304.98,And it's a problem that causes the loss of human life.
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,329.17,330.862,--There are a couple answers to that.
1990.89-7272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,373.031,374.713,Most unlikely.
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,382.317,387.71,"--The State didn't prove anything, so my position is that my client has been convicted of mere possession."
1990.89-7272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,387.71,390.674,Of an awfully large quantity of--
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,390.674,392.796,I don't know if it's an awfully large quantity.
1990.89-7272,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,409.319,410.518,--Ms. Johnson--
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,410.518,414.932,"--that would be... in the scheme of things, I am not sure... I am sorry."
1990.89-7272,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,414.932,419.175,--At page 6 of the joint appendix the presentence report is present.
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,435.666,436.777,That is correct.
1990.89-7272,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,450.919,454.679,It just... this doesn't seem to me to rely on the statutory definition.
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,464.906,470.302,--I would... if... if there were a sentencing hearing on this I would object to that language.
1990.89-7272,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,471.671,474.152,We're not talking about a Sixth Amendment case here.
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,488.524,505.687,"--I think you have to take as a fact that that was in the presentence report, but I think you have to take it... you have to realize also that because Michigan doesn't make any... any difference between a major or a minor trafficker... anybody with 650 gets life in prison... it discourages advocacy at the sentencing proceeding."
1990.89-7272,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,513.061,515.034,How do we know that?
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,515.034,519.054,"--I guess we don't know that, and that's the whole point."
1990.89-7272,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,545.186,548.138,I'm a little puzzled.
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,549.169,550.131,That is correct.
1990.89-7272,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,550.131,552.852,"I mean, why would you argue about it before the judge, then?"
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,552.852,554.172,That's my point exactly.
1990.89-7272,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,573.048,582.915,"But you said a moment ago, Ms. Johnson, that you are taking the position your client had only be convicted of possession and that therefore it was at the very bottom end of the scale."
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,585.887,589.169,And my position is that the presentence report is inaccurate.
1990.89-7272,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,604.14,624.692,"Well, wouldn't you, wouldn't you think that if there was clear proof that here was a real drug kingpin, that this mandatory sentence might be constitutional as applied to him, and yet be quite unconstitutional as applied to somebody else, some minor, some person walking across the street as the delivery boy?"
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,628.916,635.621,"--Well, there are some, there are some problems with the over-breadth of the statute and some presumptions in this statute as well."
1990.89-7272,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,641.486,653.495,"Well, would you say, would you say that the statute is necessarily, would necessarily be unconstitutional on its face if this was really a drug kingpin and everybody admitted it?"
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,653.495,654.655,--That would be a closer question.
1990.89-7272,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,657.777,659.347,"Well, how would you answer the close question?"
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,659.347,667.464,--I don't believe that in nondeath cases mandatory life in prison is a constitutional sentence.
1990.89-7272,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,668.175,668.804,For anything?
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,668.804,670.026,--For anything.
1990.89-7272,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,670.707,673.598,You can imagine no crime... how about first degree murder?
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,673.598,675.471,"--Well, that's a non... that's a death case."
1990.89-7272,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,675.471,676.062,"No, no."
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,679.354,680.476,"Well, I am sorry."
1990.89-7272,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,692.504,693.546,"Well, do you have a problem with it?"
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,693.546,694.848,"No, I do not have a problem--"
1990.89-7272,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,694.848,703.593,So that there are some statutes... some crimes that in your view can constitutionally be punished with a mandatory life sentence?
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,703.593,703.883,--Yes.
1990.89-7272,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,705.306,706.986,"All right, so... That's all?"
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,706.986,708.988,In my view.
1990.89-7272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,755.197,772.97,"It's only about a decade or so ago that we found in the Constitution a prohibition on imposing capital punishment for anything except the killing of a human being, and now you say that we also can't impose life... it is also unconstitutional to impose life imprisonment for anything except the taking of a human life."
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,776.362,779.423,"Well, you're... this Court has said that the--"
1990.89-7272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,779.423,785.478,"What, what about 30 years to a 50 year old, or to a 60 year old?"
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,786.98,797.697,"--I think the Court needs to have some sort of discretion to decide whether the person under this statute, whether they are a major or a minor participant, whether they are a first time offender or just a mule of transport."
1990.89-7272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,800.929,809.434,"Well, what do you, what do you do about someone who is not likely to live 35 years, and he gets a mandatory 35 years under a statute?"
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,817.742,825.249,"That would be a close question, but outside the realm of these facts."
1990.89-7272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,825.249,833.043,"Well, I am just, you know, testing what you're... you're asking us to create a new constitutional rule that I have not heard of before."
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,836.485,849.384,"I think there needs to be some sort of discretion to decide... this statute where there is no discretion to decide the culpability of the person, coupled with the mandatory life with no chance of parole ever, is cruel and unusual."
1990.89-7272,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,858.223,870.552,"Well, I thought this Court had made reasonably clear that outside the capital murder context that mandatory sentencing was all right."
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,877.126,877.306,"--Well,--"
1990.89-7272,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,877.306,881.93,That the Constitution requires judicial discretion.
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,891.457,899.233,"--This Court has said that the sentence of death is different in kind, qualitatively different than any other sentence with a length of years."
1990.89-7272,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,939.951,953.012,"Well, and yet you, I thought you said a while ago that, but there are some crimes that, for which a mandatory life sentence without parole is okay?"
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,953.012,953.673,Yes.
1990.89-7272,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,964.723,974.927,"Well, what about some very aggravated recidivist situation, someone who four successive times has committed aggravated rape, or has committed mayhem?"
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,982.513,984.614,I don't know if that would be a violation.
1990.89-7272,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1012.325,1022.079,I am not sure that I understand the principle on which you are distinguishing mandatory life in a homicide case from mandatory life in a nonhomicide case.
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1023.221,1036.06,The principle... I believe that society agrees that the intentional taking of human life is the worst possible crime there is.
1990.89-7272,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1053.143,1057.077,"Yes, but we are dealing here with mandatory life imprisonment."
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1061.34,1064.254,Because mandatory life in prison is death in prison.
1990.89-7272,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1066.025,1067.324,What about--
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1073.368,1076.35,"Well, that is one of the things my argument hinges on."
1990.89-7272,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1076.35,1078.273,"Well, what if... what if we don't accept that?"
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1079.973,1080.945,A couple of things.
1990.89-7272,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1132.531,1137.905,"Ms. Johnson, let me just see if I don't understand what you are trying to say but you haven't quite said it."
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1151.264,1152.276,Yes.
1990.89-7272,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1152.276,1165.303,And therefore it... but the punishment nevertheless is different from all... therefore there may well be a different rule for this category of punishment than there would be for crimes for which death would be a permissible punishment.
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1167.446,1168.375,Yes.
1990.89-7272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1186.938,1192.343,"But we could say in the death penalty cases, as we have many times, that death is different."
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1203.991,1204.96,Life imprisonment--
1990.89-7272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1204.96,1216.199,"How can we say that... I mean, if the criterion is whether you will die in prison, a mandatory life sentence is no different from a mandatory term of years, depending upon the age of the person convicted."
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1216.199,1219.77,"--Well, under a mandatory term of years there is parolability."
1990.89-7272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1222.094,1227.375,"No, I'm positing a mandatory term of years without any good time, without anything else."
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1228.626,1230.339,--Michigan has recently--
1990.89-7272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1230.339,1231.429,That's... is that different too?
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1235.583,1243.029,"--Michigan has recently struck down cases with what they call basketball scores, where people were given 100 to 200 years."
1990.89-7272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1258.999,1260.431,"Well, that may be the case in Michigan."
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1281.079,1282.651,"--Thank you, Justice Stevens."
1990.89-7272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1282.651,1286.443,That's your answer?
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1289.765,1291.477,And an excellent one.
1990.89-7272,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1295.669,1325.659,"You want us to say that the taking of a human life is constitutionally different, and that society could not agree on any other crime that was so close to that that mandatory life in prison is correct, and I, as with some of my colleagues, don't understand the principle for that."
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1356.511,1362.095,"Well, the standard I would propose, of course, is the standard that this Court fashioned in Solem v. Helm, where you would take--"
1990.89-7272,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1362.095,1372.891,"Well, we write... it's just the difference between... I've just pointed out that if you, if you say that this is based on some societal consensus, I have no evidence that that consensus exists."
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1372.891,1391.513,"--I was taking that from the Coker case, where the... this Court said that rape was different than intentional taking of human life, and so the sentence of death was unconstitutional for a person who was convicted of rape."
1990.89-7272,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1439.968,1448.954,"Ms. Johnson, is it true that this hasn't had any effect in cutting down the number of dope cases?"
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1448.954,1454.748,I think the prosecutor in his brief has admitted that the drug problem is getting worse and worse in Michigan.
1990.89-7272,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1455.988,1458.02,So it hasn't had an effect on cutting it down?
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1458.02,1458.471,"--No, it hasn't."
1990.89-7272,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1459.803,1463.095,"Well, it might be even worse if it weren't for this statute."
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1465.096,1470.211,--Every time you put a mule in prison there is someone else to take his place.
1990.89-7272,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1477.206,1479.339,--So deterrence is not a reason for sentencing?
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1479.339,1481.59,--Deterrence is a reason for sentencing.
1990.89-7272,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1482.741,1490.175,"Well, if there is, if there is a mule ready to take their place every time someone is put in prison, then isn't it a plausible answer that more deterrence is needed?"
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1505.667,1509.561,"--Well, most of the people that are taking this, these risks don't even know what the law is."
1990.89-7272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1540.864,1543.257,Apparently the Michigan legislature thought differently.
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1549.782,1570.936,"At the time they passed this law, the... some of the opponents of the law realized that what is in reality happening might happen, that the mules of transport would be hired by the kingpins to carry the drugs, and that perhaps those people who are often drug addicts would end up doing this mandatory life in prison."
1990.89-7272,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1605.284,1618.854,"Ms. Johnson, is there any prosecutorial discretion still in Michigan for whether to prosecute someone for this particular offense, more than 650 grams?"
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1625.118,1630.183,--I think they have a... they have the ability to cut deals with people who cooperate.
1990.89-7272,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1630.183,1636.856,Or just not to charge the full potential offense.
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1637.577,1638.598,"Yes, I think that's true."
1990.89-7272,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1638.598,1646.705,"So, while there may not be judicial discretion, there still is some built in at the charging stage, in effect."
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1646.705,1649.189,"Yes, there is prosecutorial discretion."
1990.89-7272,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1669.264,1675.278,"Ms. Johnson, may I ask you, at the back of your brief you have a discussion of the pros and cons of the legislation."
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1682.114,1682.314,Yes.
1990.89-7272,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1682.314,1684.266,"What... tell me a little bit about that, if you would."
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1684.266,1691.831,The people who were proposing this law thought it would deter crime by putting major traffickers in prison for the rest of their life.
1990.89-7272,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1691.831,1694.833,"No, I know what it says, but I mean what is the... is this an official legislative history in Michigan?"
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1694.833,1694.994,"Yes, yes."
1990.89-7272,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1704.881,1710.166,"So that when it recites that the Office of the Attorney General opposed the legislation, we can count on that as being an official statement?"
1990.89-7272,0,19322,carla_j_johnson,,1710.166,1710.386,Yes.
1990.89-7272,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1720.032,1721.274,"Very well, Ms. Johnson."
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,1723.277,1728.09,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-7272,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1756.493,1760.362,"But Mr. Thompson, it would be the same even if it were diluted, wouldn't it?"
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,1760.362,1761.634,Yes.
1990.89-7272,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1762.305,1765.627,"And so the number of hits that are possible has nothing to do with the sentence, does it?"
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,1765.627,1767.709,"--Well, it has something to do--"
1990.89-7272,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1767.709,1771.331,"I mean, if there is 672 grams, 1 percent cocaine, it would be the same sentence."
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,1771.331,1784.31,"--Yes, if that... that is theoretically possible, but it has something to do about why the State legislature used the 650 gram as the mark off for mandatory life in prison."
1990.89-7272,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1797.3,1799.481,"But you said it, you said it was addictive, that is why they did it."
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,1803.644,1811.671,--It is an addictive drug as far as its psychological and physiological effects has on the person that takes crack cocaine.
1990.89-7272,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1811.671,1813.111,Is that in the legislative history?
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,1813.111,1815.124,"No, Your Honor, it's not."
1990.89-7272,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1815.124,1815.863,It's just the opposite in the legislative history.
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,1817.556,1825.943,"The law enforcement lab people who are experienced in this, the professionals that handle this, indicate it is a highly addictive drug."
1990.89-7272,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1852.123,1855.856,It is no more official than your reference to this general understanding about--
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,1855.856,1857.138,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-7272,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1858.528,1881.204,"--Given the fact that the 650 grams could be diluted down, as Justice Stevens said, isn't the real point of the 650-point cut off not so much to identify the seriousness of the specific offense, because he could be selling the... the person possessing could be possessing something greatly diluted."
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,1899.447,1906.63,"Yes, Your Honor, that was a legislative inference I think they made when they decided that cut off, that 650 grams."
1990.89-7272,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1923.023,1927.898,Is there a separate State offense for possession with intent to distribute?
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,1927.898,1932.37,"--There... it is a separate State offense, Your Honor, but the penalties are the same."
1990.89-7272,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1932.37,1940.816,"And here the offense charged and for which the conviction was obtained was mere possession, not possession with intent to distribute?"
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,1940.816,1941.396,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-7272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1948.863,1952.676,"Which would... which would import the same penalty, life."
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,1952.676,1966.365,"Which would import the same penalty, life, but there we would have a different element, an additional element that we would have to prove, which we could have in this case, but which we felt not necessary and not prudent to make it more difficult for us to win a prosecution."
1990.89-7272,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1966.365,1968.216,Could you have proved it with a lesser quantity?
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,1974.731,1977.002,"That would be a lesser penalty on that, Your Honor."
1990.89-7272,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1981.085,1987.449,But if we're dealing with 650 the penalty is the same whether it is mere possession or possession with intent to distribute?
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,1987.449,1988.1,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-7272,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1991.002,1992.604,What's the basis for the distinction then?
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,1992.604,1996.708,--The legislature just developed two laws.
1990.89-7272,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2019.104,2020.994,"But let, let me go back to my example."
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2034.412,2034.963,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-7272,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2034.963,2042.74,"Well, that pretty much destroys the suggestion I made a moment ago, doesn't it, that the real point of the law was to identify these people?"
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2051.795,2061.463,"I think that, not trying to read what the legislature was thinking when they did that, there is no difference as far as the penalty goes."
1990.89-7272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2074.335,2076.045,How did these two statutes come to be?
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2084.474,2084.955,"No, Your Honor."
1990.89-7272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2099.956,2116.258,"And you say that they enacted simultaneously two statutes, one of which says you get life for possessing 650 grams with intent to distribute, and in addition, at the same time, the same legislature drafted another statute that said you get 650 for possessing 650... or you get--"
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2116.258,2117.029,It was a part of the same act.
1990.89-7272,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2137.822,2148.341,"--Mr. Thompson, now suppose there is a grandmother that is keeping a suitcase for her grandson, who is the mule, and it contains cocaine."
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2156.368,2156.648,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.89-7272,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2178.222,2184.177,"The grandson says I hate to tell you this, grandmother, it's cocaine, keep it for me for the weekend."
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2186.648,2202.089,"--Your Honor, if we had... if the prosecutor had that kind of information, there is that prosecutorial discretion that could be exercised in deciding whether you are going to charge the grandmother or whether you are going to use the grandmother to testify against the--"
1990.89-7272,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2202.089,2204.48,And would that be... would that be exercising the interest of justice?
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2204.48,2212.407,"--I can't give a definite yes or no on that, Your Honor, because I can see circumstances where--"
1990.89-7272,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2212.407,2216.187,Discretion by the prosecutor would be exercised in some cases in the interest of justice.
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2216.187,2216.378,--Yes.
1990.89-7272,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2217.048,2226.215,"So that this statutory scheme does permit an exception in the occasional case in the interest of justice by the prosecutor, but not by the judge?"
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2226.215,2229.337,There are checks and balances.
1990.89-7272,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2244.367,2255.837,"--So, the point is you think this is an element in defending the statute, that there is a grounds in some cases not to impose the full sentence."
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2260.291,2268.627,"There... we'll always have... if I understand your question or your statement, we always have discretion in the system someplace."
1990.89-7272,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2276.493,2276.851,But then--
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2276.851,2279.154,--we are going to eliminate that discretion from the court.
1990.89-7272,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2279.154,2290.624,"--Mr. Thompson, supposing the statute... the legislature passed a statute and said it shall be mandatory duty of the prosecutor to prosecute to the full extent of the law because this problem is so serious, we've got to get these people off the street."
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2297.658,2301.621,"Well, the prosecutor has, the prosecutor must enforce the law."
1990.89-7272,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2301.621,2301.992,Right.
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2301.992,2304.293,And in Michigan if there is--
1990.89-7272,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2304.293,2309.588,"I find it surprising that you defend the law on the ground that the prosecutor might ignore it, which is what you are saying."
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2309.588,2311.579,"--The prosecutor does not ignore it, Your Honor."
1990.89-7272,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2318.154,2320.914,Do you think that is essential to sustain the constitutionality of this law?
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2320.914,2321.485,"No, Your Honor."
1990.89-7272,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2321.485,2326.63,Do you think the law would be equally constitutional if instead of 650 grams it was 50 grams?
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2326.63,2327.819,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-7272,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2327.819,2330.971,"So... it's a very simple case, then."
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2330.971,2332.884,"In my view it is, Your Honor."
1990.89-7272,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2348.726,2356.092,"Is it correct that for this kind of sentence, unlike most others, the... there is no interest in rehabilitation to justify the punishment?"
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2357.912,2359.504,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-7272,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2370.723,2375.487,"Well, on the deterrence point, what about those 1,200 that are in prison now?"
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2375.487,2384.043,"The... we have in prison right now 123 individuals charged and convicted under this act, Your Honor."
1990.89-7272,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2388.565,2393.67,"Is there any evidence that all of them knew of this sentence, of this law?"
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2393.67,2396.052,"--Your Honor, it would be merely speculation on my part."
1990.89-7272,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2397.792,2402.646,"And in this case, any evidence that this petitioner knew of the law?"
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2402.646,2404.536,"--I don't know, Your Honor."
1990.89-7272,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2428.234,2429.345,"Mr. Thompson, I just don't understand this."
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2435.772,2439.175,"--Well, I was responding to the question of what is in--"
1990.89-7272,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2439.175,2440.367,"I know, I'm not criticizing your response."
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2444.611,2445.012,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.89-7272,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2445.012,2450.478,Was it at the sentencing hearing that the Eighth Amendment issue was raised?
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2450.478,2451.036,"No, Your Honor."
1990.89-7272,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2451.036,2452.378,When was that raised?
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2452.378,2455.811,"It was at the appeals level, the first appeal... the court of appeals."
1990.89-7272,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2459.453,2459.781,Okay.
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2459.781,2464.936,"--it was a trial by a judge, and the only questions there were search-and-seizure questions."
1990.89-7272,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2469.661,2479.488,At any point was a request made to supplement the record with evidence that might be relevant to the Eighth Amendment issue beyond what was already in the record?
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2479.488,2480.948,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1990.89-7272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2545.381,2555.817,"Mr. Thompson, in addition to the fact that the Governor can grant clemency to this... I gather you agree that the Governor could--"
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2555.817,2556.017,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-7272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2556.017,2558.158,--grant clemency if he wishes.
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2576.621,2579.325,The Michigan legislature could do that.
1990.89-7272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2591.064,2602.364,"So, so we, we could wait several years to see if the Michigan legislature really believes this things works, and if it doesn't they might well repeal it and reduce the sentences meted out under it?"
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2602.364,2608.168,"--Your Honor, the Michigan legislature has twice visited this law since it was adopted in 1978."
1990.89-7272,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2627.078,2628.981,I wonder if there was an intervening election.
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2632.033,2632.451,I don't know.
1990.89-7272,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2774.396,2777.609,What... do you have any figures to back you up?
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2777.609,2780.062,I have--
1990.89-7272,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2780.062,2780.671,You've said--
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2780.671,2787.747,"--not a part of the record, Your Honor, but the Michigan State Police in their annual report indicated that it does have a deterrent--"
1990.89-7272,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2787.747,2790.188,--I don't want... I don't want anything outside the record.
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2791.4,2791.79,--Okay.
1990.89-7272,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2794.264,2796.154,I assumed that what you tell me is in the record.
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2796.154,2796.895,"No, Your Honor."
1990.89-7272,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2796.895,2809.901,And you haven't told me a crying thing about the fact that it... the crime of selling drugs has dropped off since this statute was passed.
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2809.901,2811.654,That is correct.
1990.89-7272,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2818.92,2821.812,But you don't know anything about what's happened.
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2821.812,2826.196,--Not regarding the impact of a particular statute--
1990.89-7272,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2826.196,2826.416,Right.
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2826.416,2829.667,--with the entire drug distribution sea out there.
1990.89-7272,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2830.568,2831.68,You don't know anything about that part.
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2831.68,2835.48,"We don't, and it would be very difficult to develop a scientific study about that."
1990.89-7272,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2835.48,2836.622,"Well, what in the world are you arguing about?"
1990.89-7272,1,40651,richard_thompson,,2836.622,2842.445,Because the purpose... the purpose of this statute was deterrence.
