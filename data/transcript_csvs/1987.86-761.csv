1987.86-761,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.67,"We'll hear argument next in No. 86-761, Cynthia Forrester versus Howard Lee White."
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,74.001,76.969,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-761,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,401.727,404.836,What would happen if the judge fired his clerk?
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,407.945,414.349,"--It's our opinion, Your Honor, that it would not be, because it is not an act of adjudication."
1987.86-761,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,414.349,416.675,"Well, suppose he fired his law clerk."
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,419.721,423.767,"Under the Seventh Circuit's opinion, that would be a judicial act."
1987.86-761,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,435.73,443.117,"Well, suppose the judge fired his assistant, his chauffeur?"
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,445.508,447.585,"Well, the Seventh Circuit's opinion would say--"
1987.86-761,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,447.585,448.444,I'm not talking about that.
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,449.552,459.268,"--All right, that would be an administrative act, not an act of adjudication because it doesn't arise out of any kind of matter before the judge."
1987.86-761,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,459.268,466.405,Suppose he appoints a master to hear the case and fires him.
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,468.577,476.213,I think it would depend on how the attack was made on the firing of the master.
1987.86-761,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,478.29,481.258,"Well, if the master happened to be a woman, would that be enough?"
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,481.258,490.317,"--The fact that she was a woman would not be enough, no, Your Honor."
1987.86-761,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,490.317,491.942,"You need more than that, don't you?"
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,491.942,493.144,I think we do.
1987.86-761,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,493.144,495.41,And where is that here?
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,495.41,499.595,What we have here is an action under Section 1983.
1987.86-761,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,499.595,506.609,That doesn't mean... you can assert anything in a pleading.
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,526.49,531.27,"Everything that this woman did, assisted the judge--"
1987.86-761,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,531.27,535.565,"Well, isn't assisting the judge judicial?"
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,535.565,546.654,"--She was assisting the judge in carrying out his judicial functions, but the judge's decision to terminate her was not judicial, it was administrative."
1987.86-761,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,566.334,570.066,"May I give you another example, somewhat like Justice Marshall's, I guess."
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,593.697,600.381,"I believe she would, because I believe that that's a decision about assigning work, which is a personnel decision."
1987.86-761,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,615.251,628.559,"Supposing in a multi-judge appellate court, one of the judges didn't like his opinion assignments, and he claimed that the chief judge was just assigning him because he didn't like his religion or his race or his sex."
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,629.777,646.597,"In theory, I believe that that judge would have a claim, because again, with regard to that judge's work assignment, it is essentially a personnel decision, an administrative decision of the chief judge to assign certain work to that individual."
1987.86-761,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,657.874,658.577,I understand that.
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,658.577,661.763,"--viz a viz the litigant, it's an act of adjudication."
1987.86-761,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,726.113,732.922,"Well, let me interrupt you for just a minute, Ms. Sedey, if I may, to follow up on some of the earlier questions."
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,771.406,791.024,"--I think it is because it arises in connection with the judge carrying out his judicial function, the function of adjudication, which is a different matter I think than the matter of an employment decision to hire, fire, demote, whatever, which I believe is a different kind of an act."
1987.86-761,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,791.024,793.163,"Of course, your argument is still the same."
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,799.942,812.875,"Well, for instance, I don't think that a litigant who felt that a judge was discriminating between two different litigants in similar law suits could bring an action attacking the judge's decision in her case."
1987.86-761,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,812.875,813.451,"No, that's pretty clear."
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,813.451,813.92,Right.
1987.86-761,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,813.92,818.497,"Could I ask you, what if the suit were brought against the clerk?"
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,850.327,854.827,"Is it by a litigant, somebody who complains about the kind of advice?"
1987.86-761,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,854.827,854.951,Yes.
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,854.951,872.849,"Then I believe that the probation officer would have derivative judicial immunity to suit by a litigant who was unhappy about the advice that she was giving the judge in connection with decisions about say probation or sentencing, that kind of thing."
1987.86-761,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,872.849,879.582,But the judge doesn't have absolute immunity when he fires her?
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,879.582,880.66,That's correct.
1987.86-761,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,881.893,882.581,Does he have any immunity?
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,882.581,900.668,"--I think he has qualified immunity exactly the same as any other governmental official would have with respect to administrative acts, in other words, qualified good faith immunity similar to that provided to every governmental official."
1987.86-761,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,900.668,906.227,"Ms. Sedey, I'm not sure I understood your response to the Chief Justice's hypothetical."
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,929.828,931.124,Yes.
1987.86-761,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,955.896,967.314,"What's the magic about it, that it is a contempt order, and therefore itself a judicial act, or rather that it is a contempt order issued in connection with another judicial proceeding?"
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,967.314,968.392,"Exactly, the fact that--"
1987.86-761,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,968.392,968.625,The latter?
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,968.625,983.01,"--The latter, the fact that it's a contempt order issued in connection with a judicial proceeding, rather than an administrative personnel decision issued in the judge's capacity as the employer to discharge the employee."
1987.86-761,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,983.01,994.489,"So having held her in contempt, if he should fire this contemptuous clerk, would there be a cause of action for that firing?"
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,994.489,995.551,"Yes, I believe there would be."
1987.86-761,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,995.551,997.645,"There would be, so he could hold her in contempt but couldn't fire her?"
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,997.645,998.815,That's correct.
1987.86-761,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1000.409,1008.984,What if he fired her and truthfully said the reason I'm firing you is because I don't retain people whom I've had to hold in contempt?
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,1008.984,1013.684,"Then, Justice, I would say that he has a good defense to the law suit."
1987.86-761,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1066.24,1068.068,"No, but here, we're talking about money damages?"
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,1068.068,1069.677,"--We are, that's correct."
1987.86-761,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1091.56,1092.871,What would the judge have to do?
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,1094.902,1096.042,No.
1987.86-761,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1104.976,1108.38,"That's this case, I'm talking about this case here?"
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,1108.38,1109.287,Right.
1987.86-761,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1109.287,1114.925,What could he have done in this situation that would have satisfied you?
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,1114.925,1121.923,He could have fired her if he had a legitimate reason not based on her sex.
1987.86-761,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1121.923,1123.796,"No, you know that's not my question."
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,1129.966,1139.649,"He could put on a defense to her law suit that said that it wasn't discrimination, and that's what he did here."
1987.86-761,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1141.368,1143.226,And that's all he can do?
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,1143.226,1144.398,That's correct.
1987.86-761,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1144.398,1146.928,He has no protection at all?
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,1146.928,1150.238,He has the same protection that any other--
1987.86-761,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1150.238,1160.687,"Suppose the probation officer's a man and punches the judge in the mouth, what could the judge do then?"
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,1160.687,1166.966,"--Well, I think the judge could discharge that individual regardless of their sex?"
1987.86-761,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1166.966,1168.419,He could?
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,1168.419,1169.028,Absolutely.
1987.86-761,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1169.028,1171.106,"Oh, he can get some relief sometimes."
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,1173.464,1177.056,The difference between that case and this case is that in this case--
1987.86-761,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1177.056,1178.072,She didn't punch him in the mouth.
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,1178.072,1179.821,--that's right.
1987.86-761,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1179.821,1181.086,That's the difference.
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,1181.086,1182.539,That's one of the differences.
1987.86-761,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1197.721,1201.72,"So then you come back that if this were a man, he wouldn't have any cause of action?"
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,1201.72,1203.343,No.
1987.86-761,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1203.343,1206.092,But he has a cause of action if he's a woman.
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,1207.123,1212.574,"No, because a man has a cause of action for sex discrimination, just like a woman has."
1987.86-761,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1212.574,1213.387,In this case?
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,1213.387,1215.963,"In any case, certainly."
1987.86-761,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1227.35,1252.387,"Well, if there's qualified immunity in this case which you concede there is to hold the judge liable for damages, it would have to be found that he had to know that he was firing for sex discrimination, because of gender."
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,1252.387,1253.558,No.
1987.86-761,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1254.714,1258.259,"Or that he... well, what do you think the test is for qualified immunity?"
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,1258.259,1271.052,"--I think that the qualified immunity would simply provide him with an opportunity to say that he didn't realize that the conduct that he's charged with violated a statute, and I don't really think it would do him much good."
1987.86-761,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1277.563,1286.452,It would be of some assistance to someone in the Seventh Circuit from the time the Seventh Circuit decided this case until if we came out with a different decision?
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,1286.452,1288.044,"That's exactly correct, it would."
1987.86-761,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1288.044,1299.899,Some administrative acts are so closely connected to the adjudicatory function that immunity would attach?
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,1331.104,1335.791,I think that that litigant could not bring a suit in connection with that decision.
1987.86-761,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1335.791,1338.617,"But that's an administrative decision, isn't it?"
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,1338.617,1348.988,"But viz a viz the litigant, it's a judicial act, it's an act connected with the proceedings that the litigant is involved in."
1987.86-761,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1348.988,1354.409,"I see, so you'd allow the litigant to sue, but you would not allow the judge who had been assigned to sue, is that right?"
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,1354.409,1358.439,I would not allow the litigant to sue because of judicial immunity.
1987.86-761,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1358.439,1360.095,I'm sorry.
1987.86-761,0,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,1365.343,1385.147,"That's correct, because viz a viz the judge whose unhappy about the assignment, there's nothing going on with regard to her that has to do with the adjudication of any particular controversy, it's simply an administrative decision to assign her work which she believes was made on the basis of her sex."
1987.86-761,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1397.283,1410.34,"You may proceed, Ms. Kaplan."
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,1410.34,1413.744,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-761,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1488.325,1504.349,"What about a United States attorney who fires an assistant United States attorney on the claimed ground that the person's incompetent, but the individual fired claims that it was because of sex discrimination?"
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,1504.349,1515.188,The immunity that would be addressed there would likely be an executive type of immunity and the considerations are going to have to be different accordingly.
1987.86-761,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1515.188,1515.532,Why?
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,1525.73,1544.129,"To the extent that Your Honor is talking about the quasi judicial immunity that's extended to a prosecutor in connection with prosecutorial decisions and he has to address a situation where his employee is assisting him in making discretionary decisions, I would agree that the same analysis would apply."
1987.86-761,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1565.855,1574.493,So assistant U.S. attorneys can be fired without being liable for suits.
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,1574.493,1580.068,To the extent that assistant U.S. attorneys are engaged in the same discretionary function.
1987.86-761,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1580.068,1582.051,"I don't know what you mean by, to the extent that."
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,1595.64,1596.296,Yes.
1987.86-761,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1617.413,1620.675,Let me just pursue Justice Scalia's example a little further.
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,1631.719,1633.156,"--Certainly, it could be challenged, Your Honor."
1987.86-761,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1643.34,1646.338,But to be challenged in an injunction suit is the only you could do it?
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,1646.338,1647.166,Could be that way.
1987.86-761,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1648.462,1657.083,"So then what he does, he just says, I'll repeal that policy, then he just continues along doing exactly the same thing, and he couldn't be--"
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,1657.083,1662.02,"--Your Honor, he could be disciplined internally as a prosecutor."
1987.86-761,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1679.544,1684.245,--Are you saying that this particular plaintiff could bring an action for reinstatement and get her job back?
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,1684.245,1690.179,--An equitable action has been allowed by this Court under Pulliam v. Allen.
1987.86-761,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1696.333,1700.051,If she proved that the only reason for the discharge was this sex discrimination?
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,1700.051,1703.939,--I believe that would however pose another difficulty.
1987.86-761,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1722.823,1730.819,"But you answer on my male whites only prosecutor was well, he could get equitable relief, but now you're saying, well we can't give that either."
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,1730.819,1737.661,I don't know that each assistant prosecutor would work so closely with the United States Attorney.
1987.86-761,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1737.661,1746.516,"Well, say you had right before the change of Administration, you had five women and five black assistant prosecutors and ten whites."
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,1754.294,1755.81,"No, Your Honor, I'm sorry."
1987.86-761,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1768.96,1770.397,"Well, why wouldn't it lie here?"
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,1771.834,1786.516,I'd like to distinguish that on the basis of the close and personal relationship in a very small office in a county court where there is a judge working closely with one probation officer and all of those functions are performed together.
1987.86-761,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1790.936,1795.84,"So if it was Cook County instead of where the case arose, you have a whole lot of probation officers, then you could grant equitable relief?"
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,1795.84,1797.918,I think that perhaps equitable relief would lie.
1987.86-761,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1799.792,1808.601,"If that's true, how does that really solve the problem that the Immunity Doctrine's supposed to solve in part of avoiding a lot of law suits and not tying up the judge's time."
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,1819.267,1821.783,I think that's a possibility.
1987.86-761,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1992.682,2001.304,"May I ask, because as I understood... the Seventh Circuit opinions a little hard for me to know just where they draw the line between this kind of immunity."
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,2008.8,2018.282,"I think that the Seventh Circuit's opinion would apply very likely to an individual like a law clerk, and perhaps to a staff attorney in certain courts."
1987.86-761,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2136.343,2142.481,What if there are several judges in a certain place and there's a chief judge.
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,2168.392,2178.92,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe that that judge is absolutely immune because he is assisting the decision making process, I would assume, in firing a probation officer if that is his responsibility."
1987.86-761,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2181.403,2185.043,"Well, that's quite a different rationale than you just stated awhile ago--"
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,2185.043,2189.135,"--Your Honor, I'm proposing a rationale--"
1987.86-761,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2189.135,2196.757,"--On that basis, I would think you would say that he should be absolutely immune for firing his secretary."
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,2196.757,2203.472,--The secretary does not contribute to the decision making process and the probation officer does.
1987.86-761,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2203.472,2208.486,The secretary doesn't participate in the... who types the opinion?
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,2208.486,2212.297,"I think that, Your Honor, is not a discretionary function."
1987.86-761,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2222.325,2229.29,What if the judge used his secretary to do legal research for him and analyze the record and check citations.
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,2234.694,2250.485,"I think that that could change the decision, Your Honor, because it sounds to me as if you're describing a situation of someone whose more like a paralegal assistant, than simply a secretary who is engaged in what you might call more ministerial type functions, as the Court has recognized a distinction there."
1987.86-761,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2250.485,2271.023,"The line you're asking us to draw, as the last few questions indicate, really requires very specific inquiry into the character of the particular individual involved, as opposed to the line which your opponent would draw, which is one that can be drawn sitting back in an armchair and just thinking about the function involved."
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,2282.223,2289.172,"I think that as the reasoning of the Seventh Circuit is applied, that the line is going to become rather clear."
1987.86-761,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2292.28,2296.279,Depends on how you use your secretary as your response to Justice Stevens just indicated.
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,2296.279,2296.903,"Yes, again."
1987.86-761,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2305.696,2308.414,"Yes, but I think you've overlooked a point Justice Scalia just made."
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,2326.172,2334.826,"I think that in most cases, Your Honor, a very limited inquiry based on the kind of job description of the individual should be sufficient."
1987.86-761,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2431.944,2441.58,You mean probation officers have been granted absolute immunity as against a suit by disappointed prisoners?
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,2441.58,2443.346,"Yes, Your Honor, that is what I mean."
1987.86-761,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2603.733,2610.075,"Ms. Kaplan, excuse me for interrupting again, but your opponent relies heavily on Ex Parte Virginia."
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,2619.93,2642.203,"--In Ex Parte Virginia, the Court ruled on two alternative bases, and this Court has since recognized that it did not hold necessarily that a ministerial act was involved, but that if the act were ministerial or judicial, nonetheless, the judge in question could be held liable under the criminal civil rights laws."
1987.86-761,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2677.875,2680.483,The work of a juror certainly is not ministerial.
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,2680.483,2682.67,"I would agree with that, Your Honor."
1987.86-761,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2707.393,2711.768,The point is that it didn't look into what jurors do.
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,2739.585,2754.329,"--Well, Your Honor, I believe that there is discretion involved, that is, to the extent that a judge must utilize his own judicial skills in evaluating the work of the employee that he has selected to help engage in those skills."
1987.86-761,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2807.575,2828.05,"You think it makes any difference that in the case of legislators, there's the speech and debate clause which expressly provides privilege in the Constitution, whereas the immunity for judges is judicially created?"
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,2828.05,2830.158,"No, Your Honor, I do not."
1987.86-761,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2905.065,2906.19,What about the executive process?
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,2912.203,2917.107,--This Court did hold that there was absolute immunity in Nixon v. Fitzgerald for the President.
1987.86-761,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2917.107,2918.279,Anybody else?
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,2918.279,2927.557,And it did not decide whether his assistants in Harlow v. Fitzgerald might be entitled to absolute immunity for the same sort of decision.
1987.86-761,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2929.415,2930.524,But certainly not a cabinet secretary?
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,2930.524,2932.148,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-761,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2942.675,2945.252,Wider than a cabinet secretary's?
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,2945.252,2950.25,"--This Court I believe has so held, Your Honor, yes, that the judicial--"
1987.86-761,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2950.25,2970.132,"Don't you think it has more to do, as Judge Posner's dissent suggested, that if there is a distinction between let's say a cabinet secretary and a judge, that what it comes to is a judge is more likely to be sued by a litigant than a cabinet secretary, personally, you know, to be sued personally for alleged malfeasance than a cabinet secretary is?"
1987.86-761,1,39698,rosalyn_b_kaplan,,2977.333,2979.941,"--I agree that that is one reason for immunity, yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-761,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3076.012,3077.855,"Thank you, Ms. Kaplan."
1987.86-761,2,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,3081.291,3082.961,Thank you.
1987.86-761,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3261.014,3265.778,Do you think you could have gotten an injunction for reinstatement here?
1987.86-761,2,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,3265.778,3268.792,"We requested reinstatement in this case, Justice White."
1987.86-761,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3272.432,3274.103,"Just for lack of equity, I suppose."
1987.86-761,2,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,3274.103,3274.774,That's correct.
1987.86-761,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3282.523,3286.332,Suppose there had been a reinstatement with back pay.
1987.86-761,2,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,3292.048,3295.234,"The back pay was approximately $26,000."
1987.86-761,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3306.028,3310.135,"And the jury awarded the damages, I take it?"
1987.86-761,2,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,3310.135,3310.963,That is correct.
1987.86-761,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3310.963,3318.258,And is there any provision for the judge to be reimbursed by the state or by the county or?
1987.86-761,2,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,3318.258,3326.754,"In fact, there is an indemnification statute in Illinois and Judge White would never have paid one penny of that monetary award."
1987.86-761,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3330.144,3344.309,"Well, so you think the situation is just as though the State said, well we know there's a policy about immunity that the Supreme Court will protect our State officers, but we don't want protection for our State officers, for our Judges."
1987.86-761,2,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,3357.741,3363.379,A State could make that choice to not indemnify judges against these kinds of suits.
1987.86-761,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3363.379,3364.176,"Yes, yes."
1987.86-761,2,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,3374.157,3375.375,That's correct.
1987.86-761,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3375.375,3379.873,Which is what you think should be the case here?
1987.86-761,2,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,3379.873,3381.045,That's correct.
1987.86-761,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3419.092,3423.949,"I hate to get on this point, but 1983 didn't apply to women."
1987.86-761,2,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,3423.949,3444.143,1983 provides a general remedy for various kinds of violations of constitutional rights and this Court has certainly found in the interim that 1983 can be used to attack sex discrimination in employment.
1987.86-761,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3444.143,3449.829,"Just out of curiosity, does Illinois provide indemnification for any of its other public officials, or just judges?"
1987.86-761,2,36709,mary_anne_sedey,,3449.829,3450.454,Yes.
1987.86-761,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3456.796,3458.796,"Thank you, Ms. Sedey."
