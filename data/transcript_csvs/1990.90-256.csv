1990.90-256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.307,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-256, G. Russell Chambers v. NASCO."
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,49.074,55.929,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,151.69,167.942,"Well, Mr. Barham, does Louisiana recognize any inherent right of a trial court judge to impose sanctions on parties for conduct of litigation?"
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,167.942,181.97,"--The only ones, Your Honor, are the ones that are in the higher tiers, like contempt, those kind of inherent powers which have, as, you know, generally across the country they have been put into legislative form."
1990.90-256,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,196.729,212.95,"So, so if an attorney knowingly introduced perjured testimony or falsified documents in a Louisiana State court, the Louisiana State court could impose monetary sanctions?"
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,212.95,228.37,"The Louisiana State court could, under its, the fact that all lawyers are in an integrated bar and therefore the court rules the lawyers, they could take care of the lawyers under that power that's given to them as a court."
1990.90-256,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,239.737,248.032,"Well, but they could impose monetary sanctions, I take it, measured by the amount of the attorneys' fees incurred by the injured party, under your--"
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,248.032,248.964,We have no cases--
1990.90-256,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,248.964,251.996,--under your first inherent power explanation?
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,251.996,262.853,"--Under the, under the contempt... I don't believe, I don't believe Louisiana has that power."
1990.90-256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,286.039,289.969,"Well, this case, of course, was tried in Federal court."
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,289.969,290.44,--Yes.
1990.90-256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,292.571,293.122,Right.
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,302.779,303.63,No.
1990.90-256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,324.892,338.714,"Well, haven't we said in Alyeska and Roadway effectively that a Federal court has inherent power to impose monetary sanctions for bad faith litigation in its court?"
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,338.714,346.387,--But you have also said very clearly in Alyeska that not for that... not in diversity.
1990.90-256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,348.588,351.339,"You mean footnote, the footnote, the famous footnote?"
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,351.339,351.98,--Yes.
1990.90-256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,351.98,356.654,"Well, aren't you reading something into that footnote that might not be there?"
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,356.654,373.035,"Well, I read it as in an ordinary diversity case where the State law does not run counter to a valid Federal statute or rule of court, a State denying the right to attorneys' fees, which reflects a substantial policy of the State, should be followed."
1990.90-256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,373.035,390.255,"Well, why doesn't that just mean in an ordinary fee shifting situation where you have to determine whether a cause of action carries with it fee shifting in attorneys' fees, and the State doesn't allow it, we're not going to impose it in Federal court sitting in diversity."
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,404.865,422.366,"Well, may it please Your Honor, it is a footnote to an exception to the general American rule against fee shifting, which is the bad faith exception, which means bad faith, vexatious conduct, during litigation."
1990.90-256,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,442.391,451.517,"Mr. Barham, in a diversity case suppose a lawyer was in obvious contempt of the court."
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,459.371,460.142,No.
1990.90-256,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,473.58,485.067,"But isn't it true that once the lawyer is in the Federal court, his conduct is controlled by Federal and not State?"
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,486.569,488.16,The conduct--
1990.90-256,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,488.16,489.171,His conduct--
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,489.171,490.182,--Yes.
1990.90-256,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,490.182,491.914,--in the presence of the Federal court.
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,491.914,493.825,"I would have to agree, it is."
1990.90-256,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,494.616,495.105,Thank you.
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,495.105,505.613,In this case the... we went through the merit trial.
1990.90-256,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,696.487,716.081,"Suppose that, suppose, Mr. Barham, that there was a Federal statute which said that in diversity cases the Federal court has inherent power to impose... to shift attorneys' fees as a sanction for bad faith conduct during trial."
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,717.781,724.346,"That's what you were kind of considering yesterday, and we got copies of this opinion."
1990.90-256,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,732.36,736.074,"Well, it's an Erie case, diversity--"
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,736.074,740.147,--It's an Erie case whether it's under the rule or whether it's under a statute or what.
1990.90-256,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,740.147,741.918,"--[inaudible] it's a diversity case, I'd say--"
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,741.918,742.729,"Yes, sir."
1990.90-256,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,742.729,743.638,--It's a diversity case.
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,750.093,752.623,"Yes, sir."
1990.90-256,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,759.939,771.707,"Well, of course, the famous footnote in Alyeska said that where a State law that does not run counter to a valid Federal statute, then all this follows."
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,782.393,786.757,"I think that's what you would have to, to look to, and I don't believe you would hold that valid."
1990.90-256,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,790.709,794.851,"Well, you would, you would if you thought it was just a procedural housekeeping matter."
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,794.851,804.579,"--Well, procedural housekeeping is hardly what you said is applicable to fee shifting when that's State policy."
1990.90-256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,822.939,835.528,"What, Mr. Barham, if the court had simply held your client in contempt and fined him this amount of money, and said I'm going to fine you an amount equivalent to the attorneys' fees?"
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,835.528,838.66,"If you pay that into the court, I only can question the amount."
1990.90-256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,838.66,840.493,But what is--
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,840.493,842.433,I can't question your power.
1990.90-256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,842.433,851.048,"--And what... even if... what if it were done as a form of civil contempt, where you would presumably pay the money to the other side?"
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,851.048,873.733,"If it's under contempt, I don't know that what... I'm not sure that I could agree that I would, I would not have to argue against that."
1990.90-256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,893.717,906.134,"This isn't fee shifting, as I understand what the Fifth Circuit did here, or the district court, simply because you have lost a case, in the English tradition of fee shifting."
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,914.269,921.173,"Well, it's also outcome involved because only the loser is going to get this fee shift."
1990.90-256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,922.335,927.188,"Yes, but the great majority of losers won't get it, only losers who behave the way your client did."
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,927.188,932.982,"Well, but it does run counter to that outcome look under Erie."
1990.90-256,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,932.982,935.553,"Why, why is it that only the loser will ever get it?"
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,940.956,941.718,I don't believe you can shift--
1990.90-256,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,941.718,954.126,"--could have been so... could have had such outrageous conduct that the court can... which causes additional expenses to the other side, even though he wins, and the court can say, you know, in the course of getting there you violated the rules?"
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,954.126,960.631,"--That is not the concept of the equity power, the equity inherent power for shifting fees."
1990.90-256,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,969.356,973.527,"But as the Chief Justice suggested, maybe we're not talking about that power."
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,980.223,998.034,"If you don't use one of the rule powers, which are so numerous now and cover every piece of conduct... in fact despite the statement by the court, if you read what he enumerates is the conduct, it could have been sanctioned at the time under Rule 11, but--"
1990.90-256,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,998.034,1000.735,What if Rule 11 only applies to signed pleadings?
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1004.048,1014.666,"--Well, almost... litigation begins, proceeds, the discovery, everything is... was signed pleadings in this case as in every other case."
1990.90-256,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1014.666,1018.187,Your only complaint is that it was shifting of a fee.
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1023.48,1026.432,"I would be complaining, but if you did it under your--"
1990.90-256,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1026.432,1029.396,"But I mean, what's the magic of shifting fees?"
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1033.538,1037.451,--There is a general American rule which says it is wrong to shift fees.
1990.90-256,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1037.451,1048.205,"Well, if you give the same amount of money, and says in the order this is not a shifting of fee, would you have a complaint?"
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1048.205,1057.022,If... if it's going to be contempt--
1990.90-256,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1057.022,1074.805,"If the fee is $15,000, and the court says for the harm that you have done by your misconduct you must pay $15,000, but this is not a shift in the fees, would you be complaining?"
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1074.805,1076.537,--Is it going to be paid to the court?
1990.90-256,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1076.537,1077.236,Sir?
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1077.236,1078.829,Is it going to be paid to the court?
1990.90-256,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1078.829,1080.287,Yes.
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1080.287,1082.04,Then I have... I cannot complain.
1990.90-256,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1082.04,1083.299,Then you wouldn't be complaining?
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1083.299,1086.181,I'd complain about the amount.
1990.90-256,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1086.181,1088.514,Well then you would just complain.
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1100.26,1104.554,"This court could have sanctioned, if it thought it necessary, any time."
1990.90-256,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1120.917,1122.525,"Well, set that aside."
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1122.525,1123.046,--All right.
1990.90-256,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1123.046,1134.634,"The district court had a very extensive opinion detailing the misconduct by the attorney concurred in, if not directed, by the client."
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1145.86,1151.294,"I have to... I have to take back... if I said that, I have to take it back to this extent."
1990.90-256,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1158.56,1159.031,"Well, it began--"
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1159.031,1160.109,--there is some litigation--
1990.90-256,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1160.109,1162.55,"--it was the Friday, Saturday, Sunday conduct that led up to a pleading--"
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1162.55,1163.151,"--Yes, sir."
1990.90-256,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1163.151,1165.323,--that was filed in the following week.
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1165.323,1167.876,"Then litigation conduct, yes."
1990.90-256,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1167.876,1172.868,And I think you were correct to say that this is within the ambit of Rule 11.
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1172.868,1173.489,Yes.
1990.90-256,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1173.489,1180.125,"Well, then why can't we just affirm, based on the fact that it... the judge could have made these findings under Rule 11?"
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1180.125,1192.25,I have trouble with a district court rejecting your Federal rule and reaching for inherent powers because the Rule 11 says--
1990.90-256,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1192.25,1196.565,"Well, we'll say he's right in finding that there was wrongful conduct, he just found the wrong rule."
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1203.088,1215.685,"--Well, in your dissent yesterday you had trouble with even the discrete pact shifting of attorneys' fees, and this is--"
1990.90-256,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1215.685,1219.318,But you don't need to have that trouble because the majority opinion ruled to the contrary.
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1220.129,1224.462,--But this was not a discrete act.
1990.90-256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1263.407,1277.376,I thought... I thought in this record it disclosed that the district court gave notice at several times during the proceedings that sanctions were being contemplated if certain behavior continued.
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1277.376,1284.39,"--Well now, Mr.... when there was a publication of some article in regard to sanctions he called it to the attention of counsel, is my understanding."
1990.90-256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1377.871,1392.651,"Don't at least some of our cases dealing with contempt committed in the presence of the court during a trial say that it's better for the court to perhaps wait until the trial is over rather than just do it instantaneously, kind of perhaps in the heat of passion?"
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1392.651,1403.22,"--I believe what it... what do though is we say I hold you in contempt, but you wait to impose that contempt, put penalty, fine, or other."
1990.90-256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1404.278,1405.64,You say defer the penalty?
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1405.64,1406.17,"Yes, sir."
1990.90-256,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1589.692,1592.153,"Is there any case you can give us which says, quote,"
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1597.987,1602.11,--Rule 11 does--
1990.90-256,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1602.11,1604.321,Apply... does not--
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1604.321,1605.05,--Does apply.
1990.90-256,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1605.05,1610.705,--Do you have any case that says Rule 11 does not apply to diversity cases?
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1610.705,1611.294,"No, Sir."
1990.90-256,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1612.135,1613.196,So you want some new law?
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1613.196,1614.045,"--No, sir."
1990.90-256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1671.086,1674.318,"Now, that point of view didn't carry the day yesterday."
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1674.318,1675.128,"--Well, he didn't."
1990.90-256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1696.762,1700.265,"You would like to reserve the remainder of your time, Mr. Barham?"
1990.90-256,0,35419,mack_e_barham,,1700.265,1701.246,Yes.
1990.90-256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1701.246,1701.775,Very well.
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1702.165,1706.78,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-256,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1783.59,1796.708,"At some point during your argument, Mr. Klein, perhaps we could discuss or you could tell me why the district court couldn't have done all of this, or substantially all of it, under Rule 11."
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1803.092,1806.655,"Well, Your Honor, I think there are two points that I'd like to say."
1990.90-256,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1871.818,1876.99,"Rule 11 certainly is basically limited to filed papers, isn't it?"
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1876.99,1881.244,"That is my understanding of it, and I think the behavior here went far beyond filed papers."
1990.90-256,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1881.244,1889.94,"So if, if the court below had been limited to Rule 11 it could not have imposed the extensive... the extent of sanctions that it did?"
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1889.94,1891.979,I think that is correct.
1990.90-256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1930.526,1937.14,"Mr. Klein, there's another problem besides the fact that Rule 11 only applies to particular filed papers."
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1951.259,1952.709,"Yes, it was."
1990.90-256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1952.709,1957.894,Did the court seek to calculate what incremental additional attorneys' fees were caused by--
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1957.894,1959.485,I believe he did.
1990.90-256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1990.553,1997.859,"--Well, they might have had that in mind, but that's quite different from saying that this amount of damage was caused by these particular abuses."
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2015.04,2016.472,"--Well, that's what I was suggesting, I thought, before."
1990.90-256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2022.575,2036.695,Why don't we... why shouldn't we take Rule 11 as being a limitation upon the way the more general discretion of the court to impose costs.
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2047.872,2048.513,"Well, I think--"
1990.90-256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2048.513,2055.697,"--so that you can't shift fees, but you can only require the other side to pay the amount of the fees that are attributable to the misconduct?"
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2055.697,2058.766,"--I want to say two points, Justice Scalia, because I may have confused at first."
1990.90-256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2070.275,2072.598,The misconduct before the court?
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2072.598,2075.71,"--The misconduct before the court, the contempt of courts that were held."
1990.90-256,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2164.91,2175.765,"Well, Mr. Klein, I think perhaps you ought to, because I think Justice Scalia's question to you was why doesn't Rule 11 limit inherent power."
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2210.027,2212.077,--Let me answer it this way.
1990.90-256,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2298.344,2301.897,"--If the power was already there, why did the rulemakers fuss with it at all?"
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2301.897,2305.049,--They made it... they imposed a higher standard.
1990.90-256,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2325.984,2329.687,So the inherent power only went to one state of mind.
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2332.779,2333.498,Precisely.
1990.90-256,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2333.498,2335.46,That's a strange definition of inherent power.
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2335.46,2338.091,"Well, the inherent power, I think, was a more limited one."
1990.90-256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2575.436,2598.592,"Mr. Klein, before you get to that, because it relates to the point you have been talking about, as I read the district court opinion which calculated the amount of this award, much of that was not only not based upon how much specific harm had been caused, but it was not even entirely based upon conduct before the court."
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2620.485,2621.987,--With respect--
1990.90-256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2621.987,2623.457,"--at the district court level, anyway."
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2623.457,2626.589,"--With respect, Your Honor, I'll disagree with that, and if I might explain."
1990.90-256,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2703.67,2711.163,Were 100 percent of the fees awarded as sanctions?
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2711.163,2714.406,"100 percent of the fees were awarded as sanctions, yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-256,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2714.406,2727.486,"And was... is there a finding, either implicit or explicit, that Chambers, the client, directed 100 percent of that conduct?"
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2727.486,2736.512,"I think that the finding was that Chambers... explicit finding that Chambers was the engineer, that is, he was the strategist and the lawyer was the tactician."
1990.90-256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2758.735,2764.038,"Mr. Klein, I'm not sure the district court's statement at least bears the reading you're giving it."
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2808.888,2809.97,"Well, Your Honor--"
1990.90-256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2809.97,2812.992,"Now, what he's saying, it seems to me, is that Chambers is a bad actor."
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2820.796,2822.228,--I don't think that's right.
1990.90-256,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2831.932,2833.214,--Whereabouts on A-51?
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2833.214,2835.946,--A-51 at the bottom of the first incompleted paragraph.
1990.90-256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2887.11,2892.023,But you have to pay the lawyer at least 50 bucks for showing up to move for summary judgment.
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2904.02,2919.611,"I agree with that, and if the argument is it's an abuse of discretion not to deduct the cost of the complaint, I really don't think that, under these circumstances, given the pervasiveness and given the sanctioning power... it is, after all, a deterrent remedy, not a--"
1990.90-256,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2919.611,2924.513,"But the omission of that, you know, it suggests that the court wasn't, didn't have its eye on the ball."
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2929.426,2935.34,"--But I'd like to discuss that with you, because I think that is wrong, and I think the record couldn't be clearer about it."
1990.90-256,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3050.435,3063.165,"Is the rule you propose that if a fraud is designed for specific judicial proceedings, that that is within the inherent power of the court to sanction?"
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3063.165,3063.805,Absolutely.
1990.90-256,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3070.68,3103.52,"Mr. Klein, if a court's inherent power is limited by the necessity to protect itself, and if a court has available to it sanctions under Rule 11 that cover at least a portion of this conduct, why should we not require the court to at least determine what of this conduct is covered by Rule 11?"
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3103.52,3107.373,"Well, I guess I think that the answer in part to that, Justice--"
1990.90-256,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3107.373,3115.989,"Because I'm not sure... only then do we know whether it's necessary to resort to inherent power, isn't that right?"
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3115.989,3120.193,"--Well, it seems to me... it seems to me that there are two parts to that."
1990.90-256,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3132.591,3134.321,"Well, we don't know."
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3144.907,3146.469,"Well, that's correct... and the Fifth Circuit--"
1990.90-256,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3146.469,3147.08,It didn't do that.
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3148.92,3152.533,"--But, I guess what I... I realize that."
1990.90-256,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3152.533,3163.32,And I didn't understand your answer to be very clear in telling us whether every single dollar imposed here could have been imposed under a Rule 11 sanction.
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3163.32,3171.915,"The reason my answer is less than clear about that, Your Honor, frankly, is because this Court hasn't ruled on those kinds of issues and the circuits are split."
1990.90-256,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3197.293,3203.187,"Well, so your best reading of Rule 11 is to the effect that it did not cover all the conduct here?"
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3203.187,3205.338,--That is my best reading of it at this point.
1990.90-256,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3205.338,3208.8,"Well, that wasn't the rationale of the court of appeals, was it?"
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3208.8,3211.392,It was not the rationale of the court of appeals.
1990.90-256,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3211.392,3212.741,Are you defending the rationale of the court of appeals?
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3212.741,3213.953,I am defending fully the rationale of the--
1990.90-256,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3213.953,3220.178,"Well, they said that Rule 11 just doesn't replace the inherent power to any extent."
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3220.178,3221.697,--That is their view.
1990.90-256,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3223.369,3224.02,Well--
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3224.02,3227.553,"But if... what I'm saying, Justice White, is--"
1990.90-256,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3227.553,3233.725,"--Well, could I ask you, do you think that presented here is the question of the relationship between Rule 11 and inherent power?"
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3233.725,3236.468,--I don't believe that's a fairly presented question.
1990.90-256,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3244.023,3254.24,You don't think the questions presented here really succeed on the question of whether Rule 11 or the statute limits inherent power?
1990.90-256,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,3254.24,3257.721,--The question is very broadly presented.
1990.90-256,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3297.818,3299.899,"Thank you, Mr. Klein."
1990.90-256,2,35419,mack_e_barham,,3302.421,3303.673,Quickly.
1990.90-256,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3391.559,3392.581,"Thank you, Mr. Barham."
