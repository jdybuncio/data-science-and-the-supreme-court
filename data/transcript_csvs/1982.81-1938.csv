1982.81-1938,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.263,We will hear arguments next in United States against Baggot.
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,70.363,91.698,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1938,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,559.164,561.897,"Mr. Wallace, I notice the way you put that."
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,575.97,578.236,--That is my understanding.
1982.81-1938,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,578.236,580.124,That is the government's position?
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,580.124,585.326,It is also my understanding of what this Court said in Proctor & Gamble.
1982.81-1938,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,607.207,628.309,"Has it not some times happened that information from one of the civil... one of the non-criminal divisions not secured by discovery but just their own investigation, then might be referred to the Criminal Division for prosecution when some lawyers in the Division make a judgment that there is criminal conduct involved?"
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,628.309,639.835,"--It happens quite frequently, and I believe it is the duty of those lawyers when they see evidence that a crime has occurred to turn it over to the prosecuting attorneys--"
1982.81-1938,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,639.835,644.911,"Is it not a fact that they might be violating some federal statute if they didn't, is that not so?"
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,644.911,650.44,"--I would not want to go that far, but an argument could be made to that effect."
1982.81-1938,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1000.658,1003.25,"Mr. Wallace, why do you say that it would always be at the request of the United States Attorney?"
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1006.156,1010.606,--They do not have authority to go into court... into the district courts.
1982.81-1938,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1021.291,1022.166,I see.
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1031.458,1035.004,"Well, they could request it."
1982.81-1938,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1062.211,1065.632,"As I read your brief, you assumed those cases were correctly decided?"
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1065.632,1075.473,"We have assumed it for purposes of argument, but I do want to caution the Court that the lower courts are by no means unanimous on this."
1982.81-1938,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1178.929,1181.617,Unless the taxpayer paid his bills.
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1182.896,1187.067,"--Well, unless the taxpayer pays the bills."
1982.81-1938,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1279.732,1281.607,"--Mr. Wallace, can I interrupt you right there?"
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1287.854,1288.541,--Well--
1982.81-1938,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1288.541,1291.086,I do not really... I do not see it documented here.
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1291.086,1292.649,--We do not have it documented.
1982.81-1938,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1381.66,1384.143,"Where do we put our finger on that, Mr. Wallace?"
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1384.143,1389.235,--It is in the hearings that we have cited in our brief.
1982.81-1938,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1394.326,1394.529,"Oh, very well."
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1394.529,1404.29,"I am reading from page 36 of the printed report of the House hearings, and this is during Judge Becker's testimony."
1982.81-1938,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1724.099,1734.939,"Mr. Wallace, under your view what was the purpose of Congress putting in this preliminary to language at all?"
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1734.939,1736.736,--Well--
1982.81-1938,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1736.736,1740.702,Which you have not really mentioned very much in this argument.
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1740.702,1743.779,--They did not specify what the purpose was.
1982.81-1938,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1819.764,1825.23,That is a rather broad purpose.
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1835.679,1844.862,"--Our position covers the use, yes, at any stage of an IRS investigation to determine--"
1982.81-1938,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1844.862,1852.906,"So, if in connection with an audit of a tax return they want the material, they can get it?"
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1852.906,1857.249,"--Well, we would take that position--"
1982.81-1938,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1857.249,1868.323,"Or even if they have not decided on an audit, if they are just reviewing... if they are just looking at a return, just looking at a return, and maybe they wanted to decide whether to do it or not."
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1868.323,1874.742,--If there has been a grand jury investigation conducted that is related to tax--
1982.81-1938,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1874.742,1879.786,"So, anything the IRS wants to do is preliminary to litigation, I think."
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1879.786,1898.419,"--If the grand jury materials are relevant to a tax investigation, then there is a sufficient likelihood that a deficiency will be assessed and that litigation will ensue that the standard is met as we understand it."
1982.81-1938,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1898.419,1903.543,"But, litigation will ensue only if the taxpayer chooses to have it ensue?"
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1903.543,1906.322,That is correct.
1982.81-1938,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1906.322,1909.525,That is entirely within his discretion?
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1909.525,1923.206,"It is always within the discretion of one side to a controversy to agree to the position that the other side is taking, if the IRS has made a deficiency assessment."
1982.81-1938,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1923.206,1924.909,"Mr. Wallace, one other question."
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1932.89,1960.301,"Well, I think that is very similar to the situation in Proctor & Gamble where this Court did distinguish between the particularized need a private party must show and the fact that it was proper for the government to be using the materials without any showing of a particularized need to be using the entire transcript for criminal law enforcement purposes."
1982.81-1938,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1963.299,1975.576,That would not have... Proctor would not have permitted use of the grand jury minutes by IRS people.
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1975.576,1979.074,"--No, it would not, but it permitted them--"
1982.81-1938,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1979.074,1980.199,Without a court order--
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1980.199,2000.174,"--Without a court order, but it did permit the use by government attorneys for civil law enforcement purposes of the entire grand jury materials without a showing of particularized need, and the Douglas Oil opinion very carefully referred to the fact that it was a private party's request that was being considered there."
1982.81-1938,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2000.174,2019.465,"--Mr. Wallace, in a sense, if particularized need has to be established by the government, we do not know that, that is part and parcel of the other case, but if it does, then isn't the inquiry about preliminary to judicial proceedings part and parcel of that same test, in effect."
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2029.117,2048.765,"Well, I do think that in the context of showing of particularized need that a private party must make, the eminence of the court proceeding is what enables the private party to show that the kind of particularized need the court has specified to impeach a witness, to--"
1982.81-1938,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2048.765,2049.39,All right.
1982.81-1938,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2055.714,2059.526,"--Well, we, of course, have taken the position that it is not--"
1982.81-1938,1,40960,samuel_j_betar_jr,,2109.677,2116.457,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
