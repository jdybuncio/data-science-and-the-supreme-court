1973.72-985,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,53.087,"We'll hear arguments next in 72-985, 72-1073, 72-1196."
1973.72-985,0,28776,john_h_anderson,,59.073,61.481,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-985,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,263.894,267.306,"Ordinarily, what form would the transaction take this cash and a check?"
1973.72-985,0,28776,john_h_anderson,,267.306,267.51,No.
1973.72-985,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,285.23,289.541,"No, no. I mean does he -- suppose he cashes the check for $15,000.00."
1973.72-985,0,28776,john_h_anderson,,289.541,311.181,"That would included and as a matter of fact, in listing the requirements that must be reported at the time of a designated transaction, it requires a description of the nature of the transaction whatever that means together with the tight amount and denomination of the currency involved and a description of any check involved in the transaction."
1973.72-985,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,311.181,321.217,"So that if I came in and while I cashed a check for $15,000.00 before -- it was cashed, the teller, whoever it was would have to get all this information from me, is that it?"
1973.72-985,0,28776,john_h_anderson,,321.217,321.919,That is correct.
1973.72-985,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,321.919,326.583,And then he’d also have to note down how many $50.00 bills or how many $100.00 and that sort of thing.
1973.72-985,0,28776,john_h_anderson,,326.583,328.192,That is also correct.
1973.72-985,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,328.827,329.638,What else?
1973.72-985,0,28776,john_h_anderson,,329.638,337.884,"And it also requires a description, as I say, the check involved also a description of the ID that is presented by the party seeking to engage in the transaction."
1973.72-985,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,337.884,338.546,What that’s mean?
1973.72-985,0,28776,john_h_anderson,,338.546,346.884,This presumably means something like a driver’s license or a birth certificate or some other form of identification that would be acceptable to the banking entity.
1973.72-985,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,347.836,352.163,Description of the check would be -- I expect on what bank it was drawn and that sort of thing?
1973.72-985,0,28776,john_h_anderson,,352.163,355.285,That is not further defined in the regulations Mr. Justice.
1973.72-985,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,401.722,421.596,"I suppose, on the face of it that would mean, if I came in twice a week with checks for $15,000.00 to be cashed, a time might come when the bank would sink -- was no reason any longer to take that information from me because it’s a regular, even though I might be kingpin of the robbery racket?"
1973.72-985,0,28776,john_h_anderson,,421.596,432.12,"That is correct Mr. Justice Brennan, however it has to be said that the regulation is couched in terms of regular and normal for the business or profession involved, I suppose --"
1973.72-985,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,432.12,450.585,"Wouldn’t it more likely to be that if they knew that particular person ran a machine shop with the payroll of about $15,000.00 a week that they could then conclude that this was normal for payroll purposes and not make a report."
1973.72-985,0,28776,john_h_anderson,,450.585,451.516,That is true.
1973.72-985,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,451.516,466.573,"But let's assume, that on the other hand, he was widely reputed to be a member of someone of this organized crime groups, do you think the bank could safely make that decision in that way?"
1973.72-985,0,28776,john_h_anderson,,466.573,469.165,"I don’t know, frankly, Mr. Chief Justice --"
1973.72-985,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,469.165,471.448,"Well, what would you advice them if they asked you?"
1973.72-985,0,28776,john_h_anderson,,471.448,487.433,The -- my the advice to the bank in that particular instance would be in view of fact that criminal penalties attach failure to make a report as required by the Act that it is in your best interest to act cautiously and to make the report if you have any reason to believe this is not and regular for this particular party.
1973.72-985,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,487.433,503.739,"I suppose you weigh in the equation, the facts that I have mentioned hypothetically that the man was engaged widely -- appear to be engaged in on lawful activity and unlike the other gentle man, did not have a machine shop with a $15,000.00 payroll every week."
1973.72-985,0,28776,john_h_anderson,,503.739,505.776,"Yes I think we certainly would, yes (Voice Overlap) --"
1973.72-985,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,505.776,518.467,"Well, doesn’t your answer to the chief justice’s question solve at least a good part of vagueness problem since if you don’t try to come within the exemption, the bank is perfectly free to report all transactions."
1973.72-985,0,28776,john_h_anderson,,521.943,522.216,Yes.
1973.72-985,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,535.625,541.02,"Well, doesn’t that at least solve your vagueness arguments so far as the exception is concerned?"
1973.72-985,0,28776,john_h_anderson,,541.02,558.421,"Well, it is simply to say that in every instance that whenever a $10,000.00 currency transaction occurs of which they are in the case of large commercial banks, presumably many hundred a day, that a report would be required to be filed and I think my brother from the Solicitor General's office would agree that’s not what the treasury department wants."
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,1621.605,1624.0,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-985,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1642.007,1642.298,Oh!
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,1649.181,1649.414,Well --
1973.72-985,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1649.414,1654.488,-- as a man the receives a lot of dividends and never reports them deliberately.
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,1654.488,1657.542,It can be tangentially useful to the criminal law --
1973.72-985,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1657.542,1657.885,Let's say for the purpose --
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,1657.885,1658.758,-- but its basic purpose --
1973.72-985,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1658.758,1659.459,I think pretty (Voice Overlap) --
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,1659.459,1661.376,-- purpose is to enforce the civil tax.
1973.72-985,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1692.057,1697.237,Aren’t you think the social security reporting requirements have more than one purpose?
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,1697.237,1702.524,"Certainly they do but not a primarily and almost exclusively criminal one, no."
1973.72-985,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1717.276,1724.094,What about those reporting requirements with respect to sales of firearms and the like?
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,1724.094,1730.056,That’s an example of the regulation both of the seller and of the buyer.
1973.72-985,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1785.702,1803.901,"Well, it might also tend to produce some evidence of criminality on the part of the person who was going into a bank and buying $20,000.00 worth of drafts on a Swiss -- payable on a Swiss bank every week, wouldn’t it?"
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,1803.901,1826.101,"If I tend to do that, any record keeping requirement might tend in some cases to evidence criminality, but one which is for, “the purpose,” and I am quoting the Government’s brief of enforcing the criminal law is a wholly different animal than one which is for the primary purpose of enforcing the civil law and has tangential criminal consequences."
1973.72-985,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1854.45,1857.891,What standing have you got to object to that?
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,1857.891,1859.682,To which?
1973.72-985,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1861.646,1874.719,Are you -- the warrant requirement as a -- to enforce your -- you're saying the warrant requirement would apply in the enforcement of the criminal law against somebody else and this just runs around the warrant requirement.
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,1874.719,1879.722,"Now, I rep -- I think I should inform the Court as to who it is that I represent here."
1973.72-985,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1888.141,1895.212,"So you're a -- you're really objecting to thank keeping records of your affair, of your client's affair?"
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,1895.212,1908.318,"Yes, I also represent one foreign or four foreign investors who must affirmatively report their holdings and their transactions across the border and analytically we feel the foreign and domestic reporting requirements are constitutionally the same --"
1973.72-985,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1908.318,1911.002,You are arguing reporting requirements more than record keeping?
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,1911.002,1912.694,We are arguing them both.
1973.72-985,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1918.622,1923.895,"Well, maybe its frightful but I don’t know about -- what about the Fourth Amendment, you may have --"
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,1923.895,1925.185,"Well, the Fourth Amendment --"
1973.72-985,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1925.185,1931.595,You may -- you as a bank costumer objecting to the bank having to keep records.
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,1931.595,1935.829,I as a lawyer representing clients who must report -- object to the reports.
1973.72-985,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1943.123,1944.771,Why?
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,1944.771,1948.349,"Because they violate the Fourth Amendment, the Fourth and Fifth Amendments combined and --"
1973.72-985,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1948.349,1953.752,"Well, don’t you think a bank has the right to keep a record that will protect itself in case of a suit?"
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,1953.752,1955.371,Certainly it does and it already does then its --
1973.72-985,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1955.371,1958.459,"Well, I (Voice Overlap) -- well, why can’t it keep those reports?"
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,1958.459,1959.111,It does.
1973.72-985,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1962.092,1965.93,"Well, don’t -- you said you objected to the keeping of the record?"
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,1965.93,1972.544,"We do when it is coerced by the Government and not relevant to the business purposes of the bank, then and only then do we object."
1973.72-985,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1972.544,1981.491,"Well, you have to have both coercion and relevancy because I can find relevancy without any problem."
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,1981.491,1986.557,"If, but for the act, the record would not be made or kept, then we object to it."
1973.72-985,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1986.557,1987.992,On what ground?
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,1987.992,1994.815,Because the bank acts as agent of the Government in doing that because its irrelevant to the regulatory purpose and because it constitutes a search.
1973.72-985,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1994.815,1999.245,"Because the keeper -- report, the bank might not turn the reports over."
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,1999.245,2001.497,The bank as a matter of practice is (Voice Overlap) --
1973.72-985,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2001.497,2010.397,"Well, if the bank is keeping -- if the bank has been keeping reports for the last 35 years, would you still have a case?"
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,2010.397,2012.102,"Yes, we would because the banks --"
1973.72-985,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2012.102,2013.617,Or you just found out?
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,2013.617,2014.711,No.
1973.72-985,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2021.218,2023.801,"Well, suppose they had been?"
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,2023.801,2027.97,"We have no objection to records kept in the ordinary course of business, none at all."
1973.72-985,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2034.775,2042.248,"Do you object to the keeping of the reports because they are given over to the Government, that’s your point isn’t it?"
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,2042.248,2043.846,"No, it's one of our points."
1973.72-985,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2043.846,2047.867,"Well, if you win on that, would you give up the other one?"
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,2047.867,2052.577,"If we win, we’ll give up the ones that we don’t need, yes.[Laughter]"
1973.72-985,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2525.249,2532.864,"Mr. Marson, are you now arguing your challenge to the reporting regulations as well as to the recording -- recordkeeping regulation?"
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,2532.864,2535.659,"Yes, in our view they're constitutional and distinguishable."
1973.72-985,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2539.073,2547.533,"Well, have any of your clients engaged in transactions which they would be required to report or had they at the time, the filing of the complaint?"
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,2547.533,2562.956,"They alleged at the time of the filing of the complaint which was a few weeks before the effective date of the Act that they had done so in the recent past and would do so in the immediate future, and therefore, we’re under the effect of the regulation."
1973.72-985,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2592.255,2594.301,Are you the (Inaudible) one of the parties to this case?
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,2594.301,2594.997,"Yes, I am."
1973.72-985,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2670.938,2676.497,If any other organization in the country that couldn’t also be a party?
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,2676.497,2686.909,The organization would have to be of the type that was controversial and whose members could reasonably plead that they could expect retaliation or exposure.
1973.72-985,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2692.455,2698.11,"So any of them, any group with would be able to (Inaudible)"
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,2698.11,2703.693,Any group who had a reasonable interest in the privacy of its membership list would.
1973.72-985,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2709.582,2726.548,"Well, if any (Voice Overlap) American Union member Joe Doe goes in and cashes his bonds and gets a check for $15,000.00, how does he become -- get on the list as a member of the American Civil Liberties union, by cashing a check?"
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,2726.548,2730.845,Because the check goes through our account and the bank makes pictures of our account Mr. --
1973.72-985,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2730.845,2732.616,"No, no, no, no."
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,2735.445,2735.752,Oh!
1973.72-985,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2739.127,2742.748,"Well, how can the American Liberties Union have anything to do with that?"
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,2742.748,2748.754,Because he knows that his bank is going to keep a record of the fact that he paid money to the American Civil Liberties Union.
1973.72-985,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2748.754,2763.739,"Suppose the man cashed a check for $15,000.00 from Babies United payable to him and he’s member of the American Civil Liberties Union, does the American Civil Liberties Union have a right to bring an action to stop that?"
1973.72-985,1,19549,charles_c_marson,,2763.739,2765.44,No.
1973.72-985,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2774.354,2784.042,"Very well, Mr. Marson."
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2787.687,2791.513,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-985,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3247.29,3276.756,"It is represented as you know that as a practical matter that exception is virtually meaningless because microfilming equipment can’t distinguish between a check under a $100.00 and check over a $100.00 and that the manpower required to separate them would not be worth the candle and that therefore as a practical matter its a meaningless distinction, a meaningless exemption, if you will and I personally don’t know the --"
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3276.756,3277.044,There is relativity --
1973.72-985,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3277.044,3277.732,-- that’s about.
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3278.848,3282.308,There's relatively little in the record that bears on this.
1973.72-985,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3312.312,3325.169,It would be possible to do.I mean a human being could easily do it but you’d -- the representation is that that would add so much expense it would -- its -- that is therefore as a practical matter cheaper to microfilm them all.
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3325.169,3325.986,At that --
1973.72-985,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3325.986,3327.946,Nobody could quarrel with the proposition that is possible --
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3327.946,3328.134,Maybe because the (Voice Overlap) --
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3328.134,3329.843,The fraudulent practice --
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3329.843,3335.944,But of course the (Voice Overlap)the way it is today show -- shouldn’t have many hundred dollar checks?[Laughter]
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3339.172,3354.9,The problem in practice has been for banks to microfilm all of their checks and of course for banks that have been doing that even though they have not been retaining those microfilms as long as it is required under the regulation --
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3354.9,3357.76,Three year --
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3357.76,3362.157,It's five years for this particular aspect of it.
1973.72-985,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3470.993,3476.35,"May I ask this question, I think its in the record somewhere but I can’t put my finger on it."
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3483.422,3486.849,It does not with respect to any of this requirements.
1973.72-985,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3486.849,3488.349,How about the regulations?
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3488.349,3490.054,Neither do the regulations.
1973.72-985,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3490.054,3499.353,You mean it applies as a -- equally to a ten million dollar bank in a small town as it would to a ten billion dollar bank?
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3499.353,3508.482,"That is correct. Of course, it doesn’t specify that microfilm has to be the process by which a copy of the check is retained."
1973.72-985,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3525.396,3529.274,Are you suggesting a small bank would use something other than microfilm?
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3529.274,3532.312,"Well, if it chose to, it could under the regulations."
1973.72-985,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3625.045,3635.407,Maybe irrelevant but do the banks get any compensation for the service from some federal agency that they involve considering time and personnel and everything else (Voice Overlap) --
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3635.407,3641.166,There is no compensation provided in the Act or the regulations Your Honor.
1973.72-985,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3670.657,3679.518,"Well, I've been thinking off -- it must -- the rolls stored in warehouses, taking them out, locating them?"
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3679.518,3679.744,There would be --
1973.72-985,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3679.744,3682.91,"Providing copies, this must involve expense?"
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3682.91,3685.17,There are expenses.
1973.72-985,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3727.956,3730.081,"More expense in that involved, is it?"
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3747.062,3777.489,"The recordkeeping requirements don’t impose any additional requirements on the bank with respect to access to such records as they have and there wasn’t a complete cross breakdown, there was testimony in the hearings that -- by representatives of the banking industry that the costs would not be unduly onerous and the costs are tax deductible."
1973.72-985,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3783.417,3797.951,"You could sue him I suppose on a capitalistic system that whatever the cost of doing business are, that will be paid for by the bank's costumers ultimately and the bank will continue to make what profit it can make in a competitive economy, isn’t it?"
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3797.951,3805.23,I would presume so although there's no indication that anyone has raised the service cost from ten cents to ten and a half cents check.
1973.72-985,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3805.23,3807.792,"Well, maybe they’ve been able to economize somewhere else."
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3807.792,3809.309,Can we go to the next point?
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3813.729,3818.242,"Well, there are provisions for civil penalties --"
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3818.242,3818.508,In criminal --
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3818.508,3822.693,"-- or the possibility for criminal violations, that is correct."
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3836.118,3839.996,Then I guess the answer is they don’t want -- they're ignoring business.
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3839.996,3840.826,That’s right.
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3872.117,3877.407,Do you think Congress could put that on any other business?
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3879.858,3888.176,"Well, the Congress has imposed a great many recordkeeping requirements on numerous businesses in order to implement various federal --"
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3888.176,3891.554,Internal revenues -- internal revenue for example?
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3891.554,3892.354,That’s correct.
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3892.354,3899.839,I’m talking about these provisions on the basis of what you say here which is that you might want to prosecute.
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3899.839,3906.945,"Well, that’s the only one basis that these provisions are also needed to investigate whether internal revenue has been paid adequately --"
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3906.945,3915.368,"But what the petition said, it’s your whole thrust in your brief and I think they’ve got so many, you keep talking about criminal."
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3915.368,3926.461,"Well, there was a great deal of focus on criminal schemes and the use of secret accounts to conceal the fruits of criminal schemes that --"
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3926.461,3929.16,Secret accounts in domestic banks?
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3929.16,3940.143,Secret accounts in foreign banks and getting it there through secret transactions in United States banks and transactions that couldn’t adequately be traced and --
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3940.143,3941.698,But immediately you say criminal --
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3941.698,3944.41,Bank costumers who aren't accurately identified --
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3944.41,3947.206,"But must -- won’t you agree with me, what lies in it?"
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3955.543,3958.129,Are you speaking of the privileging against self-incrimination?
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3958.129,3959.742,Yes.
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3959.742,3968.205,"Well, if someone is being required to incriminate himself and pleads the privilege, that question is raised."
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3968.899,3975.379,"Well, the only pleading -- the only pleading I can do to that stage would be to cash in a check."
1973.72-985,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3975.379,3977.474,"Well, does the bank have any Fifth Amendment privilege, Mr. Wallace?"
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3977.474,3982.229,"No, the banks, that corporations who don’t have a Fifth Amendment privilege and no one else --"
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3982.229,3982.606,We’re not talking about --
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3982.606,3984.23,-- is being required to keep a record --
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3984.23,3992.726,I’m talking about 40 -- $100.00 man has got a check for a $101.00.
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3992.726,3993.22,"Well, if he is --"
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3993.22,3997.752,He gives up all his right -- he gives up all his right when he puts that bank -- that check in the bank.
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3997.752,4000.288,"Well, I haven’t said anything about giving up all his rights."
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4003.852,4008.764,"And that’s all he meant to commute -- that’s only person he meant to communicate to, right?"
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4008.764,4022.206,"Well, if he has a right to uphold the confidentiality of that communication from disclosure that would arise -- that question would arise when an attempt was made to get the bank to disclose it."
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4026.975,4027.024,(Voice Overlap) --
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4027.024,4033.563,-- all he meant to communicate it to but the bank can be compelled to testify as to its knowledge of what he communicated to them.
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4033.563,4047.784,"Yes, but I don’t think that the Couch case said that the -- accountant that was given these internal revenue materials was obliged to turn that over to the Government, I don’t think that’s (Voice Overlap) --"
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4047.784,4049.312,Neither does the Act.
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4054.455,4054.947,What if you don’t (Voice Overlap) --
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4054.947,4058.376,-- if they don’t have a normal legal process of a summons or a subpoena.
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4058.376,4060.231,What about the reporting provision?
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4060.231,4071.627,"Well, the reporting provisions are something else and I’ll turn to those now with just -- if I may, wanted to close in comments about the recordkeeping provisions."
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4071.627,4073.2,(Inaudible)
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4073.2,4076.935,So that we -- won’t need to return to them unless there are further questions --
1973.72-985,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4076.935,4081.291,"Mr. Wallace, I do have one more question about the recordkeeping provisions."
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4118.372,4120.64,That was the major thrust of it.
1973.72-985,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4369.416,4381.449,"I suppose the Government is acting or the private bank or company is acting as a Government agent when they withhold taxes, social security and --"
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4381.449,4383.304,"Well, in the same sense, that is right."
1973.72-985,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4680.544,4686.396,"If you clarify for me what the term currency transaction means, Mr. Wallace?"
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4687.245,4709.627,"Well, these are transactions -- one example was given by Mr. Justice Brennan if he should get $15,000.00 in currency just by presenting a check and asking for that much currency although the denominations of the smaller bills would not have to be reported on the reporting form, that was the only exception I would take to the description that was made."
1973.72-985,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4712.233,4717.059,"Well, was that by -- is that in denomination in the currency going?"
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4721.054,4724.731,"Well, --"
1973.72-985,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4724.731,4725.687,Say?
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4725.687,4726.753,Yes.
1973.72-985,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4726.82,4728.884,I get the amount in denomination?
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4728.884,4730.503,Yes.
1973.72-985,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4753.187,4769.459,"Mr. Wallace, what about the corollary if that if -- if I walk into the bank every week with $15,000.00 in large bills to buy a draft on a Swiss bank to transfer the money to --"
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4769.459,4771.049,That too would be a currency transaction to be reported.
1973.72-985,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4771.049,4773.005,That’s the same?
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4773.005,4798.976,"And it would be for currency or other bearer instrument transactions such as a bank check made out to cash or something of the sort which anybody could cash, a bearer instrument that has the same negotiability as currency, virtually the same that’s what these are involved with."
1973.72-985,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4798.976,4803.465,So I gather (Inaudible) on the currency transaction with the Court.
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4816.537,4819.896,"No, I understand that that would be adequate."
1973.72-985,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4951.125,4952.698,When was that brief filed?
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4955.417,4958.805,We received -- and in on January 5th in our office.
1973.72-985,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4958.805,4959.908,The red covered brief?
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4959.908,4967.266,"Well, it -- there was a white covered brief that was identical to it and then the red covered briefs were substituted for it."
1973.72-985,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4967.699,4969.339,But it don’t seem it got substituted.
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4969.339,4972.423,"The brief for the appellee, California Bankers Association."

1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4973.08,4975.317,It’s the same as the white covered brief.
1973.72-985,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4976.042,4977.664,And what page are you referring to?
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4977.664,4980.602,Its no pages 37 through 39.

1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4982.28,4983.391,"Well, that’s the same --"
1973.72-985,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4983.391,4984.717,Filed January 2nd.
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4984.717,4985.842,That’s the same brief.
1973.72-985,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4999.032,5000.207,So what page now?
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5000.207,5019.846,"37 through 39, a contention is made that the regulation is invalid because it requires only the financial institution to file the report whereas the Act contemplated that the regulation would require both the institution and the costumer to file the report."
1973.72-985,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5080.255,5086.022,There's no -- the statute is unambiguous and what it requires --
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5086.022,5086.27,"Well, --"
1973.72-985,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5086.27,5089.284,And you say that the executive branch has chosen to disregard it.
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5091.498,5102.602,"The -- when you say the statute is unambiguous Mr. Justice Stewart, let me look at the statute at the bottom of page 37."
1973.72-985,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5110.13,5111.092,Both?
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5111.092,5112.104,Both.
1973.72-985,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5124.375,5127.072,But it's for both language that we’re talking about.
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5127.072,5127.906,Yes.
1973.72-985,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5227.154,5229.024,In the brief?
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5229.024,5230.274,"This is not a brief, sir."
1973.72-985,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5339.593,5348.992,But that’s not -- one of the purposes of this provision contained in the House Report certainly is not served because -- is that correct?
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5348.992,5349.21,As the House --
1973.72-985,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5349.21,5359.779,"Because this does enable the bank to give this information to the Internal Revenue without any knowledge whatsoever on the part of its costumer, isn’t that correct?"
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5359.779,5360.329,The regulation does require (Voice Overlap) --
1973.72-985,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5360.329,5363.209,And that precisely what the House Report said that the requirement was --
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5363.209,5364.522,That is precisely what the House Report said.
1973.72-985,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5364.522,5365.963,Designed to forestall.
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5365.963,5372.758,Precisely what the House Report said and it was contradicted by the Senate Report dealing with exactly the same language in the Act.

1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5817.588,5819.708,"His own grandfather left the 10,000."
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5819.708,5829.367,"If he did that by cash, the cash transaction, the institution -- the bank would file a report of it."
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5830.094,5832.39,And he wouldn’t know about it?
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5832.39,5841.764,"Well, there's nothing to keep the bank telling him about it and the Secretary has publicized these regulations very widely and has held press conferences, has disseminated --"

1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5842.439,5844.184,-- what's about them and so forth.
1973.72-985,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5844.184,5847.49,And you don’t pay the bank notifying date.
1973.72-985,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5856.394,5860.378,"The bank might send out a notice with its mention, a monthly canceled checks."
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5860.378,5868.77,"I think one could as reasonably assume that when the bank as in the information for the report, the bank will be telling you why they need this information."
1973.72-985,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5868.77,5879.047,"Well, the House Committee talked about the risk of the Secretary of the Treasury putting pressure on the bank to give it -- this information without informing its costumers."
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5879.047,5881.925,That -- the House Committee report said that.
1973.72-985,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5883.479,5884.794,"No, but that risk -- but that was --"
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5884.794,5886.085,And that issue was --

1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5888.665,5890.22,Under the regulation but it's not --
1973.72-985,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5890.22,5897.715,"Well, might not the bank themselves become kind of anxious to supply the information without having the costumer cooperate."
1973.72-985,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,5913.647,5926.901,"Well, that wasn’t -- what was indicated in the commentary that the Department received as the reason why the banks thought it would be better for them to be doing it themselves."
1973.72-985,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6013.049,6018.228,Mr. Marson.
1973.72-985,3,19549,charles_c_marson,,6018.228,6021.423,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-985,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6074.741,6093.528,"Mr. Marson, (Voice Overlap) more terrifying 20 or 30 years ago, but after the advent of social security, Medicare, to say nothing of enlargement of the reach of tax laws, those numbers when you add them up would produce numbers very much like the ones you're talking about."
1973.72-985,3,19549,charles_c_marson,,6093.528,6097.089,They do but not in the enforcement of the criminal law.
1973.72-985,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6097.411,6099.875,But often used for that purpose?
1973.72-985,3,19549,charles_c_marson,,6099.875,6112.357,"Often used, yes. And this Court has had an occasion to deal with the difficult problem where the tax law and the criminal law meet in a grey area and it becomes a bleeder's option in the hands of the IRS."
1973.72-985,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,6125.786,6131.11,"Mr. Marson, I just want to be sure of your position, your client’s position."
1973.72-985,3,19549,charles_c_marson,,6141.647,6142.376,Yes we do.
1973.72-985,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6174.898,6187.385,"But if you carry a gift from London for the accommodation of a friend in London to some young lady who is getting married in New York, you must report that on the customs declaration."
1973.72-985,3,19549,charles_c_marson,,6187.385,6189.213,That I do it for the purpose of giving it to someone else?
1973.72-985,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6189.213,6195.789,That you do it for the accommodation of someone else that carrying it for the accommodation of another person?
1973.72-985,3,19549,charles_c_marson,,6195.789,6198.846,I was unaware of that Your Honor.
1973.72-985,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6273.743,6274.41,That is Federal Reserves Act?
1973.72-985,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6274.41,6279.464,We have to report somebody in the Government.
1973.72-985,3,19549,charles_c_marson,,6279.464,6288.184,"Well, their own ledger sheets has between them would disclose the transaction, but they would not have to report that under the Bank Secrecy Act and I don’t know that they would have to report it under --"
1973.72-985,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6288.184,6290.97,They would not report it under any Act?
1973.72-985,3,19549,charles_c_marson,,6290.97,6292.05,Not to my knowledge.
1973.72-985,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6292.05,6295.068,"Well, you better look up some more."
1973.72-985,3,19549,charles_c_marson,,6301.546,6301.804,(Voice Overlap)
1973.72-985,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6301.804,6303.91,"Not under the Secrecy Act, of course not?"
1973.72-985,3,19549,charles_c_marson,,6303.91,6305.22,"No, not under this Act."
1973.72-985,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6335.838,6351.025,"Well, it hadn’t been my understanding that you were arguing that this legislation was beyond the constitutional power of Congress to enact under the commerce power, but rather that it violated specific provisions of the Bill of Rights, i.e. the Fourth or Fifth Amendment."
1973.72-985,3,19549,charles_c_marson,,6351.025,6352.495,That’s correct.
1973.72-985,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6352.495,6352.925,Isn't that --
1973.72-985,3,19549,charles_c_marson,,6352.925,6353.952,Actually it --
1973.72-985,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6353.952,6356.494,"I have not misapprehended your argument, have I?"
1973.72-985,3,19549,charles_c_marson,,6356.494,6361.145,In terms of its purpose it ought to be comprehended as an exercise as a police power.
1973.72-985,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6365.287,6371.665,"Well, there isn’t any police power in Congress, all of Congress is criminal statutes are based on the commerce power?"
1973.72-985,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6371.665,6373.525,"Well, or the taxing power?"
1973.72-985,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6373.525,6374.597,Or the taxing power.
1973.72-985,3,19549,charles_c_marson,,6376.585,6381.206,Let me offer this analogy of the interplay of these powers to the Fourth Amendment.
1973.72-985,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6422.799,6434.963,"Well, then but the -- it wouldn’t wipe out the Fourth and Fifth Amendment objections, but I don’t see that the telephone notion is particularly objectionable on the commerce clause grounds."
1973.72-985,3,19549,charles_c_marson,,6444.089,6446.53,"I agree with that, yes sir."
1973.72-985,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6446.53,6462.117,"For the purposes of the commerce clause conceivably, the Government want -- might want to find out whether the telephone company is reporting accurately all their long distance calls but by merely measuring them and under the commerce clause that would not be a -- probably would not -- the objection --"
1973.72-985,3,19549,charles_c_marson,,6462.117,6466.094,"For the purpose that you’ve stated, it would not but nobody claims here except --"
1973.72-985,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6466.094,6475.681,"As Justice Rehnquist suggested then you get into the taking the commerce, the content of the communication down then something other than the commerce clause comes into play."
1973.72-985,3,19549,charles_c_marson,,6475.681,6482.091,"Well, certainly the Fourth Amendment does as this Court has frequently decided."
1973.72-985,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6595.641,6596.465,Thank you gentlemen.
