1975.74-883,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,50.332,55.356,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1975.74-883,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1035.178,1046.402,"(Inaudible) the producer gets the limited certificate and can abandon at the end of the term, but does it abandon without complying with some procedure, as you suggested earlier, there is still a procedure?"
1975.74-883,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1046.402,1048.188,"No, there is no additional procedure."
1975.74-883,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1053.348,1060.636,"In other words, if you got a ten-year certificate and it is permitted to abandon at the end of ten years and come at the end of ten years and that is it?"
1975.74-883,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1060.636,1061.257,That is right.
1975.74-883,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1061.257,1062.922,"And, he goes out for the sales --"
1975.74-883,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1062.922,1063.858,That is right.
1975.74-883,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1063.858,1066.9,"So, the law in the contract then would be the same?"
1975.74-883,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1066.9,1068.207,That is right.
1975.74-883,1,36761,morton_l_simons,,1321.303,1326.674,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1975.74-883,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1827.808,1845.563,"Mr. Simons, when you say a pregranted abandonment simply is not available, would you include in that say a determination by the Commission at the end of the 8th year or a 10th year limited certificate or say unlimited, so that abandonment will be permitted at the end of 10 years?"
1975.74-883,1,36761,morton_l_simons,,1845.563,1846.597,At the end of 8th year?
1975.74-883,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1846.597,1848.775,Yes.
1975.74-883,1,36761,morton_l_simons,,1848.775,1858.044,"Obviously, you have to come in before the time is due and I think that there is some period of time; a year, 18 months, maybe two years."
1975.74-883,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2013.232,2016.139,But the producer can and choose to stay out of the interstate market?
1975.74-883,1,36761,morton_l_simons,,2016.139,2027.18,"Correct, no question about that and we go back of course to the dilemma that Mr. Justice White recognized for unanimous Court in Texaco, a little over a year ago."
1975.74-883,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2271.233,2274.608,Do you have any further Mr. Evans?
1975.74-883,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2274.608,2277.74,I have just one thought.
1975.74-883,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2331.131,2331.964,Thank you gentlemen.
