1974.73-1531,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,23.581,"We'll hear arguments next in Number 1531, Johnson against Mississippi."
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,25.049,28.259,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1974.73-1531,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,199.102,215.281,"Well, don't -- don't you have to show under Peacock that they have an unqualified right to do what they were charged with doing and not just that they had an unqualified right to do what they in fact might have been found to be doing?"
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,215.281,219.5,"Mr. Justice, we believe that the evidence in this case does meet the Peacock standard."
1974.73-1531,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,228.793,232.76,What activity where they charged with in the Mississippi criminal prosecution?
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,232.76,234.721,"Well, the evidence -- the evidence reveals --"
1974.73-1531,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,234.721,237.094,"I mean the charge, not the evidence?"
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,237.094,248.399,The charge was to unlawfully and feloniously bring about a boycott of merchants and businesses and to promote and encourage acts injurious to trade or commerce.
1974.73-1531,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,251.064,263.393,"Well, but now don't you have to show under Peacock that the federal statute you're relying on gave them an unqualified right to feloniously and injuriously do what they were doing?"
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,263.393,264.99,We think that's true in this case.
1974.73-1531,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,294.048,297.759,"But they were charged with doing something more than that, weren't they?"
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,297.759,299.801,"No, we don't believe they were, Your Honor."
1974.73-1531,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,324.941,328.2,"Well, that's the evidence, that's not the charge?"
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,328.2,329.565,That was the basis of the charge.
1974.73-1531,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,330.341,330.617,But it's not the charge --
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,330.617,331.481,-- evidence that was the basis of the arrest.
1974.73-1531,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,331.481,334.568,-- it's not the charged itself?
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,334.568,357.25,"Well, the charge of boycotting, and the charge of restraining trade necessarily contains elements which contradict the protected activity guaranteed by the statute because the boycott necessarily involves word of mouth publicity, free speech activity to persuades shoppers not stop in the stores and that's specifically protected by the statute."
1974.73-1531,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,357.25,375.67,"I take it then you would suggest with an indictment like this, it's fine, where the information is filed but if you would have been entitled to dismissal for the indictment, if you had moved to dismiss and cited that federal statute, that the federal statute is an absolute bar to the Constitution?"
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,375.67,378.552,That is the relief that we're requesting in Federal District Court.
1974.73-1531,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,378.552,384.819,"I know, but that's what you say should have been granted -- it should have been granted if you had look for the state court?"
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,384.819,394.001,I think the posture in the state court would have been more of constitutional question whether the state statute under which the charges are broad -- are over broad and whether they conflict with the federal --
1974.73-1531,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,394.001,398.346,You're contesting on federal statute here is they contend (Inaudible)
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,398.346,398.546,Yes.
1974.73-1531,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,398.546,402.272,-- a full complete defense to going forward with the charge at all?
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,402.272,403.692,"Yes, that's correct."
1974.73-1531,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,403.692,408.841,"And I take it, you agree to that that is the test on which is the basis for Peacock?"
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,408.841,411.122,That is one of the tests that the Court laid down.
1974.73-1531,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,670.365,696.119,"What if they have come down the street with combination of automobiles and a parade carrying signs expressing the sentiments you have referred to and then stopped for 20 minutes to block the traffic as part of their demonstration and call public attention to it, would you think they could be arrested for traffic violations?"
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,696.119,699.574,"Of course that's another case, they weren't charge with that here."
1974.73-1531,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,710.53,712.295,"Well, is this is First Amendment, then?"
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,712.295,713.602,"No, this not First Amendment."
1974.73-1531,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,716.649,718.519,"No, I'm talking about the conduct?"
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,718.519,718.692,Yes.
1974.73-1531,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,718.692,720.792,That I've just described.
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,723.633,723.942,Yes.
1974.73-1531,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,723.942,727.097,It's a demonstration.
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,729.352,751.83,"Well, that the statute indicates of the conduct of the persons engaged in this free speech activity must be lawful, and so therefore, if the conduct of the petitioners in that case have violated the state statute then and the state established this by the evidence that they violated a constitutional ordinance or state statute, then we would take our position that removal would not allowed."
1974.73-1531,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,762.02,769.785,But what does the state claim here in their -- what was the charged of the state in this case?
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,769.785,773.263,"Well, the state has changed its position a couple of times during the course of the litigation."
1974.73-1531,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,773.263,774.749,What were they charged originally?
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,774.749,785.671,"The initial charge was under 97-1-1, that is a conspiracy to restrain trade or commerce."
1974.73-1531,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1052.802,1059.368,Was 1983 then subject to this federal statute?
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,1059.368,1063.661,"No, I believe the Court in Peacock, Mr. Justice White rejected 1983 because --"
1974.73-1531,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1063.661,1070.184,"Well, it gives the right to recover damages from state officers if you interfere say with free speech activities?"
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,1070.184,1070.855,Yes but we --
1974.73-1531,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1070.855,1088.536,"Let's assume in a removal case you allege and the state says well that maybe true that you're engaged in free speech and that you're bound to win, that you're bound to win the state criminal case by interposing a federal defense, that isn't enough, is it?"
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,1088.536,1089.956,"No, it's not."
1974.73-1531,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1118.119,1128.905,"Well, isn't it any federal statute then have said, no one will interfere with free speech for -- where the reason for the interference is race?"
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,1128.905,1129.047,Yes.
1974.73-1531,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1129.047,1129.77,Purely race.
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,1129.77,1130.605,That would qualify.
1974.73-1531,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1130.605,1132.417,That would qualify.
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,1132.417,1133.444,That's correct.
1974.73-1531,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1147.924,1152.113,But what right does the statute create or provide?
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,1152.113,1154.716,The statute provides a right to be free of interference.
1974.73-1531,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1154.716,1167.328,"But the Constitution certainly provides the protection of the right -- if the right is -- if the origin of the right is constitutional, I take it, in such a statute?"
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,1167.328,1181.003,"Well, yes the power of Congress to enact the legislation, I suppose, would be constitutional, yes, but the First Amendment is not -- does not qualify the Court held in Peacock as the statute providing for rights in terms of racial equality."
1974.73-1531,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1197.291,1198.202,Mr. Parker.
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,1198.202,1199.844,Yes.
1974.73-1531,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1199.844,1210.324,Does your position depend upon the soundness of a prediction that the rights of your clients cannot be vindicated in the state courts?
1974.73-1531,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,1210.324,1222.107,"Mr. Justice Powell, in this case the prediction is a certainty because the statute invoked provides a right not even to be prosecuted in state courts, as the statute did in Rachel."
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,1598.979,1603.426,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1974.73-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2026.46,2035.966,It doesn't appear on page of the charge or the whatever pieces of paper instituted in these proceedings in the state courts.
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2043.501,2043.919,They did.
1974.73-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2043.919,2045.226,Of the charge.
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2045.226,2046.98,"Yes, Mr. Justice White, they did."
1974.73-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2046.98,2051.083,But how did you get that across to the courts?
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2053.687,2063.554,It was explained in oral argument and that question put to us where the posture of the case stood at that particular time and it came out in oral argument to the Fifth Circuit.
1974.73-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2063.554,2067.708,So you were charging these people with the use of threats and coercion?
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2067.708,2068.821,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2083.312,2084.924,"So, you're representing the state here."
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2084.924,2087.036,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2099.713,2110.231,"Let us suppose that on the removal hearing, I gather you think that a removal hearing in the District Court is a proper thing?"
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2110.231,2111.966,A removal hearing was had?
1974.73-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2111.966,2112.501,Yes.
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2149.703,2150.718,"No, sir it would not."
1974.73-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2150.718,2151.388,Why not?
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2151.388,2163.921,"Well, under Rachel and Peacock in its interpretation of 1443 (1), First Amendment rights in and of themselves are not removable."
1974.73-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2167.145,2188.198,"Let's assume -- let's assume, let's assume it's alleged that the people were arrested solely because of their race, peacefully protesting activities and they were arrested solely because of their race?"
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2188.198,2198.489,"I still do not think under Rachel and Peacock that this particular instance of picketing would in and of itself constitute removal, no, sir, for this reason."
1974.73-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2241.093,2259.014,"You would say anytime -- anytime you charge somebody on the face of the complaints with some act that was obviously within the state's police power, it could never be removable, even though predictably, the defendant might win in the state court."
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2259.014,2263.254,"According to Rachel and Peacock, that's true sir."
1974.73-1531,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2263.254,2267.622,"In Rachel the charge was trespass, wasn't it?"
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2267.622,2269.596,"Mr. Justice Stewart, that is true."
1974.73-1531,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2277.637,2278.86,Hamm had been decided.
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2278.86,2284.215,"Hamm have been decided, there interpreting 19 -- 2000 (a)."
1974.73-1531,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2284.215,2284.758,"(c), I believe."
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2284.758,2293.938,"(c) which said that Public Accommodations Act granted a specific right, therefore, it's substituted a right for a crime."
1974.73-1531,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2367.755,2370.612,"Well, what was the secondary boycott?"
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2370.612,2371.134,What was it?
1974.73-1531,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2371.134,2373.961,In this case?
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2373.961,2391.59,"Mr. Justice Marshall, it was brought out that these people were engaged in a conspiracy to stop individuals from participating in ongoing business activities with the certain individuals in the City of Vicksburg."
1974.73-1531,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2391.59,2393.63,And that's secondary boycott?
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2393.63,2400.696,"According to the state statute, it is."
1974.73-1531,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2410.603,2413.923,They just say people don't patronize the store?
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2413.923,2414.3,"No, sir."
1974.73-1531,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2416.161,2421.473,"Because we don't know what they charged with, do we, do you?"
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2421.473,2423.833,"Well, according -- without all due respect --"
1974.73-1531,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2423.833,2425.561,Do you know what they're charged with?
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2425.561,2430.6,"With all due respect to you, Mr. Justice Marshall, I can only represent to you what the indictment says."
1974.73-1531,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2443.115,2444.424,That's all we have?
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2444.424,2447.013,That's right sir.
1974.73-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2447.013,2459.268,You're necessarily saying then that the federal statute would be no defense to those charges?
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2459.268,2460.707,"Absolutely, Mr. Justice White."
1974.73-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2460.707,2470.073,"And that if they were convicted, the people convicted them couldn't be indicted under the federal statute for having interfered with these activities?"
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2470.073,2494.038,"The statute speaks, the federal statute and which they allude to, 245 (b), specifically refers to force or threats of force in the following activities and if they do so, and if you go to the bottom statute then they maybe find or if there's imprisonment involved."
1974.73-1531,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2494.719,2500.094,How about the policeman's threat to take the man to jail.
1974.73-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2505.356,2509.738,Put to jail rather than (Inaudible)
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2509.738,2515.253,"I wouldn't think that -- I would say that would be, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1974.73-1531,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2528.697,2542.234,"Even if they could be convicted, and maybe they could, depending of course on what the actual facts might be, that's not enough to justify removal as was pointed out in Peacock?"
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2542.234,2542.769,"No, sir."
1974.73-1531,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2543.052,2550.585,"They pointed out that there was one of the remedies with the criminal -- with the federal criminal laws, as well as the federal civil law?"
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2550.585,2552.052,"That was correct, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1974.73-1531,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2563.11,2564.038,The criminal prosecution?
1974.73-1531,1,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2564.038,2573.747,"Right, perhaps, criminal prosecution and of course appeal throughout the state system and to this Court itself."
1974.73-1531,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2573.747,2575.873,"Thank you, Mr. Noble."
1974.73-1531,2,24466,frank_r_parker,,2578.276,2581.221,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1531,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2698.931,2715.339,"Let's assume that the indictment or the charge is that someone killed somebody or broke in to some store or something -- broke into a store in the course of a demonstration, assume that's the charge."
1974.73-1531,2,24466,frank_r_parker,,2719.78,2721.217,That's correct.
1974.73-1531,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2721.217,2724.814,And -- but you would say it's nevertheless removable?
1974.73-1531,2,24466,frank_r_parker,,2724.814,2727.689,If the fact show that the charge is spurious.
1974.73-1531,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2727.689,2736.877,"So, you would say that anytime at a hearing you can show that this is a completely fraudulent prosecution that it should be removed?"
1974.73-1531,2,24466,frank_r_parker,,2736.877,2739.168,"That's right, if the prosecution is fraudulent."
1974.73-1531,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2739.168,2741.319,You don't think that's contrary to Peacock?
1974.73-1531,2,24466,frank_r_parker,,2741.319,2743.124,"No, it's not contrary to Peacock at all."
1974.73-1531,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2834.648,2848.612,"Is it true about the -- it's equally true, isn't it, about the civil statutes, the civil right statutes going back to the reconstruction days?"
1974.73-1531,2,24466,frank_r_parker,,2848.612,2849.248,What is the --
1974.73-1531,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2849.248,2849.912,Which were involved?
1974.73-1531,2,24466,frank_r_parker,,2855.062,2855.726,Yes.
1974.73-1531,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2855.726,2862.855,"And yet we held -- the Court held, did it not, in the City of Greenwood case that that wasn't enough."
1974.73-1531,2,24466,frank_r_parker,,2867.028,2878.794,"Well, the Court in Peacock, I believe the ruling, the holding of the Court was that those statutes invoked were not specifically statutes which were stated in terms of racial equality."
1974.73-1531,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2879.152,2883.985,"Well, that's part of the holding but some of the statutes were?"
1974.73-1531,2,24466,frank_r_parker,,2883.985,2893.988,"Yes, but those statutes, 1981 and 1971, were not statutes specifically protected the conduct and activity of the petitioners."
1974.73-1531,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2917.483,2917.666,Mr. Parker.
1974.73-1531,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2917.666,2919.334,Pursing --
1974.73-1531,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2919.334,2920.841,"After you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-1531,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2920.841,2941.813,"Pursuing Mr. Justice White's question to you, is it possible that in the removal hearing might turn into a miniature trial of the criminal charges to determine in the murder case or the break in -- a house break in, in order to determine the issues?"
1974.73-1531,2,24466,frank_r_parker,,2941.813,2955.52,"Well, an evidentiary hearing as required by Rachel and the Court indicated that the plaintiffs or the petitioners did have an opportunity to prove that they were asked to leave the restaurant for racial reasons."
1974.73-1531,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2975.967,2979.968,But the state would have to prove a prima facie case at the removal hearing?
1974.73-1531,2,24466,frank_r_parker,,2979.968,2981.541,That's correct.
1974.73-1531,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2995.581,3010.229,"Mr. Parker, in responding to Mr. Justice White, you stated as I understood you, that if a defendant could show that the charged were fraudulent or brought in bad faith that he would be entitled to a removal."
1974.73-1531,2,24466,frank_r_parker,,3020.795,3022.155,"That's correct, Mr. Justice."
1974.73-1531,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3052.102,3056.376,You say you'd have alternative remedies?
1974.73-1531,2,24466,frank_r_parker,,3056.376,3064.652,"Well, the Court certainly in Peacock held that there were alternative remedies where the First Amendment rights, for example, were alleged to be violated."
1974.73-1531,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3108.283,3109.001,Thank you gentlemen.
