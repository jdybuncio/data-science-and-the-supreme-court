1990.90-757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,15.401,"We'll hear first this morning in No. 90-757, Ronald Chisom v. Charles Roemer, consolidated with 90-1032, United States against Charles Roemer."
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,17.394,20.546,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,218.657,229.525,"General Starr, there is some authority for the proposition that there is no one-vote one-person requirement in election for judges."
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,239.142,251.16,"The line of authority, and it is clear that judges are not covered by the one-person one-vote principle, is inapplicable here."
1990.90-757,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,286.996,301.636,"But if the judges are representatives in the way that you have described, then ought we to rethink that line of authority and indicate that one-person one-vote does apply to all representatives?"
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,314.232,318.476,"I respectfully disagree, and we certainly are not urging that."
1990.90-757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,384.803,391.999,"Well, what is the test then in a vote dilution claim if it applies to judges?"
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,391.999,410.882,"The test in a vote dilution claim is whether there is in fact, under the totality of the circumstances as set forth in section 2(b), less of an opportunity for minority persons to participate fully in the political process and to elect candidates of their choice."
1990.90-757,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,412.875,414.214,"Less than what, General Starr?"
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,430.776,431.167,--Less--
1990.90-757,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,431.167,432.289,You need a standard of watering.
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,435.881,440.645,"--The standard is less than others, less than nonminority persons."
1990.90-757,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,440.645,445.51,"But you have said it's okay to have less of a chance than others in other counties, right?"
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,445.51,451.085,"No, in terms of equal protection principles as embodied in one-person one-vote."
1990.90-757,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,467.278,470.491,"Could you give me, you know, just what the baseline is?"
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,475.553,475.804,Right.
1990.90-757,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,475.804,480.708,"People are supposed to have, no matter what their race, the same say."
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,490.285,498.75,I would commend to the Court the vast body of law that the Senate report in 1982 looked to.
1990.90-757,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,526.201,531.516,Did they also involve candidates who were subject to the one-person one-vote requirement?
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,531.516,541.131,"Some did, and some rejected one-person one-vote challenges while at the same time vindicating a vote dilution challenge brought by minorities."
1990.90-757,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,541.131,545.094,Did they involve offices that were not subject to the one-person one-vote requirement?
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,545.094,549.379,"I don't think any of those did, but some may."
1990.90-757,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,561.567,563.59,"Well, don't make me go back and read all those cases."
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,567.584,575.46,"The baseline is set forth in the statute, and that baseline is the totality of the circumstances."
1990.90-757,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,575.46,575.881,What does that mean?
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,578.776,579.226,Correct.
1990.90-757,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,579.226,580.788,I do not think that's a baseline.
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,580.788,583.841,That's the congressionally mandated baseline.
1990.90-757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,601.134,610.04,"Well, wasn't, White against Regester was based on the Equal Protection Clause, wasn't it?"
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,610.04,610.962,That is correct.
1990.90-757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,610.962,612.734,So it was a constitutional law case.
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,612.734,613.593,That is correct.
1990.90-757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,613.593,617.906,"And what happened to White against Regester in Bolden, do you think?"
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,617.906,619.707,What happened?
1990.90-757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,619.707,623.74,What happened to it in the Bolden case?
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,623.74,630.315,"In the Bolden case it eventually went back, after this Court's decision in Bolden, and the challenge was rejected."
1990.90-757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,630.315,634.619,"But what happened to the White against Regester, if anything?"
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,634.619,635.688,"Oh, they broke up the districts."
1990.90-757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,635.688,636.279,Well--
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,636.279,639.17,They were at-large districts and they broke them up.
1990.90-757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,639.17,645.415,--Do you think the vote dilution part of White against Regester survived Bolden as a constitutional matter?
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,645.415,649.779,"Oh, as a constitutional matter, perhaps it did not."
1990.90-757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,649.779,649.889,Well--
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,649.889,655.024,But the point is Congress said this is the standard in section 2--
1990.90-757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,655.024,662.587,"--Well, I know, but what was the Congress' authority to pass section 2, the amendment to section 2?"
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,662.587,664.51,--The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.
1990.90-757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,664.51,667.032,You think it was the Fifteenth?
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,667.834,669.075,It could be... I think it could be both.
1990.90-757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,671.709,681.754,Even though Bolden said there was no such equal protection requirement in the Fourteenth Amendment?
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,681.754,685.046,Bolden said exactly that--
1990.90-757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,685.046,694.543,"So, but Congress has the authority to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment in a way that the Court said wasn't required?"
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,694.543,695.194,--Correct.
1990.90-757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,741.599,745.602,"Does it incorporate, in your view, our holding in Thornburg and Gingles?"
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,745.602,747.375,Does what incorporate?
1990.90-757,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,748.154,753.569,The totality of circumstances test that you advocate as the correct standard under the section that is here involved.
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,753.569,760.604,I think Thornburg against Gingles sets forth this Court's reading of what the Senate report factors pointed to.
1990.90-757,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,765.238,767.599,Do you think it should be applied to the election of judges?
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,767.599,776.626,"--I think that the standards set forth in section 2, and as interpreted in, by this Court, should be applied to the election of judges."
1990.90-757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,776.626,778.756,But Gingles--
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,797.259,808.047,"Well, I think something very important is involved in the election of judges, and this is the State interest and its structure of the judiciary."
1990.90-757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,858.195,866.2,"It just, it isn't clear to me how you think Gingles would apply in the absence of a one-person one-vote requirement."
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,871.325,873.706,It may not apply in full measure.
1990.90-757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,910.564,920.051,"General Starr, do you think that the section 2(b) requirements extend to merit selection retention elections as well?"
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,920.051,923.224,"That issue is not before us, but I think it does."
1990.90-757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,932.059,935.001,"Well, how about an election on referendum measures--"
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,935.001,936.593,We believe it applies.
1990.90-757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,936.593,939.304,--despite the use of the word representatives?
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,939.304,939.545,Yes.
1990.90-757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,939.545,942.637,It's a little hard to argue that a referendum is a representative.
1990.90-757,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,942.637,951.395,"Yes, it is, but I would suggest that, very briefly, that the function of 2(b) is to tell us what the 2(a) standard is all about."
1990.90-757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1012.194,1014.515,"Very well, General Starr."
1990.90-757,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1016.676,1020.49,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1064.182,1077.292,"Excuse me, but that assumes that the State is taking nothing into account except numbers, and it presumably is also taking into account geography, the nature of the political units into which these districts are drawn."
1990.90-757,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1082.978,1085.83,"--No, that's not the sole criterion, of course, Justice Scalia."
1990.90-757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1085.83,1087.28,It's the sole one you're willing to judge them on.
1990.90-757,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1091.444,1092.585,"Well, to begin with--"
1990.90-757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1092.585,1094.956,"And their answer might be well, we have different geographic regions and there are different--"
1990.90-757,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1094.956,1103.943,"--Well, their answer might be, Your Honor, that they don't think that representing black people on the State supreme court is as important as representing Cajuns, which is one of the reasons they have the districts that they have now."
1990.90-757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1103.943,1108.177,"--That may well be, but you can make that argument about any political arrangement that they make."
1990.90-757,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1110.808,1111.489,"Well, right."
1990.90-757,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1181.802,1198.816,"--But if we had that kind of a scheme we would at least, or the court that has to, that had to draw the district or find the violation would at least have on the numerical issue a principled basis for saying yes, there can be a district of appropriate size."
1990.90-757,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1207.184,1212.697,"Well, to begin with in this case, as I already alluded to, the districting size that the State already has."
1990.90-757,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1215.421,1221.605,"Well, what if the State is not quite to cooperative, and what if the figures aren't quite that neat?"
1990.90-757,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1238.074,1254.637,"--Well, Justice Souter, in this case because it's a State supreme court, I would suggest that if the State of Louisiana had one district with 3 million people in it and another district with 12 people in it, that would violate the Equal Protection Clause because it would be arbitrary, regardless of whether one-person one-vote applied."
1990.90-757,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1425.585,1448.609,"So would you... you would take the position that in a State that for instance had five supreme court justices, and they were all elected Statewide, that a 2(b) claim could be made out and the State could be forced to set up a separate district for the election?"
1990.90-757,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1448.609,1449.861,"--No, Justice O'Connor."
1990.90-757,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1470.307,1472.58,How is that different from proportional representation?
1990.90-757,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1472.58,1476.434,"--It's not proportional representation for two reasons, Justice Kennedy."
1990.90-757,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1486.182,1489.704,"Well, what is the object of your cumulative voting exercise?"
1990.90-757,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1489.704,1494.45,"To give black citizens in Louisiana a say on who sits on the supreme court, the same as--"
1990.90-757,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1494.45,1495.419,And how do you measure that say?
1990.90-757,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1497.802,1499.482,--Candidates of their choice.
1990.90-757,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1501.114,1502.055,"Well, candidates of their choice."
1990.90-757,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1504.287,1505.636,"--No, it's not proportional--"
1990.90-757,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1505.636,1509.65,You define proportional representation as just being a racial calculus?
1990.90-757,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1509.65,1519.277,"--That's what the Senate sought to avoid, is the idea that you had to have a token black person on every body in order to, in order to satisfy the Voting Rights Act."
1990.90-757,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1519.948,1527.694,"No, I think the suggestion here is that members of the black community want to be able to identify a candidate as is theirs."
1990.90-757,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1531.077,1533.32,"--It is, but it's not proportional representation, Justice Kennedy."
1990.90-757,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1542.978,1552.973,"Well, but if you have an identifiable candidate, regardless of the race of that candidate, representing a racial group, I think that's proportional representation, or otherwise it's just a quibble."
1990.90-757,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1552.973,1555.254,"--Well, I don't think it's just a quibble."
1990.90-757,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1594.127,1599.51,And you're telling me that it's irrelevant the race of the members who serve on the supreme court of the State of Louisiana in this case?
1990.90-757,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1599.51,1601.351,May I have leave to answer that question?
1990.90-757,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1601.351,1603.384,"You may answer the question, Ms. Karlan, yes."
1990.90-757,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1603.384,1604.894,I'm not telling you it's irrelevant.
1990.90-757,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1625.219,1626.19,"Thank you, Ms. Karlan."
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1627.793,1633.786,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-757,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1734.373,1746.042,"Mr. Pugh, is there some accepted explanation for why some of the seats on the supreme court are geographically... by geographic regions, and others are at large?"
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1746.042,1747.141,Yes.
1990.90-757,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1798.609,1804.743,The proposal was to move from five geographic districts to have all seven by geographic districts?
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1804.743,1805.024,"--Yes, sir."
1990.90-757,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1806.125,1806.295,And that was--
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1806.295,1813.001,"--The proposal was to have seven districts, as distinguished from having six districts--"
1990.90-757,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1813.001,1813.161,--Six?
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1813.161,1815.354,--and then a combination on the seventh.
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1906.576,1910.889,What have these numbers got to do with the legal issue here?
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,1910.889,1922.807,"Well, I was trying to illustrate for the benefit of the Court that, as suggested by the Chief, why the districts, and trying to explain that that's what the people want."
1990.90-757,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2054.38,2055.062,Mr. Pugh--
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2055.062,2055.679,Yes.
1990.90-757,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2055.679,2063.956,"--Is it your position that judges are not covered by 2(b), but are covered by 2(a)?"
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2063.956,2065.485,"Yes, sir, that is my position."
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2115.394,2117.765,Which requires an intent.
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2117.765,2119.516,"That's right, Your Honor."
1990.90-757,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2165.861,2167.384,"Because it makes sense, you say?"
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2185.255,2188.656,"That's our answer, as provided in subsection (b), which carries--"
1990.90-757,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2188.656,2193.562,But subsection (b) provides that it doesn't cover anything except representatives.
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2193.562,2194.724,"--That is absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-757,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2194.724,2197.836,So that leaves subsection (a) covering nothing except representatives.
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2197.836,2198.927,Then issues are out.
1990.90-757,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2198.927,2199.877,"You suddenly jump off there, right?"
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2199.877,2200.087,Not at all.
1990.90-757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2275.137,2276.669,"Mr. Pugh, can I ask you a question?"
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2276.669,2277.03,"--Yes, sir."
1990.90-757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2277.03,2281.05,In White against Regester the Court's opinion used the term legislators--
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2281.05,2281.561,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2281.561,2283.143,--and then Congress substituted the word representatives.
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2287.825,2288.646,"Yes, sir, it is."
1990.90-757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2288.646,2289.177,What is--
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2289.177,2295.311,"Why they switched from legislators to representatives, I don't know and I doubt seriously if anybody knows except perhaps them."
1990.90-757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2295.311,2298.333,--What does it include in addition to legislators in your--
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2298.333,2299.715,I think it includes the executives.
1990.90-757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2299.715,2300.977,--Includes all the executives.
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2302.848,2306.1,"It would be someone... well, I think it's in there for two reasons."
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2406.815,2417.122,You suggest that the Congress didn't use legislator and used representative in order to cover the executive branch?
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2417.122,2419.715,I know of no other reason there could possibly be than that.
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2419.715,2425.119,What... let's just take Louisiana for example.
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2425.119,2425.439,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2425.439,2433.587,Let's say that section 2(a) could apply to the executive branch in Louisiana.
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2433.587,2433.977,"Yes, sir."
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2433.977,2441.992,"Give me an example of an office to which it would apply that isn't a one-person office, and indivisible office."
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2441.992,2443.202,"Excuse me, school board."
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2443.202,2445.014,School boards?
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2445.014,2446.654,"Yes, sir, and I think that's really what--"
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2446.654,2448.337,Is that about it?
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2448.337,2449.616,"--Well, that's one of them."
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2460.945,2465.077,And you think... and school boards would qualify as representatives?
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2465.077,2469.62,"Yes, sir, I would, because I think they have that dual function."
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2469.62,2475.275,"And they, school boards are sometimes, they are mostly elected at large, aren't they, or not?"
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2475.275,2479.618,"Yes, they are primarily elected at large."
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2489.434,2504.385,"Well, I guess it's... the Court has been reasonably clear that section 2(a) applies to judges, Mr. Pugh?"
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2504.385,2505.587,Section--
1990.90-757,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2505.587,2506.588,2(a).
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2506.588,2509.199,--I believe it applies to judges.
1990.90-757,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2518.014,2530.823,"Well, of course 2(a) itself was amended, as Justice Scalia noted in his question to you, to include the word results and to refer specifically to 2(b)."
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2530.823,2532.546,It trickles down to 2(b).
1990.90-757,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2555.262,2583.171,"Well, if 2(a) applies and it refers in 2(a) to the word results, and it incorporates whatever the standard is in 2(b), you have to put a tremendous amount of freight on the word representatives to say somehow you can't look at the totality of the circumstances when it comes to judicial election."
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2583.171,2590.227,"Well, I put no more freight on it than what Congress apparently did, because that's all they said."
1990.90-757,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2608.27,2628.774,"Mr. Pugh, what about... what 2(b) says is that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate not just to elect representatives of their choice, but to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice."
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2628.774,2630.384,"That's a conjunction, Your Honor."
1990.90-757,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2630.384,2631.355,It is indeed.
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2634.438,2637.109,"I'm not being playful, or I shouldn't be in any event."
1990.90-757,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2639.14,2639.32,Right.
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2643.493,2644.955,"Not when the conjunction is there, Your Honor."
1990.90-757,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2644.955,2647.456,"Well, they're entitled to both."
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2647.456,2649.808,"Well, they are not representatives."
1990.90-757,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2649.808,2650.349,They are entitled to both.
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2653.421,2664.36,"Well, let's put it under the intent standard then rather than the results standard, because the results standard says specifically that it's related to representatives of their choice."
1990.90-757,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2671.433,2675.727,"What does participate in the political process in 2(b) mean, do you think?"
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2675.727,2676.237,To vote.
1990.90-757,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2676.237,2682.201,It's clear to elect representatives of their choice does get you into the dilution issue.
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2682.201,2682.672,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-757,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2682.672,2685.176,What about participating in the political process?
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2685.576,2686.436,That's to vote.
1990.90-757,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2686.436,2687.878,--To vote?
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2687.878,2692.459,To vote and elect representatives of your choice.
1990.90-757,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2700.825,2703.728,Do the justices in Louisiana represent anybody?
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2703.728,2706.099,Do they represent anybody?
1990.90-757,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2706.099,2706.269,Yeah.
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2706.269,2711.623,"Well, not in the sense that the word representation is used here."
1990.90-757,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2712.644,2720.027,"Oh, you mean represent means something one place, and something else another place, and something else a third place?"
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2720.027,2721.449,"Well, I can only suggest--"
1990.90-757,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2721.449,2723.03,Or do we use the common phrase?
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2733.428,2737.66,--He may well feel that he--
1990.90-757,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2737.66,2741.112,"Well, doesn't he in fact represent them?"
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2741.112,2746.417,--He is elected by those people to serve on the court on their behalf.
1990.90-757,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2747.487,2751.21,And don't you think that requires one-person one-vote?
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2751.21,2755.784,"--Well, I can only say--"
1990.90-757,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2755.784,2757.294,"Well, I notice you say one-man one-vote."
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2760.557,2760.707,--I apologize.
1990.90-757,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2897.565,2898.436,--Mr. Pugh--
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2898.436,2899.007,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-757,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2899.007,2906.593,"--You don't agree, then, that before the amendments in 1982 judges were covered by the act?"
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2906.593,2908.704,"Yes, sir, they were, because it was intent."
1990.90-757,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2915.61,2922.355,So judges were covered under the applicable standard of the act before the 1982 amendment?
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2922.355,2922.936,"--Yes, sir."
1990.90-757,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2922.936,2932.712,"Well then it wasn't such a dramatic change, as you say, to say that they would continue to be covered after the 1982 amendments."
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2932.712,2940.459,"Well, I think it's a dramatic change in that they are definitively covered for the purpose of this brand new results test."
1990.90-757,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2940.459,2945.231,But so is everybody else brand new covered for the purpose of that results test.
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,2945.231,2947.103,"Representatives are, Your Honor."
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3048.893,3073.83,"Do you think if Bolden had never been decided, and White against Regester was still hail and hearty, do you think that, do you think that this at-large election in Orleans Parish could have been attacked under the standard written about in White against Regester?"
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3073.83,3080.465,I don't think so.
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3080.465,3082.288,Sir?
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3082.288,3085.099,Apparently I should have said yes.
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3091.541,3092.492,"I think so, too."
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3096.475,3097.817,If I may be candid enough to repeat my--
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3097.817,3105.553,--Don't you think that Congress intended to have that test applied as a statutory matter in section 2?
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3105.553,3108.165,"--2 or 2(b), Your Honor?"
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3108.165,3108.595,Section 2(b).
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3108.595,3110.266,"No, Your Honor, I do not."
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3131.53,3139.257,"Well, you still have to get over the notion, you have to convince us that judges aren't covered by the word representative."
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3139.257,3143.839,"Well, I could drag out some dictionaries."
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3143.839,3144.27,Well--
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3144.27,3151.555,I don't find it... I do find cases holding that they are not representatives.
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3199.168,3201.84,--Six of those judges in the Fifth Circuit thought that they were covered.
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3201.84,3202.721,"Yes, they did, Your Honor."
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3202.721,3204.881,"Seven didn't, I guess."
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3204.881,3206.06,"That's right, Your Honor."
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3214.838,3216.799,All those six didn't read the dictionaries.
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3216.799,3218.361,"--Well, not very well."
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3243.358,3243.638,Yes.
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3243.638,3245.271,And then of course we had the--
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3245.271,3245.669,Dissent.
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3245.669,3247.472,"--the chief, who concurred."
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3267.237,3267.577,Yes.
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3267.577,3274.522,I think it's the blindfolded lady with a sword and with a scale.
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3299.831,3311.78,"Well, of course a State can elect their judges, I suppose, and empower the electorate to throw the judge if they don't like the way he decides cases."
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3311.78,3313.833,"--And that's exactly what is going to happen, Your Honor, if--"
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3313.833,3319.395,"Well, that's exactly what, that's exactly what happens in Louisiana and Texas, isn't it?"
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3319.395,3320.177,--I don't believe--
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3320.177,3324.399,If the electorate doesn't like how the judge operates they throw him out.
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3324.399,3331.114,"--Well, that's what the law provides, but I guarantee you one thing, not too many of them shed the robes."
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3337.377,3338.96,"Well, what about that 10 percent?"
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3338.96,3355.119,"--Well, they may have been doing what I would hope would never occur, that is to show favoritism to a certain group or to show stupidity in the decisions when they render them."
1990.90-757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3361.023,3366.419,And you don't think that even comes close to suggesting that they are representative?
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3366.419,3367.356,"No, Your Honor, I don't."
1990.90-757,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3381.696,3382.487,"Thank you, Mr. Pugh."
1990.90-757,2,40227,robert_g_pugh,,3384.039,3385.09,"--Yes, I have, and I apologize, Your Honor."
1990.90-757,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3388.494,3392.805,"General Starr, you have 3 minutes remaining for rebuttal."
1990.90-757,3,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3392.805,3394.706,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.90-757,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3406.814,3407.495,Have we held that?
