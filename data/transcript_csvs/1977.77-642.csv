1977.77-642,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,26.539,We will hear arguments next in Parker against Flook.
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,31.745,34.906,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.77-642,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,353.461,362.038,"Mr. Wallace you told me turn to 63a, where I find B1=B0?"
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,364.155,367.579,It is not necessary to get involved in the details of these equations.
1977.77-642,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,522.182,524.344,That is only one ingredient of a combination.
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,533.062,536.233,"So far as I am aware, there never has been a --"
1977.77-642,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,536.233,542.651,"That is what this is clearly, it is a combination and this is one element of a combination."
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,565.756,577.738,"There could be a combination patent on a series of steps, processes putting together processes that formerly had not been put together."
1977.77-642,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,583.78,589.979,"That depends upon Sections 102 and 103, not 101."
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,589.979,590.76,"Well, that would."
1977.77-642,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,590.76,592.533,Which was never reached by the examiner in this case?
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,592.533,605.291,"No, it may be that -- the decision in this case is not based on any contention of combination patent."
1977.77-642,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,605.291,606.82,He never got there.
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,606.82,607.863,It never got there.
1977.77-642,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,610.972,612.368,"well, that is what it clearly is, isn't it?"
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,622.75,625.0,It is a process claim.
1977.77-642,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,625.0,628.057,"Exactly, it is a method or process claim."
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,628.057,639.416,"The claim is on the process set forth in part one, the parts -- claims two through 10 are all dependent on that."
1977.77-642,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,647.494,655.2,"A process consisting of several steps, only one of which is this…"
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,655.2,660.865,"Well, in a sense, claim one itself is a combination of steps."
1977.77-642,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,663.453,665.078,Certainly it is.
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,669.686,670.969,That is correct.
1977.77-642,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,719.589,725.961,What do you think about my hypothetical case about an applicant for a patent?
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,750.384,754.989,There is an old case in this Court that is very similar to that hypothetical.
1977.77-642,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,785.008,787.41,Obviously gravity itself is not patentable.
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,787.41,796.625,That is correct and every process claim is a claim about a series of steps to achieve a result.
1977.77-642,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,796.625,811.015,"Mr. Wallace, you say you cannot patent the Pythagorean Theorem but do you say a transit used in surveying is not patentable just because it employs the Pythagorean Theorem to accomplish its result?"
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,811.015,811.714,Not at all.
1977.77-642,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,866.358,873.189,You say this claim here did not address itself to any of the equipment involved?
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,873.189,873.927,It did not.
1977.77-642,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1109.27,1124.755,"What if he saw a patent with the algorithm and the conventional alarm adjusting equipment, he could not have been turned down solely on the basis that the whole thing was non-patentable subject matter?"
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1124.755,1126.231,"Excuse me, if he sought a patent on…"
1977.77-642,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1126.231,1132.271,Supposing if a claim included not only the algorithm but the machinery for putting the algorithm to use?
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1132.271,1141.966,"Well, if it is tied in to an apparatus which is itself an inventive contribution, an element of novelty then the process can be claimed."
1977.77-642,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1146.117,1161.728,"Supposing I went tomorrow to the patent office and applied for a patent on the telephone, I assume I would be turned down but not on the grounds that it was non-patentable subject matter but on the grounds it was not novel."
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1161.728,1163.463,Of course if that was….
1977.77-642,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1163.463,1166.439,That would not be under 101 would it?
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1166.439,1168.764,That would not be under 101.
1977.77-642,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1187.947,1200.183,"Mr. Wallace, do you think this patent would foreclose use of this algorithm for any other possible imaginable purposes?"
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1200.183,1213.999,The Court of Customs Patent Appeals concluded that present claims do not preempt the formula or algorithm contained there in.
1977.77-642,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1268.846,1272.524,Well then is the argument is just how to construe the claims?
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1274.811,1279.007,I do not think it is an argument about how to construe the claims.
1977.77-642,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1279.007,1283.847,Do you mean the Court is legally wrong even if it is true what they said here?
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1288.575,1295.728,We say that it is legal error that the Board of Appeals resolved the question correctly.
1977.77-642,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1295.728,1300.172,"Mr. Wallace, let us assume, that it is correct what the Court of Appeals said."
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1307.74,1309.204,That is correct.
1977.77-642,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1317.928,1328.368,"Let us just say they solved it and found another use for it, would it infringe these claims and the Court of Appeals says it would not and if you agree with that, that it would not --"
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1328.368,1330.275,That is correct.
1977.77-642,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1343.914,1344.167,I remember the argument.
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1344.167,1369.806,But that would make Benson a valid patent claim and in other words if the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals is correct here then this Court’s decision in Benson is really reduced to just a drafting obstacle and the drafting of patent claims.
1977.77-642,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1387.048,1399.487,But the Court of Appeals construed this patent as though it were just a application for a patent for a peace of machinery?
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1399.487,1400.942,"No, it was a process application."
1977.77-642,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1400.942,1404.044,"Alright, just an ordinary process application."
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1404.044,1405.946,But using this algorithm.
1977.77-642,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1405.946,1408.417,"Yes, using the algorithm that is right."
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1408.417,1433.182,If I can focus exactly the way the controversy was put below on page 12a of the Appendix to our petition the controversy concerned this quotation in the middle of page 12a which was from a prior opinion of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals applying this Court’s decision in Benson.
1977.77-642,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1547.645,1551.473,But he is not the only one that feels that way about Benson isn't it?
1977.77-642,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1551.473,1563.2,"Well, apparently his colleagues feel the same way and they have construed Benson as I say they are reducing Benson to be nothing but a drafting obstacle."
1977.77-642,1,20511,d_dennis_allegretti,,1683.206,1687.188,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1977.77-642,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3341.471,3352.422,"In the limited time, I have remaining, I have to take issue with respondent’s characterization of the Funk case and with his analogy to the putter in the laboratory."
1977.77-642,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3385.761,3398.603,"But Mr. Wallace, in this particular patent, this relates to conversion of hydrocarbons, you would not say the patent would preclude the use of this algorithm to make bathtubs or something like that."
1977.77-642,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3398.603,3403.361,"But if he had listed it to make bathtubs, then it would have precluded it to make bathtubs also."
1977.77-642,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3410.549,3411.972,But he did not make that determination.
1977.77-642,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3411.972,3425.149,"He did not make it but we are talking about whether he can get it for whatever end use if he specifies, if the only thing new is the algorithm which is comparable to a phenomenon of nature."
1977.77-642,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3523.389,3527.1,Let me ask one other question about the government's position I am not entirely clear on.
1977.77-642,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3550.044,3555.636,We would say there has to be novelty in the end use.
1977.77-642,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3558.106,3560.282,If there is novelty --.
1977.77-642,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3560.282,3564.739,The use itself must produce an unexpected result.
1977.77-642,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3564.739,3566.853,Just try to listen to my question.
1977.77-642,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3578.411,3595.665,"That is a patentable process patent but tied into that end use or that apparatus, that is what we understand Benson and Funk to mean and Benson saying that Funk applies to process patents."
1977.77-642,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3626.583,3627.26,Thank you gentlemen.
