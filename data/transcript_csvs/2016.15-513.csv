2016.15-513,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.095,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case No. 15-513, State Farm Fire and Casualty Company v. United States, ex rel. Rigsby. Ms. Sullivan."
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,11.095,38.07,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The False Claims Act asks very little of a private qui tam relator who would step into the government's shoes, file under seal, serve only on the government, and maintain the seal until it is lifted. Respondents here violated that requirement. They leaked the content and existence of their suit to the Associated Press, ABC, and the New York Times."
2016.15-513,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,54.27,59.335,Did you seek any sanction of -- for the seal violations other than dismissal?
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,59.335,60.28,"We did not, Your Honor."
2016.15-513,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,61.87,62.575,Why not?
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,62.575,71.6,"Your Honor, we think dismissal was the appropriate sanction and that any alternative sanction would be toothless here for -- for -- just to begin --"
2016.15-513,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,71.6,84.165,"From -- from -- perhaps from the defendant's point of view, but I thought the whole purpose of sealing the materials was not to tip off the defendant."
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,117.865,130.44,"Your Honor, we think that Congress intended a statutory bargain that does not give the government absolute discretion to decide whether the seal has been violated. And let me explain first what the statutory bargain is."
2016.15-513,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,150.75,153.87,"And if it's a condition for the government's benefit, the government can waive it."
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,153.87,155.58,"Your Honor, we don't agree with that."
2016.15-513,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,162.35,171.49,"Well, just under Justice Ginsburg's question, why -- why don't the defendants have a stronger interest in having the seal requirement followed than the government does?"
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,171.49,173.35,"Respectfully, I disagree, Your Honor."
2016.15-513,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,173.35,174.7,That's the point of the question right now.
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,174.7,176.54,"Yes, but let me go back to the question."
2016.15-513,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,243.87,253.025,"So you're arguing -- you're arguing the government's interests, but it -- it rings a little hollow when we see that the government is on the other side."
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,253.025,254.88,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.15-513,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,282.57,286.52,"But in Hallstrom -- Hallstrom, the plaintiff could re-file."
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,302.44,313.06,"Your Honor, if I make no point clearer today, let me make this point clear: The suit does not go away on our rule; the relators go away on our rule."
2016.15-513,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,313.69,327.125,"Yes, but that puts the government to the choice of not having the relator to go forward for it, and it has to either take up the reins itself or say, well, we have too many other things on our plate; we have to let it go."
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,327.125,337.96,"Your Honor, the government here is free to intervene even after the relators are dismissed, no matter how late it is in the suit."
2016.15-513,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,357.64,359.185,But the government starts again.
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,359.185,360.16,"It does, Your Honor."
2016.15-513,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,360.16,362.465,The judgment that was entered here would be nullified.
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,362.465,365.12,"That's correct, Your Honor. But the same thing happened in Hallstrom."
2016.15-513,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,373.09,374.06,I -- please.
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,374.525,375.47,"Sorry, Justice Kagan."
2016.15-513,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,375.47,376.285,"No, please."
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,376.285,390.03,"I just want to make the point that if the government has already intervened, which it didn't do in this case because three years of investigations found no fraud, if the government has already intervened, then Justice Ginsburg's dilemma will never occur."
2016.15-513,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,412.44,416.91,You mentioned Hallstrom a couple of times --
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,416.91,417.32,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-513,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,417.32,419.0,-- and rely on it heavily in the briefs.
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,473.745,481.425,"That is correct, Your Honor. We do not have an express statement of what the remedial sanction is for a violation of the seal."
2016.15-513,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,504.24,510.965,But what about the point that I made before with respect to Hallstrom? Hallstrom didn't put the plaintiffs out of court.
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,535.315,536.06,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-513,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,620.74,652.38,"Well, you have two arguments: One is that dismissal is mandatory; the other is that the district court and the court of appeals applied the wrong standard in determining not to dismiss here. As to the first, what would you say about the case where the disclosure is very limited, seen by only one person, let's say; it was inadvertent, it was not done in bad faith, and it causes no harm? You would say dismissal is required even under those circumstances?"
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,652.38,659.915,"Not necessarily, Your Honor. We think that dismissal is required where a disclosure rises to the level of a violation."
2016.15-513,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,687.22,687.67,But that doesn't --
2016.15-513,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,687.67,688.97,"Well, that's not this question."
2016.15-513,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,690.265,692.69,"That doesn't sound like a per se rule, then."
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,692.69,695.425,"A per se rule with de minimis exceptions, Your Honor."
2016.15-513,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,737.1,745.74,"Once you're there -- I mean, my thought was the same as Justice Alito's: Vast range of violations."
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,768.7,776.845,"Your Honor, we don't think that the Lujan factors were properly articulated or applied in this case."
2016.15-513,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,800.38,803.735,But the clients did not know that.
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,803.735,807.44,"Your Honor, that's not -- not correct on this record."
2016.15-513,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,808.17,812.83,"On the record, does it show that they did know it or they didn't know it?"
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,812.83,813.77,"Correct, Your Honor."
2016.15-513,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,814.19,815.2,Not correct.
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,820.2,827.69,The record -- the Fifth Circuit assumed that the lawyer's conduct could be imputed to the relators.
2016.15-513,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,827.69,830.92,But on the question of whether they knew it or not.
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,830.92,832.31,"Your Honor, we think that no --"
2016.15-513,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,832.31,834.725,Why did you never ask them or the lawyer?
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,834.725,838.51,"Well, Your Honor, we did ask them whether they authorized the conduct."
2016.15-513,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,840.0,842.775,So here we have ambiguity as respect to that.
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,875.125,880.93,"Your Honor, in this case, it was an abuse of discretion not to dismiss on the underlying facts."
2016.15-513,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,880.93,882.83,I don't have to worry about this case; you do.
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,882.83,883.2,You are correct.
2016.15-513,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,883.2,886.75,And I -- I have to worry about the right standard to write an opinion.
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,886.75,917.23,"Correct, Your Honor. And let me suggest, respectfully, why you should, at a minimum, vacate and remand for resolution of any remaining fact questions about imputation or the like, and that is because the articulation of the standard by Lujan, the court below, and courts following this toothless test basically have invited open season on deliberate, bad-faith leaks to the press. If you affirm and say this was good enough for abuse of discretion, then further -- Mr. Chief Justice?"
2016.15-513,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,917.23,924.54,I was just going to ask: I thought your very -- the very first question was that you didn't -- that your answer was that you didn't seek any sanction other than dismissal.
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,928.395,935.37,"It is, Your Honor, because dismissal should have been granted under a proper discretionary test, if you reject our per se rule."
2016.15-513,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,936.55,936.67,Right.
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,941.655,950.87,"We -- we asked for dismissal. And we asked for dismissal urging, at a minimum, a test that would take bad faith into account."
2016.15-513,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,959.455,974.255,"So if we go back -- and I haven't done this -- and look at the way the case was litigated, is there an argument from you that says, okay, if you're not going to automatically dismiss this case as we argue, you should do this as a second alternative."
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,974.255,983.48,"Yes, there is, Your Honor. We preserved at every stage the argument that if there is no per se dismissal, there should be dismissal based on a proper balancing test."
2016.15-513,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,988.44,992.12,"But again, you didn't ask for any sanction other than dismissal."
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,992.12,1004.46,"That is correct, Your Honor. Attorney discipline would do no good in a case where Mr. Scruggs had already been indicted and disbarred for reasons having nothing to do with his deliberate seal violations here."
2016.15-513,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1012.5,1016.245,"So then I do have one fundamental, factual question."
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1016.245,1016.89,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-513,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1016.89,1032.945,"As I'm reading the record below, the circuit, the Fifth Circuit, took the position that the only disclosure that would violate the seal requirement is the disclosure of the existence of the lawsuit."
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1082.605,1094.325,"So Your Honor, there is no question here that the existence of the complaint under the False Claims Act was literally revealed."
2016.15-513,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1138.495,1156.245,"And I thought the question was suppose these plaintiffs didn't reveal the complaint at all, but they described on a radio show, on a TV show, what they understood to be State Farm's practice."
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1162.955,1165.715,"Your Honor, that would be a different case."
2016.15-513,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1176.19,1183.44,Let's assume for the moment that there is a First Amendment right to discuss the actions that took place.
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1202.14,1259.95,"Then, Your Honor, if fraud was discussed without revealing the existence and content of the complaint itself, then there would not be a violation and the per se rule would apply, which is why our per se rule is narrower and less absolute than -- than my friends on the other side have portrayed it. But Your Honor, there may be times when a revelation of fraud and not the words ""here is our False Claims Act complaint,"" which was the case in this record, in which the revelation of the fraud was the functional equivalent of revealing the complaint. If a lawyer goes up on the courthouse steps, comes out on the courthouse steps and talks about fraud and then points to his briefcase and says, well, I can't, if somebody says, well, did you file a complaint, no, I can't talk about, there might be instances in which the exercise of First Amendment rights becomes the functional equivalent of fraud, and the district courts can work that out in deciding whether a disclosure rises to the level of a violation. But you don't have to face that here."
2016.15-513,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1284.6,1289.16,You said your test would put -- would make bad faith primary.
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1311.185,1314.87,"Your Honor, under our balancing test, it might not on those facts."
2016.15-513,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1319.58,1330.66,"Well, then, what does it mean for bad -- why do you say -- is it -- how is it first among equals? Why isn't it just something that a district court should take into account as this district court took it into account?"
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1330.66,1336.24,"Your Honor, we don't think the district court or the court of appeals did take bad faith into account."
2016.15-513,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1373.73,1374.34,"Well, but it did both."
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1401.89,1427.58,"Your Honor, we don't tend to let drug dealers off if the thing they think is marijuana that they are selling turns out to be oregano. We do care about state of mind at the time, and we don't just look to the accident or happenstance that it didn't cause harm in fact. Here, the courts, by looking to the consequences, failed to describe as severe -- and the government actually calls this a minor violation -- to leak the contents of the complaint to national news media."
2016.15-513,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1458.81,1477.395,"Can you -- can you tell me, just clarify what 3730(b) means when it says the action may be dismissed only if the Court and the Attorney General give written consent to the dismissal and their reasons for consenting."
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1477.395,1478.46,"I can, Your Honor."
2016.15-513,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1505.46,1519.625,"If there is a primary factor, why shouldn't the primary factor just be what the government wants? In other words, why shouldn't this be -- given that the government is the beneficiary of this provision, why shouldn't we give very significant discretion to the government?"
2016.15-513,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1519.625,1522.47,"Your Honor, this is a case of pure statutory construction."
2016.15-513,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1552.195,1558.665,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Singh?"
2016.15-513,1,62297,tejinder_singh,,1558.665,1595.96,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is, as the first half-hour illustrates, not really whether the courts will punish and deter violations of the False Claims Act seal requirement, but whether they will do so in a way that is counterproductive to the government's interest, or whether they will instead impose other sanctions that would benefit the government, allow cases to go forward, and simultaneously create an effective deterrent. The message that you're hearing from State Farm is that no other sanction will be effective; but the rule will be toothless, it will be open season, but history belies this claim."
2016.15-513,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1644.48,1690.805,"Well, if we issue an opinion -- when we issue an opinion in this case, it will change the legal landscape. And I would appreciate it if you would respond to one of the arguments Ms. Sullivan made toward the end, which is that if we issue an opinion that affirms in this case where there were -- which involves the type -- the greatest degree of bad faith in this -- in violating the seal requirement that is really possible to imagine, that will stand for the principal in future cases, that even if an instance in which there was complete bad faith, dismissal is not appropriate. Or a dismissal is -- can -- can properly be rejected."
2016.15-513,1,62297,tejinder_singh,,1690.805,1691.535,Sure.
2016.15-513,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1735.025,1739.06,"Do you have, just on the top of your head somewhere -- I -- I because I want to read this."
2016.15-513,1,62297,tejinder_singh,,1739.06,1744.605,"Petition Appendix 67A is where you'll find the district court's finding on this, I believe."
2016.15-513,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1744.605,1745.43,Okay.
2016.15-513,1,62297,tejinder_singh,,1745.43,1749.41,"You know, that the relators did not know, and then that was affirmed on appeal."
2016.15-513,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1749.41,1749.59,Okay.
2016.15-513,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1749.73,1756.11,But parties are usually held accountable for the actions of their attorneys.
2016.15-513,1,62297,tejinder_singh,,1756.11,1760.9,"To be sure, they are, ordinarily, when the attorney is acting within the scope of representation."
2016.15-513,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1812.745,1830.46,"You see, I -- I think this is going to protect the government's investigations. But the consequence of this is that there is a document somewhere in the court that says Joe Smith is a defendant in what could be a very harmful case to Joe Smith."
2016.15-513,1,62297,tejinder_singh,,1900.33,1901.05,Absolutely.
2016.15-513,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1944.26,1948.155,And before you -- I want to get a thorough answer of this because --
2016.15-513,1,62297,tejinder_singh,,1948.155,1948.41,Sure.
2016.15-513,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1948.41,1952.025,"-- however this case got here, it's here."
2016.15-513,1,62297,tejinder_singh,,1993.06,1993.635,Sure.
2016.15-513,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2199.46,2204.2,I think that it honestly asks very little of them when it comes to the seal requirement.
2016.15-513,1,62297,tejinder_singh,,2205.77,2205.95,So --
2016.15-513,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2205.95,2207.23,That's not asking a lot.
2016.15-513,1,62297,tejinder_singh,,2207.23,2211.25,So State Farm's position on this has morphed a little bit over time.
2016.15-513,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2272.59,2273.18,Right.
2016.15-513,1,62297,tejinder_singh,,2285.0,2302.42,"I think that's possible, Your Honor, and so, you know, that gets back to the question of what is and isn't a violation. I don't understand them to be taking that position in this case, and those kind of closed-case situations, you know, they aren't really before you. And, you know, as the summary of the history of False Claims Act seal violations tells you, that kind of stuff really is not happening."
2016.15-513,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2342.26,2364.465,"Well, what do you make of the -- how much weight do you think should be given to the fact that the government doesn't think that dismissal is appropriate in this situation? What -- what -- does the statute say that the complaint shall be filed under seal and shall be main -- maintained under seal unless the government waives that?"

2016.15-513,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2479.195,2491.155,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bash."
2016.15-513,2,29118,john_f_bash,,2491.155,2535.41,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Given the focus of the earlier portion of the argument, I will -- I'm happy to answer questions about why the automatic dismissal rule is wrong, but I will jump right to what we think the standard should be, how we think the Court ought to write the opinion, and then how we think the Court ought to dispose of this case. We think the standard for how to remedy a seal violation incorporates the basic background flexibility that district courts have always had to remedy violations of protective orders and sealing orders as informed by the basic purpose of this provision, which I think, as everyone has acknowledged now, is to protect the government by making sure that potential targets of criminal and civil investigations are not tipped off. And the reason you need that in the FCA is because the filing of the complaint does something very special."
2016.15-513,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2554.63,2558.87,And -- and -- and why does the government need that latitude?
2016.15-513,2,29118,john_f_bash,,2558.87,2569.82,It needs that latitude because defendants could potentially take steps to stymie an investigation if they know that there's an actual government attorney looking at this right now because they have to look at it under the statute.
2016.15-513,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2576.93,2607.985,"So -- well, let's get to that, okay, because do we look at the situation as it existed at the time of the violation and the risk it created? Or do we look at it ex post facto and decide it didn't, in fact, happen, so there is no harm? Shouldn't the severity be determined at the time it occurred? Giving a complaint to a news media is probably the best way to tip off a defendant."
2016.15-513,2,29118,john_f_bash,,2628.96,2630.6,"Well, let me take --"
2016.15-513,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2630.6,2647.19,"There is a disparity on how courts are treating those situations, but that's not necessarily at issue here. But what is at issue is, what do we measure the appropriate sanction to be and based on what evaluation?"
2016.15-513,2,29118,john_f_bash,,2647.19,2657.5,"Well, let me take the general question and bring it to the facts here, and then talk about that question of the disparity about how courts are treating the different kinds of violations. The answer on the general question is they are both relevant."
2016.15-513,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2696.16,2703.5,"Before you get to the facts here, I have this thought in my mind, which is that this is a court order."
2016.15-513,2,29118,john_f_bash,,2743.495,2745.26,I didn't disagree with anything you said.
2016.15-513,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2800.85,2805.89,When would the government be hurt by a sealing violation?
2016.15-513,2,29118,john_f_bash,,2805.89,2818.48,"I think what Congress had in mind is defendants taking steps to thwart the government investigation; for example, destroying evidence, declining to cooperate once they know that there is a formal investigation of them."
2016.15-513,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2847.88,2863.18,"In your brief, you did say -- on page 27 of your brief, you said that reputational harm to the defendant could be relevant to determining a sanction for seal violation."
2016.15-513,2,29118,john_f_bash,,2863.18,2865.94,"That's right, Justice Ginsburg, in an idiosyncratic case."
2016.15-513,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2882.04,2887.315,You were going to tell us how to write the ideal platonic opinion?
2016.15-513,2,29118,john_f_bash,,2887.315,2889.64,I wouldn't presume to say the platonic opinion.
2016.15-513,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2980.795,2985.59,"Do you think deference ought to be given to the government? And if so, as to what parts of the test?"
2016.15-513,2,29118,john_f_bash,,2985.59,2990.265,"Well, what we say in the brief is deference ought to be given to the government's statement that it's been harmed."
2016.15-513,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2998.05,2998.67,On actual harm?
2016.15-513,2,29118,john_f_bash,,2998.67,2998.835,Yeah.
2016.15-513,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3059.6,3068.74,"On the issue of harm to the government, did I understand you to say that the question is actual harm and not likelihood of harm at the time of the disclosure?"
2016.15-513,2,29118,john_f_bash,,3068.74,3074.455,"We think on that factor, it's actual harm, but we think the second factor, severity, correlates with potential harm."
2016.15-513,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3078.85,3091.525,"And do you think it might be helpful for this Court to clarify that when we're talking about the severity of the violation, part of what we are talking about is the likelihood that the violation might cause harm?"
2016.15-513,2,29118,john_f_bash,,3091.525,3093.84,I think it would be helpful for the opinion to say that.
2016.15-513,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3102.66,3104.01,You can finish your sentence.
2016.15-513,2,29118,john_f_bash,,3104.01,3108.82,They talked about the most severe violation being just a blatant filing of the complaint publicly.
2016.15-513,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3114.13,3119.165,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Sullivan, four minutes."
2016.15-513,3,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,3119.165,3158.795,"When you write the opinion reversing or vacating, we trust that you will clarify that actual harm to the government is not a requirement for dismissal. And let me just remind you, in answer to your question, Justice Ginsburg, when will the government concede actual harm, it's not dispositive. It's dispositive if the government says there's actual harm, yes, or heavily weighted and possibly dispositive if they say it. But to remind you, as we point out on page 20 of our reply brief, the government hasn't admitted it was actually harmed, except in one case, the Le Blanc-ITT case, in 30 years."
2016.15-513,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3397.42,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
