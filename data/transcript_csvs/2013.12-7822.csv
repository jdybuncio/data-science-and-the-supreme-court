2013.12-7822,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.154,"We'll hear argument next today in Case 12-7822, Fernandez v. California."
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,7.137,9.939,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-7822,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,65.808,70.66,That's the reason -- maybe I should put to you at the outset the problem with the case that's bothering me.
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,143.793,152.898,"--She can invite them in, Justice Breyer, and the police, within about 15 minutes, can get a warrant and come right in and--"
2013.12-7822,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,152.898,153.75,On what basis?
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,153.75,154.65,--Pardon me?
2013.12-7822,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,154.65,155.75,On what basis?
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,155.75,159.035,On the basis that I think that you've just described that she said there's essentially--
2013.12-7822,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,159.035,161.32,"No, she says, I don't know what's in the closet, Mr. Policeman."
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,172.712,173.262,--Okay.
2013.12-7822,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,173.262,175.33,I've tried to eliminate any other basis.
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,201.064,205.599,"Well, Justice Breyer, I've never seen a case like that, but there'd be two things I would say if one arose."
2013.12-7822,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,226.512,227.631,How could she invite them in?
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,239.439,239.906,"Well, no, I'm sorry."
2013.12-7822,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,279.731,282.199,"Mr. Fisher, I wasn't here for Randolph."
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,304.715,307.75,"--Because I think -- that was just the point I was trying to make, Justice Alito."
2013.12-7822,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,324.193,330.43,Suppose her friend is a forensics professor at the law school.
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,330.43,333.149,--I think it's still very--
2013.12-7822,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,333.149,339.888,"And she said, you know, I'm concerned there might be evidence of a crime here; I don't want any part of it, I want you to give me your expert opinion on that."
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,339.888,341.138,--I think it's very different--
2013.12-7822,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,341.138,345.725,I don't know why you want us to write an opinion saying that the police are different from anybody else.
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,347.708,348.259,--No.
2013.12-7822,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,364.003,364.403,Why is it different?
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,373.109,376.911,"--That's the ordinary presumption, but what this Court held--"
2013.12-7822,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,376.911,377.745,Why is it a presumption?
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,380.213,387.452,"--It may be a property right, but it's trumped by the constitutional right of another resident of the building to forbid the police for entering without a warrant."
2013.12-7822,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,390.487,391.004,I understand that.
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,394.039,399.01,"Well, because it's this Court's precedent and no one on the other side is asking to have it overturned."
2013.12-7822,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,399.01,404.58,"Well, asking to extend it, asking to extend it."
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,410.818,423.792,"Well, I think, Justice Scalia, that's a fair way to put the question here, which is once somebody does exactly what this Court said they had a right to do in Randolph, which is say, you cannot come in my house, what happens next?"
2013.12-7822,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,432.481,439.401,"But Randolph, I forget exactly how many times, but repeatedly said it was discussing a case involving the physical presence."
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,461.667,466.821,"Well, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, if I could fairly characterize the case, there is physical presence in this case."
2013.12-7822,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,477.593,478.212,What happens next?
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,508.064,509.148,"--Well, two things, Justice Kennedy."
2013.12-7822,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,537.667,545.088,"But Justice Breyer's question was very carefully phrased to indicate, at least to me, that there was no probable cause."
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,561.116,565.651,"--If she wants that, she has numerous ways to help the police, Justice Kennedy."
2013.12-7822,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,582.796,586.482,You can say that in lots of consent search cases.
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,600.957,601.341,No.
2013.12-7822,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,601.807,603.276,"Well, so why should that be the rule here?"
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,603.276,604.559,No.
2013.12-7822,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,618.036,618.836,You have a woman who has been beaten up.
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,637.33,644.203,"--Remember, there are two people that have rights in that scenario, her and the defendant -- or the suspect."
2013.12-7822,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,671.804,676.074,What about what we said in King just last year or the year before -- it's a quote:
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,698.655,704.492,"Mr. Chief Justice, the police can do that and presumably, no matter what you hold in this case, they will continue to do that."
2013.12-7822,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,723.555,727.757,"That's a circular question, you see, because once you say right, you assume the answer."
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,767.917,770.786,"Let me try to walk you through it, because I think it is vital here."
2013.12-7822,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,823.069,824.171,Finish.
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,824.171,826.288,"--If I could just put it on the table, and then I'll answer your question."
2013.12-7822,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,856.725,860.177,What do you make of the language in Randolph about pretext?
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,860.177,861.711,About pretext?
2013.12-7822,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,861.711,862.129,Yes.
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,863.263,866.248,"In all fairness, I don't know that it does."
2013.12-7822,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,892.232,892.498,Sure.
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,894.517,897.802,"--All you have to do is arrest and remove them, and that's the facts of this case."
2013.12-7822,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,934.659,938.361,"Mr. Fisher, and you can stick with this case."
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,971.767,975.319,"I think I'd agree with what you're saying, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-7822,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,981.456,982.04,"Well, in the -- in the interim."
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,987.944,998.084,--I'm not sure that a charge would be enough to take -- take one out of the social setting where one would assume that somebody's objections still stood.
2013.12-7822,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,998.084,1009.457,"He was in jail for 500-plus days, and you're saying that for all that time, the co-occupant has no complete control over the premises."
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1009.457,1014.444,"Justice Kennedy, at least until he's convicted, I don't think he does."
2013.12-7822,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1067.396,1075.252,"Well, what's the conversation between the husband and the battered wife, bleeding, holding the four-year-old baby going to look like?"
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1090.927,1103.419,"--Well, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, in that situation, the police would probably do well to do exactly what they did here, which is remove him from the premises, arrest him, and then all they, again, have to do is get a warrant."
2013.12-7822,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1108.623,1113.127,"Well, I quoted you the lang -- I quoted you the language from King from last year where we said that's not an adequate answer."
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1113.127,1125.1,"--Well, I think to be fair, in this Court's cases, they've -- sometimes you've said -- and we've quoted those other cases in the reply brief -- that the administrative efficiency is not a good enough reason to dispense with the word 〝 requirement ″."
2013.12-7822,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1209.338,1213.242,"But Jardines was based on an understanding of property rights, wasn't it?"
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1213.242,1214.658,--Which--
2013.12-7822,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1214.658,1217.627,"It was based on an understanding of property rights, Jardines?"
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1217.627,1221.146,--I don't know that it was any more than Randolph.
2013.12-7822,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1274.047,1280.451,"Well, when you say the -- the police prohibit him from exercising that right, there was an arraignment before a magistrate."
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1283.137,1285.188,"Well, fair enough, Justice Kennedy."
2013.12-7822,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1292.842,1298.662,Was there any indication why the police didn't get a warrant in that hour interval?
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1298.662,1302.216,"No, I don't think there's any testimony to that effect, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-7822,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1318.143,1321.778,It's not purely an -- there's -- the language I quoted said any number of reasons.
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1345.627,1350.447,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, in those other permutations, you have, first of all, the exigent circumstances doctrine."
2013.12-7822,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1360.653,1364.556,"Well, you don't think there would be exigent circumstances in the case of -- this case, do you?"
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1364.556,1365.256,"No, I don't think so."
2013.12-7822,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1370.11,1372.41,That's -- that's the initial problem I started with in this case.
2013.12-7822,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1429.149,1435.22,"--No, Justice Breyer, I understand that's -- that's a concern, but there are two very easy ways for the police to deal with that."
2013.12-7822,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1476.63,1477.78,"Thank you, Mr. Fisher."
2013.12-7822,1,34668,louis_w_karlin,,1489.104,1491.473,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-7822,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1529.681,1545.374,Would that be so if Fernandez left -- he's made known his objection and then he says I'm going to pick up something at the drugstore.
2013.12-7822,1,34668,louis_w_karlin,,1556.766,1558.784,"Yes, Your Honor, it would."
2013.12-7822,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1582.983,1599.426,"So what's left of Randolph if we accept your -- all the police have to do is arrest anyone if they have probable cause, and if they don't, all they have to do is remove them from the premises and just talk to the co-tenant even though they've heard an objection?"
2013.12-7822,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1599.426,1600.361,"Well, Your Honor--"
2013.12-7822,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1600.361,1605.913,"When is Randolph ever going to survive after this, assuming we accept your argument?"
2013.12-7822,3,34668,louis_w_karlin,,1605.913,1612.502,"--Justice Sotomayor, Randolph remains efficacious for the narrow situation it was crafted to object -- to address."
2013.12-7822,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1624.809,1627.278,So there's nothing left to Randolph.
2013.12-7822,3,34668,louis_w_karlin,,1628.911,1631.563,"--Well, the police can't just remove a person--"
2013.12-7822,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1631.563,1633.748,"Remove them to the stoop, into the police car, to the station?"
2013.12-7822,3,34668,louis_w_karlin,,1636.867,1644.021,"--Well, certainly, as in this case where there's a valid arrest, that person is gone."
2013.12-7822,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1656.698,1662.434,Smith goes up to the house and Mrs. and Mr. Jones -- Mrs. Jones: Please come in.
2013.12-7822,3,34668,louis_w_karlin,,1733.698,1748.54,"Well, the reason the hour and a half rule I think would be wrong is that it would effectively rob the co-tenant of her authority over the -- over that space."
2013.12-7822,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1762.864,1775.671,"That's all true, but can you answer my straight-faced question, which is how can I do this with a straight face, both come out one way in Randolph and say when the police get him out of the way knowing about what he doesn't wan, that's all different."
2013.12-7822,3,34668,louis_w_karlin,,1778.223,1779.89,--I think there are two things here.
2013.12-7822,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1858.909,1861.111,"Mr. Karlin, don't you find that a little bit odd?"
2013.12-7822,3,34668,louis_w_karlin,,1887.029,1893.099,The social expectation analysis in Randolph really wasn't intended to address that question.
2013.12-7822,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1936.944,1939.244,Did Matlock -- there was no objecting defendant.
2013.12-7822,3,34668,louis_w_karlin,,1939.244,1940.146,--Correct.
2013.12-7822,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1940.146,1951.085,"It's the presumption that still survived, that absent an objection you have a consent, you assume whoever has control over the premises has consented."
2013.12-7822,3,34668,louis_w_karlin,,1955.387,1969.047,"What -- what controls in Matlock is the underlying reasoning that it's no longer a question of agency, and that really is the theory of Petitioner."
2013.12-7822,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1994.447,1997.832,"You see, I thought that Randolph rejected that analysis."
2013.12-7822,3,34668,louis_w_karlin,,2027.168,2037.957,"But, Your Honor, in -- in this case when the objection was made, the police weren't searching."
2013.12-7822,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2070.695,2073.23,I guess this goes back to my -- my other question.
2013.12-7822,3,34668,louis_w_karlin,,2093.711,2095.662,Right.
2013.12-7822,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2194.143,2206.819,"You don't disagree, do you, Mr. Karlin -- and I don't want to put words in your mouth -- but you don't disagree that the expectation of privacy does not decline after the arrest is made."
2013.12-7822,3,34668,louis_w_karlin,,2211.771,2213.473,I do not dispute that.
2013.12-7822,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2229.415,2231.284,I'm -- I'm a little confused.
2013.12-7822,3,34668,louis_w_karlin,,2249.746,2260.201,"Your Honor, in -- in Rodriguez and in -- the question is apparent authority to give consent to shared spaces."
2013.12-7822,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2293.941,2295.108,--I own the house.
2013.12-7822,3,34668,louis_w_karlin,,2295.108,2297.893,Yes.
2013.12-7822,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2300.011,2305.832,"I'm letting the person use it by sufferance, not by -- but it's still my closet."
2013.12-7822,3,34668,louis_w_karlin,,2305.832,2317.056,--If it's -- if it's a locked -- we can have a variety of -- of living arrangements and there can certainly be within a home a space that is truly yours.
2013.12-7822,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2317.056,2323.46,I would certainly recommend to every married couple now to have a prenuptial agreement on access rights.
2013.12-7822,3,34668,louis_w_karlin,,2324.994,2332.4,"But I do think that -- that you can create spaces that, from all reasonable appearances, are -- are yours."
2013.12-7822,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2332.4,2342.255,"I don't think there's -- reading your brief and the other, I don't think this is a case where she wanted to talk to the police."
2013.12-7822,3,34668,louis_w_karlin,,2369.823,2372.025,"Well, in this case, that's exactly what they did--"
2013.12-7822,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2372.025,2372.725,Yes.
2013.12-7822,3,34668,louis_w_karlin,,2372.725,2373.827,--and no one is contesting that.
2013.12-7822,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2373.827,2374.86,Yes.
2013.12-7822,3,34668,louis_w_karlin,,2377.179,2378.145,Yes.
2013.12-7822,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2379.797,2380.197,Okay.
2013.12-7822,3,34668,louis_w_karlin,,2390.771,2392.171,--No.
2013.12-7822,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2446.589,2470.89,"Mr. Karlin, there is in this case some indication that she was not inviting this search, that she in the end consented, but only after the police suggested that her child could be taken away and, you know, the facts of this case are not I'm standing at the door dying for you to come in."
2013.12-7822,3,34668,louis_w_karlin,,2470.89,2476.794,"Well, with regard to the voluntariness, that was established as a matter of fact and is not being challenged."
2013.12-7822,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2545.871,2548.806,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-7822,4,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2560.448,2563.15,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-7822,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2593.669,2609.381,"Then you could reduce Randolph to nothingness by saying the police -- as long as the police act lawfully to get the objector out, then they can override, that his objection doesn't count."
2013.12-7822,4,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2609.381,2615.618,"Justice Ginsburg, Randolph was a self-consciously, narrowly written and explained decision."
2013.12-7822,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2731.493,2732.01,Why did they need to search?
2013.12-7822,4,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2732.01,2733.362,--Excuse me?
2013.12-7822,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2733.362,2734.278,Why did they need to search?
2013.12-7822,4,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2751.656,2753.858,"Justice Sotomayor, in this case--"
2013.12-7822,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2753.858,2757.81,I think this was just a pure: We want to -- we want to find something else.
2013.12-7822,4,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2757.81,2763.131,"--Well, he had been identified as -- as the robber, so you will recall the facts."
2013.12-7822,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2779.407,2783.795,"So they were looking for evidence not on the ground that they arrested him on, but on an independent crime?"
2013.12-7822,4,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2783.795,2785.878,"--Well, there are two -- the sequence is important."
2013.12-7822,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2819.218,2820.001,Did they have probable cause to get a warrant?
2013.12-7822,4,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2820.001,2820.851,Pardon me?
2013.12-7822,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2820.851,2824.003,"Once he was identified, did they have probable cause to get a warrant?"
2013.12-7822,4,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2824.003,2827.574,I think they almost certainly did have probable cause to get a warrant at that -- at that point.
2013.12-7822,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2837.845,2843.666,So everything here -- the things -- the everything -- the search at issue was a search solely for evidence?
2013.12-7822,4,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2843.666,2846.551,"--Yes, yes."
2013.12-7822,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2846.551,2853.272,The objecting party was present and made his objection known clearly and directly to the officers seeking to enter the house?
2013.12-7822,4,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2853.272,2854.141,Yes.
2013.12-7822,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2854.141,2856.107,"A little earlier, but he did."
2013.12-7822,4,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2932.574,2938.045,"Your Honor, I don't think a reasonable time requirement like that is readily administrable."
2013.12-7822,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2942.865,2944.799,How about a clear answer?
2013.12-7822,4,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2945.651,2950.869,"--Your Honor, that's just inconsistent with Kentucky v. King and--"
2013.12-7822,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2950.869,2974.468,"Get a -- when you have probable cause to believe a crime has been committed, and here clearly you admit there would have been probable cause to search, there's no exigency, there's no looking for evidence related to the crime that drew you particularly there, the screaming, but you've just got to secure the premises and get a warrant."
2013.12-7822,4,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2982.407,2987.811,"--Justice Sotomayor, this Court has not adopted that kind of less restrictive means analysis in that area."
2013.12-7822,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3022.484,3027.119,"Mr. Palmore, could I ask what you think that this sentence means in Randolph?"
2013.12-7822,4,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3040.112,3049.634,"Your Honor, that was of course dicta in Randolph because there was no -- that wasn't presented, and it isn't presented here either because there's no such allegation."
2013.12-7822,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3071.465,3077.301,So it would only apply if the -- if the taking the person away from the home was unreasonable.
2013.12-7822,4,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3092.711,3094.58,We don't think that language would apply.
2013.12-7822,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3105.721,3112.042,And has anybody ever found that conduct fit within that language?
2013.12-7822,4,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3120.73,3122.564,I haven't found any such case.
2013.12-7822,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3143.311,3158.855,"I think the property law cases that you cite, pages 24-25 of your brief, I had thought originally that this would be the principal focus of our decisions in these cases, but it's -- it's marginally in your favor."
2013.12-7822,4,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3167.878,3169.811,"May I answer, please?"
2013.12-7822,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3189.042,3190.375,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-7822,5,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3192.411,3195.196,Thank you.
2013.12-7822,5,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3255.134,3266.892,So the cotenant has much less authority to allow people to enter if her other cotenant is -- is a criminal than if he's a law-abiding citizen?
2013.12-7822,5,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3268.661,3270.027,"--No, because--"
2013.12-7822,5,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3270.027,3277.599,That's -- that's the result of the way you allocate the rights and duties of the cotenant who allows the -- the person to enter.
2013.12-7822,5,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3277.599,3287.788,"--No, Justice Kennedy, because if he's a law-abiding citizen, the police couldn't take him away and he could stay there or, at a minimum, the police might be able to reposition him as I think they've acknowledged that occurred--"
2013.12-7822,5,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3287.788,3288.324,"No, no."
2013.12-7822,5,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3300.465,3305.0,"--No, I -- but to be intellectually coherent you might say, no, even then the police couldn't override it."
2013.12-7822,5,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3326.097,3332.234,"Well, the problem, for as long as he can't enforce it -- he's the worst criminal in the world; right from the house to 20 years in Sing-Sing."
2013.12-7822,5,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3338.423,3343.292,"No, because I think once he's imprisoned, you might say he has a new domicile, Justice Breyer."
2013.12-7822,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3434.469,3438.271,"Counsel, I don't understand how you can say it would render Randolph a dead letter."
2013.12-7822,5,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3455.732,3460.702,"No, I think when Randolph said it was being formalistic, it didn't mean we're establishing a meaningless right."
2013.12-7822,5,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3474.879,3493.257,"Well, why doesn't your rule express profound disrespect for the -- the cotenant who was standing at the door and who has -- who says, I've just been beaten up by my cotenant and I want you to come into my house and see the evidence of what my cotenant has done to me."
2013.12-7822,5,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3504.248,3505.515,"--Two things, Justice Alito."
2013.12-7822,5,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3511.385,3511.835,All right.
2013.12-7822,5,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3513.354,3514.037,--It would.
2013.12-7822,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3531.382,3532.798,"Thank you, counsel."
