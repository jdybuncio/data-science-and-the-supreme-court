1993.92-519,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,6.685,We'll hear argument now in three consolidated cases.
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,20.496,23.247,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-519,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,187.583,195.488,"Mr. Klein, I assume that you are asking us to reject this notion of the Statewide frame of reference totally, for this case and for every case?"
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,195.488,198.81,--I think you have to reject it in the following sense.
1993.92-519,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,228.72,235.575,"Well, even... I had thought perhaps a Statewide basis was the proper focus."
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,248.773,253.876,"I agree with you, Justice O'Connor, that the proof in this case was limited to Dade County."
1993.92-519,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,256.878,258.339,"And that's enough to dispose of the case, is it not?"
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,258.339,258.901,It is.
1993.92-519,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,289.101,293.313,"And the proof, by everybody, basically focused on Dade County."
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,293.313,293.964,--Absolutely.
1993.92-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,428.86,431.081,It's sort of curious in a statute that absolutely forbids that.
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,434.314,436.777,"--I don't think the statute forbids that, Justice Scalia."
1993.92-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,444.662,445.861,You're saying it's the touchstone.
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,445.861,447.153,I'm saying--
1993.92-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,447.153,448.773,How can it be the touchstone if it doesn't require it?
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,448.773,450.436,--It's the touchstone as a maximum.
1993.92-519,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,505.972,517.729,"Well do you take... excuse me, do you take the position that it is... necessarily, it is a dispositive upper limitation, or do you say that it is a relevant consideration in deciding what the upper limit should be?"
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,517.729,519.421,"--No, I think... I think it is under section 2."
1993.92-519,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,520.76,521.352,You say it is dispositive.
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,521.352,524.463,"And I think that's true in a single district case, in contrast--"
1993.92-519,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,524.463,540.774,"Is it fair to say that in this case we would not have to go that far to accept your position, because I gather in this case, basically, we've got a record in which there does not seem to be any other explanation than a maximization principle."
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,547.299,548.12,--You wouldn't.
1993.92-519,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,588.636,593.828,So you're... in so many words you're saying that this is strictly a results kind of test.
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,594.91,595.32,"Well, I think that--"
1993.92-519,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,595.32,601.995,"--Is a bottom-line equality, and it has nothing to do with discrimination that may have occurred, I think, in Judge Easterbrook's phrase, along the line."
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,601.995,603.104,"--Well, I think--"
1993.92-519,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,603.104,622.538,"In other words, if you get a result which is consistent with proportionality, it doesn't matter that that result may, in fact, have been arrived at through various discriminations along the way which just happen to work out numerically in a way which, on the face of it, gives equality."
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,622.538,624.459,"--It depends what you mean, Justice Souter."
1993.92-519,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,643.59,644.541,But not a section 2.
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,644.541,645.903,"--Section 2, it's absolutely clear."
1993.92-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,665.857,671.48,"You don't really disagree, as I understand it, with the maximization argument made by the Government."
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,683.697,684.579,"No, I don't--"
1993.92-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,684.579,685.668,And then that district has to be maximized.
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,686.109,687.621,"--I don't concede that at all, because--"
1993.92-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,687.621,689.392,"Well, what do you mean by proportional representation?"
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,689.392,693.115,--Because what you had here was more than proportional.
1993.92-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,695.706,702.78,"Oh, maximization certainly doesn't mean... doesn't mean that they're going to win if they have 1 vote against 100."
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,720.65,722.743,"If that's what you mean by maximization, we're in complete agreement."
1993.92-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,722.743,723.883,"Well, what does anybody else mean by it?"
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,723.883,732.839,"Well, I think what people mean by maximization, and the lower courts have used the term this way, it is possible in Florida to create 11 majority House districts."
1993.92-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,751.122,751.433,"Oh, I see, okay."
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,764.599,765.39,Where they're compact.
1993.92-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,765.39,765.921,Yeah.
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,765.921,766.281,Yes--
1993.92-519,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,766.281,770.844,"Allotted might be a better word than maximized, it seems to me, in that situation."
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,770.844,772.676,--I think that... I think that's a fair word.
1993.92-519,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,779.669,791.457,"Just on the maximization point, if a State chose voluntarily to maximize in this instance, would there be a constitutional or a section 2 violation, in your view?"
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,791.457,797.451,"Well, I don't think there'd be a section 2 violation, because I don't think majorities have a cause of action under section 2."
1993.92-519,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,803.414,804.877,Suppose the districts were compact?
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,804.877,816.094,"--Even if they were compact, it seems to me you get into a question of whether the creation of a disproportionate number of minority districts is something akin to affirmative action."
1993.92-519,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,824.97,832.376,"When you said you don't think the majorities have a cause of action, you decide the majority by looking Statewide or at Dade County?"
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,832.376,836.747,"--I think... when I say the majority, I mean white people."
1993.92-519,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,837.288,837.639,I know.
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,841.309,843.282,"--I don't think that matters under section 2, Justice Stevens."
1993.92-519,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,844.133,846.965,"Because section 2 looks at the entire State, is that the reason?"
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,846.965,847.213,--No.
1993.92-519,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,854.99,858.833,It wouldn't apply to whites even if whites are a minority in the covered jurisdiction.
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,858.833,859.132,--Right.
1993.92-519,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,859.132,862.503,You mean nationwide protected minorities.
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,862.503,865.275,Protected minorities is what Congress had in mind.
1993.92-519,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,873.153,873.353,I understand.
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,873.353,881.767,"But there's never been a suggestion... and, of course, it's not presented by this case, but there's never been a suggestion that white voters would have a cause of action on section 2."
1993.92-519,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,881.767,882.068,Is--
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,882.068,884.579,"Which was designed to implement... originally, to implement the Fifteenth Amendment--"
1993.92-519,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,884.579,886.449,--But under the plain language of the statute I suppose there would--
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,886.449,887.661,"--Well, I think--"
1993.92-519,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,887.661,889.291,"--If you discriminated on account of race, or--"
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,889.291,893.555,"--Well, the plain language of the statute talks about protected minorities."
1993.92-519,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,893.555,893.805,--Right.
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,893.805,900.819,"And what I'm submitting to you is that the term protected minorities really does mean a discreet group: that is blacks, Hispanics, and so forth."
1993.92-519,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,900.819,911.237,"Would it comply with the statute, then, in... say Dade County was electing just county officers rather than the State legislature, if they contrived a plan that denied whites a majority in any district?"
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,911.237,916.039,"I think it probably would, but I think that would raise an equal protection question that Justice Kennedy--"
1993.92-519,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,916.039,920.403,But you think it would comply with the statute because whites are not a group that's defined by color.
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,920.403,926.086,"--That is, it's not a group that is protected with the term protected minority under the statute."
1993.92-519,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,930.198,932.969,But you have to go to the legislative history to find... to come to that conclusion.
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,932.969,935.643,"--Well, there is... the term in the statute is protected minority."
1993.92-519,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,935.643,936.542,Where is that term?
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,950.972,953.553,"Well then I misspoke myself, then."
1993.92-519,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,979.562,989.367,"Is it your view that the cohesiveness of the groups... there was some issue about that in this case, that that's irrelevant to your analysis."
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1001.114,1006.957,We concede that Hispanics in Dade County are cohesive within Dade County.
1993.92-519,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1013.523,1026.332,"But on your... the view you stated earlier about it's not a compact group, then the lack of cohesiveness, the lack of identity, of necessary identity of interest is kind of surplusage."
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1027.34,1027.922,That's correct.
1993.92-519,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1123.144,1138.866,"--On this record, do you... can you say that Florida did have the obligation to structure districts with proportional representation in Dade County itself, or could they have had a luck-of-the-draw system?"
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1138.866,1143.818,"Well, let me say it depends what one means by luck-of-the-draw system."
1993.92-519,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1159.379,1164.791,"Are those premises an assumption that the State has simply accepted in this case, or were they proven?"
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1164.791,1166.552,"They were proven, we believe, in this case."
1993.92-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1289.343,1295.087,I'm not sure... but isn't that the same principle that you're accepting within a district?
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1295.087,1296.967,--I think it is within a district.
1993.92-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1296.967,1309.326,"That is, the vote of no individual black person or other minority person is increased at all, but that person is benefitted only that the votes of others, not necessarily himself, is augmented."
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1309.326,1309.917,I don't--
1993.92-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1309.917,1313.989,"He may choose to vote for... you know, for not the black candidate but a white candidate."
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1313.989,1318.263,--But the assumption is... this is a group right in the following sense.
1993.92-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1318.263,1319.522,"It is a group right, exactly."
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1319.522,1321.074,And the group... you've got to have a group of people.
1993.92-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1350.463,1351.074,You're saying this is the wrong group.
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1351.074,1352.254,--They're a different group.
1993.92-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1352.254,1353.215,"It's not an individual right, you're saying."
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1354.186,1354.996,"They're a different group, entirely different group."
1993.92-519,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1358.658,1363.192,And have we said in our cases that the equal protection clause grants group rights?
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1364.952,1367.312,--I don't think you've ever said that in equal protection cases.
1993.92-519,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1367.312,1375.648,"I thought the whole underpinning, the whole premise, the whole principle of the Fourteenth Amendment was that people are treated as individuals."
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1375.648,1379.512,"I think that's right, but I think that is not the premise of the current Voting Rights Act."
1993.92-519,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1397.884,1400.937,"Well you have... it's a capacity to form a group, isn't it?"
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1407.21,1410.302,"Well, I don't know that it has to be reconciled in the following sense."
1993.92-519,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1424.101,1426.593,"Well, the further you get beyond it, the riskier it is, though."
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1426.593,1431.196,"--I agree with that, and that's what I think the principle of the Shaw decision was last term."
1993.92-519,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1484.462,1508.686,"I think the Government argues... or perhaps it's the Appellee who argues in response to that that Florida has chosen to draw its districts in terms of total population rather than people of voting age, citizens, and so it can't complain if the Voting Rights Act case is fought out along those lines."
1993.92-519,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1508.686,1512.689,"I don't... I don't think that's a correct... I think that's what they argue, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-519,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1572.639,1573.977,"Very well, Mr. Klein."
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1575.769,1579.393,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-519,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1611.403,1616.716,How do you square that with the compact and cohesiveness requirement of Gingles?
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1616.716,1620.249,I actually don't think there's any problem in squaring that with those requirements.
1993.92-519,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1634.549,1648.055,"See, but once you have some compact group that can sort of carry the banner for the minority Statewide, you can give that compact group as many votes as is necessary to represent the minority Statewide is your argument."
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1648.055,1649.988,"No, that... I wouldn't put it that way."
1993.92-519,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1680.557,1683.899,So you are providing a remedy to persons who have not been wronged.
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1683.899,1686.631,"--No, I don't think... I don't think that's correct."
1993.92-519,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1734.342,1736.646,"But, Mr. Feldman, isn't that the line you drew in your complaint?"
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1742.59,1742.73,Yes.
1993.92-519,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1767.177,1771.67,Where was this State frame of reference stated in the complaint?
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1771.67,1779.415,The... I think the ultimate allegation was that Hispanics in the State of Florida are denied equal opportunity to participate and elect candidates of their choice.
1993.92-519,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1785.95,1796.005,"What was the proof of that other than... you state in your brief, for example, English language initiatives, language-based employment discrimination."
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1807.354,1810.624,--I think you have to look at the record of this case as it comes to this Court.
1993.92-519,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1829.188,1832.279,"Well, other... what other than the two examples that you put in your brief?"
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1832.279,1838.744,"Well, in every... I guess what I'm trying to say is that in the Congress... it was already decided before the trial started here."
1993.92-519,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1879.512,1907.279,"Was there evidence that there is a greater identity between the Hispanics in other parts outside Dade County and African-Americans than with Hispanics in Dade County, that the identity of those two groups... so if you were going to pick a group to bracket the Hispanics outside Dade County, it would not be the Hispanics inside Dade County, but you would find more cohesiveness with African-Americans inside Dade County?"
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1907.279,1915.654,"--I think there was some anecdotal evidence that there were various segments of the Hispanic community, that it does not vote cohesively with the community as a whole."
1993.92-519,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1920.96,1923.33,But didn't the district court make a finding to that effect?
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1923.33,1927.883,--The district court finding was that there is racially polarized voting in the State of Florida.
1993.92-519,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1927.883,1938.679,"But didn't it also... didn't it also point out just what Justice Ginsburg said, that the Cuban Hispanics in Dade County tend to vote quite different from non-Cuban Hispanics?"
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1938.679,1940.843,I don't believe the district court did make that finding.
1993.92-519,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1964.277,1965.417,What does it mean to vote cohesively?
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1968.919,1971.02,I mean I think that might be a factor.
1993.92-519,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1992.254,1993.846,They must want to elect Hispanics.
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1993.846,1995.146,They don't--
1993.92-519,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1995.146,2004.703,"It isn't enough if all... say all Hispanics vote Republican or, you know, all of some minority... some other minority votes Democratic all the time?"
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2004.703,2005.715,--No.
1993.92-519,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2006.065,2006.743,That's not enough.
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2010.727,2013.159,"--No, I don't think that's required, but I think that that may be proven in a given case."
1993.92-519,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2013.159,2013.779,But it's not required.
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2013.779,2014.19,No.
1993.92-519,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2014.19,2016.751,It would be enough if they always vote for one party.
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2016.751,2017.542,"I think, yeah."
1993.92-519,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2023.566,2024.117,"Well, then what is it?"
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2028.411,2029.691,"--No, I don't think that that's it."
1993.92-519,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2045.871,2049.844,You said a minute ago that Hispanics were not protected.
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2053.485,2055.338,I think... I believe the statutory language says persons of Spanish descent.
1993.92-519,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2055.338,2055.639,Where is that?
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2059.73,2060.502,I think--
1993.92-519,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2060.502,2063.884,"As opposed to everybody, just certain groups, where it that?"
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2063.884,2073.949,"--No, everybody's entitled to equal voting opportunity, but there are particular... the statute protects against unequal voting opportunities on account of race, for example, and that would affect everybody."
1993.92-519,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2073.949,2074.179,Right.
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2074.179,2082.594,"It also specifically uses the term persons protected by... let me just see, it says by..."
1993.92-519,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2093.623,2096.063,"Oh, okay."
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2096.063,2099.798,--For purposes of this section the term language minorities means a number of different groups including--
1993.92-519,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2099.798,2100.406,Right.
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2100.406,2102.599,--Or persons of Spanish heritage.
1993.92-519,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2102.599,2108.393,"May I ask just as... out of curiosity, what is the defining characteristic of the Hispanic group we're talking about?"
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2113.646,2119.29,"It's the... it's the fact... I mean, technically, it is that they are of Spanish heritage, that's the statutory term."
1993.92-519,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2119.29,2121.339,The statute refers to Spanish heritage.
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2121.339,2121.71,Yes.
1993.92-519,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2136.581,2139.943,"Well, what provision of the statute is it that refers to people of Spanish heritage?"
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2139.943,2141.044,It's--
1993.92-519,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2141.044,2143.947,Something in 1973?
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2143.947,2154.813,--It's... 42 U.S.C. 1973 aa-1a(e).
1993.92-519,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2165.368,2168.661,And how does that become relevant to the race or color criterion of section 2?
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2168.661,2180.95,"Because section 2 protects not only for discrimination or unequal electoral opportunities on the base of race or color, but also in this provision... where it adds."
1993.92-519,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2180.95,2183.561,"Oh, just the 1973(b), I see."
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2183.561,2183.852,Right.
1993.92-519,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2204.134,2210.369,"Well, Mr. Feldman, I assume we are looking at this case and this judgment, right?"
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2210.369,2210.789,That's right.
1993.92-519,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2210.789,2220.556,And did the district court in this case that we're reviewing make any vote dilution findings outside of Dade County?
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2220.556,2227.051,"The district court... I think what the district court, having made the number of findings... it did in this very case."
1993.92-519,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2302.889,2315.268,"Mr. Feldman, on page 40a of the Appendix to the Jurisdictional Statement where you get to part B of the court's opinion, that first sentence is the plaintiffs... that the Dade County's..."
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2328.736,2331.918,I think... I think it may be inartfully drawn.
1993.92-519,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2331.918,2335.832,"But it's very difficult to contend otherwise, at least with respect to that particular sentence."
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2335.832,2349.079,"I think what they meant in that sentence was that the vote dilution that had occurred... I mean, what you had was a practice where Hispanics could only elect other Hispanics... or could only elect candidates of their choice where they were the majority... where they were in the majority in a district."
1993.92-519,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2375.526,2381.551,"Well, we're told by the Appellants that the case was tried, basically, on the basis of Dade County."
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2392.84,2396.17,I would agree with you that it cuts against my... our point of view.
1993.92-519,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2419.885,2424.269,"Mr. Feldman, could you... there's an awful lot of pages here to look through, as we understand."
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2433.305,2440.409,"But that... first of all, I don't think... well, as to compactness, I don't know what it would mean to say that they're compact Statewide."
1993.92-519,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2449.576,2465.516,"No, but I think a lot of the people assume that within the Hispanic community there are Cuban Americans who tend to vote very regular... very conservative Republicans, and there are a lot of agricultural workers and the rest, who have a different Hispanic origin, who tend to vote Democratic."
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2479.745,2485.319,"Well, I can cite you the voluminous exhibits showing the runs of election after election."
1993.92-519,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2500.069,2502.152,"Well, apart from looking at reams and reams of exhibits."
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2502.152,2502.399,Right.
1993.92-519,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2502.399,2508.363,"Is there any statement anywhere that is as succinct as the one the Chief Justice pointed you to, but pointing in the opposite direction?"
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2508.363,2521.553,"Well, if you look at the... the JSF in that, I think '92, 5/19, if you look at page 79a, they... the court says at the bottom of that page, and carrying over to the next one: ""The parties agree""..."
1993.92-519,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2555.784,2573.707,"Yes, but your statement that racially polarized voting exists throughout Florida to varying degrees could mean that in Dade County there's racially polarized voting among blacks that is contra to the way the Cuban Americans vote, and that there's racially polarized voting in Tampa that's contra to either of those two groups."
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2583.233,2583.533,--Right.
1993.92-519,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2605.639,2618.346,"But the paragraph you refer to... us to, starting on page 79a does appear, at least, at the end of the paragraph, to refer just to African-Americans."
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2618.346,2619.508,"Yes, well I can--"
1993.92-519,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2619.508,2638.568,"Where do you extract from this opinion an indication that it's proper on your Statewide frame to bracket the Hispanics outside Dade County with the Hispanics inside, rather than with African-Americans."
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2638.568,2643.443,"--Well, I think... that's how I read the finding that there's racially polarized voting in Florida."
1993.92-519,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2650.557,2652.74,"It's certainly a Delphic way of putting it, isn't it?"
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2652.74,2653.459,I beg your pardon?
1993.92-519,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2653.459,2666.157,"It's Delphic, isn't it, to get all that out of racially polarized voting, which could mean Hispanics and African-Americans versus whites?"
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2666.157,2676.813,"Your Honor, the... if you... the... if you go beyond the three-judge court, it adopted findings that a special master had made."
1993.92-519,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2706.783,2707.585,"Yes, but that doesn't--"
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2707.585,2708.185,That doesn't?
1993.92-519,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2708.185,2709.995,--Deal with the question that I asked you.
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2716.45,2717.822,Yes.
1993.92-519,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2729.28,2746.42,"But if you're talking about creating two more districts and if the cohesiveness is closer between African-Americans and Hispanics outside Dade County, then why should those two districts go to Hispanics in Dade County?"
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2746.42,2759.587,"Well, I think... well I think I can only make... perhaps answer that by repeating, I think, what I said before, which is the question is whether Hispanics in the State of Florida vote cohesively."
1993.92-519,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2810.411,2828.343,"Well, we may... we may have difficulty in figuring out what the findings are, but do you agree that if we do not read those findings as establishing dilution outside of Dade County, that the Hispanic population outside of Dade County cannot legitimately be taken into consideration for purposes of the maximization that went on here?"
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2828.343,2829.795,"Yes, I do."
1993.92-519,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2850.319,2854.98,Is it enough if... I mean are we supposed to go through the testimony to see if it was made out?
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2857.162,2871.711,"Well, the only reason I refer... this is... the only reason I refer to the testimony is because there are, in addition to the opinion that was... that the court issued on July 17th, there was the previous congressional opinion and the special master's and independent expert's opinions, which were specifically adopted by the court."
1993.92-519,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2876.575,2878.555,"So you're talking about findings, not just testimony."
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2878.555,2878.736,--Yes.
1993.92-519,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2887.933,2890.895,Let me ask you a question of your interpretive criterion.
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2934.893,2940.787,"I think the district court's opinion, with due respect to the court, was written hastily."
1993.92-519,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2944.821,2946.02,"Then the answer to my question, then, is yes, you are--"
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2946.02,2947.923,"--No, the answer is sometimes yes and sometimes no."
1993.92-519,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2967.294,2968.396,"--Well, why should that be?"
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2986.866,2987.197,--Yes.
1993.92-519,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3019.808,3026.203,"So you're saying there was... at worse, from your point of view, there was a failure of the district court to find on a crucial issue."
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,3026.203,3028.244,"That's... that would be what I would say, yes."
1993.92-519,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3045.744,3054.41,Is there any support in the case law for this Statewide frame of reference as opposed to the geographical districts?
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,3054.41,3055.993,"Actually, yes, I think there is."
1993.92-519,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3106.066,3119.034,"Mr. Feldman, assume there were no Gingles preconditions show, could a State, on its own initiative, maximize the voting strength of racial minorities within its jurisdiction?"
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,3119.034,3125.406,"--I'm not... I guess I would have one... initially, I'm not sure what maximizing would mean there?"
1993.92-519,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3125.967,3127.71,Maximizing as you use it here.
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,3127.71,3128.589,"--Well, we've never--"
1993.92-519,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3128.589,3137.425,"Taking a State... taking a State-wide sample of all the minorities and giving them the maximum possible number of seats in, say, the State legislature."
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,3137.425,3141.899,"--I think a State can reasonably act, for instance, to preclude a section 2 claim."
1993.92-519,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3150.424,3154.775,"Well, but I'm assuming that Gingles... that the Gingles conditions, preconditions cannot be found."
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,3155.596,3156.918,If they cannot be found?
1993.92-519,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3156.918,3159.359,There's no bloc voting.
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,3159.359,3164.062,"I... you know, I would hesitate to hazard an answer to that."
1993.92-519,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3168.846,3171.888,It raises at least at least a delicate constitutional question.
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,3171.888,3175.98,A delicate... the question would be whether it would be unconstitutional for a State to do that.
1993.92-519,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3175.98,3187.139,Doesn't that mean it's all the more important for us to be quite confident that the district court's judgment was no more than necessary to remedy the violations that were shown?
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,3187.139,3193.2,I would certainly agree that the district court is obligated simply to remedy the section 2 violations.
1993.92-519,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3215.237,3219.5,Well it seems to me an odd result to give a remedy to someone who has not suffered a wrong.
1993.92-519,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,3219.5,3225.014,"--Well, I think the answer... I think that's... that's one way... that's slightly mischaracterizing what's happening."
1993.92-519,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3264.698,3265.559,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,3267.902,3273.266,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-519,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3361.122,3364.965,Are you talking about the kind of purplish blue or the cobalt blue?
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,3367.346,3371.801,"Actually, Mr. Chief Justice, you can take your pick, both of them are Anglo districts."
1993.92-519,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3445.219,3451.291,"--Suppose that you used those same factors and you got 15, would you be entitled to that remedy?"
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,3451.291,3456.424,"--In this particular case I think we might well be entitled to it, Justice Kennedy."
1993.92-519,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3481.242,3488.565,"Counsel, what are the criteria used in drawing Anglo districts that you say should have been used, to draw funny looking shapes like this?"
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,3488.565,3489.056,"No, sir."
1993.92-519,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3528.162,3532.914,Does that involve any disrespect to the lines that existed before for other groups?
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,3532.914,3533.555,"--No, ma'am."
1993.92-519,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3533.555,3544.624,"In other words if you said... respect everyone equally and Hispanic groups were not respected equally, do the new lines disrespect any other groups?"
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,3544.624,3545.132,"No, ma'am."
1993.92-519,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3557.16,3558.021,I don't understand.
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,3574.301,3575.683,And if you try--
1993.92-519,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3575.683,3579.667,"And then put another 51... or, you know, to make it safe, 60 percent."
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,3588.192,3588.452,--That will pack.
1993.92-519,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3588.452,3594.286,You have to intentionally go about packing districts on the basis not of neighborhood lines.
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,3599.291,3609.196,"In fairness... in fairness, Your Honor, to what the plaintiffs tried to do in this case and what the district court adopted, the plaintiffs' plan did respect communities."
1993.92-519,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3656.657,3657.528,Mr. Foster.
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,3657.528,3657.809,"--Yes, sir."
1993.92-519,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3657.809,3665.035,Wherein was the violation of the Voting Rights Act in the law passed by the Florida legislature?
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,3665.035,3670.478,"It both... it... number one, we proved all three of the Gingles preconditions."
1993.92-519,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3689.259,3693.973,Well... and you say nine districts was not enough.
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,3696.174,3698.415,"Well, sir, I'm glad you brought up that point."
1993.92-519,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3699.837,3700.408,"Well, would you answer my question?"
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,3700.408,3701.076,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-519,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3740.383,3746.177,"Well, I think what they said, as I understood it, was that they were talking about districts which included some part of Dade County."
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,3749.349,3749.659,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-519,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3750.901,3753.672,"Before you leave that district, is that an Anglo district?"
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,3753.672,3757.784,"--It's an Hispanic district, sir, and they have to count it in order to get proportionality."
1993.92-519,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3766.639,3769.671,Are you saying it doesn't include any part of Dade County.
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,3769.671,3770.462,--Just a wee bit.
1993.92-519,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3782.451,3783.67,Are you talking areawise or population?
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,3783.67,3791.046,"--Areawise and I don't remember the precise figures, but I think that's pretty close to populationwise as well."
1993.92-519,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3827.761,3829.591,Is that a Hispanic district?
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,3829.591,3832.103,"That happens to be a white district, an Anglo district."
1993.92-519,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3832.103,3833.836,Well then you gained by having them do that.
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,3833.836,3834.704,That's true.
1993.92-519,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3840.659,3845.61,"But if you left out both 101 and 102, the proportion of Hispanic representation would be even higher."
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,3845.61,3851.096,"--Barely, by the fact that you're dropping one number from the numerator and one from the denominator."
1993.92-519,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3934.251,3935.88,"Well, who were these exhibits introduced by?"
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,3937.18,3938.262,These are plaintiffs' exhibits.
1993.92-519,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3939.744,3949.08,"Yes, and you have one dealing with the Miami area, one dealing with what you call South Florida, another dealing with what you call South Florida."
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,3953.773,3954.494,That is true.
1993.92-519,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4064.374,4067.255,"Counsel, what is District 30, is that an Anglo district?"
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,4067.255,4068.487,District 30.
1993.92-519,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4068.487,4073.6,That's the long tall one up between--
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,4074.011,4075.643,"Oh, the yellow one, District 31."
1993.92-519,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4075.643,4077.554,"No, no, not yellow, the one to the left of the yellow district."
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,4077.554,4078.195,That is an Anglo district.
1993.92-519,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4089.48,4090.452,"No, no, I'm not talking about the yellow district."
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,4090.452,4091.651,"The yellow district, yes, sir."
1993.92-519,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4091.651,4094.473,"No, I'm talking about the one immediately to the one to the left of the yellow district, the purple district."
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,4094.473,4094.794,Oh.
1993.92-519,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4096.156,4096.526,The long--
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,4096.526,4097.356,"Oh, I see."
1993.92-519,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4099.716,4102.591,--And do you have any problem with the way that's drawn?
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,4102.591,4104.971,"That wasn't my case, sir."
1993.92-519,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4113.256,4115.768,But it was to respect the African-Americans.
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,4115.768,4116.109,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-519,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4116.109,4118.08,"Thank you, Mr. Foster."
1993.92-519,2,18954,c_allen_foster,,4118.08,4118.43,Thank you.
1993.92-519,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4118.43,4122.173,"Mr. Klein, you have 18 minutes remaining."
1993.92-519,3,31305,joel_i_klein,,4122.173,4137.102,"I would ask the Court... with indulgence, I want to refer to the Appendix, the Joint... Jurisdictional Appendix on 92, 5/19, the JSF, to the district court's opinion, because I think that we need to have a couple of points of grounding here."
1993.92-519,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4178.74,4189.316,"Well, I don't... if you're depending on the sentence you just read for the conclusion that they're less compact, I don't think that sentence supports you."
1993.92-519,3,31305,joel_i_klein,,4189.316,4192.788,They say they are not significantly less geographically compact.
1993.92-519,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4196.792,4199.414,"Well, that's reading it very favorably."
1993.92-519,3,31305,joel_i_klein,,4199.414,4200.182,"Well, but at a minimum--"
1993.92-519,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4239.449,4241.329,78 percent of the population.
1993.92-519,3,31305,joel_i_klein,,4241.329,4242.561,"Of the population, yes."
1993.92-519,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4367.403,4371.023,"Mr. Klein, do you have... did you participate in the trial?"
1993.92-519,3,31305,joel_i_klein,,4371.023,4371.524,--I did not.
1993.92-519,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4371.524,4393.88,"Do you have any idea when the reference is made to Dade County, as in that sentence you just quoted or some other, is that referring to the Dade County in the sense of all districts which touched on Dade County or is it referring to Dade County as a geographical entity regardless of what districts might extend both in and out of it?"
1993.92-519,3,31305,joel_i_klein,,4393.88,4399.144,"I think it's referring to Dade County as a geographical entity, and let me explain why, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-519,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4444.393,4448.406,Were there other previous proceedings in the same case?
1993.92-519,3,31305,joel_i_klein,,4451.269,4451.509,--There were proceedings in the Congress.
1993.92-519,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4451.509,4452.44,Do we have to look at other findings and opinions?
1993.92-519,3,31305,joel_i_klein,,4452.44,4453.549,I don't think that's right.
1993.92-519,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4537.956,4544.281,Just to be sure I understand where this is coming... you're telling us what the record shows about voting patterns by Hispanics in other parts of the State?
1993.92-519,3,31305,joel_i_klein,,4544.281,4545.039,--Yes.
1993.92-519,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4578.021,4585.648,"Now, are they different because they... one group votes Democratic and the other votes Republican, or are they also different because they have different ethnic backgrounds?"
1993.92-519,3,31305,joel_i_klein,,4585.648,4586.796,They have different ethnic backgrounds.
1993.92-519,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4600.236,4612.733,"Under this statute, if one group of Hispanics with one ethnic background achieves sufficient political power to take advantage of another group of Hispanics of a different ethnic background, would the statute apply?"
1993.92-519,3,31305,joel_i_klein,,4612.733,4615.756,I don't know the answer to that question.
1993.92-519,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4620.891,4627.515,"You have two cohesive groups, both Hispanic but different ethnic backgrounds, one is strong enough to discriminate against the other successfully."
1993.92-519,3,31305,joel_i_klein,,4628.754,4631.376,--If they... I think they could make a subgroup claim.
1993.92-519,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4707.617,4708.917,Let me ask you a question... another question there.
1993.92-519,3,31305,joel_i_klein,,4711.789,4712.35,"Yes, I did."
1993.92-519,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4712.35,4716.593,Where they suggested that five districts should be drawn in place of one.
1993.92-519,3,31305,joel_i_klein,,4724.207,4726.908,"I... they'd have to show a geographically compact group, absolutely."
1993.92-519,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4727.359,4734.515,So that they shouldn't even count the black voters who are not within the black majority district that might be created.
1993.92-519,3,31305,joel_i_klein,,4734.515,4740.928,"--They have to show that the black voters in a single district, Justice Stevens, would make up a majority."
1993.92-519,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4755.199,4760.591,"Does that mean that in determining whether there's a violation or whether there's dilution, you ignore the other 8 percent?"
1993.92-519,3,31305,joel_i_klein,,4760.591,4761.081,--Absolutely.
1993.92-519,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4847.196,4848.508,"Thank you, Mr. Klein."
