1996.95-2074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.497,"We'll hear argument now in Number 94-2074, the City of Boerne v. Flores."
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,11.79,12.301,Boerne.
1996.95-2074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,12.301,12.889,Boerne.
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,15.043,18.425,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.95-2074,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,100.238,100.959,Ms. Hamilton--
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,100.959,101.919,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1996.95-2074,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,101.919,135.842,"--certainly you have to come to grips with the fact that, in situations such as the Voting Rights Act, where this Court had said the meaning of the Constitution was that intentional discrimination violates it but had never applied the so-called effects test, yet Congress passed laws of a prophylactic nature saying that discriminatory effects would be sufficient to create a cause of action for discrimination, and we upheld those."
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,135.842,136.342,Yes.
1996.95-2074,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,136.342,148.858,"And there are other similar prophylactic measures, and how do you distinguish those from what Congress now offers in amicus briefing, a rationale that it is a prophylactic measure?"
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,148.858,160.145,"Well, Justice O'Connor, I think the test to understand whether or not section 5 has been appropriately used by Congress is the text of the amendment itself."
1996.95-2074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,185.463,189.347,"Well, Katzenbach v. Morgan I think went further than that."
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,201.572,211.63,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, Lassiter stated that as a facial matter a particular literacy test was not unconstitutional."
1996.95-2074,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,240.5,258.612,"Well, it's kind of unsatisfactory, really, to think that all you'd get from your argument is at best a notion that we would say Congress had to do a better job of making facts, a factual determination here, and that's kind of an uncomfortable position to be in."
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,281.066,293.605,"Well, Justice O'Connor, the difference between the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and all of this Court's section 5 jurisprudence will turn on the meaning of the word appropriate legislation, which section 5 says."
1996.95-2074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,299.789,316.059,"Well, given that, could we go back to Justice O'Connor's original question, which I think was, in effect, why isn't there an obvious analogy between the situation in the Voting Rights Act, section 2, section 5, and the case that we have before us?"
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,323.775,333.162,Because Congress in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was not aiming to ensure constitutional guarantees under the Free Exercise Clause.
1996.95-2074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,344.969,353.325,So basically it was the candor of Congress which is going to result in the unconstitutionality of this statute in your view?
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,353.325,359.428,"Not the candor, Justice Souter, but rather the patent purpose--"
1996.95-2074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,359.428,362.618,"Well, candor in expressing the purpose."
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,388.097,392.311,--That still would not pass this Court's section 5 jurisprudence.
1996.95-2074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,403.578,405.04,"So it's timing, then."
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,419.949,420.588,"Well, presumably--"
1996.95-2074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,420.588,421.199,They jumped the gun.
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,422.22,436.642,"--Well, presumably, if Congress did find specific instances... for example, there was a set of laws that almost always meant there was discrimination against a particular religion... in that particular circumstance, Congress would be acting the way they were acting under the Voting Rights Act cases."
1996.95-2074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,436.642,437.571,Okay.
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,450.081,457.946,"Well, in addition, it would have been impossible to have gotten a factual record with respect to every law in the United States, whether passed--"
1996.95-2074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,457.946,465.002,"--Well, does Congress... I assume... I... and that may be so, but I take it your argument is that Congress in effect has to wait."
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,480.8,481.141,"--Yes, Justice--"
1996.95-2074,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,481.141,483.693,"To put a finer point on it, let me ask you this."
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,514.033,515.315,--If Congress--
1996.95-2074,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,515.315,515.856,Or religion.
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,516.943,530.913,"--If Congress had evidence that there were instances where there was discrimination in a particular arena with respect to particular types of religions, Congress certainly could go ahead and do what you're describing, which is--"
1996.95-2074,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,530.913,544.283,"It could pass a law that says some State law, for example, that disproportionately affects a religious group would be subject to stricter scrutiny?"
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,544.283,545.272,--I think that's possible.
1996.95-2074,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,547.004,549.105,But you think that's not what was done?
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,549.105,550.367,That is not what was done here.
1996.95-2074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,553.76,566.696,"Ms. Hamilton, in your brief you say that the Court should lay to rest the substantive power theory, i.e. the notion that Congress may expand the scope of constitutional guarantees."
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,572.129,572.34,Yes.
1996.95-2074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,575.492,575.712,Yes.
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,575.712,580.728,I would hold it to the much narrower holding of the fact-finding capacity of Congress.
1996.95-2074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,580.728,599.439,"Ms. Hamilton, when Congress wrote this provision that's central here... Congress shall have power to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions of this article... and when that was ratified by the States, was it understood that the provisions of this article included the First Amendment?"
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,607.144,610.805,It's not at all clear in the legislative history.
1996.95-2074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,617.29,619.881,Which is a development of this century.
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,619.881,620.192,Right.
1996.95-2074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,620.192,623.544,"And, indeed, of the latter two-thirds of this century, isn't it?"
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,623.544,624.125,Right.
1996.95-2074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,624.846,627.909,"Well, why isn't that the argument you're making, then, that--"
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,627.909,630.439,"--Oh, we do make that in a footnote in the opening brief."
1996.95-2074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,636.356,661.07,"--Yes, but certainly that's a major point, that when Congress has adopted a provision which it... or has proposed for a constitutional amendment a provision that enables Congress to prevent the unequal treatment of any citizen, but especially of blacks, which is what was at issue at the... to convert that into the power of Congress to enforce any provision of the Bill of Rights, isn't that a massive alteration of the original meaning of it?"
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,661.07,661.821,It's staggering.
1996.95-2074,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,661.821,662.963,Ms. Hamilton--
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,669.588,670.078,No.
1996.95-2074,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,704.653,705.134,Why is--
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,705.134,705.802,--in the history of the Fourteenth Amendment.
1996.95-2074,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,705.802,716.451,"--Why is it staggering, even under a pre-Fourteenth Amendment view... I mean, sorry, the ancient view that was being described."
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,755.677,755.957,Well--
1996.95-2074,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,755.957,761.07,And why is it such an odd thing that we should look to the... scrutinize the evidentiary records of--
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,761.07,783.404,"--Well, Justice Breyer, I think the point that Justice Scalia was leading me to with the... and I was able to get in staggering was that the question of the definition of appropriate, how far can Congress go to enforce constitutional guarantees, and the real question in this case is what does prophylactic mean if, in fact, they have a prophylactic power?"
1996.95-2074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,810.251,817.928,"--As far as our prior holdings go, have we ever extended that power to anything except the equal protection provisions of the Constitution?"
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,817.928,825.492,"The only case that would indicate that it was extended at all would be Hutto v. Finney, and there's no prophylactic power question in that case."
1996.95-2074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,825.492,827.976,"Well, I take it... I want to make sure I understand your argument."
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,856.556,857.525,I think that's right.
1996.95-2074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,857.525,857.776,Why--
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,857.776,860.647,I think McCulloch v. Maryland applies in both instances.
1996.95-2074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,860.647,876.139,"--Yes, and I guess where I'm not sure is, why is it that you make this distinction between the protection of incorporated rights and the protection of rights which are spelled out in the text of the amendment?"
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,888.427,892.149,"Well, the city certainly does not challenge incorporation per se."
1996.95-2074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,892.988,899.232,"Okay, then how can we draw the line between the rights with... as to congressional powers to incorporated rights and nonincorporated--"
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,899.232,915.775,"--I think the argument is that Katzenbach v. Morgan was applied to equality rights, and if there's going to be a broad reading under the Fourteenth Amendment for enforcement, it would have to be with equality rights, and if that's right, Katzenbach must be the upper limit."
1996.95-2074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,918.997,940.39,"--No, but that still assumes... when you say it's the upper limit, I assume you're talking in terms of categories, and you are still drawing a line between Congress' power with respect to incorporated rights and with respect to section 1 rights, and I don't understand... if incorporation is not to be overruled, I don't understand how that line can be drawn on a principled basis."
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,940.39,945.124,"--Your Honor, the city's argument does not center on extinction."
1996.95-2074,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,962.465,977.266,"Is your main point, then, with respect to that branch of your argument that what Congress may be able to do in a particularized way, focusing on a discrete problem, it can't do wholesale?"
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,977.654,980.376,"That is exactly our argument, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.95-2074,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,980.376,987.112,"--Is that a separation of powers argument in part, that we must proceed on a case-by-case basis?"
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,990.304,990.514,I think--
1996.95-2074,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,990.514,991.546,--separation of powers argument?
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,991.546,1007.796,"--I... Justice Kennedy, there... the separation of powers argument is that the one thing that Congress cannot do is to enact a standard that will apply across every law in the country and will, in fact, mimic the Constitution in its scope."
1996.95-2074,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1007.796,1014.801,"And does that apply to the validity of the law in its Federal aspect, or just vis-a-vis the States?"
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,1014.801,1019.846,The separation of powers argument would in fact invalidate this law as applied to both State and Federal law.
1996.95-2074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1019.846,1033.414,"Well, you are saying in effect I think that Congress under section 5 cannot anticipate what it sees as a likely difficulty and provide for it by legislation, but Congress can do that generally."
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,1036.036,1042.16,"Justice Souter, I'm confused about when Congress has been able to do that generally."
1996.95-2074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1043.622,1050.806,We don't generally except in very specific instances... the First Amendment I suppose is a good example.
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,1083.439,1086.431,"--Your Honor, we're not arguing for a high level on Congress."
1996.95-2074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1088.283,1097.76,"Well, you're saying it cannot anticipate a problem without in effect making a factual record to show that in a specific instance the problem has already occurred."
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,1099.331,1106.665,"--Well, Justice Souter, that seems to me the only way to prevent massive usurpation of State law that RFRA effects."
1996.95-2074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1108.558,1121.315,"Well, why doesn't Congress have the same risk of massive usurpation whenever it is legislating under Article I in cases in which it's noninfringing or risking an infringement of individual rights?"
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,1121.315,1137.006,"--Well, Your Honor, the most appropriate case would be Heart of Atlanta Motel, in which Congress did provide for rights against discrimination in the Commerce Clause context when it was acting appropriately according to that enumerated power."
1996.95-2074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1141.678,1150.736,"Well, it had an enumerated power under the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause, and I suppose it's got an enumerated power under section 5."
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,1151.357,1157.632,"The difference is the language of section 5, which limits enforcement to the enforcement of constitutional guarantees."
1996.95-2074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1157.632,1161.145,The Necessary and Proper Clause does the same thing.
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,1161.145,1168.281,"The Necessary and Proper Clause, Your Honor, gives Congress the ability... may I finish my answer?"
1996.95-2074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1168.281,1169.322,"Finish your answer, yes."
1996.95-2074,0,36026,marci_a_hamilton,,1169.322,1177.978,"Gives Congress the ability to make effective its enumerated powers, but it does not say that Congress can do what it did in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act."
1996.95-2074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1177.978,1179.768,"Thank you, Ms. Hamilton."
1996.95-2074,1,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1181.701,1193.806,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-2074,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1270.31,1276.452,"Well, but now, when you say incorporated rights, we've been quite selective, haven't we, in what rights are incorporated."
1996.95-2074,1,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1286.592,1288.723,"--That is true, Your Honor."
1996.95-2074,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1288.723,1291.435,Then why can't we read section 5 the same way?
1996.95-2074,1,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1305.184,1313.029,"As your incorporation decisions read, section 5 in this instance is not enforcing the First Amendment."
1996.95-2074,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1336.224,1343.389,"What if Congress were to say that we think that the grand jury provision of... what is it, the Seventh, the Sixth Amendment +/?"
1996.95-2074,1,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1359.068,1360.921,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1996.95-2074,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1368.988,1375.503,How do we know that section 1 doesn't cover the grand jury provision?
1996.95-2074,1,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1375.503,1377.155,"--Excuse me, Your Honor."
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2086.132,2098.54,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-2074,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2120.635,2125.847,"Well, certainly some of the early cases on which Katzenbach relied are not to that effect."
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2140.981,2167.735,"I agree the holding in Ex parte Virginia did not present the question we have presented here, but the standard the Court announced in Ex parte Virginia was that the congressional power reaches whatever is adapted to carry out the objects the amendments have in view, and by the next case 4 years later, the civil rights cases adopted the badges and incidents theory of the enforcement power under the Thirteenth Amendment, which plainly goes vastly further than anything this Court would ever consider doing under the Thirteenth Amendment."
1996.95-2074,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2167.735,2175.893,"Well, there is that word appropriate in there, in section 5, I guess, that might bear some interpretation or weight."
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2175.893,2176.632,It--
1996.95-2074,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2176.632,2178.064,It has to be appropriate.
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2186.151,2187.301,--That is not contested.
1996.95-2074,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2187.301,2188.392,Excuse me?
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2188.392,2189.484,Everyone agrees with that.
1996.95-2074,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2189.484,2190.032,Yes.
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2190.032,2191.543,Congress cannot overrule the Court.
1996.95-2074,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2191.543,2197.938,"And there's some indication that that was what Congress was all about here, if you read the purpose clause."
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2210.156,2211.628,The effect is to--
1996.95-2074,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2211.628,2212.318,--retroactively.
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2212.318,2218.134,--The effect is to achieve a different result in some cases than Smith would achieve--
1996.95-2074,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2218.134,2218.913,"Well, and indeed, in Smith."
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2218.913,2219.354,--Pardon?
1996.95-2074,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2219.354,2220.946,And in Smith itself.
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2228.01,2230.404,"Well, it would be... overturn is shorthand."
1996.95-2074,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2230.404,2230.614,Directly and retroactively.
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2230.614,2230.874,Pardon?
1996.95-2074,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2230.874,2232.236,And retroactively.
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2232.236,2234.067,Yes.
1996.95-2074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2245.453,2248.585,"Mr. Laycock, do you think it overturns Reynolds?"
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2248.585,2250.438,Do I think it overturns Reynolds?
1996.95-2074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2250.438,2250.798,Yes.
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2250.798,2254.671,"No, I don't think it overturns Reynolds, but the... that's a compelling interest question."
1996.95-2074,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2259.756,2263.679,"Well, of course, Reynolds didn't reason on that basis."
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2267.961,2275.515,"You would write a different opinion than you wrote in Reynolds, but it's not at all clear the result would be any different than in Reynolds, but that would be up to this Court."
1996.95-2074,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2281.909,2297.811,"How about cases involving prisoners who... and I've seen several of these since I've been here, and petitions claiming a right in prison to smoke marijuana as part of their religious practices and beliefs."
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2310.601,2314.083,--We all know that prisoners file frivolous claims.
1996.95-2074,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2315.636,2317.686,"Well, it would require that, would it not?"
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2317.686,2328.031,"--It requires a claim, but the one piece of data on that is in the brief of the State of Texas, which reports that of all the cases pending against the State and its agencies, less than one-quarter of 1 percent are RFRA claims."
1996.95-2074,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2333.544,2367.007,"Well, certainly it would be open in the future for that claim to be made, or for some child to claim that their religious beliefs require them to take weapons to school, or that somebody has an absolute right under the Free Exercise Clause in the military context to wear yarmulkes, or other religious dress or head gear as their religion dictates, and that would overturn, I guess, a decision of this Court on that subject."
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2367.007,2370.86,"--Well, it would require the Court to apply a different standard under the statute, but the district judges--"
1996.95-2074,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2370.86,2370.951,Excuse me.
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2380.982,2386.825,--Goldman was overruled by a particular statute shortly after it was decided.
1996.95-2074,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2386.825,2388.555,--I'm not talking about that one.
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2390.358,2393.607,RFRA... It's hard to imagine a compelling interest in--
1996.95-2074,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2393.607,2394.949,But we held there was one.
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2403.617,2406.19,"--If that's how you read Goldman, it is not overruled."
1996.95-2074,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2413.186,2426.566,"Well, compelling interest has an institutional, a juridical meaning based on our past cases, and I assume under ordinary principles of statutory construction that that is what Congress intended."
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2426.566,2427.154,That is correct.
1996.95-2074,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2427.154,2431.468,So Congress really hasn't tied our hands very much.
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2439.365,2442.628,You might reconsider that holding if it ever comes up.
1996.95-2074,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2452.131,2454.104,I'd like to hear your response--
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2482.973,2491.879,"That's the statutory standard you must follow, but you have the same independence in interpreting that statute that you have in interpreting any other statute, which isn't to say unconstrained freedom."
1996.95-2074,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2500.406,2506.119,"Well, but... compelling... we're interpreting what Congress meant by compelling interest in the statute--"
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2506.119,2506.949,--That's correct.
1996.95-2074,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2506.949,2512.394,"--rather than, as we had previously thought, what we meant by a compelling interest under the Constitution."
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2513.514,2513.954,Well--
1996.95-2074,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2513.954,2516.085,It's dramatically different.
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2516.085,2519.928,"--It's a different task, but it's no less judicially independent."
1996.95-2074,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2522.452,2528.766,"Well, except if we're faithful to our oaths we've got to say, we're looking at what Congress meant by this."
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2540.225,2543.049,"I don't think we disagree, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-2074,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2546.479,2570.796,"Well, certainly under this Court's notion of the needs and authority of the military we've given a good deal of deference to military requirements, just as we have to prison disciplinary requirements in the prison context, and so our balance might well come out differently in those cases in the past."
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2588.649,2599.296,"Congress attempted to apply the compelling interest test across the board, but Congress is also quite clear that what is a compelling interest depends upon context."
1996.95-2074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2602.868,2609.564,"I'm not even sure what compelling interest means in the peyote case itself, because the Court was divided on that issue."
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2614.138,2617.391,--I share that assumption.
1996.95-2074,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2625.325,2642.175,"Have you considered the possibility that Congress might have been well within section 5 with respect to its insistence upon, we'll call it an effects test, but perhaps went too far when it got to enacting a compelling interest criterion?"
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2644.138,2654.714,"In theory the baby can be split, but there's no basis in section 5 to make that split."
1996.95-2074,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2669.155,2684.224,"Mr. Laycock, you can say that, and I could understand it intellectually, but practically isn't it so that what this statute does is to make the Smith doctrine academic, a dead letter?"
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2686.918,2688.257,It will occasionally be applied.
1996.95-2074,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2707.14,2719.199,Can you explain to me a case in which the notion that a law of general application does not have to make exceptions for religious observances?
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2719.199,2720.118,"Well, it--"
1996.95-2074,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2720.118,2724.492,"Where that would... once we have RFRA, where that doctrine would ever come into play?"
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2724.492,2734.687,"--It is always in the litigant's interest to show that the law is not of general applicability, that in fact it discriminates, because that undermines the Government's compelling interest argument, undermines the Government's credibility."
1996.95-2074,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2742.645,2745.716,Are you answering Justice Ginsburg's question?
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2747.306,2748.327,I thought I was.
1996.95-2074,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2751.399,2760.155,"Because my understanding was that this goes at least as far in protecting religious freedom as Smith does, and then goes quite a distance further."
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2760.155,2761.738,It goes some distance further.
1996.95-2074,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2767.431,2770.383,"Well, that's what I don't understand."
1996.95-2074,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2780.772,2784.164,That was the purpose in enacting it.
1996.95-2074,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3261.464,3273.18,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-2074,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3292.725,3294.237,"In what, Mr. Dellinger?"
1996.95-2074,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3297.97,3298.209,--I'm sorry.
1996.95-2074,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3298.91,3299.53,Oh.
1996.95-2074,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3301.343,3302.365,Versus the City of Hialeah.
1996.95-2074,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3337.64,3349.728,"Do you take the position in this case, Mr. Solicitor General, that the denial of the variance from the historic site ordinance was, in fact, a violation of the act?"
1996.95-2074,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3353.14,3359.613,"--No, Justice Kennedy, we do not... we have not included... and Mr. Laycock tells me it is a substantial burden and would violate RFRA."
1996.95-2074,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3371.631,3375.866,Assume that charitable deductions are very important for some churches.
1996.95-2074,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3384.55,3390.424,I think where you have... it would be tested in this Court by the standards--
1996.95-2074,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3390.424,3392.296,"But this act addresses that, does it not?"
1996.95-2074,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3392.296,3392.385,--This act.
1996.95-2074,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3392.385,3399.61,And this act says that Congress must use the least-restrictive means in formulating its tax policy--
1996.95-2074,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3399.61,3401.583,The Court would have to--
1996.95-2074,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3401.583,3402.554,--in order to protect religion.
1996.95-2074,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3402.554,3402.863,--It is not clear--
1996.95-2074,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3402.863,3403.454,Is that not correct?
1996.95-2074,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3403.454,3403.644,--It is not--
1996.95-2074,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3403.644,3404.425,Is that not correct?
1996.95-2074,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3404.425,3405.656,"--That is correct, Justice Kennedy."
1996.95-2074,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3421.97,3424.98,Would we even get to the act if that's all Congress did?
1996.95-2074,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3446.827,3450.189,"No, I'd assumed they had abolished the charitable deduction completely."
1996.95-2074,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3450.189,3450.409,--Correct.
1996.95-2074,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3450.409,3453.272,And your position is that taxation is not a burden?
1996.95-2074,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3453.272,3454.604,That the--

1996.95-2074,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3461.627,3461.968,The--
1996.95-2074,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3461.968,3465.42,"Which amounts to saying that taxation is not a burden, right, and that's--"
1996.95-2074,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3465.42,3469.754,"--Well, it is a burden, but we're talking about a burden on the free exercise of religion."
1996.95-2074,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3486.728,3501.397,"--Mr. Solicitor General, does that require us to assume, and that may be correct, that, as was the case with the Fourteenth Amendment and the Voting Rights Act and all... there's a long, well-documented history of violations of the rights of the people protected by the Fourteenth Amendment."
1996.95-2074,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3509.292,3510.694,--No.
1996.95-2074,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3553.131,3553.352,How does that--
1996.95-2074,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3580.049,3580.258,That is correct.
1996.95-2074,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3580.258,3602.953,"And then it says, section 2, Congress shall have power to enforce this article and so, your argument goes, where a general law that isn't motivated purposely is at stake, insofar as Congress forbids that, it's not enforcing the Constitution, because--"
1996.95-2074,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3602.953,3605.056,"Justice Breyer, I--"
1996.95-2074,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3605.056,3605.918,--the Constitution doesn't prohibit that.
1996.95-2074,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3608.639,3608.977,--Yes.
1996.95-2074,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3609.588,3610.99,--tie that response to a linguistic argument.
1996.95-2074,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3610.99,3611.28,--My response is quite clearly--
1996.95-2074,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3611.28,3611.431,Yes.
1996.95-2074,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3611.431,3626.173,"--Congress is prohibited requiring exemptions not otherwise required to some laws that would not violate section 1, but it is doing so prophylactically, as this Court does in cases like Miranda and many others."
1996.95-2074,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3628.144,3633.415,"Well, how many others... how many others, other than Miranda are there, where they... we have imposed a prophylactic rule?"
1996.95-2074,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3633.415,3636.979,--I believe that a number of your rules are prophylactic.
1996.95-2074,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3643.634,3645.975,"Well, that was a constitutional holding."
1996.95-2074,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3645.975,3646.346,--Yes.
1996.95-2074,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3677.657,3681.35,Let me take just what you're saying and put it in this linguistic framework.

1996.95-2074,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3770.481,3772.752,"Yes, Now... if may just finish up."
1996.95-2074,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3805.075,3805.426,--Well--
1996.95-2074,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3805.426,3809.059,--we are concerned that we won't be able to police those in the future.
