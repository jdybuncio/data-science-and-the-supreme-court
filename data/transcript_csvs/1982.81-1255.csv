1982.81-1255,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,15.275,"We will hear arguments next in Planned Parenthood Association of Kansas City, Missouri against John Ashcroft, Attorney General of Missouri, and the related case."
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,41.281,44.279,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1255,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,266.938,267.22,We've said that in a number of our opinions.
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,267.22,269.11,That's correct.
1982.81-1255,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,269.11,271.266,Why is that so startling to you?
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,271.266,274.344,"It is not startling, but I do not feel that they accurately do it."
1982.81-1255,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,278.747,286.932,"Well, that's one of these generalizations which has the value of many generalizations."
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,289.805,291.57,"--Yes, you have, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1255,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,307.548,317.654,"Do you think that, say a judge of the court of appeals who takes an oath to follow the Constitution who writes an opinion that is reversed by this Court is not being faithful to his oath?"
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,317.654,322.667,"No, I think he's being faithful to the oath if he intentionally tries to apply it to the best of his or her ability."
1982.81-1255,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,770.674,773.502,"Mr. Susman, where are the findings on remand?"
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,773.502,793.636,"These are all in the Joint Appendix on pages 12 through 14... actually, 12 through 14, and then the same findings by the appellate court, or additional findings, are found on the Cross-Petition at A61 and A116."
1982.81-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,948.963,950.698,Is that true throughout the period?
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,950.698,961.583,It was true throughout the period that they were presently being performed in Missouri and by the physicians who were the experts testifying.
1982.81-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,961.583,965.786,"No, I mean is it true about... the relative safety... is it true throughout the second trimester?"
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,965.786,970.283,I would suggest that it is probably not true.
1982.81-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,984.449,999.396,"Well, if the evidence showed that this relative safety was true only up to the 16th week, for example, the statute arguably might be unconstitutional, to that extent."
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,1001.068,1008.767,"Because first of all, all second trimester procedures were not really an issue in this case."
1982.81-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1020.841,1024.683,"No, but the question is whether hospitalization is necessary."
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,1024.683,1025.619,Correct.
1982.81-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1026.213,1030.399,"Throughout the period, throughout the second trimester."
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,1030.399,1037.225,"--Then if it does not eliminate that period of time when it is not safer, then it has not been narrowly tailored."
1982.81-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1037.225,1040.848,But why is it invalid on its face?
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,1043.145,1051.845,"I'm not sure but this requirement is, in fact, invalid on its face."
1982.81-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1078.458,1080.395,I'm talking about the evidence that was submitted.
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,1080.395,1081.004,Yes.
1982.81-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1081.004,1094.655,The evidence did not suggest that aborting throughout the second trimester was as safe as childbirth.
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,1094.655,1100.325,"No, there was no evidence discussing the higher range of the second trimester."
1982.81-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1100.325,1101.997,"Well, what did it discuss?"
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,1101.997,1102.762,"Theoretically, it would even be past--"
1982.81-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1102.762,1105.058,What did it discuss?
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,1105.058,1111.806,"--It discussed... the experts who testified, and the statistics, mainly went through 18 weeks."
1982.81-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1111.806,1125.049,"And... well, what was the period during which the testimony indicated that aborting was as safe as childbirth?"
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,1125.721,1127.252,The district court found through the 18th week.
1982.81-1255,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1132.375,1136.358,And tell me again who was the district judge?
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,1136.358,1139.809,"Judge Elmo Hunter, now senior status."
1982.81-1255,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1139.809,1147.229,"Mr. Susman, does Missouri license outpatient clinics at all?"
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,1147.229,1151.071,"No, Your Honor, although that's not a complete answer."
1982.81-1255,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1185.682,1191.587,Are abortion procedures specifically barred by the regulations?
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,1191.587,1192.413,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1255,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1210.89,1212.841,More than one or just a permanent?
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,1212.841,1213.935,--It just says a permanent staff.
1982.81-1255,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1225.275,1228.976,Without regard to the surgical procedure?
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,1228.976,1233.085,"Abso... well, that's what the definition says, yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1255,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1233.085,1238.598,"In any event, the clinics you represent were not licensed--"
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,1238.598,1242.502,"Both of these clinics are not-for-profit agencies, tax exempt under the IRS."
1982.81-1255,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1242.502,1246.25,--And your position is that they would not have been licensed if they had applied for a license.
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,1246.25,1253.623,"I don't know whether they would have been licensed, but the statute clearly does not require it, no one has ever suggested it."
1982.81-1255,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1282.846,1295.933,In the prior case there was testimony referred to by the president or past president of the American College of Obstetricians--
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,1295.933,1296.168,Dr. Schmidt.
1982.81-1255,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1296.168,1303.978,--that all second trimester procedures should be in a hospital.
1982.81-1255,0,24566,frank_susman,,1306.383,1310.553,"Well, curiously enough, that same Dr. Schmidt testified in this case."
1982.81-1255,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1352.161,1361.501,"Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Attorney General?"
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,1361.501,1366.451,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1703.221,1706.751,May I interrupt with a question before you go on to the second doctor issue?
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,1716.966,1735.739,--We believe that there is a great deal of testimony that indicates that medical debate is going on here as to whether or not it is as safe or safer to require these in the hospital.
1982.81-1255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1735.739,1736.161,I understand.
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,1755.684,1758.745,The finding is an established fact.
1982.81-1255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1763.057,1766.822,Are you urging that we set aside the finding as clearly erroneous?
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,1766.822,1768.226,No.
1982.81-1255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1768.226,1771.865,Should we decide the case on the assumption that the finding is correct?
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,1771.865,1778.535,"Even if you find that the finding is correct, I am urging this Court to--"
1982.81-1255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1778.535,1787.453,"If that's true, is it not established that this requirement does reduce the number of abortions that are performed during this period?"
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,1798.105,1809.726,--The state of Missouri is willing to concede that the choice for an abortion in a hospital is more difficult than the choice in a clinic facility.
1982.81-1255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1809.726,1817.8,"So in consequence of the statute, a fewer number of abortions in this period are performed, at least performed lawfully."
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,1818.549,1820.314,The state is unwilling to concede that.
1982.81-1255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1834.184,1845.008,--What I'm wondering is what happens to these women who want abortions during this period and are not going to hospitals by reason of the statute; are they safer or less safe by reason of the requirement?
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,1845.008,1851.943,Are they safer by not going to the hospital or less safe than--
1982.81-1255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1851.943,1859.532,"I mean, are they going someplace else that may be an unlawful choice, or are they giving up their opportunity that they want?"
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,1860.11,1866.592,--There is no evidence in the record of this case to indicate that the women are going to unlawful sources for abortion.
1982.81-1255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1866.592,1884.726,"General Ashcroft, Justice Stevens asked you about a finding of fact the district court made that the effect of the statute... and I'm simply repeating what I thought either he said or you said... that the effect of the statute is to cut down the number of abortions actually performed."
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,1886.226,1888.865,The district court--
1982.81-1255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1888.865,1892.458,"Well, let me get to my basic question I want to put to you."
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,1906.811,1912.091,--I think the district court looked to a time in Missouri when hospitalization was required.
1982.81-1255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1931.411,1936.127,So his finding related to a time period during which this statute wasn't in effect.
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,1936.127,1944.125,"--It was based upon information from a time period when this statute was not in effect, and that's why the state is reluctant to agree with the conclusion in that matter."
1982.81-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1944.125,1955.527,Wouldn't it be possible that one explanation might be that they went elsewhere into another jurisdiction?
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,1955.527,1956.761,It is possible.
1982.81-1255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1966.224,1968.271,Where do people go from St. Louis?
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,1969.426,1971.02,They might go into Illinois somewhere.
1982.81-1255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1972.628,1973.222,East St. Louis.
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,1976.674,1977.439,"--Yes, sir."
1982.81-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1978.813,1987.013,Are you suggesting that the statistic is not too reliable?
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,1987.013,1989.95,I am suggesting that it's not an inevitable statistic.
1982.81-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1991.543,1996.588,"Well, the court found that... and the court of appeals agreed with it... said it was supported by the evidence."
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,1996.588,1997.806,--That's correct.
1982.81-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2008.505,2016.375,"Normally, on your statement of the standard, we would normally then accept that finding."
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,2034.791,2034.807,--Yes.
1982.81-1255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2053.082,2065.17,"--Is there any evidence in the record as to the number of illnesses or such, or complications that were caused by reason of second trimester abortions being performed other than in a hospital?"
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,2065.17,2086.927,"There is some evidence about complications and deaths outside of hospitals, but basically, this evidence which was in the case took place prior to the suspension of the law, during a period of time when second trimester abortions were required to be in hospitals in the state of Missouri."
1982.81-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2102.796,2109.386,"Mr. Attorney General, you heard some questions in the previous case about legislative history and whatnot."
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,2112.182,2120.757,Missouri does not record... other than the fact that hearings may have been held and the like... that there is--
1982.81-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2120.757,2122.772,They keep no record of hearings?
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,2122.772,2123.412,--That's correct.
1982.81-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2128.645,2131.535,Are there any legislative findings that precede this statute?
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,2131.535,2132.221,--Not to my knowledge.
1982.81-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2212.345,2214.314,"Well, the district court found 18 weeks."
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,2217.297,2217.844,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2217.844,2221.84,And the court of appeals affirmed that.
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,2221.84,2237.397,"Neither the district court nor the court of appeals acknowledged to any willingness to differentiate between the weeks of gestation statistics, which were supplied over and over again, and the Missouri statute's requirement for weeks of pregnancy."
1982.81-1255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2407.75,2411.468,"Mr. Ashcroft, one other question."
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,2429.584,2432.271,"Well certainly, this enactment is abortion related."
1982.81-1255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2432.678,2441.721,"But is there any other counterpart in any other field of medicine where the legislature has said, for example, in heart surgery or something else, you may perform one technique and not another?"
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,2441.721,2445.345,--I don't know in reference to a specific technique.
1982.81-1255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2452.92,2454.623,Do you have any others which say you must do it in a hospital?
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,2454.623,2462.027,--I don't have an awareness of any other statute requiring that a particular surgical procedure must be in a hospital.
1982.81-1255,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2462.027,2471.428,You had the example in the Danforth case of amniocentesis as being proscribed.
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,2471.428,2472.709,That's correct.
1982.81-1255,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2472.709,2477.63,There's an example where your legislature undertook a medical determination.
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,2477.63,2483.611,"That's correct, and it was not allowed and declared unconstitutional by this Court."
1982.81-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2483.611,2493.591,"Could the legislature of a state constitutionally require that all childbirths take place in a hospital, absent an emergency?"
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,2493.591,2496.495,I believe that it could.
1982.81-1255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2501.307,2503.51,"Would be a little hard to enforce, I think."
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,2513.209,2514.239,--That would be my understanding.
1982.81-1255,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2514.239,2516.833,Would lack of money be an emergency?
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,2516.833,2524.642,"No, I don't think it would, and I don't think the lack of money would really prevent that--"
1982.81-1255,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2524.642,2528.453,"So that a poor woman who couldn't afford a hospital had a baby, she'd commit a crime."
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,2530.811,2540.713,--We've made provision in Missouri for individuals who seek... are having children who don't have the resources to afford the hospital setting to be provided for in the hospital.
1982.81-1255,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2962.947,2968.65,Does Missouri require the presence of a second doctor with a premature normal birth?
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,2968.65,2971.008,The Missouri law does not.
1982.81-1255,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2989.047,2995.357,You would recommend that the legislature do this?
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,2995.357,2996.95,Pardon?
1982.81-1255,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2996.95,3014.162,"You would recommend that the legislature pass a statute requiring the presence of a second physician, second surgeon, second OB, whatever you want, in the delivery room for a premature, normal birth."
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,3014.162,3016.317,Yes.
1982.81-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3016.317,3017.989,Your office would so recommend.
1982.81-1255,1,28835,john_ashcroft,,3017.989,3019.519,"Yes, I would."
1982.81-1255,2,24566,frank_susman,,3235.775,3240.492,"First of all, Justice Rehnquist, if I might perhaps clear up some confusion."
1982.81-1255,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3270.137,3281.695,"Do you know why the 70 provision respecting hospitals from 1974 to 79 in effect then was not challenged, whereas this one, which you say is identical, was?"

1982.81-1255,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3353.399,3363.256,They thought that our constitutional doctrine should change because views of organizations like the American Public Health Association changed?
1982.81-1255,2,24566,frank_susman,,3363.256,3363.552,No.
1982.81-1255,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3423.232,3432.118,That doesn't answer his argument that the second doctor provides an additional protection against using that procedure when it may not be the appropriate procedure.
1982.81-1255,2,24566,frank_susman,,3432.118,3440.317,"That second physician, while they might have some idle conversation, has no direct say in that decision."
