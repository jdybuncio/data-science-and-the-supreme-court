1987.87-5428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.741,"Ms. White, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,13.741,14.358,Thank you.
1987.87-5428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,157.033,158.735,That was a direct appeal?
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,161.354,174.412,"Justice Rehnquist, that is correct, but, in fact, that proposition, that quote, in Fallen v. United States, was quoted by the Advisory Committee to the rules of appellate procedure, particularly under Rule 3."
1987.87-5428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,211.318,219.607,"Well, isn't there a statute here that we have to come to grips with, and there wasn't for the direct appeal?"
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,219.607,230.047,"--Justice O'Connor, the state points out that 20 USC Sec. 2107 is a statute that says that in civil cases an appeal must be brought within 30 days."
1987.87-5428,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,303.545,309.249,"Well, he would have had to... would he have had to have a certificate, some affidavit?"
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,309.249,310.617,--That's an interesting question.
1987.87-5428,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,322.174,328.328,"That's terribly hard on the pro se indigent prisoner, isn't it, that rule?"
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,333.014,337.101,I think that that is illustrated greatly by this case.
1987.87-5428,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,402.81,418.803,"So you suggest that we should simply construe the word ""filed"" as used in the rules as being satisfied if he has delivered his notice of appeal to the prison authorities in ample time?"
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,418.803,428.159,"I suggest that is one thing that the Court could do, and since those are rules that are to be applied with elasticity, and rules written and approved by this Court, the Court can do that."
1987.87-5428,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,428.159,432.211,"That was Justice Stewart's suggestion, wasn't it, in Fallen?"
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,432.211,439.967,"Justice Warren wrote the opinion, Chief Justice Warren, but there was a concurring opinion in which the mailbox rule was proposed."
1987.87-5428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,441.783,452.69,"What if the post office takes ten days to... you know, some of us feel just as helpless putting it in the mailbox as a prisoner might feel delivering it to the warden."
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,462.046,475.39,"A number of cases have recognized that reliance upon normal delivery of mail is excusable neglect, is good reliance, and, in fact, I think what the Court would have to determine is what is reasonable."
1987.87-5428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,494.166,496.118,To meet a jurisdictional deadline?
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,496.118,502.188,The jurisdiction aspect of it is only filing.
1987.87-5428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,550.919,559.775,"Well, do you think we should incorporate all those doctrines into something where you are trying to talk about whether the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction of a case?"
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,572.099,584.323,"If I understand your question, I do think that the simplest way to cure the matter would be to define filing for all papers in the Circuit Court as occurring upon the same act."
1987.87-5428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,606.153,616.342,"We just had a case the other day, Ms. White, about a post office employee who was dismissed for keeping mail in the trunk of his car for a year and never delivering it."
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,638.541,643.612,"Yes, sir, I understand that reservation, Justice Scalia, but we don't have that case before the court."
1987.87-5428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,645.812,650.282,But you're suggesting a rule that leaves itself open to that kind of uncertainty.
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,664.108,667.477,I am not suggesting that that rule is the only way the Court can go.
1987.87-5428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,744.143,759.82,"Well, in the cases you're talking about, the District Court had indicated that a motion to grant an extension would be granted, or at least assured the people that what they proposed to do would be timely, although he was, in fact, wrong."
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,763.605,766.891,You're absolutely correct in the case of Harris Truck Lines.
1987.87-5428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,845.276,854.882,Do you think that the inmate then is not required to conform to the rules of civil procedure if he is going pro se in a way that other parties are?
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,854.882,855.983,Absolutely.
1987.87-5428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,855.983,857.2,Absolutely what?
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,857.2,857.816,Absolutely.
1987.87-5428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,887.186,894.209,"In the Kerner case, that was a statement that they are not held to the same level of expertise in drafting a complaint."
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,901.362,909.968,"That's true that the Kerner case dealt with the 12(b)(6) dismissal of a complaint, and the Court said we don't hold pro se inmates at the same level."
1987.87-5428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,927.663,938.887,"Do any of those cases say that those... that pro se inmates could not conform with the jurisdictional rule, either Darr, or Price against Johnston, or Holiday against Johnston?"
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,938.887,939.97,I would suggest that this Court--
1987.87-5428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,939.97,941.037,Could you answer the question?
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,941.037,953.48,"--Sir, none of those cases dealt directly with applying... with complying with an appellate rule, but this Court said that when it approved rule of appellate procedure 7, I believe it is, in which it says"
1987.87-5428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,975.828,983.749,"It seems to me there are two factors involved here when you say substantially complies, and when you say unlettered litigant, whatever."
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1014.769,1024.041,"In regards to your first point, I think if you would indulge me, we are assuming that Petitioner Houston knew that it was 30 days."
1987.87-5428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1066.535,1068.785,That could happen to anybody no matter how literate you are.
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1073.605,1083.127,"But when it happens to me, when I mail on the 27th day, I can call the Clerk, I can travel to the Clerk's Office to make sure it got there."
1987.87-5428,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1100.486,1106.74,"You are not trying to tell me that a prisoner doesn't know about the calendar, and the days?"
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1110.509,1113.745,"Yes, sir, they may have quite a bit of experience in counting the days."
1987.87-5428,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1118.797,1121.399,And they know how to do it.
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1132.457,1135.659,That's exactly what he did in this case.
1987.87-5428,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1322.011,1331.783,--the date on which the prison authorities turned the notice over to the mailman?
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1331.783,1333.152,"No, sir, you do not."
1987.87-5428,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1343.757,1345.642,And then Mr. Clerk got it on February 7th?
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1345.642,1349.594,"Correct, which is another interesting point, and it's actually my last point."
1987.87-5428,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1386.469,1389.821,How distant was the District Court from the prison?
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1389.821,1390.871,Eighty-one miles.
1987.87-5428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1390.871,1395.392,Twenty miles a day for the delivery.
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1401.046,1401.879,In a post office?
1987.87-5428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1401.879,1402.629,Yeah.
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1407.617,1412.604,"No, I'm not always sure, but I can pick up the phone and call, and I can go down and see if it got there."
1987.87-5428,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1431.482,1432.632,Was there a postmark on it?
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1432.632,1434.35,--We don't know that either.
1987.87-5428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1442.456,1451.396,"And you're suggesting because of the filing stamp in the morning, and that a lot of stuff is filed that early in the morning, it might have been received the day before?"
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1451.396,1459.049,I'm suggesting there's enough of a possibility there to entitle this litigant to a remand if the Court cannot find timely filing on any other basis.
1987.87-5428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1459.049,1461.334,"Ms. White, was that argument made below?"
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1461.334,1462.953,"No, ma'am, it was not."
1987.87-5428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1462.953,1466.238,This is the first time that we... anyone has heard that?
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1466.238,1467.321,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt."
1987.87-5428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1494.139,1499.559,And you didn't make the argument about... that it might have been received in the post office?
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1499.559,1500.828,"You are absolutely correct, I did not."
1987.87-5428,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1529.829,1536.252,And your argument is that it doesn't make any difference whether he gave it to prison authorities or not under your rule.
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1543.238,1554.296,"No, sir, not exactly, because if he put it in a mailbox that was not a functioning mailbox, I certainly wouldn't be making this argument."
1987.87-5428,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1554.296,1563.235,"Well, no, but he put it in the regular prison mailbox to go out, and he put it in on the day long before the time expired."
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1570.306,1572.025,I'd like to respond in two ways.
1987.87-5428,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1578.411,1581.363,The prison authorities may have put it in the mail right then.
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1581.363,1582.163,"--Yes, sir."
1987.87-5428,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1582.163,1584.565,And then the only problem would be the mail.
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1584.565,1586.434,That's correct.
1987.87-5428,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1586.434,1592.838,"Well, so he drops it in the mailbox instead of giving it to the prisoner, and it doesn't arrive in time."
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1592.838,1601.194,"If under the circumstances of dropping it in the mailbox he did all he reasonably could do under the circumstances, then, yes, that appeal would be timely."
1987.87-5428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1601.194,1603.577,I don't think four days is reasonable.
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1611.766,1614.835,You wouldn't because you would have known the 30 days.
1987.87-5428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1636.098,1637.117,Should that make the difference?
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1644.021,1645.187,We expect that of lawyers.
1987.87-5428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1645.187,1646.889,--So then that's irrelevant.
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1646.889,1649.091,"No, it's not irrelevant."
1987.87-5428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1649.091,1651.793,"Every non-lawyer, we can't hold them to the 30 days."
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1651.793,1659.114,"No, sir, every pro se inmate who does everything he reasonably can do under the circumstances to timely note his appeal should have his day in court."
1987.87-5428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1659.114,1659.497,Okay.
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1661.982,1663.767,It is different.
1987.87-5428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1663.767,1666.552,"We can hold him to knowing the 30 days period, can't we?"
1987.87-5428,0,38462,penny_j_white,,1674.556,1680.027,"Not if you rule that a late filed notice is a motion for extension of time, you certainly do not."
1987.87-5428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1693.787,1694.354,"Yes, you may."
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,1697.239,1705.261,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.87-5428,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1751.306,1756.544,There is nothing to indicate in the record when they actually mailed it either.
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,1756.544,1758.229,"No, that's correct Your Honor."
1987.87-5428,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1759.179,1760.764,"Well, they might have sat on it for two or three days."
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,1760.764,1762.098,It is conceivable.
1987.87-5428,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1762.098,1763.048,What if they did?
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,1764.383,1765.5,"No, Your Honor, it would not."
1987.87-5428,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1765.5,1766.233,Because?
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,1768.485,1782.844,"Well, because I think Fallen is a criminal case, first of all, and as a criminal case there are no congressionally set deadlines, filing deadlines."
1987.87-5428,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1782.844,1789.848,Suppose we reject that argument and say that Fallen would apply anyway if it otherwise would apply?
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,1789.848,1798.77,"Well, then I think that Fallen may apply in the case of... it is a case that I submit to you--"
1987.87-5428,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.77,1805.34,If it's clear... do you think the Fallen might well apply if it were clear the prison authorities just sat on it for a week?
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,1805.34,1810.927,"--Oh, I think it's conceivable that Fallen would apply in that particular kind of case."
1987.87-5428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1814.779,1815.981,You might not even need Fallen.
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,1818.517,1820.15,"--That's correct, it may not be necessarily Fallen."
1987.87-5428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1907.606,1917.98,"General Smith, I suppose that interest would be met by taking your point of second argument that you always treat the notice that is a couple of days late under these circumstances as a motion to extend time."
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,1922.032,1923.967,"Well, I think there's a problem with the argument."
1987.87-5428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1925.383,1928.252,"Right, there are problems with it, but at least it would solve that particular concern."
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,1928.252,1929.871,"Oh, if that is, yes."
1987.87-5428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1934.906,1938.31,Plus the thing gets there one day after the extended deadline.
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,1940.11,1940.61,That's right.
1987.87-5428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1940.61,1942.512,"--just postponing the evil day, aren't you?"
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,1942.512,1942.945,That's right.
1987.87-5428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1944.131,1948.583,"Even if you give him another 30 days, it is going to come one day after the extended 30 days."
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,1948.583,1953.57,"--Yes, and if it comes one day beyond the extended 30 days, this argument will not wash."
1987.87-5428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1953.57,1960.057,"Well, sure, you couldn't make the rule whatever it is, 4(a)(1)(5), for a five rule in that circumstance."
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,1961.34,1962.19,"That's right, it wouldn't."
1987.87-5428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1962.19,1965.558,"If you buy her argument, you would have an outside number of 30 days."
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,1968.844,1970.544,There is no argument to make in that kind of case.
1987.87-5428,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2160.719,2171.777,"What would you say if the rule was it must be... show a postmark of a certain date, that it was mailed on the certain date?"
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2173.26,2174.979,"--No, Your Honor, it would not."
1987.87-5428,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2174.979,2176.462,"You'd have no objection to that, would you?"
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2176.462,2178.447,"Yes, Your Honor, I do have an objection to that."
1987.87-5428,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2178.447,2179.564,What would be the objection?
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2179.564,2182.899,That it flies in the clear language of the rules concerning filing.
1987.87-5428,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2182.899,2185.335,I said to change the rule.
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2185.335,2190.154,"Oh, by the rules amendment process we have absolutely no objection to that, Your Honor."
1987.87-5428,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2190.154,2192.17,It would be all right for the statute.
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2198.658,2208.199,"If the rules said that, yes, Your Honor, because I think the definition of what is filing is a matter that would probably be left to promulgation of the court rule."
1987.87-5428,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2208.199,2222.625,I suppose it might be... do you think that this court is... is it within its competence to construe the word file in an individual case like this?
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2222.625,2235.349,"Well, it certainly is, but I submit to you when the rule could not be plainer to say that file means delivery to the Clerk, that it would be an extraordinary torturous interpretation of that language."
1987.87-5428,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2235.349,2247.074,"Mr. Smith, in this case the District Court issued a certificate of probable cause, I guess, and the Court of Appeals sent out a briefing schedule?"
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2247.074,2248.107,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.87-5428,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2248.107,2252.025,And what was the timing of those two actions?
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2257.512,2258.881,Yes.
1987.87-5428,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2263.266,2278.11,"And you think that doesn't fit within the Thompson unique circumstances that the Petitioner might have thought by virtue of those two things reasonably that the appeal had been received on time, the notice of appeal?"
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2278.11,2299.173,"Well, I think that the issuance of a certificate of probable cause, the bare issue on a certificate of probable cause, stands in stark contrast to the statements of the District Court, and actions of the District Court in the Thompson and Wolfsohn cases, where counsel was virtually assured that the appeal period had been extended or told, affirmatively assured."
1987.87-5428,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2315.982,2321.036,"Well, the Court of Appeals had issued a briefing schedule, I thought."
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2321.036,2323.655,"Yes, they issued a briefing schedule."
1987.87-5428,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2328.789,2331.158,Within the 60 day period?
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2331.158,2333.51,"I think that's correct, Your Honor."
1987.87-5428,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2335.462,2349.203,"And if the papers had been given four days before the expiration of the 30 day filing period to the warden, and then you got all those things, I just wonder if that couldn't qualify?"
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2349.203,2349.972,Under?
1987.87-5428,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2349.972,2352.924,Under Thompson as unique circumstance.
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2352.924,2365.065,"Well, we submit to you concerning Thompson and Wolfsohn that those cases may be of limited continuing validity, with all due respect."
1987.87-5428,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2397.036,2424.103,"But it does seem that when one is dealing with notices of appeal from pro se Petitioners in prison, that it would be the most desirable practice if the District Court on receipt of it would indicate to the Petitioner that it was not timely filed, or if some action were taken other than one that could be thought to lull them into a sense of security about it."
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2431.607,2454.789,"We have no quarrel if this Court wishes to adopt a rule that puts the Clerks of the various federal District Courts on notice that they should create a pro se desk, and through that pro se desk, pro se filings, especially jurisdictional ones, should be screened for timeliness, and that litigants be notified of that fact."
1987.87-5428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2508.524,2515.613,It would also save us from dealing with the million variations to determine just what has to be done to comply.
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2515.613,2516.797,"That's correct, it would."
1987.87-5428,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2516.797,2523.284,"If you say rule and not judicial, do you mean the federal rules or court rules?"
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2523.284,2525.969,The federal rules.
1987.87-5428,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2525.969,2527.938,Because the court rules would be judicial fiat.
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2527.938,2528.605,Yes.
1987.87-5428,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2532.456,2533.991,"Well, couldn't it be done by the circuit rules?"
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2533.991,2536.71,"Yes, it could be done."
1987.87-5428,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2552.553,2555.922,Have you heard of it?
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2555.922,2587.209,"In closing, we would like to say to the Court that it is clear under innumerable decisions of this Court that federal rule of appellate procedure 4(a)'s time limits are jurisdictional, and in the interest of finality, of litigation, should not be considered waiverable."
1987.87-5428,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2613.443,2620.447,"What case was it, Mr. Smith, in which three members of the Court recognized that 60(b) might be an escape hatch in a situation like this?"
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2620.447,2650.534,"--I believe it was in the case of Browder v. The Director of the Illinois Department of Correction in a concurring opinion, I believe, offered by Justice Blackmun, and with two Justices concurring, recognize that under slightly altered circumstances Rule 60(b) could be used to vacate an old judgment and reenter it to start afresh the judgment... the time for the appeal running."
1987.87-5428,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2650.534,2654.02,But that wasn't the action of the Court.
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2654.02,2655.27,"No, that wasn't the action of the Court."
1987.87-5428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2679.886,2683.29,"At least he's unlettered, General Smith."
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2685.807,2696.614,"Well, Your Honor, again it is a point that the way you treat pro se litigants is almost a point without rational departure."
1987.87-5428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2696.614,2697.214,You are right.
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2697.214,2726.034,"It's... you have to... it seems to me if you are to have an orderly system of justice at some point in time, charge people with knowledge of how that... some knowledge, some rudimentary knowledge of how that system operates, and I don't think the Court has ever held in its leniency to pro se defendants that they are excused from complying with jurisdictional requirements, that all bets are off, you just come to court one day and tell what your case is."
1987.87-5428,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2809.538,2814.675,You're admitting they are confused now when you say it will add to the confusion.
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2814.675,2822.162,"Well, in some cases the rules are confused, yes, Your Honor, but not in all cases."
1987.87-5428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2834.053,2836.171,It won't affect the Bar because we are talking about pro se cases.
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2836.171,2836.921,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1987.87-5428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2836.921,2840.123,Would it affect the Bar when we're just confining it to pro se cases?
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2841.909,2848.896,"Well, Ms. White today inherited a pro se case, and is having to live with the result."
1987.87-5428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2848.896,2849.746,We will not confuse Ms. White.
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2855.05,2856.502,There may well be.
1987.87-5428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2856.502,2862.054,So it would be confusing to that lawyer as to whether the appeal is alive or dead.
1987.87-5428,1,33177,jerry_l_smith,,2862.054,2863.156,Very much.
1987.87-5428,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2887.704,2888.871,"Thank you, Mr. White."
1987.87-5428,2,38462,penny_j_white,,2891.406,2908.268,Counsel faults Petitioner and his appointed counsel for not filing a Rule 60 motion in a situation when the Sixth Circuit in its order joint appendix 29 had assumed jurisdiction over the issue of jurisdiction.
1987.87-5428,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3040.17,3041.086,"Thank you, Ms. White."
