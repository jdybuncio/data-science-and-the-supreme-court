1962.13,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,17.347,"Number 13, Doyle Smith, Petitioner, versus Evening News Association."
1962.13,0,42783,thomas_e_harris,,29.408,31.762,May it please the Court.
1962.13,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,248.013,258.618,"Mr. Harris, as a matter of local law could the Guild had sued as an uncooperative association as a party to the Guild of the party to -- as plaintiff?"
1962.13,0,42783,thomas_e_harris,,258.618,272.562,There is a statute in Michigan which allows a union to sue as an entity and that statute appears to me to permit a union to sue.
1962.13,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,280.307,285.294,And this (Inaudible)
1962.13,0,42783,thomas_e_harris,,285.294,287.398,"That is correct, Mr. Justice."
1962.13,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,287.398,297.864,I wondered if it is (Inaudible) would require that form of action which is required that as of a -- maybe by the Michigan law (Inaudible)
1962.13,0,42783,thomas_e_harris,,297.864,311.592,"It does not appear to me that it is required and I think that the explanation is that this suit was filed during the period between Westinghouse and Lincoln Mills, and that is -- and the Westinghouse decision --"
1962.13,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,311.592,318.835,"Well, I take it, in that case, it would have been much wiser if you've had the union a plaintiff."
1962.13,0,42783,thomas_e_harris,,318.835,329.192,"Well, the Westinghouse was interpreted by some people and the respondent's still interprets it as saying that only the individuals can sue."
1962.13,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,348.777,351.002,Apart from the (Inaudible)
1962.13,0,42783,thomas_e_harris,,351.002,363.597,I mean that there is no suggestion in the case of hostility between the plaintiffs and the union or that the union has undertaken to settle the case or that it refused to take it to arbitration or anything of that sort.
1962.13,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,363.597,367.378,"I wasn't suggesting that, I'm just asking you as a matter of procedure."
1962.13,0,42783,thomas_e_harris,,367.378,383.682,The Supreme Court of Michigan dismissed the case on the broad ground at the pre-emption doctrine laid down by this Court in the second Garmon case controlled.
1962.13,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,951.34,960.643,"Everything you said so far sums that this action is maintainable under 301, is that correct?"
1962.13,0,42783,thomas_e_harris,,960.643,965.075,"No, Your Honor, I wouldn't get -- look for the same result even if it is not maintained."
1962.13,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,965.075,967.924,"Well, I mean today, I was going to ask you that as the next question."
1962.13,0,42783,thomas_e_harris,,972.35,973.64,I do not think it is.
1962.13,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,985.854,987.606,We can come to that next point then.
1962.13,0,42783,thomas_e_harris,,987.606,989.185,"Yes, I will."
1962.13,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,989.185,997.45,"Because which -- up to date, you're really -- are you suggesting that the Westinghouse is -- has been overruled or should be overruled?"
1962.13,0,42783,thomas_e_harris,,997.45,998.635,I think it has been overruled.
1962.13,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,998.635,999.867,Do you think it has been?
1962.13,0,42783,thomas_e_harris,,999.867,1011.128,But I think that there are numerous other grounds on which this case has to be decided against the respondent anyway.
1962.13,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1656.369,1677.646,"Mr. Harris, before you do, if it (Inaudible) assume that the state could provide you with a 301 suit, how many (Inaudible)"
1962.13,0,42783,thomas_e_harris,,1677.646,1691.681,We have not briefed the point whether individuals could sue under Section 301 (a) because we think it's most unlikely that the Court were rigid.
1962.13,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1842.852,1852.005,"(Inaudible)see if I understand, you say if state law controls and you concede that there is pre-emption."
1962.13,0,42783,thomas_e_harris,,1852.005,1863.909,I think that there are strong considerations for finding pre-emption in that event simply because the decisions would be unreviewable by this Court except of course on the issue of pre-emption.
1962.13,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1866.995,1868.741,"Well, that's true."
1962.13,0,42783,thomas_e_harris,,1868.741,1873.976,And I would agree with them that this Court should apply pre-emption doctrines in that event.
1962.13,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1873.976,1880.821,"Well, I'm surprise to hear you make that concession so readily, that's the reason I asked."
1962.13,0,42783,thomas_e_harris,,1880.821,1884.771,It is set forth in our reply brief.
1962.13,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1884.771,1893.292,Then this really does come back as far as your case is concerned to standing or falling on whether 301 covers this action.
1962.13,0,42783,thomas_e_harris,,1893.292,1898.699,"No, I don't think so and I will get to that point right now, Your Honor."
1962.13,1,38468,philip_t_van_zile_ii,,3220.771,3226.385,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, this is my initial appearance before the Court."
1962.13,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3314.816,3318.438,Neither of you refers to the Gonzales case.
1962.13,1,38468,philip_t_van_zile_ii,,3318.472,3321.401,I referred to the dissenting opinion of the Chief Justice.
1962.13,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3321.401,3322.61,"Dissenting opinion, yes."
1962.13,1,38468,philip_t_van_zile_ii,,3322.61,3323.142,But --
1962.13,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3323.142,3325.241,The holding of the Court.
1962.13,1,38468,philip_t_van_zile_ii,,3325.241,3325.285,No.
1962.13,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3325.285,3336.671,That -- that was a case that was governed by state law and where pre-emption notwithstanding was not held applicable.
1962.13,1,38468,philip_t_van_zile_ii,,3336.671,3339.945,That I realized Your Honor.
1962.13,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3339.945,3343.569,That you say -- what you need to do with that case?
1962.13,1,38468,philip_t_van_zile_ii,,3343.569,3345.075,"Well, if I recall this --"
1962.13,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3345.075,3353.903,This case is very easily disposed obviously if 301 governs this case -- governs this cause of action.
1962.13,1,38468,philip_t_van_zile_ii,,3353.903,3359.964,We would like the Court to listen to us in that area if we might.
1962.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3587.562,3588.665,(Inaudible)what page?
1962.13,1,38468,philip_t_van_zile_ii,,3588.665,3594.324,"Yes, page 4, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1962.13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3745.705,3754.356,"Now how about the right of an incorp -- of a union, an incorporated association to sue as a party plaintiff, is that suit in there?"
1962.13,1,38468,philip_t_van_zile_ii,,3754.356,3757.455,I believe that that can be done if they are an assignee.
1962.13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3759.544,3760.196,Cannot.
1962.13,1,38468,philip_t_van_zile_ii,,3760.196,3770.58,Absent an assignee but I know of no obstacle to their suing if they are suing as an assignee.
1962.13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3770.58,3773.374,"As an assignee and therefore they're asserting somebody else's rights, yes?"
1962.13,1,38468,philip_t_van_zile_ii,,3773.374,3774.429,Exactly.
1962.13,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3786.907,3792.237,(Inaudible) they would stand in the same position as the plaintiff here with respect to the 49 (Voice Overlap) --
1962.13,1,38468,philip_t_van_zile_ii,,3792.237,3793.248,Exactly.
1962.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3801.316,3803.579,I see.
1962.13,1,38468,philip_t_van_zile_ii,,3803.579,3818.862,As to damages recovery was sought solely of back pay consisting of the difference between what this employee would have recovered had he worked full time and had he worked part time.
1962.13,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4464.738,4471.15,"From your -- I'm assuming that, the Government (Inaudible)"
1962.13,1,38468,philip_t_van_zile_ii,,4471.15,4471.839,"No sir, they had not."
1962.13,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4471.839,4473.333,(Inaudible)
1962.13,1,38468,philip_t_van_zile_ii,,4473.333,4474.322,Exactly.
1962.13,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4474.322,4477.743,And you don't know how thi8s case (Inaudible)
1962.13,1,38468,philip_t_van_zile_ii,,4477.743,4485.769,I do not but I can speculate that the -- one grounds we're going to the state court was that they thought that it was more receptive than the Board at that time.
1962.13,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4496.04,4503.711,We'll recess now Mr. Van Zile.
1962.13,1,38468,philip_t_van_zile_ii,,4506.482,4522.16,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court we were discussing pre-emption and I had about concluded my remarks on the practical effect of the petitioner's position it adopted."
1962.13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5311.711,5336.117,"Now, what if -- as a matter of state procedural law even in a case which was concededly based on the union's right as the union but what if the -- if the state required, it wouldn't -- would not permit a union to be a party plaintiff and required that individual employee -- that individuals be in -- be the plaintiffs."
1962.13,1,38468,philip_t_van_zile_ii,,5338.082,5338.585,Definitely.
1962.13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5343.125,5343.323,I think it was too.
1962.13,1,38468,philip_t_van_zile_ii,,5343.323,5346.216,I think that the Massachusetts law required --
1962.13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5346.216,5346.401,"Apparently so, that is --"
1962.13,1,38468,philip_t_van_zile_ii,,5346.401,5348.568,-- the individuals sue on behalf of the union --
1962.13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5348.568,5348.953,Yes.
1962.13,1,38468,philip_t_van_zile_ii,,5348.953,5351.677,-- under their local procedures.
1962.13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5357.851,5360.744,But you're talking about the “uniquely personal right”?
1962.13,1,38468,philip_t_van_zile_ii,,5360.744,5367.794,"Yes, I am, and I'm talking about the reaction of the lower courts, federal courts that have treated the question since Westinghouse."
1962.13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5367.794,5376.792,And now are these nine circuits which you consider this -- so they considered it since Lincoln Mills?
1962.13,1,38468,philip_t_van_zile_ii,,5376.792,5383.428,"Well, we have -- we have four cases decided May and June of this year."
1962.13,2,42783,thomas_e_harris,,6371.127,6393.353,I would like if I may to give the Court a concrete illustration of why it is that we are anxious to preserve the concurrent arbitral and judicial remedy even in situations where we could go to the National Labor Relations Board.
1962.13,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6640.395,6676.234,"Mr. Harris, (Inaudible)"
1962.13,2,42783,thomas_e_harris,,6676.234,6697.746,"I rather think that even in that situation, the Court would still have jurisdiction but it appears to me that both there and in a good many other situations I can think of, the Court should in its discretion refuse to entertain the suit on the ground that it is a matter better left to the National Labor Relations Board."
1962.13,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6699.928,6708.164,But the Board (Inaudible)
1962.13,2,42783,thomas_e_harris,,6708.164,6710.622,I would think that it should not here.
