1960.241,0,18158,bernard_weiss,,13.378,13.414,May it please --
1960.241,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,13.414,15.625,Mr. Weiss.
1960.241,0,18158,bernard_weiss,,15.625,19.521,May it please the Court.
1960.241,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,655.129,655.448,May I --
1960.241,0,18158,bernard_weiss,,655.448,657.639,"And this is a non -- yes, sir."
1960.241,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,657.639,659.451,"May I ask you please, sir?"
1960.241,0,18158,bernard_weiss,,670.191,671.294,That's right.
1960.241,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,671.294,689.647,"Well then, is it not true that in all except where an excess profits credit adjustment is involved, the administrative remedies by the Commissioner in the absence of a judgment pay its interest from the date of the overpayment?"
1960.241,0,18158,bernard_weiss,,689.647,690.414,"Oh, yes."
1960.241,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,866.643,868.837,Are you saying you're (Inaudible)
1960.241,0,18158,bernard_weiss,,868.837,875.086,"Now, in my claim -- in my claim, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the claim."
1960.241,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,907.916,914.625,Not as so (Inaudible) your argument imply defendant is ordered by a judgment acknowledged (Voice Overlap) --
1960.241,0,18158,bernard_weiss,,914.625,916.361,That is correct.
1960.241,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1235.582,1237.135,Mr. Davis.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1237.135,1240.84,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.241,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1490.204,1493.072,How much time did he have to make the claim within which --
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1493.072,1493.979,Over three years.
1960.241,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1493.979,1495.753,Over three years.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1495.753,1497.715,Some -- some -- quite a long period.
1960.241,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1520.079,1520.241,You said--
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1520.241,1520.684,That --
1960.241,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1520.684,1523.633,"Mr. Davis, you said that Congress deliberately chose not to."
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1524.609,1525.604,Yes.
1960.241,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1525.604,1531.505,"Well, so I'm going to wait for that demonstration so I would have to read your -- your (Inaudible) will I?"
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1531.505,1538.069,"If you will turn the -- perhaps and anticipating the -- page 16 of our brief, Mr. Justice."
1960.241,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1607.088,1616.184,"Mr. Davis, how much time does he claim he has, the petitioner, in which to do this and still date it back to the original date?"
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1616.184,1617.357,I don't know what the --
1960.241,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1617.357,1617.392,"Yes, they don't --"
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1617.392,1622.874,"-- petitioner has not said, but we -- we figure he has about three years or -- or -- quite a long time."
1960.241,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1624.858,1625.033,Yes.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1625.033,1626.016,-- and two months in which to do it.
1960.241,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1626.016,1626.397,Yes.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1626.397,1627.078,And I --
1960.241,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1627.078,1629.489,But does he claim there is no limitation on --
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1629.489,1630.674,He has not stated it.
1960.241,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1630.674,1631.428,Is not said?
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1631.428,1631.914,He has not said anything.
1960.241,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1631.914,1637.629,"Well, except the statute of limit -- except that there's no limitation if he can make any claim at all."
1960.241,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1638.616,1639.902,"Well, isn't -- isn't --"
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1639.902,1642.258,We figured out to be as 39 and a half months.
1960.241,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1642.258,1644.535,"Well, if he has 39 and a half months --"
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1644.535,1645.769,From the end of the year.
1960.241,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1645.769,1646.619,Yes.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1654.802,1655.24,"Well, no."
1960.241,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1659.263,1661.671,"I understand that, but not get interest if he waits."
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1661.671,1662.604,That's right.
1960.241,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1663.288,1671.567,"But I'm saying is for that -- if he can get interest for any part of the time, he can get it for all of the time, because there's no provision in the law which --"
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1671.567,1671.675,"Well, that's right."
1960.241,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1671.675,1676.298,-- says he can get perhaps two years or one and a half year or is there?
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1676.298,1677.034,"No, there is not."
1960.241,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1677.034,1679.674,"So, the either it's all or nothing, he claims for all or nothing."
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1680.006,1680.591,Yes.
1960.241,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1778.393,1781.469,Nor is he implying on -- on unjust in Richmond.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1784.559,1785.111,"Oh, no."
1960.241,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1796.711,1803.91,Not at the very -- but there comes a time wherein something was owing to him from the Government for which he could have been there and there sued.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1803.91,1804.412,And Congress --
1960.241,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1804.412,1809.114,"If he had sued, he would've had interest from, if he succeeded."
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1809.114,1809.344,He would have to --
1960.241,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1809.344,1813.382,"Well, I'm suggesting you, the matter of unjust in Richmond, you've used his money."
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1818.859,1821.452,But Congresses has said that --
1960.241,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1821.452,1822.359,"I'm not saying that's true, but that is --"
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1822.359,1823.27,"No, no."
1960.241,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1849.682,1854.193,But it must be more complicated though as -- as you'd sit down at this point.
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1854.193,1855.946,"Well obviously, Mr. Davis, it is, isn't it?"
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1855.946,1856.03,Yes.
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1856.03,1861.099,You're relying -- you can't be relying on the literal language of 3771 (e) either.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1861.099,1861.727,Yes.
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1861.727,1862.276,Alright.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1862.276,1863.178,"Well, no."
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1863.178,1863.573,Because at the very four words.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1863.573,1877.754,"I'm -- I'm -- well, but I'm -- I'm trying to go back and I will try to go back now and to state my -- what I want to do is to clear the ground from some of what I think some of the -- the provisions here which cannot be applied on their phase."
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1877.754,1878.516,Yes.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1878.516,1885.693,"And what the problem really is, is that you have these two provisions I set at the beginning, which have to be integrated."
1960.241,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1885.72,1893.844,"It's the same kind of problem that was present in the Carter case, in the Ninth Circuit decided in 1939?"
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,1893.844,1894.359,No.
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2242.187,2244.25,Not that -- is that -- quite right.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2247.545,2247.87,Yes.
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2247.87,2248.676,-- time of judgment.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2255.536,2256.514,"Well, perhaps in --"
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2256.514,2261.482,"Regardless of all the history to be sure, interest was thrown down against the Government of common law and all the rest of it."
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2273.117,2273.818,Yes.
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2273.818,2275.866,-- of general applicability.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2284.5,2284.641,Well --
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2284.641,2286.24,It's the burden there rather than where you seek through it.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2286.24,2297.169,"Well, we think the history does indicate that even in this situation, it's up to the taxpayer to show that -- that the section should be applied as he says it should be applied."
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2300.171,2300.278,Yes.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2300.278,2301.86,-- seek to apply it in the literal terms of the statute.
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2301.86,2302.928,Yes.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2302.928,2309.673,"And because he -- I think because he thinks have lead to an absurd result, so he seeks to -- to modify that thing."
1960.241,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2438.654,2438.856,Are you going to --
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2438.856,2439.205,And --
1960.241,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2439.205,2449.854,-- deal with this argument that turns on whether the payment is voluntary or involuntary in the sense the taxpayer has to sue -- sue for it.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2449.854,2452.172,"Well, that I think is just another way of saying that --"
1960.241,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2452.172,2453.244,That's his whole case.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2453.244,2463.571,His whole case is that if -- if what I -- I'll try to answer that by saying that Congress didn't make a distinction between the taxpayer who goes to the Tax Court.
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2488.062,2489.361,"Now, how could he have gone to the Tax Court?"
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2490.155,2492.516,Because the Commissioner assessed deficiency.
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2506.558,2507.96,For -- for what year?
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2507.96,2511.693,"For -- for 1952 -- 1942, I'm sorry, I may not say 1952."
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2523.201,2523.536,On that.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2523.536,2524.361,-- on that deficiency.
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2524.361,2524.47,Yes.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2524.47,2526.246,That would've opened up the whole thing.
1960.241,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2543.822,2545.966,Well that would draw the overlapping?
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2545.966,2546.287,Pardon me?
1960.241,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2546.287,2547.814,That would draw it.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2550.783,2551.616,"This, yes."
1960.241,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2564.835,2572.13,And you say that's a so-called involuntary payment on that premise which by its terms carries interest only on a limited basis.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2572.13,2572.364,That's right.
1960.241,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2572.364,2582.513,"And therefore, his distinction between -- broadly between 3771 and 28 and the Judicial Code is not a tenable distinction issue."
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2582.513,2582.687,That's right.
1960.241,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2582.687,2591.464,(Voice Overlap) --
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2591.464,2601.421,"Now, is there any disagreement between you as to what you just told us about the fact that he could've gone to the Tax Court without question?"
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2601.421,2603.421,I don't know because I -- I think that --
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2603.421,2604.212,That's not developed in the case.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2604.212,2607.257,"Nothing -- it's nothing developed, but I think it's quite clear that it could have been."
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2607.257,2607.718,Alright.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2607.718,2624.488,"And anyway, I would say, Mr. Justice Stewart, that Congress quite clearly decided when it added subsection (e) that the Tax Court was -- was a -- an appropriate vehicle in most of the cases, because it provided that interest shall stop when -- when a petition was filed in the Tax Court."
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2624.488,2624.72,Yes.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2632.879,2634.809,"Well, it could have arisen in one several ways."
1960.241,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2651.647,2654.416,For what situation wouldn't or couldn't?
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2654.416,2657.316,"Well, I -- I'm not enough with the Tax law -- lawyer, Mr. Justice Whittaker --"
1960.241,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2657.316,2669.804,I don't understand that there is any proposed deficiency by the Commissioner that is not subject to redetermination by the Tax Court in its timely petition.
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2669.804,2670.519,"Well, I don't either --"
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2670.519,2670.603,It's not -- I --
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2670.603,2676.831,"-- in some areas of course, but on a proposed deficiency in income tax whether or not that opens up all the person's excess profits."
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2676.831,2678.217,"Well, I think that is clear."
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2679.414,2686.507,"Indeed, the Tax -- the Tax Court is the final -- the final court on excess profits tax type to the question of most kinds."
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2686.507,2687.578,"Sir, other kinds."
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2687.578,2688.639,Yes.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2688.639,2689.594,"Now, I think that's clear."
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2698.998,2700.295,"This claim did, didn't it?"
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2700.295,2703.113,This claim arose as a result of a deficiency.
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2706.721,2708.319,Income taxes.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2708.319,2713.953,Income taxes and he could have gone to the -- to the Tax Court saying there was no deficiency --
1960.241,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2713.953,2713.981,But he did not.
1960.241,1,37425,oscar_h_davis,,2713.981,2715.37,-- of the time when it's overpaid.
