2003.03-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,36.795,"We'll hear argument next in No. 03-526, Dora B. Schriro v. Warren Wesley Summerlin."
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,66.711,71.235,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-526,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,129.952,139.87,"Mr. Todd, could we go back to what you opened with, that you said this is just a... and you emphasized this throughout your brief... it's only a who decides, not what."
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,197.148,222.203,"Justice Ginsburg, my understanding of this Court's holding in Ring was that it applied the Sixth Amendment jury guarantee as... as this Court recalls, Arizona already found, beyond a reasonable doubt, this... these particular aggravators and that it applied it to... for purposes of finding these... these aggravators."
2003.03-526,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,228.007,229.899,"Well, let me give you a concrete example."
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,246.759,259.158,"--Well, Your Honor, the judge in this particular case did not rely on a presentence report to find either of the aggravating circumstances that he found."
2003.03-526,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,263.692,280.593,"Well, just let's say that the judge could consider, or would you concede that if the judge could make this determination, that the judge could, and judges routinely do, look at presentence reports?"
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,280.593,302.408,"--Not under Arizona law, Your Honor, that the... the aggravating circumstances that are... that are present in Arizona law are not the type that would be... you could rely on a presentence report to find because Arizona law doesn't permit hearsay evidence to establish the aggravator."
2003.03-526,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,333.597,339.0,Was it clear under prior law that the aggravators had to be found by the judge beyond a reasonable doubt?
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,339.0,340.042,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.03-526,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,342.205,345.288,Was that in the statute or the supreme court decision?
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,345.288,347.128,Supreme court decision.
2003.03-526,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,347.128,348.22,Thank you.
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,372.944,374.296,"Yes, Justice Breyer."
2003.03-526,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,374.296,374.857,All right.
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,406.186,434.496,"Well, Your Honor, I... I think that the... that this Court's discussion in Bousley or Bousley... as... as you were indicating based on the Bailey decision, sort of capsulizes where... what... what in terms of retroactivity analysis, where substantive... what... what a real substantive change is."
2003.03-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,434.496,451.617,"We... didn't we make it quite clear in Bousley that it was important that we were interpreting a Federal law, which we had the authority to interpret, rather than what's happened in this case where, as I understand it, the Supreme Court of Arizona has said the change brought by Ring was procedural."
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,451.617,454.849,"That's... that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.03-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,478.075,483.206,"Does it follow, if it is procedural, that you necessarily prevail?"
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,490.631,493.912,"--This Court has said that it was, yes."
2003.03-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,493.912,494.933,"Yes, I mean, under our holdings."
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,503.24,526.924,"I... if I read your cases correct, Justice Stevens, I believe that you have decided three cases since Teague in which you have found that the... there was a problem, unconstitutional problem, with a jury sentencing procedure in a capital case and you have found that those cases are Teague barred."
2003.03-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,526.924,531.378,But the... the... what was barred was considering whether or not there was a constitutional violation.
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,539.683,562.529,"My recollection, Justice Stevens, is that in each of those cases there had been a prior holding by this Court finding some unconstitutional procedure and that the case was in these three cases that procedure existed, only they had... they were on collateral review and this Court found them Teague barred."
2003.03-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,562.529,563.33,I see.
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,563.33,591.099,"In our opinion, the only way that Mr. Summerlin can avoid this Court's Teague bar is if somehow he can find that the Apprendi/Ring rule fits within the exception for watershed changes in the rule."
2003.03-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,721.812,722.904,May I interrupt you just once more?
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,733.051,738.875,"Well, Your Honor, the... I can't speak to... to all the cases."
2003.03-526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,775.477,780.142,"Well, you wouldn't... you wouldn't contest that Furman was a watershed decision, would you?"
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,780.142,781.392,"--No, I would not."
2003.03-526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,781.392,789.396,"So, I mean, the question is whether this... whether Ring is equivalent to Furman as far as watershed decisions go I guess."
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,789.396,792.39,"Of course, Justice Scalia, our position is that it is not."
2003.03-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,812.493,816.544,Let me just ask you why is Furman a watershed decision?
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,822.017,832.856,Because Furman affected all death penalty cases nationwide.
2003.03-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,832.856,833.985,Because it was applied retroactively.
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,833.985,834.817,And... and it--
2003.03-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,840.33,844.504,"And I suppose if this case is applied retroactive, this might be a watershed decision."
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,849.616,853.479,"--Furman, Justice O'Connor, was decided before Teague."
2003.03-526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,863.967,882.61,"Yes, which... an understanding which... which had existed in the country for a couple of hundred years, whereas, as I understand Ring, it's based on a reversal of... of a relatively recent practice of announcing in statutes sentencing factors as opposed to elements of the crime."
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,904.804,908.096,"We would agree, Justice Scalia."
2003.03-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,908.096,913.209,"You would agree that Apprendi just corrected a... a minor wandering law, not an old rule?"
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,916.692,926.649,"At... at most... at most, Apprendi merely extended in an incremental degree an existing proposition of this Court."
2003.03-526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,926.649,930.98,"Apprendi purported, did it not, to be setting forth established law?"
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,932.142,933.033,I--
2003.03-526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,933.033,933.744,And... right?
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,933.744,934.283,--Yes.
2003.03-526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,934.283,935.024,And did Furman?
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,935.024,935.695,No.
2003.03-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,940.557,942.64,"There was no... there was no Court opinion in Furman, was there?"
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,942.64,950.585,"No, there was no opinion by the full Court where every... all the members agreed or a majority of the members agreed."
2003.03-526,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,950.585,965.826,"What will you do if... I mean, I absolutely accept your point, at least for argument, that... that if you go through the factors that favor calling it a watershed rule, you've listed several that argue strongly against calling it a watershed rule."
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,1037.543,1057.505,"Your Honor, in our view Teague answers that question, that if the Apprendi/Ring rule would come within the Teague exception, then certainly in fairness, it should be applied retroactively."
2003.03-526,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1057.505,1063.519,Justice Breyer is... is arguing for a... a general capital sentencing exception to Teague.
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,1088.317,1090.908,"Yes, absolutely, Your Honor."
2003.03-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1110.731,1112.774,"Of course, is Teague itself a bedrock rule?"
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,1118.407,1119.686,Teague--
2003.03-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1119.686,1121.569,And that should trump the constitutional right at stake.
2003.03-526,0,33227,john_pressley_todd,,1121.569,1126.412,"--Teague is a judge... judge-made rule, Your Honor, yes."
2003.03-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1129.003,1130.194,"Very well, Mr. Todd."
2003.03-526,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1131.935,1143.564,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-526,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1205.783,1217.263,"Mr. Feldman, what would you think the result should be for someone whose capital conviction and sentence became final after Apprendi but before Ring?"
2003.03-526,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1217.263,1228.659,"I... I think that... that was a relatively brief period, but during that period, this Court's decision in Walton had held that judges could decide aggravating factors."
2003.03-526,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1237.435,1239.325,Let me ask you something else.
2003.03-526,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1247.09,1249.343,--We should have.
2003.03-526,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1370.768,1374.328,Can we go back to the... the first and how you characterize this?
2003.03-526,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1411.263,1413.223,--I... I don't think so.
2003.03-526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1496.919,1503.244,"Mr. Feldman, do you think that the outcome of this case necessarily determines whether Apprendi is retroactive or not?"
2003.03-526,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1503.244,1508.716,I... I would think they stand or fall together because the Court in Ring--
2003.03-526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1508.716,1512.507,"Do you think if we hold this is bad, we must follow the same rule in Apprendi?"
2003.03-526,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1512.507,1514.38,"--Well, I'd prefer not to be categorical about that."
2003.03-526,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1523.526,1544.459,"But if we... if we said, for example, that this is... this is retroactive because we, in effect, have said that the sentencing factor is... is like an element so that we are, in fact, for purposes of... of serving the jury right, recharacterizing or redefining the... the crime, then that would cover Apprendi as well as this case, wouldn't it?"
2003.03-526,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1544.459,1546.25,--It... it may well.
2003.03-526,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1669.291,1670.941,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,1672.884,1679.437,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-526,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1733.834,1739.447,Did the court of appeals rely on the fact that there was a... this was a death case as part of its reasoning?
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,1739.447,1742.759,"It did in many respects, Your Honor."
2003.03-526,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1742.759,1745.11,You mean it said in so many words?
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,1745.11,1764.444,"Well, it... it pointed out the fact of the necessity of having evidence presented in a manner that would go to accuracy in a capital case, especially one was... you know, if somebody was looking at the death penalty, and there was a concurrence that specifically went into the fact that this was a capital case."
2003.03-526,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1791.622,1801.367,"Well, isn't... isn't that because a lot of the sentencing... a lot of the aggravating factors the sentencing pivots are... are not only factual but normative?"
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,1823.602,1826.334,Prong one of the second exception?
2003.03-526,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1826.334,1826.885,Yes.
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,1826.885,1834.87,"Yes, Your Honor, to the extent that... I mean, I understand what you're saying, but to the extent that this is going to categorical accuracy."
2003.03-526,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1834.87,1838.583,But it sounds more like judgment than accuracy is what I'm getting at.
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,1838.583,1843.097,It is... and is... and that's why the accuracy I... we believe has to be categorical.
2003.03-526,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1888.268,1894.592,"Well, that's... that's... everything you say is... is true so far, but I don't know that that gets you to satisfy the accuracy prong."
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,1911.872,1924.42,"Well... well, Your Honor, we're... our position is that it's accuracy only in, as I said, a categorical context because you can't ever determine who is absolutely right or wrong."
2003.03-526,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1955.811,1960.245,"Mr. Murray, I... I have sort of the same problem that Justice O'Connor did."
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,2022.025,2026.109,"Well, specifically, Your Honor, we have two responses to that."
2003.03-526,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2076.882,2082.125,But... but those cases do not involve the precise issue that you're bringing before us here.
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,2092.834,2093.705,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.03-526,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2120.022,2124.233,The point is that they didn't involve precisely what is involved here.
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,2136.08,2153.501,"--That's correct, Your Honor, but also you can remember that that case was decided pre-Teague when the balancing process that the Court used included a consideration and... and have given great weight to the consideration of the overall effect of the administration of justice."
2003.03-526,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2154.983,2157.655,"Teague... but Teague does that too, does it not?"
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,2164.049,2172.267,--Teague has done that essentially to the extent that the Court is going to consider that by the definition of a standard that is set in Teague.
2003.03-526,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2203.906,2205.267,"That was a separate opinion, was it not?"
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,2205.267,2206.168,"--It was, Your Honor."
2003.03-526,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2291.959,2292.448,I agree.
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,2342.682,2366.879,"Well, our position, Your Honor, is that there is room for flexibility and... and it is essential if you're going... if the Court is going to be looking at these cases and trying to determine how the result of their decisions will affect everybody else who are in similar positions, because the goal of Teague is to ensure that people in similar circumstances receives equal treatment."
2003.03-526,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2372.122,2397.297,"Mr. Murray, we have many opinions which... which comment upon the fact that the... the line between substance and procedure is an extremely variable one and that they really are just... just two opposites in various fields, and... and where the line is depends upon the purpose for which you're calling it substantive or calling it procedural."
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,2431.61,2433.411,If that's the limitation--
2003.03-526,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2433.411,2434.403,If... if that's what it means.
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,2446.093,2468.536,"--Our understanding, Your Honor, is that the position that the Assistant SG gave is included in a broader, more universal definition of what substantive is and that is at the core of a substantive ruling is defining what the elements of an offense are, back to the status quo of finding what is a crime, what is the crime of capital murder--"
2003.03-526,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2468.536,2484.468,Even though the additional 5 years or 10 years for... for an act that was innocent was being imposed under the rubric of a sentencing factor rather than under the rubric of element.
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,2484.468,2493.842,"--Well, anytime that you... yes, but anytime that you change the definition, it's a substantive... substantive change--"
2003.03-526,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2493.842,2508.552,"Well, it... it is substantive for the purpose of whether it's in a criminal procedure book as an element or as a... as a sentencing factor, but it's not substantive for the purpose of whether an individual knew that if he did this, he was going to get 5 more years."
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,2512.805,2543.257,"--Well, Your Honor, that... that sounds of the first exception to Teague, and our position is that... is not the entire universe of what substantive is about because in this case, although in Arizona the individuals were charged with... setting aside for the moment the indictment issue, they were charged and given notice, at least pretrial, of the aggravating circumstances for which they... the State was trying to impose the death penalty."
2003.03-526,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2579.22,2590.63,"There was a question that was asked to Mr. Wood and that was about do Apprendi and Ring go together, and I'd like your answer to that."
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,2603.927,2609.48,"The short answer, Your Honor, is maybe or... or not necessarily."
2003.03-526,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2612.302,2615.775,What... what... could you give me a reason why they shouldn't go together?
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,2615.775,2619.949,--If... if you rule... we've presented basically four arguments.
2003.03-526,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2672.594,2677.946,"On your... your not a new rule, I found that hard to follow in light of Walton."
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,2687.884,2690.465,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.03-526,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2690.465,2700.62,"So how could it not be... given that Walton was the instruction, how could Ring be anything but new?"
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,2700.62,2708.056,"Well, Ring went back, so to speak, to the old law."
2003.03-526,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2754.559,2758.092,Why do you say Walton was a blip in... in the history?
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,2764.175,2767.248,"--Yes, Your Honor, and even before that."
2003.03-526,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2777.292,2783.798,"But surely, I mean, Arizona had adopted that system before Walton or Walton wouldn't have had occasion to pass on it."
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,2783.798,2791.964,Arizona never adopted the... the system wherein the juries would be involved in sentencing.
2003.03-526,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2800.889,2805.373,"And... and it was that system that came to us in Walton, was it not?"
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,2805.373,2806.765,"It was that system, Your Honor."
2003.03-526,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2806.765,2813.34,"So saying that Walton... when you say blip, I got the impression you thought it originated something."
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,2816.302,2821.217,It passed on the existing system in Arizona but for the wrong reason.
2003.03-526,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2893.324,2896.487,Why... why should that be a factor that we take into consideration?
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,2911.125,2927.516,"--It just, Your Honor, goes to the fact that if two people on the government's side of the case are disagreeing on it, then it just shows the absolute need and the... the essential character of the jury's role in determining the community's sense of whether such an aggravating factor did exist in this case."
2003.03-526,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3010.041,3025.422,"Do you agree, by the way, with Mr. Wood that the judge... whatever his name was... that he didn't use the presentence report because that would be considered hearsay under Arizona law?"
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,3025.422,3027.175,"I do, Your Honor."
2003.03-526,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3046.936,3050.839,But Mr. Wood said he couldn't consider it because it was hearsay.
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,3051.459,3052.38,--Well--
2003.03-526,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3052.38,3059.735,"--But the judge... no more than the jury, the judge could not have considered that in determining whether there was an aggravating factor."
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,3059.735,3070.131,"--I understand, and I agree that there are rules that... and there are rules and presumptions that say that the court is not going to consider irrelevant or inadmissable evidence."
2003.03-526,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3095.029,3097.439,Who don't have human frailties.
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,3100.032,3105.835,"We all... the juries, the judges, every one of us have human frailties, Justice Scalia."
2003.03-526,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3105.835,3111.071,There... there were a number of issues that you raised in this case that... that they didn't get to below.
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,3120.567,3121.755,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.03-526,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3128.531,3130.281,And they rejected the--
2003.03-526,2,33917,ken_murray,,3130.281,3136.726,"--as a preliminary matter, but the remainder of the rules... of the ineffectiveness issues and the judge issues remain open."
2003.03-526,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3149.115,3150.785,"--Thank you, Mr. Murray."
2003.03-526,3,33227,john_pressley_todd,,3153.596,3163.803,"If I may, I would like to respond to Justice Breyer's question concerning flexibility of Teague."
2003.03-526,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3201.918,3204.83,What... what rules would fit that so important?
2003.03-526,3,33227,john_pressley_todd,,3209.442,3214.568,"--I think Gideon is the... the ideal, perfect example."
2003.03-526,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3214.568,3217.279,"Yes, but are there other examples?"
2003.03-526,3,33227,john_pressley_todd,,3217.279,3222.382,"I cannot think of one off the top of my head, Your Honor."
2003.03-526,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3302.568,3304.278,"Thank you, Mr. Todd."
2003.03-526,3,33227,john_pressley_todd,,3304.278,3304.909,--You're welcome.
2003.03-526,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3304.909,3305.87,The case is submitted.
