1987.87-336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.54,"Mr. Kester, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,11.54,13.38,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-336,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,127.654,135.919,"Mr. Kester, is the Petitioner still in the United States and still under the probation order?"
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,135.919,139.953,The probation order was modified subsequently.
1987.87-336,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,180.138,181.38,And that is where he is?
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,181.38,182.171,Yes.
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,182.171,199.822,"On the first day that the Petitioner went, at that time, he was required to be in California, as ordered by the court to report to his probation officer in Los Angeles, as soon as he arrived at the probation office, he was handed the summons and complaint in this case."
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,288.24,290.741,Rauscher did not involve appealability.
1987.87-336,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,301.959,303.08,It didn't involve a civil case.
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,303.08,304.269,I beg your pardon?
1987.87-336,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,304.269,306.733,It also did not involve a civil case.
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,306.733,307.431,That is right.
1987.87-336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,338.052,343.045,That held otherwise than there was absolute immunity?
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,343.045,343.996,That's right.
1987.87-336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,460.694,463.765,"When you talk about immunity, are you talking about freedom from service?"
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,463.765,465.137,That's correct.
1987.87-336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,465.137,471.539,Freedom of service because of the particular circumstances surrounding his visit to this country.
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,477.054,477.594,Absolutely.
1987.87-336,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,504.392,505.704,How long does that run?
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,505.704,511.857,"It runs, according to the treaty with Switzerland, it runs basically for a month."
1987.87-336,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,517.451,527.218,It isn't quite the same type of thing as Mitchell v. Forsyth where the immunity was permanent.
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,527.218,528.247,That is correct.
1987.87-336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,535.103,536.812,"He wasn't going to come back, I suppose."
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,536.812,538.935,I would not have advised him to come back.
1987.87-336,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,538.935,544.309,Is this like immunity from personal jurisdiction... is this like lack of personal jurisdiction?
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,544.309,546.49,"No, Justice Kennedy, this is not--"
1987.87-336,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,546.49,550.813,You have to say that because lack of personal jurisdiction is not appealable.
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,550.813,558.487,"--Well, I don't think my answer surprised you, but this is not the same thing as the ordinary 14th Amendment due process immunity from lack of personal jurisdiction."
1987.87-336,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,558.487,562.01,"Why shouldn't the rule of non-appealability be the same, though?"
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,562.932,573.968,"No, I don't think it is because I think really what you have in this case when we are talking about the immunity is a Cohen v. Beneficial Loan but it is really a Cohen-plus situation."
1987.87-336,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,638.232,638.713,Excuse me.
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,656.634,663.147,"--This is different, Justice Scalia, I think first of all because it has always been recognized as different."
1987.87-336,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,680.059,682.079,"Well, you could say the same thing about lack of personal jurisdiction."
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,684.762,691.406,"--No, because in Rauscher, the court was not talking about the 14th Amendment or due process or anything like that."
1987.87-336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,756.941,759.163,"Analytically, it is like lack of personal jurisdiction."
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,776.036,776.586,No.
1987.87-336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,783.94,791.984,A federal statute that says: You shall not bring this guy to trial in a criminal case when he is here under these circumstances.
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,791.984,793.736,--That is right.
1987.87-336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,796.268,807.855,And you have personal jurisdiction statutes and constitutional provisions that say it takes a certain amount of contact in order to hail a guy into court.
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,809.216,816.771,"The difference, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the principle here is the same principle you had in Mitchell v. Forsyth."
1987.87-336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,816.771,820.813,How does it differ from the personal jurisdiction principle?
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,820.813,829.18,"Because in the personal jurisdiction principle, you are talking about very broad general provisions under the 14th Amendment having to do with personal contact."
1987.87-336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,832.783,833.995,No.
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,842.57,843.812,That's right.
1987.87-336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,843.812,849.316,I just don't think those are of really controlling significance.
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,849.316,865.134,"I think that you have to look at the basis, as you are suggesting, the basis on which it is claimed and say: Would bringing the person to trial seriously subvert the policy of the very protection which he is invoking."
1987.87-336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,879.373,886.058,But how about the policy that protects someone from being hailed into court where there are insufficient contacts?
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,886.058,888.539,"--It is not that strong a policy, I would have to say."
1987.87-336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,888.539,889.31,How do you know?
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,889.31,891.461,I don't know.
1987.87-336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,908.964,913.937,"But why should that make it lean in your favor, the fact that it is not a general provision that applies to everybody?"
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,918.499,924.143,--We are only talking about people who are present in this country as a result of extradition.
1987.87-336,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,947.647,954.443,"Mr. Kester, how broad is this rule of specialty do you think?"
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,978.379,978.969,No.
1987.87-336,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,984.002,986.155,"Crime, a tort."
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,986.155,994.19,"--A tort or a crime, either one, clearly he would not be immune because there it is a subsequent situation."
1987.87-336,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1007.209,1013.464,"Assuming he is convicted and sentenced to prison, does that end his immunity?"
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,1013.464,1022.758,"The immunity would end after he was released and had a reasonable time, let's say a month, to return home."
1987.87-336,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1022.758,1025.57,From prison?
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,1025.57,1027.963,After he was released.
1987.87-336,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1027.963,1030.304,I say he is in prison.
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,1030.304,1030.645,Yes.
1987.87-336,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1030.645,1032.004,For 80 years.
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,1034.227,1043.123,It would not end as long as he was subject to the criminal process for which the extradition had brought him to this country.
1987.87-336,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1052.829,1057.061,May I ask you another question that is somewhat like Justice O'Connor's.
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,1074.595,1080.717,"I think that if he would be otherwise subject to civil process, it would be good."
1987.87-336,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1098.909,1103.733,"But then suppose he makes the motion in the district court on the grounds he did here and the Plaintiff says,"
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,1114.11,1120.554,I would say it could be.
1987.87-336,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1123.096,1129.45,It seems to me that this issue need not always arise in the pristine clear posture in which you describe this.
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,1129.45,1134.443,"--I think the issue, Justice Stevens, is almost always going to arise in a very pristine posture."
1987.87-336,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1137.183,1138.185,But there have been so few appeals of this question.
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,1139.076,1139.955,I beg your pardon?
1987.87-336,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1139.955,1142.018,There have been so few appeals on this.
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,1142.018,1144.109,I can explain it this way.
1987.87-336,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1148.901,1153.045,"Well, then aren't you sure to win at the end of the ball game in that case?"
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,1153.045,1154.705,"It has always been the other person who is appealing, if any."
1987.87-336,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1154.705,1155.446,"Yes, right."
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,1155.446,1176.05,The other is that many of the earlier cases came up on habeas corpus because in those days the creditor's rights were much fiercer than they are today and they commonly commenced civil law suits with what the called the capias and they would put a capias ad respondendum in.
1987.87-336,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1221.64,1226.133,"In this case, was there also an attempt to obtain jurisdiction by attachment of his property?"
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,1226.133,1230.317,There was a purported attachment of his property.
1987.87-336,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1264.828,1267.881,"Mr. Kesler, do you want to say something about forum non conveniens?"
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,1267.881,1268.221,Yes.
1987.87-336,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1268.221,1269.313,I thought you might.
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,1269.313,1269.854,"Thank you, Justice Scalia."
1987.87-336,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1317.275,1319.378,Do you think it is an important issue?
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,1319.378,1320.978,Is this an important issue?
1987.87-336,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1320.978,1329.624,Is it an important issue in the sense that you are going to get a fair trial either way.
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,1345.696,1350.52,"I think in the real world, it does do injustice."
1987.87-336,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1405.721,1409.264,"Well, that may be a problem with the venue statute."
1987.87-336,0,31320,john_g_kester,,1434.98,1440.333,"The forum non conveniens, I would submit, is something more than simply venue."
1987.87-336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1641.536,1643.006,"Thank you, Mr. Kester."
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,1644.559,1648.239,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1987.87-336,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2338.862,2346.248,"Well, Mr. Walsh, do you think it has in this sense perhaps some international implications?"
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2363.79,2376.185,"Well, first of all, there isn't any indication that any country in the world has any interest in whether this particular petitioner is served with a civil summons while he is in this country."
1987.87-336,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2401.764,2404.255,"Well, I guess you have two points."
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2407.918,2408.656,Correct.
1987.87-336,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2408.656,2413.06,"And then, secondly, is the appealability question."
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2417.703,2427.28,"Well, if you want to assume that, there is nothing anywhere that would indicate that Switzerland in this case or Belgium or any other country--"
1987.87-336,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2427.28,2430.072,I am talking about the generality of this situation.
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2430.072,2430.652,--Yes.
1987.87-336,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2443.351,2446.594,What about a diplomatic immunity question?
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2448.514,2450.907,As to whether that would be immediately appealable?
1987.87-336,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2450.907,2452.497,Yes.
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2452.497,2463.514,"Well, if it was truly the right not to stand trial in the Nixon and Mitchell sense, then I think it would fall within the three Cohen criteria and could be immediately appealable."
1987.87-336,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2468.759,2470.338,How do we know which is which?
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2477.464,2491.483,"--Well, if... I do not know that much about diplomatic immunity, but if it means that this person is immune from arrest, cannot be arrested, cannot be tried, cannot be convicted, for this crime here, then--"
1987.87-336,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2491.483,2493.573,I think that is the same thing this one means.
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2493.573,2495.326,--This doesn't mean that at all.
1987.87-336,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2500.329,2501.28,I understand that.
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2520.081,2535.852,"The most that he is, in this particular situation, Your Honor, and I submit is if his theory of specialty is correct, which I submit it is not; but, assuming arguendo that it is correct, all that means is that the service that we have on him at present is no good."
1987.87-336,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2548.461,2550.782,"You could say the same thing about diplomats, of course."
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2553.093,2556.756,But the question is: Does he have the right not to be tried.
1987.87-336,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2559.828,2560.129,I understand.
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2564.0,2573.566,"Well, you look at double jeopardy from Abney and you look at absolute immunity from Nixon."
1987.87-336,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2579.84,2580.561,We said so.
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2580.561,2583.173,"--That's correct, yes."
1987.87-336,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2674.553,2679.355,"Well, the Rauscher case, I guess, decided it should protect him against the service of a criminal--"
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2679.355,2680.537,"Of criminal, only."
1987.87-336,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2680.537,2680.988,--Yes.
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2680.988,2694.616,It was a criminal prosecution for a different crime in a situation where the Queen of England was obviously miffed about the possibility of her national being prosecuted for a different crime.
1987.87-336,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2694.616,2701.27,"Now, does the individual myth in each case contribute to the appealability or not?"
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2706.103,2711.736,"Well, what it does is it affects whether there is a right nor not."
1987.87-336,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2755.587,2764.283,"Your argument: There is no individual right under this treaty and that the only time a court should stay its hand is when the country, itself, objects."
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2768.294,2770.906,"--Well, clearly, the right is that of the country."
1987.87-336,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2778.692,2781.033,I was about to say: You can say that about every treaty.
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2787.507,2805.189,"Yes, but part of the problem in determining whether the right exists requires an examination of the elements, the merits of the case, if you will, and gets you into the kind of analysis that I think prevents the second Cohen factor from being met in that it is not completely separate from the merits."
1987.87-336,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2826.493,2828.236,Just let me interrupt you.
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2835.599,2843.356,"--Well, I think it requires you to look at the allegations of the complaint, look at the criminal case that preceded it."
1987.87-336,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2843.356,2843.937,Why?
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2843.937,2850.619,And have a determination made of whether the foreign country really cares about whether there is a right.
1987.87-336,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2850.619,2855.464,"Well, in the plain language of the treaty, and the man is a third party beneficiary--"
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2855.464,2855.862,But it doesn't.
1987.87-336,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2855.862,2857.775,--I know because that doesn't in terms apply to civil.
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2857.775,2858.226,Right.
1987.87-336,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2858.226,2865.088,"But if it did apply to civil, if he is a third party beneficiary of the treaty, I do not know why you have to worry about whether Switzerland cares or not."
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2865.088,2869.422,"Well, I think you do have to engage in an analysis."
1987.87-336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2885.742,2889.465,Unless you say it is just a right not to be tried at all in this country.
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2889.465,2891.455,At all?
1987.87-336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2894.438,2895.149,"Well, what if it were?"
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2895.149,2897.169,--If it were?
1987.87-336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2897.169,2900.36,"I thought you said then it would be a Nixon, Abney kind of case."
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2900.36,2917.424,"If it were... if he were immune from suit, then depending on the source of the immunity, but I think I would be willing to agree that if he were actually immune from suit in the Nixon sense, then a collateral appeal would perhaps be appropriate."
1987.87-336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2917.424,2925.399,What is the closest case here in our Court holding that a particular order isn't appealable?
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2928.931,2934.776,"I think that the MacDonald, Jeffrey MacDonald case which involved speedy trial delay."
1987.87-336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2947.102,2949.425,What about the defective service cases?
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2949.425,2956.949,"No court, to my knowledge, has ever held that defective service of process is immediately appealable."
1987.87-336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2956.949,2960.051,"Well, is there a case here that says they aren't?"
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2960.051,2973.859,"Well, this Court held twenty or thirty years ago in Catlin that personal jurisdiction denials are not immediately appealable and that certainly is--"
1987.87-336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2973.859,2976.631,Isn't that the closest case here?
1987.87-336,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2976.631,2978.454,--I think so on the jurisdictional issue.
1987.87-336,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3054.425,3056.546,"Thank you, Mr. Walsh."
1987.87-336,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3058.847,3068.774,The MacDonald case is not the closest case to this.
1987.87-336,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3084.275,3093.541,"Well, MacDonald made the same argument, that he had a clean clear case, that the speedy trial thing had been violated and should not have... the thing should have been dismissed."
1987.87-336,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3093.541,3096.694,"But as this Court pointed out, speedy trial depends on prejudice."
1987.87-336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3114.004,3121.1,"What if this gentleman had come to this country not... he wasn't extradited, he just came here."
1987.87-336,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3127.474,3131.288,He is certainly subject to service of process if he comes here voluntarily.
1987.87-336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3135.78,3142.315,That isn't the same kind of immunity you have been talking about with Abney or Nixon.
1987.87-336,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3142.315,3149.127,"--I think it is very much like the immunity in Abney and Nixon in this respect, Justice White."
1987.87-336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3153.28,3160.416,"Well, if you won this case and the next day he came back here over, against your advice, he would be subject to suit; wouldn't he?"
1987.87-336,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3160.416,3162.167,Yes.
1987.87-336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3175.147,3180.79,"Well, why isn't this just a case of defective service, of failure to get personal jurisdiction?"
1987.87-336,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3180.79,3197.449,--This is a case of whether this person really can be subjected to suit in the United States because the defective service... the service was defective because a federal statute and a federal treaty were violated in invoking that service on him.
1987.87-336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3197.449,3205.735,"Well, what if this was a suit in the federal court and the objection is that this man just wasn't subject to being sued in a federal court in the State of New Mexico."
1987.87-336,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3205.735,3208.867,That is just the ordinary 14th Amendment objection.
1987.87-336,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3210.88,3214.09,"Well, those protections are less important than treaty protection?"
1987.87-336,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3214.09,3216.163,"--They are less specific, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.87-336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3217.102,3220.856,But the claim is he is not subject to suit in New Mexico.
1987.87-336,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3225.6,3228.691,--That is the ordinary personal jurisdiction.
1987.87-336,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3230.091,3231.861,"Then all it means is that ordinarily, they are not appealable."
1987.87-336,2,31320,john_g_kester,,3231.861,3239.798,"Ordinarily, they are not, but in this case we submit they are because there are considerations of international law and international policy."
1987.87-336,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3239.798,3241.679,"Thank you, Mr. Kester."
