1959.11,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,25.101,"Number 11 Edgar, Allen West, Petitioner, versus United States of America, et al."
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,28.226,29.641,Thank you.
1959.11,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,30.349,41.3,"So it's clear, really?"
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,41.3,45.298,"May it please the Court, there are two basic issues in -- in this case."
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,354.748,356.457,"Mr. Freedman, I'm -- I'm --"
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,356.457,356.623,Sir?
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,356.623,359.43,-- I'm afraid I may not have completely followed you in your last point.
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,368.864,370.33,"The overall job, Your Honor."
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,370.33,373.014,That is getting a ship -- making a ship seaworthy --
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,373.014,373.478,"Seaworthy, yes Your Honor."
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,373.478,374.351,-- that it'd been in overhauls?
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,374.351,377.811,"Preparing the vessel for sea, overhauling it."
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,418.826,425.953,"Now, is what you told us a matter of evidence in this case or something of which we're supposed to take judicial notice or for everyone."
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,425.953,427.872,"As to what a seaman's work, Your Honor?"
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,427.872,429.857,"Yes, yes."
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,429.857,438.569,"I would say, Your Honor, that it would be pretty much impossible to get all of the evidence to show what is and what is not seaman's work."
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,536.631,539.711,What I had in mind Mr. Freedman that was causing me difficulty is this.
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,561.085,564.177,"Well, Your Honor, this -- this was not mothballing the vessel."
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,564.655,565.382,De-mothballing it.
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,565.382,565.868,-- out of mothballs.
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,565.868,566.302,It's de-mothballing.
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,566.302,567.973,Just as preparing it for sea.
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,568.61,569.883,Make it seaworthy.
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,569.883,577.341,"Well, Your Honor, perhaps the methods have changed -- methods of laying a ship up, but laying a ship up is nothing new Your Honor."
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,635.559,638.081,(Voice Overlap) any evidence you might consider?
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,638.081,638.535,In this record?
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,638.535,639.543,As a matter of evidence?
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,639.543,642.091,"That -- that it's overhauling work, Your Honor?"
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,642.091,644.488,Or that this work is -- is a seaman's work.
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,644.488,649.683,"Well, there is no work in any contract is characterized as such, as seaman's work, Your Honor."
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,654.333,656.283,Just -- I wonder if you can answer the question first?
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,656.283,657.771,I know of nothing in the record --
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,657.771,658.403,No evidence.
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,658.403,665.779,-- which -- which says that it is or is not seaman's work that is using that tag of using the term itself.
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,675.789,680.424,"How many court opinions are there involving this mothballing, de-mothballing procedure?"
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,680.424,683.099,"Well, Your Honor when you -- when you say de-mothballing, --"
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,683.099,689.523,"It's this one, there is this one in the Court of Appeals in which it was not regarded by the courts as involving seaman's work, is that correct?"
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,689.523,696.144,"Well, I think Your Honor, it would be fair to state that every vessel which is laid-up, is really put in mothballs."
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,784.953,792.732,"Well now, how much -- is there any -- what evidence is there that a vessel's annual overhaul is the work of seaman rather than of a shipyard?"
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,792.732,800.356,"Well, Your Honors, we'll go through the -- again, that's a conclusion which I think Your Honors must consider judicially."
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,800.356,811.751,"Well, if I've -- if you're asking me to decide this case on my knowledge, my knowledge is contrary to that based on four and a half years experience as a -- a seaman."
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,813.73,818.608,"I -- I venture, Your Honor that -- Your Honor was in the navy."
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,818.608,819.358,Naval Reserve.
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,819.358,819.833,Naval Reserve.
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,819.833,821.012,And I thought we would like to hear the --
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,821.012,821.904,There's a big difference Your Honor --
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,821.904,824.834,-- being accused of having had me in it.
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,824.834,829.488,"Well, Your Honor, I assume that Your Honor was in military service."
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,864.778,866.642,I see your point and I don't want to interfere with your argument.
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,866.642,867.359,Well I -- I --
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,867.359,867.55,I understand --
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,867.55,869.79,I would prefer to reach any question in Your Honor's mind.
1959.11,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,876.287,888.4,"If you -- if you think of relying on the case of novo, there could really ignorant men other like me, you must apply some materials where I can find your -- that which I'm supposed to know."
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,888.4,892.03,"Well, having heard some of Your Honors' opinions in maritime cases, I think --"
1959.11,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,892.03,893.698,"I approved my point, had I?"
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,893.698,896.788,"No, no, Your Honor.[Laughter]"
1959.11,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,909.38,911.276,I'm denying any of what you say.
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,920.026,923.226,"Well, sir, let me go back on that point then."
1959.11,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,923.226,926.877,"You can take your time, I just -- I -- I -- if it's on your brief, I'll read it."
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,926.877,927.811,"Alright, sirs."
1959.11,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,932.864,937.468,"Unlike -- unlike my brother Stewart, I'm not spoiled by experience."
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,937.468,943.476,"[Attempt to Laughter] Well, sir, let's take the Pope & Talbot case versus Hawn which this Court decided after Sieracki."
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1158.061,1170.599,"Well, Mr. Freedman, isn't your difficulty of that argument the fact that this Court has reached that question and reasonable and philosophically right as Judge Hand may have been, he was overruled in that case, wasn't he?"
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1170.599,1172.318,That on this point.
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1175.452,1176.373,On what -- on which point?
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1177.108,1179.831,"On the point -- on the point of the services, the seaman services."
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1183.309,1184.325,In the Halecki case?
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1184.325,1187.159,The point in the Halecki and also the Skovgaard.
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1189.119,1190.298,Halecki was that case.
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1190.298,1190.562,"Yes, Your Honor."
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1190.562,1192.635,Halecki and the other one decided the same day in the Second Circuit (Voice Overlap) --
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1192.635,1193.059,"Right, sir."
1959.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1194.786,1195.01,Correct.
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1195.01,1197.014,-- in a sense.
1959.11,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1202.045,1205.669,"Well, it couldn't have been affirmed."
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1205.669,1211.066,"Well, it seems to me that if Your Honors only -- only reversed part of it."
1959.11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1220.571,1224.074,(Inaudible)
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1224.074,1224.894,Sir?
1959.11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1224.894,1231.247,"I wondered -- what my difficulty as you just quoted about, more likely (Inaudible)"
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1231.247,1234.352,"I think on the interpretation of the Death Act, Your Honor."
1959.11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1245.257,1249.584,"Well, if you get covered."
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1249.584,1251.554,I thought Your Honor was referring to Halecki.
1959.11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1251.554,1252.621,I thought Halecki (Inaudible)
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1252.621,1261.996,"Yes, it's -- well Halecki and -- Halecki and Tungus so far as the State Death Act involved pretty much the same principle that is under the Death Act."
1959.11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1310.778,1321.851,It is your (Inaudible) filed on the facts.
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1321.851,1324.819,"On that point, Your Honors, Your Honors (Voice Overlap) specifically reserved."
1959.11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1324.819,1327.106,(Inaudible)
1959.11,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1327.106,1369.438,"Your Honors, I think the -- the majority specifically reserved the question that we have right here in Halecki, namely -- namely whether or not in this situation where there is a -- a service involving the repair or placing a vessel back in operation, Your Honors specifically in that case -- that is the majority specifically in that in case, I think Your Honor, Mr. Justice Brennan pointed in your dissenting opinion that -- that it covered just citing Pope & Talbot that it did cover, but I think that the majority did reserve that point in the Halecki case."
1959.11,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1582.908,1587.638,You may.
1959.11,1,34222,leavenworth_colby,,1588.867,1591.935,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1959.11,2,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,3440.368,3448.201,I would like to briefly reply to some of the points which my friend -- let me address myself first to this question about seaworthiness.
1959.11,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3666.271,3669.014,"Those cases, -- well, those cases are different."
1959.11,2,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,3684.513,3686.654,"It's both, Your Honor, Peterson versus Hawn it was (Voice Overlap) --"
1959.11,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3686.654,3688.354,But wasn't that -- wasn't that Talbot so --
1959.11,2,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,3688.354,3689.235,Your Honor (Voice overlap) --
1959.11,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3689.235,3690.473,Let's do that.
1959.11,2,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,3695.387,3697.975,"This -- (Voice overlap) this Court had this situation, Your Honor."
1959.11,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3709.016,3718.087,"But it was onboard -- or the question -- there wasn't any question that it was a -- whether it was a -- the ship was in action or non-action, wasn't it?"
1959.11,2,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,3718.365,3719.086,This ship was --
1959.11,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3719.086,3728.964,"-- a question was whether you could distribute, whether you could unroll your responsibility and chuckle it all around the contractor, again do we know?"
1959.11,2,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,3728.964,3729.56,That's right.
1959.11,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3733.121,3736.75,But you first got to resolve the duty in order to find out whether it's delegable or not.
1959.11,2,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,3736.75,3751.205,"Well, that duty -- that duty was made clear by this Court in Sieracki and the Pope & Talbot versus Hawn, most recently in Crumady and I might say that the distinction which my friend, the assignment would say, Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Stewart does cover the point that friend just made."
1959.11,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3768.539,3773.852,"In other words, the opportunity is still open for my -- whether we would disagree on your present question."
1959.11,2,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,3773.852,3777.219,"No, they had already agreed on my questions in the -- in the Crumady case."
1959.11,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3781.779,3783.778,I'm not my Brother Stewart to that extent.
1959.11,2,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,3783.778,3784.435,Sir?
1959.11,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3784.435,3785.931,He'll have to decide for himself whether this --
1959.11,2,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,3785.931,3786.45,Of course.
1959.11,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3786.45,3790.058,And has been issued to everybody to keep the --
