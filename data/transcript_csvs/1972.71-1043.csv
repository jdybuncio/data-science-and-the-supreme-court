1972.71-1043,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.429,"We’ll hear arguments next in 71-1043, Heller against New York."
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,11.834,14.867,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,148.983,149.254,I see.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,152.09,152.759,That’s right.
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,152.759,153.87,Not just probable cause.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,153.87,156.034,"No, to determine obscenity del not."
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,227.971,228.87,Was it the only print?
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,228.87,231.622,"Yes, the only print and, indeed, that--"
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,231.622,232.965,Is that clear too in the record?
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,232.965,234.415,"No, it does not."
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,236.159,237.838,Then how will we assume it?
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,237.838,243.858,"Well, I can only say you asked a question and it has been told to me."
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,257.927,262.575,"Like the picture in the previous cases, it’s also showing in Washington?"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,262.575,264.817,I really don’t know.[Attempt to laughter]
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,271.885,273.161,You don’t think that makes a difference?
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,273.161,275.838,"It makes a difference? No, I don’t think it makes a difference at all."
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,275.838,279.801,"Well, the only print, what, in existence?"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,279.801,283.226,"Apparently, the only one in existence."
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,283.226,290.924,Isn’t-- shouldn’t there be another question of whether there’s more than one print that might be available to this man?
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,290.924,295.943,"The-- apparently, there was no other available to this man, but we have an overwriting problem."
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,295.943,297.407,Is that clear in the-- is that clear in the record?
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,297.407,298.759,"It is not clear in the record, no."
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,302.139,309.311,But you appreciate why we’re asking all those questions to call in both Quantity of Books and Marcus.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,309.611,310.669,I know.
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,310.669,313.336,The end result there was to take everything out right of the circulation.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,313.336,314.254,I know that.
1972.71-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,322.228,324.916,"Why, if there’s another film available?"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,324.916,335.822,"Let us assume there’s another film available, Justice White, the deterrent effect of an immediate arrest for showing that other film casts a chilling effect and an impossible burden."
1972.71-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,335.822,340.263,Marcus and Quantity didn’t hold that the man couldn’t be arrested right then.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,340.263,341.208,I realize that.
1972.71-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,341.208,342.694,That issue has been on many times.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,342.694,345.176,"I realize that, but by the same token--"
1972.71-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,345.176,349.415,Why is there any more of a chilling effect when in connection with movies?
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,349.415,355.33,"Well, because of the fact that movies can be shown to a large audience."
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,378.502,383.66,"I guess you wouldn’t even have to argue it if we-- the record show that, actually, this was the only print in existence, wouldn’t you?"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,383.66,386.805,"Unfortunately, that was never actually developed in the record."
1972.71-1043,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,412.248,425.185,"Well, if this were, in fact, the only copy of this film in existence that it would not be such a unique composition that it would’ve been made the subject of some inquiry at the trial?"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,425.185,427.556,"Perhaps it would, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.71-1043,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,427.556,430.776,Are there very many films of which there is only one copy in this area?
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,430.776,437.265,"No, I would say that it’s quite unusual for a film to be produced where there’s only one print."
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,439.487,441.699,Is this the kind of film that’s--
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,441.699,442.888,This is a low-budget--
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,442.888,447.048,"I mean, does it run the ordinary booking procedures?"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,447.048,450.096,"As far as I know, it was shown in only one theater in New York."
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,463.595,464.814,Is this as war hole?
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,464.814,472.511,"It’s a war hole film, but it’s not like some of those others which are being syndicated around town such as Heat and things of that sort."
1972.71-1043,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,482.369,486.117,"There wouldn’t be much profit in it if there were only copy, would there?"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,486.117,488.296,"There probably would not be, but let us--"
1972.71-1043,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,488.296,489.151,There had to be.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,489.151,491.022,There may have been copies in the west coast.
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,757.839,761.115,Do you know whether that’s a standard procedure?
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,761.115,780.361,"Now, I understand that since this situation has occurred and in view of Death View Amusement Park, in the Second Circuit-- an astro film is in the Second Circuit and, indeed, decisions in Sixth Circuit Courts of Appeal-- I believe the procedure in New York County is that they do give out that sort of hearings now."
1972.71-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,829.165,834.187,Is that testimony in the record of Judge Goldberg and Inspector Smyth or is that just in the brief?
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,834.187,835.694,"No, that’s in the record."
1972.71-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,835.694,836.27,It’s in the record.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,836.27,840.485,Judge Goldberg testified and so did Inspector Smyth testify.
1972.71-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,886.34,895.442,"Your concept of an adversary hearing, that would be where the counsel for the defendant would have a right to cross-examine the magistrate?"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,895.442,900.078,At least to cross-examine the complainant be he a magistrate or for Inspector Smyth.
1972.71-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,900.078,904.782,I take it that Judge Goldberg here where it was not a complaint and he was basically in the position of someone who--
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,904.782,907.187,"He was the magistrate who issued the search warrant, that’s correct."
1972.71-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,907.187,914.79,And you’re saying that in your concept of an adversary hearing defense counsel would have a right to cross-examine someone sitting in Judge Goldberg’s position?
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,914.79,915.939,No.
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,948.372,948.843,Excuse me.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,948.843,949.624,"Yes, Justice Stewart."
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,949.624,950.518,"Excuse me, I--"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,950.518,961.69,"I am not saying that necessarily, in all cases, I would say that where a detached impartial magistrate issues a search warrant that you have a right to cross-examine him as to why he did it."
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,998.517,1000.91,Is a copy of the search warrant in the appendix here?
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1002.791,1005.096,I thought it was reproduced.
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1005.096,1009.995,"Well, perhaps it is."
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1009.995,1016.027,Your friend from the state seems to indicate that he doesn’t think it’s in there.
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1016.027,1022.101,What Judge Goldberg did find-- he didn’t find that this movie was obscene.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1027.327,1039.617,"It-- if it were to follow the usual search warrant situation, it would say probable cause to believe that a search warrant should issue, and he applied a Fourth Amendment standard to a search and seizure situation."
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1056.349,1057.056,"Well, Mr. Anolik."
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1057.056,1057.373,Yes?
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1057.373,1060.214,"When you talk about adversary hearing, what do you concede this to be?"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1071.366,1071.922,That is correct.
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1071.922,1082.739,"And, for that purpose, what kinds of proof would the city have to use and what kind of proofs and defense would you use?"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1085.246,1087.074,It would certainly be a full-scale hearing.
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1088.406,1089.186,I--
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1089.186,1089.322,Yes?
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1089.322,1090.33,A full-scale trial?
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1090.33,1090.744,Yes.
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1090.744,1094.12,When you’re talking about a determination going on.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1096.064,1096.358,That’s correct.
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1096.358,1097.262,"Would suffice, would it?"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1097.262,1098.185,I would say not.
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1098.185,1099.059,"Well, what does that mean?"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1104.955,1105.172,Yes.
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1105.172,1108.572,Bearing on-- the city would have to prove obscenity.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1109.656,1111.029,"This is the State of New York, Your Honor."
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1111.029,1111.267,State?
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1112.007,1113.156,The County of New York.
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1113.156,1116.114,The state would have the burden of proving obscenity in the first instance.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1116.114,1116.809,That’s correct.
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1116.809,1118.42,"And by what, preponderance or--"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1118.42,1123.596,"No, I would say that they would have to prove it by the standard appertainable to a criminal prosecution."
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1123.596,1124.179,Beyond reasonable doubt?
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1124.179,1126.285,"That’s right, beyond reasonable doubt."
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1127.134,1136.368,"You mean, not because the object of seizing the film is to get evidence to support a criminal prosecution?"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1136.368,1153.765,"Well, the object of seizing the film here is to, in effect, take the film away, out of the possession of the individual and, while it’s true that is evidence, we maintain they must proceed by subpoena and, of course, with the subpoena you can make a motion to quash a subpoena."
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1158.227,1159.825,I understand that.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1168.914,1169.562,No.
1972.71-1043,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1175.216,1184.845,What you’re saying is that there must be a full-scale adversary criminal trial to determine whether there should be a full-scale adversary criminal trial.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1184.845,1187.732,I would say that the standard that you would use--
1972.71-1043,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1187.732,1189.587,"Well, isn’t that what you’re arguing?"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1189.587,1196.371,"In effect, I would say-- although it seems to be rather logical to say that, I would say, in effect, that would have to be our position."
1972.71-1043,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1196.371,1198.022,"Well, there’s no escape from it, is there?"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1201.828,1220.805,"Well, I would say that perhaps we could use a different standard because, as I understand it, a standard as to, for example, a fair preponderance might be sufficient to see that at least some gross miscarriage of justice has not occurred."
1972.71-1043,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1220.805,1224.13,But then you’re backing away from your ammos to Justice Brennan.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1224.13,1234.932,"I would be prepared, as I say, to at least reanalyze the standard of proof, in view of the way you set the question, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.71-1043,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1236.365,1239.269,"Well, don’t let my questions mislead you."
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1240.477,1248.807,"No, it is my position, as I say, that nothing less than a full adversary hearing where a proof beyond reasonable doubt is obtained should be had."
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1248.807,1266.147,"And yet, I take it, if the tryer applied beyond reasonable doubt standard and then they-- and determined obscenity and then a criminal prosecution ensued, you’d still insist the state had over again, in the criminal trial, to prove obscenity beyond a reasonable doubt."
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1266.147,1275.202,"Well, I would say that would, of course, would seem to be a situation where you’d have a jury trial perhaps on a different scale, because there you’d be trying--"
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1275.202,1276.13,"But still, the st--"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1276.13,1276.837,An individual.
1972.71-1043,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1276.837,1281.217,The standard for the decision of the jury would have to be obscenity beyond reasonable doubt.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1281.217,1285.318,"Yes, but the point is, in the one case, you’re judging the film itself."
1972.71-1043,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1301.378,1302.209,Mr. Anolik.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1302.209,1302.424,Yes?
1972.71-1043,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1302.424,1327.384,"Assuming that they follow this procedure and they seize the man who was showing the film who is the owner and he is also the operator, and you have this full adversary hearing and you lose there, and you have a second trial-- you have the trial and you waive the jury."
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1332.853,1335.431,The first hearing would determine what the film itself--
1972.71-1043,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1335.431,1337.267,I’m talking about what happens.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1337.267,1338.253,What happens?
1972.71-1043,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1346.644,1350.0,"Well, in my case there’s no question the man showed it."
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1350.0,1350.831,That he showed the film?
1972.71-1043,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1351.746,1354.436,"Well, in the second case, what other evidence would you put in?"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1357.069,1358.544,"No, he-- I think that we have--"
1972.71-1043,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1358.544,1359.85,What else would you put in?
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1359.85,1363.544,"No, I think you’d have to show that he had knowledge and intent."
1972.71-1043,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1363.544,1364.404,To do what?
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1364.404,1366.091,To show an obscene film.
1972.71-1043,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1382.309,1398.264,The state shows that they went in the place and they found the man up in the place in the projection room running the camera and they also saw him picking up the money and there was nobody there but him.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1400.03,1402.905,"Well, the-- I think you’d have to show some intent."
1972.71-1043,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1402.905,1403.63,How?
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1403.63,1410.371,"Well, that for example, this man, in good faith, believes this was not an obscene film because it’s--"
1972.71-1043,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1410.371,1412.871,"Well, he’s already testified in the other hearing."
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1412.871,1416.041,"He has testified, that’s right, but he was not the subject of the other hearing."
1972.71-1043,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1417.845,1418.851,He wasn’t?
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1418.851,1423.246,"Well, we maintain that it was the film itself which is the criterion of the other hearing."
1972.71-1043,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1423.246,1445.231,"Well, suppose in this-- my hypothetical, they start this adversary hearing the day after the picture is shown, adversary hearing, and the other hypothetical is they start his trial on the merits the day after the hearing."
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1447.133,1448.818,"The difference being that, in the one case--"
1972.71-1043,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1448.818,1450.507,I mean practical business.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1450.507,1459.162,"The practical is that, in the one case, we’re testing out whether or not the film itself should’ve been seized, whether or not it’s in fact obscene."
1972.71-1043,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1484.511,1494.359,"Well, what we’re worried about, isn’t this just like some narcotics cases when you, as defense counsel, you lose the motion to suppress, you lose your case?"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1494.359,1506.996,"No, I wouldn’t think so, because in narcotics cases there, again, has to be some element of criminal intent and knowledge because, frequently, a person who’s found in possession of heroin and there’s a chemical analysis."
1972.71-1043,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1515.919,1517.821,I said I’m going to practical.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1518.169,1519.877,"As a practical effect, I’ll say this."
1972.71-1043,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1531.69,1534.018,I wouldn’t push you a number.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1534.018,1535.65,"No, there aren’t too many of those."
1972.71-1043,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1554.401,1559.58,All of those that I-- I limited mine to that because I don’t think the others apply.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1571.059,1577.733,"Well, Your Honor, as I said, I-- if you noted, I was willing to backtrack a little bit on that aspect."
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1615.693,1616.382,Mr. Anolik.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1616.382,1616.608,"Yes, Justice Stewart?"
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1616.608,1621.581,"How do you visualize this adversary hearing? The movie would have to be there, wouldn’t it?"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1621.581,1623.783,"The movie would have to be there, but the point is this."
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1668.239,1670.384,"Well, that brings me back to my question."
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1673.613,1675.476,It would work by--
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1675.476,1677.029,Would there be a subpoena first to--
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1677.029,1682.226,"Yes, a subpoena and we maintain the subpoena is perfectly alright because there’s a contempt power behind it."
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1682.226,1683.617,A subpoena duces tecum.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1683.617,1684.456,"That’s correct, for the film."
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1684.456,1686.475,To the theater owner--
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1686.475,1686.564,That’s right.
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1686.564,1689.703,To produce the film and that immediately would take the film away--
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1689.703,1689.921,Just--
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1689.921,1693.803,From the projection booth and deprive all these people of their First Amendment rights to see it.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1693.803,1700.505,"But just for one day, not for weeks or months or years, just for one day, just for the purpose of showing it."
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1700.505,1700.82,You’re suggesting that--
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1700.82,1701.989,And then it’s immediately returned.
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1701.989,1708.111,You’re suggesting that the subpoena has to be-- that the hearing has to be within a matter of hours after the subpoena?
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1708.111,1711.424,I’d say that they would have to schedule a showing.
1972.71-1043,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1722.095,1728.903,"Then, when you come to the later trial, how is the state going to meet its burden of proof of showing that the film brought in at the trial is the same film they had--"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1728.903,1729.267,"But, that’s true--"
1972.71-1043,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1729.267,1730.211,At the preliminary?
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1730.211,1734.577,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, that’s true of any situation where you have subpoenaed records."
1972.71-1043,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1736.421,1737.377,You can make copies.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1738.395,1739.581,"Well-- but, it’s not that easy."
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1767.591,1774.557,"I suppose there could be ancillary restraints on its return against tampering with it and so forth, which would--"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1774.557,1775.517,Absolutely.
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1775.517,1779.445,Which would subject the exhibitor to contempt if it--
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1779.445,1784.444,"Not only contempt, perhaps forgery prosecution of offering a forged document."
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1791.164,1794.228,Just-- I wasn’t-- I’m not finished with my questions.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1803.792,1804.162,That’s correct.
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1804.162,1807.219,The theater owner shows up in response to this subpoena duces tecum.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1807.219,1808.056,Right.
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1808.056,1827.656,"And then, let’s assume that the magistrate, after the adversary hearing, finds that this probably is or that the prosecution has sustained its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that this is obscene, and then what happens?"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1828.313,1829.747,"What happens is then, it’s true."
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1832.141,1833.647,Is he?
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1834.057,1835.769,Pardon me?
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1835.769,1842.6,"I thought that you would say that the constitution requires that, nonetheless, the film be returned to the theater until or unless there’s been a criminal conviction."
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1842.6,1842.985,I’m sorry.
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1845.273,1846.577,We’re talking about this--
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1846.577,1846.768,The hearing--
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1846.768,1849.352,Adversary hearing that you say the constitution requires.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1850.812,1855.399,"And if it’s only the adversary hearing, they would have to wait for a conviction on the merits, we would maintain."
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1855.399,1855.929,So that--
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1855.929,1856.892,Before that was done.
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1856.892,1864.946,"So that, although there’s a finding by the magistrate that the preponderance of the evidence shows that this is an obscene film."
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1864.946,1865.292,Right.
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1865.292,1874.113,"Then, you say that, after such a finding, the constitution requires that the film be returned to the theater."
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1874.113,1883.847,"Your Honor, we would have to say, to take a constant position, that until there’s a finding of guilt by a Court that the film, it being a First Amendment property right we’re dealing with--"
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1883.847,1884.412,Yes.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1884.412,1886.593,Should not be seized at all.
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1886.593,1886.914,That’s what I thought.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1886.914,1890.519,We don’t think that present situation requires that to be seized.
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1890.519,1897.911,"Well, you see, because all these cases in these briefs talk about an adversary hearing and I have a very great deal of trouble visualizing what--"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1897.911,1899.255,It would be an adversary hearing and we--
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1899.255,1900.281,What the counsel had in mind.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1900.281,1902.445,We would use a standard of a fair preponderance.
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1902.445,1911.459,"Alright and--there’s a finding that by a fair preponderance of the evidence the film is obscene, then you say the constitution then requires the film to be returned to the theater?"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1911.459,1912.521,That’s correct.
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1912.521,1914.031,Immediately or very promptly.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1914.031,1914.813,As promptly as possible.
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1914.813,1917.546,"And then the case comes to trial, then what happens?"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1917.546,1924.491,"Again, through subpoena, it is displayed to the Court, and until there’s a finding of guilty, it should not be seized."
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1924.491,1930.826,"Well, it’s subpoenaed and then displayed to the finder of the fact, the jury or the trial judge."
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1930.826,1933.311,That’s correct.
1972.71-1043,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1933.311,1942.005,"And then it’s-- and then, assuming it’s a criminal trial, then the man may be punished but the film never does gets seized, does it?"
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1942.005,1953.337,"Well, eventually, if it’s deemed to be obscene after a trial on the merits beyond a reasonable doubt, then I presume they could seize it because it would technically be contraband at that point."
1972.71-1043,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1953.337,1954.572,Mr. Anolik.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1954.572,1956.588,Yes?
1972.71-1043,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1956.588,1977.526,"Suppose it were feasible for a copy of the film to be reproduced promptly, say, by an independent lab. Under circumstances, it would assure that there was no tampering with the film and that your client, therefore, could have the original back in 24 hours."
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1980.924,1981.465,I would say so.
1972.71-1043,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1983.37,1983.983,Yes.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1983.983,1986.15,That might be-- that would probably satisfy it.
1972.71-1043,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1986.15,1988.888,This would avoid having the duplicate trials.
1972.71-1043,0,28459,irving_anolik,,1988.888,1992.006,That’s correct.
1972.71-1043,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1994.365,1998.545,Mr. Friedman.
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,1998.545,2001.633,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2200.129,2202.813,Why do you need to take the film out of circulation?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2202.813,2207.146,"Your Honor, we-- the film didn’t have to be withdrawn from circulation in order to prosecute it."
1972.71-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2207.146,2208.174,"You seized it, didn’t you?"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2208.174,2217.368,"We did seize the film and, in partial answer of a question Mr. Justice Marshall had asked before, the film was currently in this Court’s custody actually."
1972.71-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2222.603,2227.128,Was-- Wouldn’t it have been enough for your purposes to subpoena it for the trial?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2227.128,2234.469,"Well, Your Honor, the subpoena route is not as simple, I submit, as has been suggested by my adversary."
1972.71-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2250.97,2256.192,"At the time of the trial, the film would finish its showing and they’d be out of jurisdiction anyways."
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2256.192,2270.984,"That’s correct, and I think the contemptor’s power is not a very effective one for this reason. As has been mentioned several times here, the films are on a schedule of circulation and if the current distributor--"
1972.71-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2270.984,2271.213,But if there were--
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2271.213,2279.17,"Has a contract right which limits his right to possession to a very limited period of time, he may well have a defense to any contempt proceeding."
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2279.17,2281.901,"Ordinarily, does he get more than one print?"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2281.901,2286.068,"The individual distributer, generally, would have one print, although--"
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2286.068,2290.876,Is that the sort of distribution method this film was subject to?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2290.876,2296.36,"Well, Your Honor, I presume that each person who had this film had one print in his possession."
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2301.85,2302.287,"Well, I know, but that--"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2302.287,2303.152,Commercial distribution.
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2303.152,2307.61,"That doesn’t mean much if there’s not a second print available to this exhibitor, does it?"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2307.61,2310.563,We don’t know whether there’s a second print available to this exhibitor.
1972.71-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2317.985,2324.935,Let’s assume that there were two copies readily available to him and you could have one of them but he could go on showing the other.
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2330.109,2331.637,"Yes, it certainly would, Your Honor."
1972.71-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2354.836,2355.021,"Well, that--"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2355.021,2367.629,"But not because we are preventing it, but because practicality of law enforcement is that the penal sanction, having been invoked as to one showing, the man runs a risk of subsequent prosecution."
1972.71-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2367.629,2367.957,"Well, isn’t that--"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2367.957,2369.957,Where they’re not subsequent seizure.
1972.71-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2369.957,2371.389,What’s the significance of that?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2371.389,2384.291,"Well, the point is, Your Honor, that the mere fact that the film is not shown again even if he had a second print available would not necessarily be because the state would seize it, but because the man might be well-advised not to show it."
1972.71-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2384.291,2390.616,"Yes, but that’s a little different situation than when you effectively preclude him from showing the film."
1972.71-1043,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2390.616,2392.498,"Each exhibition is a new crime, is it not?"
1972.71-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2392.498,2394.867,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2455.102,2467.635,"Why did they tell you that until you decide obscenity, you’re not supposed to take steps to preclude circulation of it?"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2467.635,2483.561,"But, Your Honor, the problem is this, and that’s why I refer to this case involving a film called Deep Throat which, I believe, is referred to in one of the briefs for amicus curiae in this matter, a motion in brief which has not yet been accepted by the Court."
1972.71-1043,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2490.132,2490.32,"Well, isn’t there a solution?"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2490.32,2492.071,They have this case come to a hearing.
1972.71-1043,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2492.071,2494.011,Isn’t there a solution to go to trial?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2494.011,2496.531,"Our-- we have made every effort, Your Honor."
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2532.012,2541.907,I thought Mr. Anolik suggested to us earlier that because of some decisions of the Second Circuit you are actually providing an adversary hearing.
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2542.059,2543.63,"Your Honor, we have been held."
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2543.63,2543.92,How many?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2543.92,2546.046,"To my recollection, there had been three."
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2546.046,2547.834,What form did they take?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2547.834,2553.118,"Well, the first one was in 1970."
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2559.664,2559.989,What was this--
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2559.989,2560.969,Six weeks later--
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2560.969,2561.816,"Before whom, a magistrate?"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2561.816,2562.661,Before a magistrate.
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2562.661,2562.949,Yes.
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2562.949,2568.362,"Six weeks later, there were three days of testimony given by defense experts."
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2581.8,2584.465,"Well, I understand you saying there’d been two other instances?"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2584.465,2584.799,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2584.799,2586.573,Are they different or are they the same?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2586.573,2588.73,One terminated in an Article 78--
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2588.73,2590.283,"Well, what kind of case--"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2590.283,2591.722,-- It would never go to a full hearing.
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2591.722,2595.554,"What time of case-- or what kind of case did the state put in, in this first case?"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2595.554,2596.636,The film.
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2596.636,2597.158,Nothing but the film?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2597.158,2597.832,Nothing but the film.
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2597.832,2598.493,And then rested?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2598.493,2599.012,And then rested.
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2599.012,2601.365,"And then the defense put on expert testimony, is that it?"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2601.365,2602.596,That’s correct.
1972.71-1043,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2619.203,2619.704,"Well, if there’s a due process right as to--"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2619.704,2620.899,Because there is a problem in New York--
1972.71-1043,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2620.899,2634.755,"Mr. Friedman, is there’s a due process right to some kind of a hearing, adversary or otherwise, do you suggest that that right can yield to the fact that some judges in New York don’t get on with the trial of their cases?"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2634.755,2637.623,"No, Your Honor, our proposition is this."
1972.71-1043,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2655.92,2656.137,"Well, it may--"
1972.71-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2656.137,2658.354,I thought you have the hearing.
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2658.354,2658.76,Because I--
1972.71-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2658.76,2660.853,"The judge wanted to get to it and hold it, is that it?"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2660.853,2661.9,"Well, no, Your Honor."
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2672.449,2673.91,"Well, I guess, he’s entitled to some time."
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2673.91,2677.002,He’s entitled to time and the question of how much time.
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2678.982,2681.423,"That’s for your state judges, isn’t it, not for the rest to decide?"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2681.423,2689.447,"Your Honor, if the First Amendment mandates an adversary hearing, then I submit that what we have is the Sixth Amendment mandating a delayed adversary hearing--"
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2689.447,2695.273,What about that procedure-- is it still obtained in New York when we have in king--

1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2696.218,2697.018,Kingsley Books?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2697.018,2697.43,"Yes, Your Honor, that’s now--"
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2697.43,2702.632,Didn’t that require a hearing within a day or something and a decision within two days?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2702.632,2705.555,That procedure was not applicable to films in the first instance.
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2705.555,2706.255,"Yes, I know, but is that still--"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2706.255,2707.246,It is now.
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2707.246,2707.48,Is it now?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2707.48,2709.619,It has been amended to be applicable to films.
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2712.267,2717.883,"As I recall, that one-- doesn’t that-- that requires a hearing within what, one day or something?"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2717.883,2732.467,"Yes, Your Honor, and as the cases of this Court have indicated, those hearings also go on for months, that, although the hearings are required, the defendants request time and, in Kingsley Books, they consented to the injunction pendently to provide time to prepare."
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2736.117,2737.497,"No, but I take it if they--"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2737.497,2737.945,Of a consent to delay.
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2737.945,2743.849,"If they ask for more time and the Court grants it, that’s too bad to the state but that’s hitting it."
1972.71-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2743.849,2751.926,"The film-- isn’t the film-- aren’t films subject to a different approach, in any event, to licensing?"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2751.926,2752.436,Not in New York.
1972.71-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2752.436,2753.471,In advance?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2753.471,2755.111,Not in New York currently.
1972.71-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2755.111,2756.06,"Well, I know, but constitutionally it could be--"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2756.06,2765.504,"I believe the Court has said yes, although I believe the current state of the law has been to-- they’ve been repealed in, I believe, every state though I won’t-- I’m not sure."
1972.71-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2765.687,2766.374,"Well, certainly not under the--"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2766.374,2769.379,As a result of this Courts’ decisions which have cut down the proceeding--
1972.71-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2769.379,2771.779,"I know, but we never said in Freedman that there couldn’t be such a support."
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2771.779,2786.902,"No, Your Honor, but in Freedman the Court said that a temporary removal of a film from exhibition for a limited period, pending rapid state proceedings, was permissible."
1972.71-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2786.902,2788.804,"But, why isn’t that-- why doesn’t that still obtain?"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2788.804,2788.998,Well--
1972.71-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2788.998,2790.037,Even in censorship cases.
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2790.037,2796.833,"In a case of this type, and that’s what I see here, is that this man has shown the film in the past."
1972.71-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2802.623,2813.53,"I know, but if any-- but if you think the other approach is preventing from showing in advance, then there is some pressure on him to get on with the hearing, and then the state starts dragging his feet."
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2813.53,2819.717,"That’s correct, Your Honor, except that in these instances, and that all we can speak of is the experience."
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2841.431,2841.978,Is there some reason--

1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2842.577,2847.56,"Is there some reason, Mr. Friedman, now that you’ve amended that Kingsberg-- was it Kings--"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2847.56,2848.202,Kingsley Books.
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2848.202,2853.225,"Kingsley Books statute, is there any reason you don’t resort to that instead of this type of proceeding?"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2853.225,2858.772,"The first answer, Your Honor, is that the statute-- the amendment, I believe, became effective in August of 1972."
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2858.772,2860.638,"Well, that’s a good reason."
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2860.638,2869.501,"Secondly, it’s a-- I have been told that the effectiveness of the Kingsley Books statute is somewhat limited because it’s a-- in a book situation."
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2869.501,2870.835,It’s an injunction proceeding.
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2870.835,2874.472,It had been a very cumbersome procedure to serve and hold in advance.
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2874.472,2876.356,"It’s an injunction procedure, isn’t it?"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2876.356,2880.351,It’s a purely civil injunction procedure which is now contained in the Civil Practice Act.
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2939.354,2944.778,I take it on the ground that if there’s a determination of obscenity that takes it outside the First Amendment.
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2944.778,2945.697,That’s correct.
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2945.697,2947.629,"Therefore, it could be treated as without or--"

1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2949.047,2950.732,"Well, whether it’s contraband, in any event--"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2950.732,2957.235,"Or a nuisance or one, whatever the appropriate rupert might be under the particular jurisdiction but, the point is, here--"

1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,2972.09,2978.318,"Your Honor, there is nothing to stop, but there is nothing to stop it in any search warrant case."
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3007.579,3007.745,But you--
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3007.745,3008.734,But the real problem is getting a magistrate willing to hear it.
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3008.734,3020.655,"But you justified this on the fact that, I think I heard you correctly, that if it’s found out that it was obscene then that makes everything alright."
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3020.655,3023.226,I wouldn’t justify judge-shopping.

1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3025.286,3040.122,"But, I thought you shared-- what prompted my question was that once the hearing does determine that the picture is obscene, however it was seized and under whatever conditions, it’s nothing at all."
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3040.122,3042.789,"Well, to the extent that--"
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3042.789,3045.306,Which is not my idea of search and seizure.

1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3067.538,3068.36,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3068.36,3071.63,Isn’t that-- do you want to make that true here too?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3071.63,3075.154,"Your Honor, we’re not trying to vindicate a search by what--"
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3075.154,3082.065,But you’re vindicating the seizure of property which allegedly is under First Amendment protection.
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3082.065,3083.173,Well--
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3083.173,3084.441,Allegedly.
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3084.441,3099.477,"Allegedly, Your Honor, but what we have in this case, and I think you’ve realistically thrown all of these cases, we have had a search and seizure where a magistrate has seen the evidence and has found eh film to be obscene."
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3118.6,3120.739,That’s obscene under the state law of New York.
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3120.739,3138.612,"Under the state law of New York, Your Honor, and I think as we set forth the state statute at the outset of our brief, I think the Court will see that that is as close a paraphrase as the legislative draftsman was capable of doing of the three-fold test this Court has announced in its five decisions on obscenity."
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3139.917,3142.324,My sound instead to give a proof of what you’re in.
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3142.324,3150.701,"No, Your Honor, I think that that question is one which can be seen from the statute itself, that the state has codified the sound in this question--"
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3150.701,3155.763,"Why can’t we have this hearing, other than the fact that it takes time?"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3155.763,3156.949,"Why not hold the hearing, Your Honor?"
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3156.949,3161.591,"Yes, other than the fact that it takes time."
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3161.591,3177.484,"After a magistrate has seen the film, we run a substantial risk, and has been mentioned several times today, of alteration of a film, we run the risk of film disappearing because of will, and these are not imaginary."
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3195.188,3196.563,"Well, why go through any hearing?"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3203.446,3204.361,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3204.361,3207.845,"Well, if all you say is true, why’d you worry about getting the magistrate?"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3207.845,3223.179,"Your Honor, because the Fourth Amendment requires that there’d be a neutral and detached magistrate who ascertains that there is grounds for seizure and this Court has suggested in Marcus that the First Amendment does run into that."
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3223.179,3223.564,And then you can--
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3223.564,3236.1,"We might suggest that the magistrate must have, as close to firsthand, knowledge of the material to be seized as is possible in order for him, in his judicial role, to make that decision."
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3241.708,3246.491,And this man has been without this film for how long now?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3246.491,3247.861,"This stage, three years."
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3247.861,3248.215,Huh?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3248.215,3253.89,Three years and four months to this date.
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3253.89,3255.62,And that doesn’t give any problem?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3255.62,3271.703,"Your Honor, there has been a final adjudication beyond a reasonable doubt that this film was obscene and, given that final adjudication and in 48 days after the seizure, the state may validly seize and hold that film."
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3272.916,3274.351,Forever?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3274.351,3276.313,That’s right.
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3276.313,3278.397,Forever?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3278.397,3281.065,I would see no reason why not.
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3281.778,3284.071,Would that apply to a book?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3284.071,3286.824,"The single copy of the book that is seized, certainly."
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3286.824,3287.976,It would apply to a book?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3287.976,3288.603,Your Honor--
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3288.603,3291.002,Even if it was the only book?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3291.002,3291.636,If it’s the only book--
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3291.636,3292.986,If it was the only copy?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3292.986,3294.312,"That’s correct, Your Honor, and--"
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3294.312,3294.903,It could be seized--
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3294.903,3297.27,A final adjudication of obscenity has been made.
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3297.27,3298.935,Then it could be kept forever?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3298.935,3299.598,That’s correct.
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3299.598,3302.102,"Or, as a matter of fact, destroyed?"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3302.102,3303.263,"That’s probably true, Your Honor."
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3303.263,3305.577,And that gives you no First Amendment problems?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3305.577,3307.312,"No, Your Honor, as long as the state has a--"
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3307.312,3310.306,Do you mind if it gives me some?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3310.306,3312.292,"That’s why we’re here, Your Honor."
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3354.854,3360.888,We wouldn’t have that problem in the case we had earlier because somebody destroyed it.
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3364.281,3371.891,"If it’s the same film, Your Honor, and I believe the Attorney General from Kentucky indicated he hadn’t seen it to see if it is the same film."
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3378.99,3386.121,Does the New York statute have any provision for destruction of material when finally adjudicated obscene?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3386.121,3389.083,"Not that I am aware of, Your Honor."
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3389.083,3391.496,Other than-- I mean-- Even after-- I’m just interested.

1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3410.928,3411.42,"I think, usually--"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3411.42,3412.621,Many problems as the retention.
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3412.621,3415.493,"Well, usually, these statutes provide for its destruction in that situation."
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3415.493,3417.773,"MIt may be a statute in New York, Your Honor, that I’m unaware of."

1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3426.183,3433.25,"When it’s heroin or something like that, isn’t there some statutory provision in which you keep it?"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3433.25,3442.27,"Not-- the statutes are vague, at best, as to the right to retain or destroy evidence at the expiration of a case."
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3448.752,3450.086,"But it’s contraband, isn’t it?"

1972.71-1043,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3450.796,3453.603,You don’t return it to the defendant.
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3453.603,3456.051,We certainly don’t return heroin to defendants.

1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3459.662,3495.644,"I presume there is a statute regulating the police property clerk which governs that but, as a practical matter, I think the Court’s aware there’s a substantial problem in obscenity cases of the Bar or anyone else knowing precisely what the item that has been adjudicated is, and that the objects are usually retained for as long as it is possible to keep them in some form of intact state or another so as to provide that insight for further study, so that in most cases and certainly in most obscenity cases the material that’s been seized has been held for years and years."
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3495.644,3499.5,Isn’t it some place in Brooklyn that has this “library” on it?
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3501.536,3504.16,I believe the State of New York was in the process of setting one up.
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3505.256,3507.069,"Yes, I thought so."
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3507.069,3510.306,The value of a library of obscenity--
1972.71-1043,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3510.306,3512.335,I think you need to use the word “library.”[Laughter]
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3512.335,3516.805,"Well, I think that’s the way it’s been popularly described, Your Honor."
1972.71-1043,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3577.081,3579.457,"But who’s in charge of the calendar in New York, judges or the--"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3579.457,3591.34,"Your Honor, it is the judges, but the defendant’s Fifth-- Sixth Amendment right to counsel is generally what has been interjected and, I think, not unjustifiably where counsel needs time to prepare."
1972.71-1043,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3619.331,3619.597,"So, you--"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3619.597,3628.901,"But if a hearing is required, then the problem of delay is forced into the hearing process by the Sixth Amendment, if nothing else."
1972.71-1043,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3633.076,3643.874,"But you-- if it were the other way, then the state concedes and holds pending what you say is necessarily a period of time for preparation?"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3643.874,3655.831,"If the def-- if the person who had custody of the film requires a time for preparation, then the state-- if he wants the time, then should that state return it to him during that period."
1972.71-1043,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3663.376,3675.612,"I suppose you might say too that, although frequently defense counsel in criminal cases will want delay in the actual trial of the action, they may not insist on delay of-- for preliminary hearing."
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3675.612,3690.158,"No, they may or they may not, depending on how it suits the strategy of a particular defense, but the question is whether the state must be put in a position where delay is a matter of right, and I think that the Sixth Amendment would make it a matter of right."
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3742.004,3745.216,"Well, I suppose the word “adversary” has appeared first in Marcus."
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3745.216,3745.694,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3745.694,3749.708,"That ordinarily connotes, doesn’t it, a contest?"
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3749.708,3751.81,"Yes, but the problem of how much of a contest."
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3751.81,3751.902,"Yes, I know."
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3751.902,3757.568,"The New York Court of Appeals, in this case, in its opinion seem to treat it as being a question of argument as oppose to a question of proof."

1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3766.508,3775.481,"And to that extent, if the principle of Marcus and Quantity of Books applies in this situation, to that extent, surely your procedure is deficient."
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3775.481,3778.631,If it is a full contest at that stage which is required.
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3778.631,3780.443,"But, here, there’s no contest at all."
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3780.443,3780.832,That’s correct.
1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3780.832,3788.588,"Whatever the contest may be, I just suggest that I think Marcus and Quantity of Books does suggest there has to be some contest."

1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3818.164,3820.199,And an ex parte one.

1972.71-1043,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3821.515,3822.463,"Well, that’s what it is."
1972.71-1043,1,34449,lewis_r_friedman,,3822.463,3838.065,"It may be ex parte, but that doesn’t necessarily make it deficient because in a judge-- in deciding the questions of obscenity, there are no questions of fact in the sense of an informant type of search warrant case."
