2015.15-6092,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.75,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 15-6092, Mathis v. United States. Mr. Fleming."
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,7.75,19.975,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Iowa statute under which Mr. Mathis was convicted defines one crime, and Iowa does not need to prove generic burglary to convict under it."
2015.15-6092,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,41.45,48.9,"Why is that so? I mean, here we have the crime, burglary, and there are two ways of committing it."
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,65.3,71.37,"For the exact same reason, Justice Ginsburg, that the California statute at issue in Descamps was not divisible."
2015.15-6092,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,102.13,103.885,But he did one or the other.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,113.484,121.99,"The -- the -- California would have had to prove entry, just as Iowa would have to prove an occupied structure."
2015.15-6092,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,150.19,154.785,"But they have to prove one -- they define, somewhere, structure, right, in the statute?"
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,154.785,155.68,"They do, Justice Breyer."
2015.15-6092,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,155.68,163.815,"And don't you have to prove that that definition applies? I mean, you know, suppose it was a structure for -- for an animal at a zoo or something."
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,166.59,167.57,It might not.
2015.15-6092,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,167.82,168.19,Right.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,171.7,173.25,The definition of occupied structure.
2015.15-6092,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,173.25,173.39,Yes.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,173.39,174.02,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-6092,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,174.02,174.21,Okay.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,174.21,174.63,And we don't --
2015.15-6092,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,174.63,184.73,"And, similarly, in Taylor, you have to prove that it falls within the statute's definition of boat or car or house."
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,187.49,188.48,That is the difference.
2015.15-6092,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,188.48,196.82,"But you don't have to prove -- you have to prove in Massachusetts if you have an indictment which says it was like a houseboat, so they're not certain what it counts as."
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,209.055,210.79,This Court in Shepard assumed that --
2015.15-6092,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,210.79,212.56,"Now, we don't know Massachusetts law."
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,213.05,213.11,Yeah.
2015.15-6092,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,213.11,216.01,"-- Massachusetts law, would you be able to convict the person?"
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,216.01,221.0,I -- this Court assumed because it wasn't disputed in Shepard that the answer is no and that --
2015.15-6092,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,221.0,229.8,"The answer is no? You cannot convict a person, say, on a houseboat in Massachusetts where the prosecutor says it's either a house or a boat? They have to go into what the difference is?"
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,229.8,237.35,"As this Court interpreted it in -- in Shepard, house or a boat are elements of the crime."
2015.15-6092,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,237.35,244.03,"So, in other words, if six people think a houseboat is a boat and six people think a houseboat is a house, the guy gets off --"
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,244.03,245.05,If -- if --
2015.15-6092,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,245.05,248.5,-- in Massachusetts? Do you have any case on that? I would be rather surprised.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,248.5,250.795,"Not in Massachusetts, Your Honor, but this is an Iowa case."
2015.15-6092,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,250.795,251.15,I know.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,265.215,271.79,"Because Massachusetts and Iowa have chosen to define different crimes, and they have the prerogative to do that."
2015.15-6092,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,318.41,320.07,That's why I asked you about Massachusetts.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,320.07,321.72,Massachusetts will be different.
2015.15-6092,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,321.72,323.79,"You violated Section blah, blah, blah."
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,332.81,338.495,"It -- in Massachusetts, the -- the statute itself is not clear on the point."
2015.15-6092,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,359.31,364.2,"Well, there are a lot of reasons why Iowa might want to take the approach that it -- that it does."
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,413.31,416.31,"The -- I do not, Your Honor. But this is not a Massachusetts case."
2015.15-6092,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,420.01,424.155,"Well, maybe they have more houseboats in Massachusetts than they do in Vermont. (Laughter.)"
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,424.155,431.39,"But the -- the point, Justice Alito, is that the State is free to define its crime as it wishes."
2015.15-6092,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,444.6,469.47,"Well, the point is, what is the Federal -- under your approach, what is the Federal sentencing court supposed to do in the situation like the Massachusetts situation where there is no case, there is no Massachusetts case? So what is the court supposed to do? Now, in -- this Court has said it's -- it's as simple as pie to determine whether something is -- is an element or a means."
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,475.07,480.83,"If there truly were a situation where all else had failed, all the standard tools of statutory interpretation --"
2015.15-6092,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,480.83,482.24,Which will often be the case.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,482.24,495.3,"Will sometimes be the case. There are a number of them that we cite where State law is plain on the point, and the State courts have had to resolve this, whether in the context of the double jeopardy challenge or a challenge to the indictment or request for unanimous jury instructions."
2015.15-6092,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,495.3,500.055,So what -- what happens if there is that State case that says whether this is definitively an element or a means?
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,500.055,515.71,"In the situation where that arises, obviously, the sentencing court will apply the ordinary tools of statutory interpretation, looking at the text to say -- for instance, in the case of Vermont -- are they punishing one of the particular locations more severely than another? In that circumstance, we know they have to be elements, not --"
2015.15-6092,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,515.71,517.08,"Well, suppose they -- suppose they don't."
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,521.8,527.13,"Obviously, one would look to authoritative sources like -- like jury instructions. One could look at commentaries."
2015.15-6092,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,535.26,545.655,"Isn't there also something that Descamps says that -- that can be done, which is, you know, maybe you have a case and it just gives you the answer."
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,600.44,609.77,"It's certainly right as to the first point, and I -- I think certainly looking at Shepard documents to determine, for instance, if house and boat are charged in the same count, then to avoid duplicity --"
2015.15-6092,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,609.77,616.365,These documents are a clue to whether something is an element or instead a means.
2015.15-6092,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,616.365,618.125,Sometimes they're a very good clue.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,629.775,635.19,"I think as Your Honor has phrased it, we have no quarrel with that, as long as the Court is being cautious about --"
2015.15-6092,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,635.19,639.13,"Why is that correct, Mr. Fleming? That depends on State pleading law."
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,665.43,666.57,"No, Your Honor, that's not our position."
2015.15-6092,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,666.57,672.42,"Well, then how can you tell from the -- from the charging document that something is an element or a means?"
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,672.42,691.67,"I think if, in the limited situation that Justice Kagan's question posited, which is when you have a situation where a prosecutor charges house and boat together in one count, that would be a duplicitous indictment if they were different elements. So that is a clue that at least the prosecutor viewed them as different means of commission of a single offense."
2015.15-6092,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,691.67,693.61,What if the charge is one?
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,693.61,694.43,If --
2015.15-6092,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,694.43,700.525,"What if -- in this case, what if the charge -- what if the charging document just charged one? Does that make it an element?"
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,700.525,707.315,"I think in that situation, the Shepard document would be inconclusive, and it would not be -- it would not be indicative of which it was."
2015.15-6092,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,708.66,709.06,So Mr. Fleming --
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,709.06,710.265,"I apologize, Justice Sotomayor."
2015.15-6092,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,710.265,711.905,Why don't we use this case?
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,711.905,713.18,"I would welcome that, Your Honor."
2015.15-6092,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,713.18,737.315,"All right -- at the Joint Appendix it says -- one of the charging elements says that Richard Allen Mathis, on such-and-such a date in Iowa, unlawfully and willfully break -- I'm sorry about the tenses -- broke and entered a storage shed belonging to -- to the victim with the intention to commit a theft."
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,743.34,744.45,"No, your Honor."
2015.15-6092,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,744.45,748.63,It is very clear that the only thing being charged is breaking into a shed.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,748.63,749.69,Absolutely.
2015.15-6092,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,752.95,757.49,"Well, I mean, this doesn't say willfully -- willfully -- unlawfully and willfully."
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,784.25,785.165,"Of course, Your Honor."
2015.15-6092,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,785.165,789.065,"The State law dispositive, that's number -- first, let's start there."
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,789.065,789.71,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-6092,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,806.5,808.47,"So that's your entire case, correct?"
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,808.47,809.75,"Well, in this case --"
2015.15-6092,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,809.75,811.545,Let's assume Iowa was silent.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,813.88,814.285,If --
2015.15-6092,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,814.285,816.625,-- was coming to.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,829.775,841.27,"The same -- the same problem would have occurred and did occur in Descamps. Mr. Descamps's criminal information said, feloniously entered a building -- a grocery store, I believe it was --"
2015.15-6092,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,841.27,842.08,"Yes, the problem --"
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,842.08,842.19,-- and --
2015.15-6092,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,842.19,855.935,"-- with Descamps there is that ""feloniously entered"" had two potential meanings: You broke and you entered, or you remained unlawfully and committed a crime."
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,879.82,926.785,"If I may, Justice Sotomayor, I -- I -- if you -- if Your Honor had thought that the -- either the indictment or the plea colloquy were dispositive of figuring out whether the generic offense was involved for purposes of ACCA, Mr. Descamps would have lost, because his indictment said, ""willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously entered a building."" And at the plea hearing, the prosecutor said, without objection from Mr. Descamps, that the crime involved the breaking and entering of a grocery store. So there was no question, if you were to -- looking at the Shepard documents in Descamps, that they set forth generic burglary. Nonetheless, that wasn't enough, because -- and these are the Court's words -- California, to get a conviction, need not prove that Descamps broke and entered."
2015.15-6092,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,934.87,939.065,Do you see a difference between -- he had to do one or the other here.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,955.47,960.08,And the point is that California did not need to -- to show beyond a reasonable doubt --
2015.15-6092,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,960.08,960.54,Exactly.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,960.54,960.86,-- whether --
2015.15-6092,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,960.86,963.33,He wasn't pleading guilty to one or the other.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,975.03,986.94,"But the -- the nongeneric aspect of the California offense was that you could enter lawfully and then shop with the intent to shoplift, and that could still be punishable under this statute."
2015.15-6092,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,990.68,992.355,Go back to my ultimate question.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,994.29,995.98,The steps for how the sentence --
2015.15-6092,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,995.98,997.76,You say State law is dispositive.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,997.76,997.99,"Yes, it is."
2015.15-6092,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,997.99,999.57,Assume State law is unclear.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,999.57,1002.77,So there's a general answer to the question and a specific answer to the question.
2015.15-6092,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1070.75,1086.81,"Must everything be either a means or an element? Suppose I just looked at this statute and I said, here's a statute, punishing burglary, and it tells us two ways in which this offense can be committed, one way or the other way."
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1094.895,1100.07,"I -- I view, Justice Ginsburg, a way of committing the offense as a synonym for the means."
2015.15-6092,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1124.98,1138.045,"This -- this defendant pled guilty to an information that charged unlawfully entering a garage, a house."
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1140.09,1142.14,The -- the information states that.
2015.15-6092,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1144.0,1148.535,He doesn't think that -- there wasn't any possibility of a boat or a car being in this picture.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1148.535,1151.49,"The -- the record does not exclude that, Your Honor."
2015.15-6092,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1173.35,1179.13,"I was curious to know, you said Congress never intended, and then we didn't get the never."
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1179.13,1179.87,Never --
2015.15-6092,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1179.87,1185.69,I'm sure Congress never intended that we have the dialogue that we're having here today. (Laughter.)
2015.15-6092,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1185.69,1192.21,"This is such an art -- you were going to say, what did Congress intend? You couldn't finish that."
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1192.21,1203.17,"I'd be happy to, Justice Kennedy. Congress intended that a -- that a conviction for a particular crime would be an ACCA predicate offense in all cases or in none."
2015.15-6092,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1284.26,1292.72,What is -- what is the evidence in -- in the -- you said the statutory text. What is the evidence in the statutory text of ACCA that this is what Congress intended?
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1292.72,1293.77,It's the -- it's the --
2015.15-6092,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1293.77,1296.5,Prior to Apprendi and all this other stuff.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1298.37,1316.57,"This -- this Court in Taylor relied on the fact that Congress used the word ""convictions"" as opposed to someone who had committed an offense, and also looked at the legislative history, which specifically indicated that Congress did not mean a conviction for a particular crime to sometimes be an act of predicate and sometimes not."
2015.15-6092,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1316.57,1329.08,"So if someone were explaining what -- what your client pled guilty to, they wouldn't say he was convicted for -- for breaking into a garage? They wouldn't say that?"
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1329.08,1333.5,It may -- I mean an -- an ordinary person may well use that description.
2015.15-6092,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1340.345,1346.44,Wasn't Congress interested in what the person did rather than what the statute said?
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1346.44,1350.32,"On the contrary, Your Honor. That's exactly what Taylor and its progeny say is not the case."
2015.15-6092,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1353.21,1355.535,It's -- it's not the case that that's what Congress wanted?
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1355.535,1372.11,"Congress was not -- by -- by passing ACCA, Congress was interested in what the person was convicted of, which is why they use the word ""convictions."" They did not use the language, for instance, of the statute in Nijhawan, which is different and does not trigger a categorical approach because it looks to conduct."
2015.15-6092,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1380.58,1386.625,"Well, you're -- you're entitled, probably required, to argue the cases as -- as we've written them, and you're -- and you're doing that."
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1386.625,1387.19,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-6092,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1387.19,1400.97,"It does seem to me that this -- we're living in a very artificial world. Does -- does Judge Kozinski's approach, as set forth in the Ninth Circuit in his separate opinion, what would be the result in your case if we used his approach?"
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1400.97,1406.745,"We would prevail, Your Honor. Judge Kozinski's approach is exactly the same as one of the questions Justice Kagan asked earlier --"
2015.15-6092,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1406.745,1406.95,Right.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1406.95,1420.615,-- which is you can look at the Shepard documents for the very limited purpose of figuring out what the elements of the State crime are to the extent there isn't dispositive State case law or other interpretive aids that the Court can use.
2015.15-6092,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1450.63,1450.82,This case --
2015.15-6092,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1450.82,1456.61,I'd like to try with one -- one -- what I'm trying to do is get the essence of your argument.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1456.61,1457.21,Trying to get it --
2015.15-6092,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1457.21,1459.7,And so you can just say I don't have it or I do have it.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1520.62,1520.78,"No, no."
2015.15-6092,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1522.04,1523.23,And that's what you're saying.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1567.61,1568.55,And the reason --
2015.15-6092,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1568.55,1569.88,Is that your basic argument?
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1569.88,1570.29,It is.
2015.15-6092,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1570.29,1570.48,Thank you.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1570.48,1574.33,"And the reason for that, Justice Breyer, is that it does not matter from --"
2015.15-6092,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1574.33,1576.08,Because it's not part of the crime.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1576.08,1577.23,It's not the crime.
2015.15-6092,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1577.23,1579.65,And what Congress wanted was crimes.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1579.65,1580.15,Was the crime.
2015.15-6092,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1580.15,1580.31,Okay.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1580.46,1582.17,And the difficulty of the government's position --
2015.15-6092,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1582.17,1582.23,No.
2015.15-6092,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1583.09,1584.47,"No, I appreciate it, Justice Breyer."
2015.15-6092,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1624.805,1634.675,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky."
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1634.675,1642.025,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: From Taylor forward, this Court has never adopted a means-elements distinction that turns on parsing State law."
2015.15-6092,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1680.58,1680.93,"Well, I'm not --"
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1680.93,1682.02,-- was it a federal offense or not.
2015.15-6092,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1682.02,1683.57,"-- sure that that's true, Ms. Saharsky."
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1715.325,1719.765,"Well, I think that it did make a difference to the Court's analysis, and what I would give you is an example."
2015.15-6092,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1756.52,1758.58,Assuming that the component is an element.
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1792.615,1796.21,"Well, two -- I think this is a critical question, and there are really two responses to it."
2015.15-6092,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1836.61,1849.905,"But you see, Descamps makes it quite clear that there's two different kinds of looking -- what Descamps says is you have to be able to say that a person was necessarily convicted of something."
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1849.905,1850.125,Okay.
2015.15-6092,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1850.125,1854.845,Meaning that the statute requires him to be convicted of something.
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1895.31,1895.595,Right.
2015.15-6092,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1895.595,1899.67,"The -- the dissent said, it's really terrible what the Court just did."
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1919.69,1920.37,Okay.
2015.15-6092,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1939.83,1941.85,"It's not just footnote 2, if I could just interrupt."
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1965.94,1966.44,Right.
2015.15-6092,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1997.36,1998.57,If you need to.
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1998.57,1998.98,Okay.
2015.15-6092,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2021.39,2032.63,"Well, here, you have a particular statute, a particular State -- excuse me -- a particular State court decision that says exactly what is an element and what is a means and that this is -- this is not an element."
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2032.63,2033.93,"Right, but I don't think --"
2015.15-6092,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2033.93,2039.09,So you don't need to look any further than a dispositive State court decision on the subject.
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2039.09,2040.89,A couple of -- a couple of responses.
2015.15-6092,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2124.4,2130.39,"Applying your approach now, how does Descamps come out? How does Descamps come out?"
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2130.39,2130.97,Same result.
2015.15-6092,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2151.01,2152.67,That -- that's stretching things.
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2165.115,2165.67,Well --
2015.15-6092,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2165.67,2172.81,"And he didn't stay a -- I'm sorry, a grocery store -- and he didn't stay unlawfully."
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2182.26,2182.575,Right.
2015.15-6092,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2182.575,2186.18,-- that often happens when you're relying on Shepard documents?
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2186.18,2186.565,Right.
2015.15-6092,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2257.06,2259.11,Here's what the statute doesn't do.
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2292.095,2292.61,Well --
2015.15-6092,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2292.61,2301.53,"And that's the critical thing under, not just Descamps, under all of these elements-based decisions, is that it doesn't matter what you did."
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2317.51,2322.71,"Well, I think that there are two different -- I think it's important to divide between the two different parts of the inquiry."
2015.15-6092,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2457.24,2457.59,What was --
2015.15-6092,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2457.59,2458.17,I think --
2015.15-6092,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2458.17,2471.99,What was the purpose for which the State may classify this as a means rather than an element? What was the context in which the State made that determination?
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2471.99,2497.79,"This question only arises when a person has been charged with more than one thing, so a burglary of a building and a boat, for example. And then the question is, if this goes to trial and the jury -- and it goes to the jury, does the jury unanimously have to find which he did, the house or the boat, or can the -- can six members find house and six members find boat? And so this -- this question actually just doesn't arise very much under State law."
2015.15-6092,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2572.36,2577.69,"Is this right? Is this like -- like even with the Massachusetts statute, the question has never come up."
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2629.345,2630.21,Well --
2015.15-6092,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2630.21,2632.81,Is that -- is that -- I have no idea of the answer to that question.
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2637.05,2640.135,"Well, I think there are two answers to that question."
2015.15-6092,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2805.29,2805.85,I'm sorry.
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2809.395,2809.975,Sure.
2015.15-6092,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2828.73,2845.34,"Which is to say that elements don't matter, and that's the thing that is contrary to 25 years of this Court's precedents, because if this Court's precedents say anything, they say that this is an elements-based inquiry, which means that we have to decide whether something is an element."
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2845.34,2859.48,"I -- and that's -- that's really, I think, the next thing I was -- I was hoping to say, which is that the reason that the Court has talked about elements as well as the statutory alternatives is because it wants to have an assurance that the person actually was convicted of generic burglary."
2015.15-6092,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2873.49,2876.04,But that sounds -- that sounds very fact-based.
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2924.975,2937.5,"Well, maybe I should clarify a little bit and say that we think that we look to see whether the law required that this finding be made in reality in this case, not hypothetically in some different case."
2015.15-6092,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2966.28,2996.15,"But the point of the modified categorical approach is to take a truly divisible statute -- in other words, a statute with three separate elements in it, of which you only need to be convicted of one -- and to figure out whether the one that you were convicted of, the one particular element, matches up with the generic offense. It's not to do anything more than that. Descamps is quite clear on this -- on this matter, that it takes -- it's -- it's three separate elements."
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3001.82,3008.2,I think that we're in agreement to the extent that we're talking about matching the statutory alternatives with the generic Federal offense.
2015.15-6092,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3008.2,3019.47,"Except that you say ""statutory alternatives,"" and I say ""elements,"" because for 25 years we've been saying ""elements,"" and that we can't do this inquiry if we're in the world of nonelemental facts."
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3019.47,3021.79,"Well, frankly, I think the Court has said both things."
2015.15-6092,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3028.76,3031.42,Elements are what defines the crime.
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3031.42,3032.18,Right.
2015.15-6092,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3239.52,3276.88,"Well, the end of footnote 2 said in some cases you won't need to parse State law because you can figure it out from the Shepard documents, because Shepard documents are a clue to whether something is a means or an element. And so in the situation in which State law is not, as it is in this case, utterly clear on the subject, you won't have to go 1,000 layers down, because the Descamps -- the -- the Shepard documents will tell you, because of the way the prosecutor has charged something, looks like this is just a means, or looks like this is really an element."
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3276.88,3283.84,"Well, I mean, we don't think you need to do the State law inquiry in the first place, because the Shepard documents will tell you that the person actually was convicted of that."
2015.15-6092,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3285.82,3290.705,"Well, why wouldn't you look to State law? You have a State law that says exactly that this is not an element."
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3292.05,3299.29,Because -- because it doesn't matter that that case is about what would happen to a different defendant in a case where more than one thing is charged.
2015.15-6092,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3321.65,3322.32,The only --
2015.15-6092,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3322.32,3335.065,"Why is it conviction-based not -- rather than conduct-based? It's conviction-based, it's okay; conduct-based isn't. Conduct charge is burgling a house."
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3335.065,3336.4,Right.
2015.15-6092,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3369.255,3369.47,It --
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3369.47,3370.035,And I --
2015.15-6092,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3370.035,3370.74,Please.
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3370.74,3383.72,"Just -- just one other point, which is: I think it's really telling that the reason that the Court adopted -- and let's go back to where this started, right? It's: What does burglary mean under the ACCA? And the Court adopted the burglary definition it did, which is generic burglary, because it encompassed the definitions in most States."
2015.15-6092,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3422.335,3427.895,Here you have a State statute that specifically tells you that this is not an element of the offense.
2015.15-6092,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3445.445,3447.71,Could I respond? I -- I don't think that's true.
2015.15-6092,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3462.76,3465.475,"Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Fleming."
2015.15-6092,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3465.475,3490.91,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. What has been on the books for 25 years is this Court's statement in Taylor that the categorical approach turns on ""the elements of the statute of conviction."" Or as the Court put it in Moncrieffe, ""what facts are necessarily established by a conviction for the State offense."" It's been very clear from my colleague's argument that the government is interested in what Mr. Mathis did, and that is not what ACCA looks to."
2015.15-6092,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3579.73,3590.2,You're seriously arguing that -- you're seriously arguing that all of the States will or should go back and reformulate their burglary statutes so as --
2015.15-6092,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3590.2,3590.51,"No, Your Honor."
2015.15-6092,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3590.51,3592.41,"-- to make the conviction? Well, that's what you just said."
2015.15-6092,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3599.33,3612.975,"As -- as some States have generic burglary statutes that do require proof of all the elements of generic burglary, if Congress is dissatisfied with the reach of ACCA, it can amend ACCA. ACCA used to have a definition of burglary in it in 1984."
2015.15-6092,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3635.79,3644.495,"What do you make of the fact that until this case, the Court has never analyzed whether something was an element or a means?"
2015.15-6092,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3644.495,3648.805,The -- the same point could have been made in Descamps.
2015.15-6092,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3650.02,3663.27,"Well, you said this has been established for 25 years and the Court has used the term element, element, element, but has it ever before gone into the question of whether what it was talking about in that particular case was in the technical sense, either an element or a means?"
2015.15-6092,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3663.27,3673.67,"May I respond, Mr. Chief Justice? The issue did not come up before Descamps. So as the previous cases came to the Court, the issue either did not matter or it was not disputed."
