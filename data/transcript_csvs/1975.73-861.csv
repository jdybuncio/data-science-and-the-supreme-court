1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,50.761,55.017,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court and may it please the Court.
1975.73-861,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,68.639,75.747,"When that white signal goes on, you will know that that is the signal to save time for rebuttal."
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,75.747,92.28,"Before getting to the discussion of the issues, facts and circumstances in this case, I dig two points [Voice Overlap] to consider and keep in mind while you are considering the issues and the facts and circumstances of this case."
1975.73-861,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,410.632,412.452,It was authorizing Legislation was not it?
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,414.889,415.22,Yes that is correct Your Honor.
1975.73-861,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,415.22,417.818,Authorized the School Boards to do this if they wanted do?
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,417.818,421.525,"That is correct, it did not mandate At-Large District, it made it permissive."
1975.73-861,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,421.525,424.508,"That is what I thought and that was true on both acts, both for the School Board and the Police Jury?"
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,424.508,425.068,That is correct.
1975.73-861,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,460.691,468.158,"Mr. Ward, tell me about a Police Jury that it have the same as I did generally as a County Board of Supervisors?"
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,468.158,471.685,"Generally speaking, Justice Powell, I would say yes."
1975.73-861,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,474.801,476.952,But it has a power to levy taxes?
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,476.952,477.933,Yes Sir.
1975.73-861,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,477.933,480.886,It is the only governing body in the parish?
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,480.886,493.689,It is the only governing body in the parish except for the School Board which has complete and sole jurisdiction over the School System for the parish and any town council which may be in a town or village.
1975.73-861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,573.628,576.989,"That was an At-Large plan, that was residential requirement?"
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,576.989,577.875,That is correct.
1975.73-861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,593.353,594.438,Who requested that?
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,594.438,595.353,"The district judge, Your Honor."
1975.73-861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,595.353,598.314,Who had retained jurisdiction?
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,598.314,598.702,No sir.
1975.73-861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,607.237,608.874,Well and he must have [Voice Overlap]
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,608.874,609.939,That is right that is prior to --
1975.73-861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,609.939,610.823,[Voice Overlap] a new lawsuit?
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,610.823,621.909,"That is correct and required them to update, they did simply by filing the same plan, the '70 census figures did not affect the one man, one vote because it was an At-Large System."
1975.73-861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,621.909,624.215,So did he enter a new order?
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,624.215,635.267,"At that point the present intervene respondent, intervened Mr. Marshall and complaining of Fifteenth Amendment discrimination and dilution of the black vote."
1975.73-861,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,765.551,768.038,So it was a constitutional holding?
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,768.038,775.135,"Constitutional, yes sir, that was a constitutional holding based primarily on white versus registered."
1975.73-861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,795.062,817.936,Mr. Ward was your -- what was the judges' answer to contentions in a District Court or that -- without even getting the constitutional issues that the preference is for single member districts when a Court is fashioning a real question for him?
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,817.936,824.361,"I may have partially beg ignorance Your Honor, I did not represent the petitioner either at the District Court or the Court of Appeals."
1975.73-861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,824.361,830.012,"Well is not that -- that is -- this Court has said that is the normal rules, is not it?"
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,830.012,830.606,That is correct.
1975.73-861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,830.606,841.605,"Although Multi-Member Districts are not, necessarily are not per se unconstitutional if a Court has to come up with a plan or approval plan and that the preference is for single member districts?"
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,841.605,855.658,"Well, I think you did say it in Connor versus Johnson that when a Court fashions a plan, it may not have been Connor versus Johnson, that it should prefer single member districts although I do still -- I do not yet understand that preference."
1975.73-861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,855.658,862.869,"Well, it may I may not be of understanding what I asked you was what was the District Court's answer to that?"
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,862.869,881.931,"That -- his answer to that was that if the issue was raised at the District Court level that -- regardless of that preference and if there was proof that the other plan was unconstitutional, there was no need for him to draw a single member district plan."
1975.73-861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,883.953,887.229,I know but it -- put into effect by a court order?
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,887.229,888.233,"That is correct, yes sir."
1975.73-861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,888.233,890.261,It was not a piece of legislation?
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,890.261,892.94,"Yes, well, that is a contention in this suit."
1975.73-861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,893.253,896.938,"Well, now it is not a piece of legislation, it was a court ordered plan?"
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,896.938,901.577,The court ordered the Police Jury and the School Board to adopt.
1975.73-861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,901.577,902.371,That is exactly.
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,902.371,904.57,"And submit to it a plan, which they did."
1975.73-861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,904.57,907.031,"Which they did, which is normal in reapportionment cases."
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,910.363,912.739,And he accepted their plan as being as constitutional.
1975.73-861,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,912.739,918.032,"The School Board and the Police Jury had legislative authority to do it, did they not?"
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,918.032,918.759,There would be a --
1975.73-861,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,918.759,921.563,If you are really authorizing Acts of the State Legislature?
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,921.563,935.47,"If you go purely technically at the time this case was decided in the District Court the Attorney General’s objection to the permissive legislation was still in effect and had not -- it was not withdrawn until '72, so those State statutes were no in effect?"
1975.73-861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,935.47,938.257,And they have no legislative authority to do.
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,944.621,952.154,"That would be correct and that is correct, Your Honor and the Court approved the plan as being constitutional over the objections that it is discriminating."
1975.73-861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,963.158,977.597,Well was that urged in the -- was it urged in the Court of Appeals that single member districts should have been put in because the preference expressed by this Court for single member districts in court ordered plan?
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,977.597,978.922,It was raised Your Honor.
1975.73-861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,986.048,991.098,While the case was pending in the Court of Appeals did the District Court tried to change its order?
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,991.098,992.555,"Yes, Your Honor, it did."
1975.73-861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,992.555,996.461,And that did not it put it in single member districts while the case was pending in the Court of Appeals?
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,996.461,997.342,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.73-861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,997.342,999.212,And what did the Court of Appeals say about that?
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,999.212,1004.727,"That once the case was on appeal, the District Court no longer had jurisdiction to enter a new order."
1975.73-861,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1004.727,1007.336,That was the panel decision though of the Court of Appeals.
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,1011.907,1030.048,"In the en banc as I recall -- if they have mentioned it all; it was barely in passing because they have decided apparently that they were going to reverse the At-Large plan, so really there was no need for them to particularly consider that question."
1975.73-861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1030.048,1041.195,"And when they would not have any need for one, they will even have an en banc hearing if the District Court was already ready to put in a Single-Member District Plan?"
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,1041.195,1045.727,But does a District Court have jurisdiction to issue orders once the case is on appeal.
1975.73-861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1058.573,1070.158,As the case come to us we are talking to the validity of a District Court order that the district judge who wants to scrap and has tried to scrap?
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,1070.158,1072.536,I would respectfully submit that on all the rules [Voice Overlap]
1975.73-861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1072.536,1083.778,"Well, is not that true that is the fact, I agree with you that the Court of Appeals has set in that -- it had -- that district judge had no authority?"
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,1083.778,1095.695,Apparently somebody convinced him without a hearing or anything that perhaps the state of decisions that have come down since the original order commanded Single-Member Districts.
1975.73-861,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1105.937,1121.882,Is there anything in the record Mr. Ward that indicates one way or the other whether the District Court’s second order was entered with or without a hearing?
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,1121.882,1151.296,"You will not find a new motion [Voice Overlap] in the record after the original complaint was filed. In his brief he attaches the order of the court, but he does not attach any new motion or is there any in the record that I was able to find or any notice of the hearing to be set and according to the information given me by the then Assistant District Attorney who was handling it, nobody knew about it till in it was issued."
1975.73-861,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1151.296,1160.888,Does the order itself shed any light on that with the preamble statement as to how the order happened to be entered?
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,1160.888,1166.746,Your Honor as I recall the --
1975.73-861,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1166.746,1180.641,"Usually if there is a hearing it recites the fact of the hearing, does it not or is that a Louisiana practice?"
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,1180.641,1183.572,"All it says, I willl read the very beginning --"
1975.73-861,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1183.572,1185.137,"Excuse me, Mr. ward, where are you reading from?"
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,1185.137,1198.339,"I am reading from respondent's brief, page 1AA of appendix."
1975.73-861,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1267.681,1285.61,"Mr. Ward while we are talking about procedural problems here, you mentioned in your brief, at least if I read it correctly that there has been change in the relative strength of the black versus white voting population, is that in the record and what is the support for that in your brief?"
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,1285.61,1297.215,My authority for that change in registered voters comes from a letter from the registrar of voters as I requested him to let me know what was his registration.
1975.73-861,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1324.835,1329.65,"If you think it would be appropriate for the whole case to go back to the District Court and start over, is that what you really saying?"
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,1329.65,1331.231,"No sir, I am saying I do not think you should."
1975.73-861,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1391.464,1401.588,"But Mr. Ward, which are the circumstances we should base that decision on, an assumption that the blacks outnumber the whites or the whites outnumber the blacks in the voting arena?"
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,1401.588,1404.073,"The respondent here, the complainant --"
1975.73-861,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1404.073,1407.365,What is the factual basis on which you want us to make that decision?
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,1412.949,1424.753,"I think on the basis that I think if there is a problem with doing it on the basis of the record, the Court should permit the record to be updated with regard to the present facts as to -- [Voice Overlap]"
1975.73-861,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1424.753,1429.816,And you think that the updating should be done in this Court rather than the District Court?
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,1429.816,1433.454,"In the essence of time, I would say yes, Your Honor."
1975.73-861,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1464.302,1466.662,And we do not either?[Laughter]
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,1466.662,1468.843,But you have to make the decision as to what --
1975.73-861,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1468.843,1471.071,"Well, how can we, if we do not know?"
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,1471.071,1483.798,"Well, as to those facts, if you want to send it back to the District Court or to permit to us to supplement the record with the exact facts, that may be the proper thing to do."
1975.73-861,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1501.045,1501.997,You said it (Inaudible)
1975.73-861,0,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,1501.997,1512.621,"-- by saying, I do not necessarily disagree with government’s position as to the use of Section 5 and that plans should be submitted."
1975.73-861,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1661.463,1663.123,"Very well, Mr. Ward."
1975.73-861,1,41524,stanley_a_halpin_jr,,1665.081,1668.879,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.73-861,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1759.625,1775.684,"Mr. Halpin you are telling us that for is that we are not in any position to get into resolving the contest over the facts here, unless at some point you would both agree on facts which could be judicially noticed?"
1975.73-861,1,41524,stanley_a_halpin_jr,,1775.684,1776.707,Precisely Your Honor.
1975.73-861,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1801.062,1807.822,"Along that same line, can you shed any light on whether or not there was notice in the hearing in connection with Judge Dawkin's order of (Voice Overlap)"
1975.73-861,1,41524,stanley_a_halpin_jr,,1807.822,1810.894,"Yes sir, that is what I was going to refer to."
1975.73-861,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1844.46,1846.843,And while it was an appeal?
1975.73-861,1,41524,stanley_a_halpin_jr,,1846.843,1848.47,After appeal had been noticed.
1975.73-861,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1849.46,1855.438,What is your position on whether the District Court -- I take it you felt the District Court had jurisdiction (Voice Overlap)
1975.73-861,1,41524,stanley_a_halpin_jr,,1855.438,1898.529,"(Voice Overlap) I think the -- if we are dealing with injunctive matter, particularly in elections where you have a great deal of flux that certainly District Court has the right to modify an injunction to meet present circumstances and change in law or whatever and that, particularly in this case there are procedures which we indicated in a footnote in our brief that at least eight of the circuits agree that in situations as this where the district judge is changing his mind, the proper procedure is for the district judge to indicate his difference and then to the Court of Appeals to remand to give him an opportunity to (Voice Overlap)"
1975.73-861,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1898.529,1900.782,(Voice Overlap) did you said the other side?
1975.73-861,1,41524,stanley_a_halpin_jr,,1900.782,1903.578,"If I filed the motion, I did, serving on the other side, Your Honor."
1975.73-861,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1903.578,1906.215,"Well, I did not say he did not know about it till that came back?"
1975.73-861,1,41524,stanley_a_halpin_jr,,1906.215,1926.786,"Well, Mr. Ward was not counsel then, so I think he was saying he does not know, but I will be glad to supply the court with whatever was filed or indicate the letter that no motion was filed, but my recollection, although that was five years ago, my recollection is that I did file something and my practice as an attorney is always to serve or file a motion to serve an (Voice Overlap)"
1975.73-861,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1926.786,1939.553,"Well, I think it is because the Court of Appeals had before it the district judge’s second order and decided that they would either -- could not or would not consider it because in their view he had no jurisdiction?"
1975.73-861,1,41524,stanley_a_halpin_jr,,1939.553,1952.942,They mean that he is out of jurisdiction just in regard and I think the proper procedure at that stage would have been to remand the case so that perhaps within (Voice Overlap)
1975.73-861,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1952.942,1962.339,What was the district judge’s answer to Connor against -- Connor v. Johnson claim that Single-Member Districts were to be preferred when the Court adopted the plan?

1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3125.583,3144.195,"Your Honor, I think it is a question of judicial administration which if we are correct in our position that the courts below should not have considered the plans submitted to them prior to pre-clearance then we think that the --"
1975.73-861,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3144.195,3146.938,It is like a jurisdictional question?
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3146.938,3155.713,"It is in the nature of a not subject matter jurisdiction, but of a primary jurisdiction as we suggest in our brief."
1975.73-861,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3155.713,3168.434,"Ordinarily, though we do not even let one of the parties argue an issue that was not read or raised in the questions presented in a certiorari -- here you are amicus and you are seeking to alter it?"
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3168.434,3180.025,Your Honor this court has on its own raised questions where it felt that principles judicial administration required the court to do so.
1975.73-861,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3180.025,3183.737,There is a difference between arguing an amicus grant of grant of the Court?
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3183.737,3186.098,That is correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1975.73-861,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3215.349,3223.159,"Well, that is also a little -- it is also the question you want to raise seems to run against the grain of our prior cases?"
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3223.159,3231.547,"Well, I think that is the question that I would like to discuss because I do not believe that it does."
1975.73-861,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3288.089,3295.025,"Oh! Yes, but the fact remains that once the plan was issued by the District Court the locality administered it?"
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3295.025,3296.674,It was required to.
1975.73-861,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3296.674,3298.001,"Well, it did administer it, did it not?"
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3298.001,3299.46,It did administer it.
1975.73-861,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3301.112,3306.354,And nevertheless it could administer the plan without going to the Attorney General?
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3306.354,3309.209,That is what this Court held and we have no --
1975.73-861,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3309.209,3310.219,I am not sure you agree with that?
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3310.219,3310.534,No.
1975.73-861,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3408.827,3424.749,"What if the District Court here, Mr. Landsberg, had done just what it did, but there had been no appeal taken from it is judgment and then it became final, would you still say that there was a litigatable violation of Section 5?"
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3424.749,3431.426,"Well, it has been -- it has been held that there is by the Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia, sir."
1975.73-861,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3431.426,3433.433,In this circuit here?
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3433.433,3435.062,Yes.
1975.73-861,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3435.062,3437.355,Even though the District Court judgment is final?
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3437.355,3453.051,Yes and we would prefer to avoid that situation where the Attorney General is called upon a required to review a statute which the District Court has already approved.
1975.73-861,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3499.035,3539.991,"What would you say -- what would you say if the rule should be under Section 5, if the court enters a declaratory judgment, a reapportionment plan in existence is unconstitutional and request the parties, both sides to submit plans and suppose the Attorney General of the State has been in court defending the state plan and he goes back and confers with his legislative colleagues and he comes back to the court with plan and submits it as the states official suggestion to the court for a plan and the other party of course comes back with a plan too."
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3550.782,3551.43,Waller.
1975.73-861,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3573.73,3574.616,What did you say?
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3574.616,3586.327,I think that ordinarily the court would first ask or give the opportunity for the state or political subdivision to formulate a plan.
1975.73-861,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3586.327,3591.353,"Not when, not when there is a -- the legislature is not about to meet before the next election?"
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3591.353,3595.151,Well if we are in an emergency type situation that is true.
1975.73-861,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3595.151,3596.394,"Well, that is not the time?"
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3596.394,3596.815,That is true.
1975.73-861,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3599.403,3638.697,"But how is in a situation Mr. Justice White posed, the Attorney General has been party to litigation and a litigation has resulted in invalidation of the existing legislative reapportionment plan and the request was made to the parties to submit a plan and the Attorney General says, well, if you are going to have a plan, try this one, not something that legislature adopts, but something that he formulates and he submits the plan and that plan is then is adopted by the District Court, is that a -- is that wrong under Johnson?"
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3638.697,3640.697,We think it is wrong under the Voting Rights Act.
1975.73-861,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3646.798,3653.748,"Or is it a Waller situation when not the state legislature, but the Attorney General formulates and submits the plan?"
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3653.748,3662.167,It is an attempt by the state in the person of it is counsel to administer a change.
1975.73-861,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3662.167,3664.193,So make out a Waller situation?
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3664.193,3700.093,"Yes, and I think that that if one looks at the purpose of the Voting Rights Act, the situation which led to it is enactment that the procedures of the Voting Rights Act were intended to apply not just to actions which the state took legislatively, but also to Voting Practices which might be imposed without the authority of state law perhaps by local officials or by local Police juries or School Boards."
1975.73-861,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3700.093,3721.75,"Suppose the State responds in the example of Mr. Justice Brennan and I were talking about, respondent submits a plan and the court says “Well, there is some good parts to that, but some good parts to the other side too and I am going to put them together and it drafts it is own plan, and it is got -- it is half and half, half state, half the other party.”"
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3729.82,3730.727,That is right.
1975.73-861,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3730.727,3747.301,"So that the states order, the court’s order would be invalid because in part it rested on a state -- in part of a state profit plan, that is a very usual situation, you know?"
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3747.301,3780.878,"But the court should not rely on the state's plan until that plan has been pre-cleared, that is what -- I think Congress very clearly stated in saying that Section 5 is intended to establish, this is on page 19 of our brief, a form of primary jurisdiction for Section 5 review under which courts dealing with voting discrimination issues should defer in the first instance to the Attorney General or to the District of Columbia District Court."
1975.73-861,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3780.878,3805.285,"Well, by court that you say, I gather, your submission is that a District Judge not having any legislative plan to propose to replace an invalidated legislative plan can formulate his own and not require -- where pre-clearance could not be required only if whatever he formulates has no input at all from the State?"
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3805.285,3807.64,"No, I would not think we would go that far, I think --"
1975.73-861,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3807.64,3808.643,I thought what you just saying --
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3808.643,3819.846,"No, I think that when the plaintiff presents a plan, certainly the state would as a party to the case have an opportunity to comment on any proposals that were made."
1975.73-861,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3824.312,3837.303,"Well this -- the congressional report is the report to which you refer to says that “Where the District Court directs an entity to adopt, to a adopt a new plan and present it to the court for consideration.”"
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3848.493,3850.242,I think that it would cover that as well.
1975.73-861,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3850.242,3852.343,It is not adopting a plan; it does not even purport to adopt a plan?
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3852.343,3872.901,"Well, we get the situation and in this case we have two sets of resolutions, one of which says the School Board and Police Jury adopt reapportionment plan and then the next time a resolution is passed by the Police Jury and the School Board saying “We propose this plan.”"
1975.73-861,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3883.069,3890.163,Do I understand you to say that the court could or could not develop a plan on it is own motion?
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3890.163,3902.253,I think that can only be done as I understand this court’s decisions where there is some sort of an emergency situation it has been unable to get an acceptable plan from the jurisdiction.
1975.73-861,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3919.84,3937.505,"Well, if the court was going to develop a plan on it is own motion, would you think the intervention or suggestions from counsel for the State would then make that something other than the court’s plan for an emergency?"
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3937.505,3942.935,I think it would depend upon the nature of the input.
1975.73-861,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3942.935,3952.398,"Well, is not the Attorney General of a State an officer of the court on whom that court is always is entitled to call for suggestions and assistance?"
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3952.398,3965.364,"Well, he is, but he is also an officer of the State and counsel for the State and is representing the State in seeking to -- permission to administer the plan."
1975.73-861,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3965.364,3968.115,"Your time is up, but I think Justice Stevens had a question for you."
1975.73-861,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3968.115,3968.479,I did.
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3986.731,3989.159,A memorandum in effect objecting to --
1975.73-861,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3989.159,3997.276,"Objecting and saying we think the plan the court is to adopt should have features A, B, and C in it?"
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,3997.276,4001.257,"Well, I think that that would be -- that would be a close case."
1975.73-861,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4001.257,4004.705,So it just goes to the form of the submission by the (Voice Overlap)
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,4004.705,4009.105,What I am trying to suggest that it ought not to be governed by the forum.
1975.73-861,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4025.306,4029.398,"So anybody can submit anything to the judge, but the State?"
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,4029.398,4035.104,"Well, that would -- we are talking about the unusual situation where the --"
1975.73-861,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4035.104,4037.733,"In the unusual, in your situation --"
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,4037.733,4039.734,The state may comment on what (Voice Overlap)
1975.73-861,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4039.734,4043.519,The judge can look for advise to everybody in the world except the state?
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,4043.519,4048.17,The court may look to the state for comments on what the other parties have submitted.
1975.73-861,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4048.17,4054.999,"Well, suppose the comment is I do not agree with that because I agree this, they could not take this?"
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,4054.999,4062.718,"Well there again, I think we are getting into a close area where one would have to look at the actual document that has been filed."
1975.73-861,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4062.718,4072.568,"When you are suggesting it, it sounds like when a declaratory judgment is entered the Attorney General should retire the case for a fear of poisoning his holding decrees?"
1975.73-861,2,17837,brian_k_landsberg,,4072.568,4073.308,I think not.
1975.73-861,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4097.501,4098.578,Thank you Mr. Landsberg.
1975.73-861,3,33615,john_f_ward_jr,,4105.845,4107.823,I will be very brief Your Honor.
1975.73-861,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4136.907,4137.988,Or any part of it?
