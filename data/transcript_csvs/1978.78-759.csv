1978.78-759,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,73.915,We'll hear arguments next in Leroy against Great Western United Corporation.
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,96.242,97.298,Mr. Chief Justice --
1978.78-759,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,97.298,98.434,Mr. Heiser.
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,98.434,101.306,-- and may it please the Court.
1978.78-759,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,380.041,387.427,Was the sole basis of this claim of fact that the federal law preempted the Idaho law?
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,387.427,403.81,"No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the basis for the constitutional challenge was preemption on the one hand, and on the other hand that the Idaho law and the Maryland and New York law is unduly burdened interstate commerce, and were therefore forbidden on that ground as well."
1978.78-759,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,403.81,420.184,I suppose the mere existence of an Idaho statute which might ultimately be determined to preempt -- to be preempted by a federal statute wouldn't mean that the state official charged with administering would be “violating” the federal statute within Section 27?
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,420.184,423.427,Mr. Justice Rehnquist that is exactly our contention.
1978.78-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,454.38,456.945,That's one -- on what basis for jurisdiction?
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,456.945,460.502,That is the federal securities law basis for jurisdiction.
1978.78-759,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,739.163,751.108,"Mr. Heiser, what if this case had arisen with a plaintiff as one who is contending that the takeover should not be permitted because the corporation had not complied with the Idaho statute?"
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,769.719,784.548,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist if it were procedurally proper to entertain the lawsuit in the Northern District of Texas, there is absolutely no reason why the Idaho law could not be assessed as it affected someone in the Northern District of Texas."
1978.78-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,809.171,821.326,"But I suppose New York and Maryland would, on your basis, would have the same objection to jurisdiction in Idaho as you are placing -- objecting to in Texas?"
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,821.326,833.169,"Mr. Justice White that is absolutely correct and in fact, New York and Maryland very strenuously did object to the jurisdiction and venue being based in Texas, as I'm sure they would have, had it been based in Idaho."
1978.78-759,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,833.169,846.272,"But you wouldn't go so far as to say that given all the other necessary requirements of federal jurisdiction and venue, only the Federal District Court sitting in Idaho could hold an Idaho statute preempted by a federal statute."
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,846.272,850.573,"No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist that is not what I'm -- would not be my contention."
1978.78-759,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1053.423,1056.724,Let me ask you a question in two stages.
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1086.49,1117.491,"Mr. Chief Justice under the terms of the Texas long-arm statute where you had defined within the doing business context of that statute, a contract to be performed in whole or in part in Texas, it is quite likely that he Federal District Court in Texas would have proper jurisdiction over that action so long as it did not fall within the proscription of U-Anchor Advertising, Inc. versus Burt."
1978.78-759,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1117.491,1137.674,"Now eliminate the Texas statute from the hypothetical and have the same loan made, financial statement submitted and it turned out that the financial statements were allegedly false."
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1142.522,1145.972,"Under the general venue statute, Your Honor?"
1978.78-759,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1169.45,1179.151,"-- a false statement was rendered, a false statement was delivered to Texas, to the bank, rather the lender."
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1181.078,1199.855,"That is, you have there a situation of a weight of context problem, where one of the acts in furtherance -- if that is the operative fact, the fault statement and its transmission into Texas, then yes."
1978.78-759,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1213.186,1215.759,"Well there's no question about it being in Idaho, but the borrower --"
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1215.759,1219.819,"Well, it will be in Idaho under defendants where the defendants resided."
1978.78-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1254.367,1262.222,"Well Mr. Heiser, are we talking now about venue or jurisdiction, and are we talking if jurisdiction over the person or over the subject matter?"
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1272.387,1276.509,Mr. Justice Stewart that has been one of the problems of this case from the beginning.
1978.78-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1276.509,1276.709,"Well it is been your contention, I gather."
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1276.709,1284.571,It's been our contention that there are several distinct criteria which must be met.
1978.78-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1286.145,1286.954,Must be met what?
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1288.818,1295.567,Must be met under the Constitution as well -- well there are criteria that must be met under the Constitution.
1978.78-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1295.567,1296.066,Yes.
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1296.066,1297.394,Due process standards.
1978.78-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1297.394,1297.781,Yes.
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1297.781,1312.191,"There are three criteria which must be met under the Federal Securities Act, jurisdiction and venue provision and there are special criteria which must be met under the Texas long-arm statute."
1978.78-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1363.362,1371.884,"Its subject -- it's a personal jurisdiction over the Idaho officials, which is the big threshold issue here isn't it?"
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1371.884,1372.922,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1978.78-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1372.922,1377.302,"And it's personal jurisdiction over them, not subject matter jurisdiction over the case."
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1385.274,1388.525,Mr. Justice Stewart that is absolutely correct.
1978.78-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1405.361,1408.772,"Well, let's assume they violated the Act."
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1410.648,1411.267,There still is the --
1978.78-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1411.267,1413.611,"-- is whether or not the court had personal jurisdiction over them, isn't it?"
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1413.611,1415.208,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1978.78-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1419.567,1424.307,"But if there was a violation then there's nationwide service, isn't there?"
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1424.307,1425.383,Mr. Justice White that --
1978.78-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1425.383,1433.775,"Let's just assume there was a violation by the Idaho officers, and I don't suggest that they're -- that I think there was."
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1439.162,1440.769,Mr. Justice White that is correct.
1978.78-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1445.118,1448.509,Does that -- wouldn't that give personal jurisdiction?
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1448.509,1457.693,That would give personal jurisdiction in a court where the due process standards were properly applied.
1978.78-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1457.693,1458.699,Right.
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1458.699,1461.841,"And there again, we go to the crux of the argument."
1978.78-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1481.484,1488.599,"Anybody can be served by a federal court, the only meets and bounds of our nation."
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1488.599,1490.366,Absolutely Mr. Justice Stewart.
1978.78-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1498.666,1499.023,Well then is that a matter --
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1499.023,1500.231,And that's the crux --
1978.78-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1500.231,1502.584,That's a matter of venue then?
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1502.584,1511.675,That is a matter of the -- it's a matter of whether one wants to call it venue or proper assertion of personal jurisdiction.
1978.78-759,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1518.629,1536.742,"Well, what if Congress says in so many words that if there has been a violation of the Act, as Mr. Justice White's question to assume, process may be served and personal jurisdiction may be obtained in any one of the 93 judicial districts in the United States?"
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1536.742,1560.625,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, if that is what the statute said, then I would still try to be here before you saying that that statute in assessing personal jurisdiction on such a broad scope was missing the very important due process requirement that allows the federal court to hear the case in the first place."
1978.78-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1560.625,1570.343,Well would you say that even in a case where the prosecution or the action arose in a case where the alleged violation occurred?
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1570.343,1571.678,"Mr. Justice White, no."
1978.78-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1571.678,1572.117,"Of course you wouldn't, it --"
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1572.117,1573.634,That's the whole point.
1978.78-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1573.634,1584.731,"And so if the violation occurs in State A, and the federal law says that you can serve anybody connected with this case anywhere in the country, you wouldn't object to that?"
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1584.731,1587.286,"Absolutely not Your Honor, and that's the whole point."
1978.78-759,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1600.444,1605.173,And that doesn't determine where the venue is going to lie.
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1605.173,1607.237,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.78-759,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1619.289,1622.962,"And all of these colloquies address to the federal statute, is it not?"
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1622.962,1623.639,All of this is --
1978.78-759,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1623.639,1623.687,"No, our case is involves --"
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1623.687,1626.43,-- directed to jurisdiction under Section 27 of the Security Exchange Act.
1978.78-759,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1626.43,1630.779,Our case involves the Texas statute doesn't it?
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1630.779,1640.0,"That was one basis for jurisdiction, and the other basis -- the one basis for jurisdiction over the state officials was Section 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934."
1978.78-759,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1657.634,1666.932,"Well don't you agree that if your opponents can sustain either one of those, the Court of Appeals was correct?"
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1666.932,1673.419,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist if, if this Court would sustain either one of those then the Court of Appeals was correct, but it's our --"
1978.78-759,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1673.419,1675.575,They're independent basis of jurisdiction.
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1675.575,1677.162,Absolutely Your Honor.
1978.78-759,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1713.136,1723.439,But that -- that's answering the question that Mr. Justice White earlier asked you to assume.
1978.78-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1759.041,1759.887,In Texas.
1978.78-759,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1759.887,1761.614,In Texas?
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1761.614,1763.688,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, yes."
1978.78-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1779.144,1787.634,"Well Mr. Heiser, in so far as you are having violated the statute or not, and I don't suggest one way or another."
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1802.181,1805.893,"You have violated it, Mr. Justice White, any place in the United States."
1978.78-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1805.893,1806.522,Exactly.
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1806.522,1807.967,But the venue would not necessarily --
1978.78-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1807.967,1809.813,"If you violated it at all, but you say that --"
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1809.813,1813.286,"If you violated it at all, but then you would not necessarily be proper in the United States then you're back to venue."
1978.78-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1813.286,1817.69,I understand.
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1817.69,1819.037,I reserve the rest of my time.
1978.78-759,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1819.037,1822.211,"Mr. Heiser before you sit down, just to detail."
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1827.37,1832.687,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, it's my contention the Attorney General is properly here."
1978.78-759,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1869.508,1881.782,"Speaking of Attorney's General, I think in your brief, you have ex parte Young as the Attorney General of Minnesota, sometimes we at Minnesota might be glad to yield that Michigan as you've described it."
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1886.093,1886.93,"In the summary of argument, my --"
1978.78-759,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1886.93,1888.298,-- the Attorney General of Minnesota.
1978.78-759,0,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,1888.298,1901.926,"In the summary of argument, my printer got Michigan and there -- in my argument he did it right in Minnesota."
1978.78-759,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1901.926,1907.115,Mrs. Juviler.
1978.78-759,1,16311,amy_juviler,,1907.115,1910.768,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.78-759,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2024.555,2035.819,"Mrs. Juviler, your friend Mr. Heiser in response to Justice Blackmun said very definitely, the appellant is here."
1978.78-759,1,16311,amy_juviler,,2053.532,2059.172,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that appellant Kidwell could."
1978.78-759,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2173.31,2181.204,"You don't deny that a private citizen could be made subject to suit anywhere in the United States by Congress, do you?"
1978.78-759,1,16311,amy_juviler,,2181.204,2190.742,"No, of course Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I don't deny that it would be possible for Congress to establish nationwide service over state officials."
1978.78-759,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2204.576,2218.284,"But if Congress just said in so many words there should be nationwide service of process on everyone who is alleged to have violated statute when didn't purport to make any finding of reasonableness, they just -- this is what the law is going to be?"
1978.78-759,1,16311,amy_juviler,,2218.284,2226.024,"If Congress had done that, and well one of the basic questions, you used the word violate and it has been used here a great many times."
1978.78-759,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2345.518,2349.967,"You know us better than to think we would want to manipulate statute, Mrs. Juviler."
1978.78-759,1,16311,amy_juviler,,2349.967,2359.821,I used the wrong -- well we feel that it's very difficult to look at the decisions below and not think that the laws of jurisdiction and venue have been manipulated.
1978.78-759,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2512.441,2514.577,"Your time has expired now, Mrs. Juviler."
1978.78-759,1,16311,amy_juviler,,2514.577,2519.381,Thank you very much.
1978.78-759,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2519.381,2521.185,Mr. Irwin.
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,2521.185,2524.579,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.78-759,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2697.768,2708.127,"And the coverage of the Idaho statute was of a corporations with their principle place of business in Idaho, corporations incorporated in Idaho and what else?"
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,2708.127,2710.161,Having substantial assets in Idaho.
1978.78-759,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2710.161,2712.005,And this is principle place of business?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,2712.005,2714.311,This was principle place of business and assets.
1978.78-759,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2717.622,2719.908,No question of the -- as to the coverage of the --
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,2719.908,2721.423,No question that it was covered.
1978.78-759,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2745.289,2746.185,May I ask you a question before you go ahead?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,2746.185,2747.962,Yes.
1978.78-759,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2747.962,2753.758,I understood you to say that the Idaho statute was typical of these state statutes.
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,2764.446,2767.669,Any other state statutes other than state takeover statutes.
1978.78-759,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2767.669,2768.076,Well I see.
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,2768.076,2769.004,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1978.78-759,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2769.004,2769.942,Right.
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,2769.942,2770.97,Certainly.
1978.78-759,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2770.97,2775.431,So you say this is typical of the 22 or 25 other state statutes?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,2775.431,2782.167,"I think all but about five have this same extra territorial reach, and I think there are 32 states now which have state takeover statutes."
1978.78-759,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2782.167,2785.609,"Yes, that too."
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,2785.609,2793.104,The District Court had personal jurisdiction over this case and venue was proper.
1978.78-759,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2824.0,2829.078,"But even there, you had to show that the defendant was “found”, did you not?"
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,2829.078,2839.524,I had to show under Section 27 that an act or transaction had occurred within the district which constituted a violation or breach of duty.
1978.78-759,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2839.524,2851.683,"Well, will you turn to page 6 of the jurisdictional statement please, where I believe Section 77 of the Securities Act is sent out the district."
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,2854.797,2855.077,Yes.
1978.78-759,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2855.077,2862.091,And it talks first about criminal proceeding and then it says “any suit or action to enforce at any liability.”
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,2884.333,2896.855,In any such district referring back to the leading sentence concerning “a criminal proceeding maybe brought in the district where in any act or transaction following -- constituting the violation occurred.”
1978.78-759,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2898.618,2901.53,So you say the civil adds on -- is broader than the criminal?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,2901.53,2907.838,"Yes, it refers back to the criminal district as one place and then goes further."
1978.78-759,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2915.425,2919.914,"I won't remind you to do this but you're going to tell us what the violation was, aren't you?"
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,2919.914,2924.485,"And breach of duty, if it may be characterized that way."
1978.78-759,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2924.485,2925.412,I see you are going to tell us just by the way -- yes.
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,2925.412,2926.5,"Yes, yes."
1978.78-759,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2928.055,2929.59,"Yes, I think it's kind of the heart of the case."
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,2929.59,2931.794,Alright.
1978.78-759,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3037.392,3039.466,What affirmative duty was placed on them?
1978.78-759,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3041.56,3042.257,Yes.
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3042.257,3042.984,Yes.
1978.78-759,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3042.984,3050.846,"Well I would not read that as placing any affirmative duty on them, because nothing in this chapter show effect the jurisdiction except such and such."
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3056.67,3057.814,I would view it differently.
1978.78-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3068.232,3079.226,You're saying a -- an officer who tries to enforce a state statute that is in conflict with the federal statute is --
1978.78-759,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3079.226,3080.002,It violates it.
1978.78-759,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3080.002,3083.116,-- is violating a duty which is under the federal law?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3083.116,3084.483,Under the 1934 Act.
1978.78-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3091.29,3096.952,Or in -- the terms you had right to be free from state regulation?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3096.952,3107.74,"Well, I think the shareholders of Sunshine had the right to be free from regulation which blocked this tender offer until it was -- until the state statute was declared unconstitutional."
1978.78-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3107.74,3111.95,"Well so did you client, I take it?"
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3111.95,3114.353,My client of course wanted the opportunity.
1978.78-759,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3130.828,3143.672,"Well, normally if your company in Texas has a gripe against a state official in Iowa, they would litigate where?"
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3143.672,3145.407,It would depend on where the defendant was acting.
1978.78-759,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3145.407,3149.157,"I said normally, normally."
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3151.024,3153.687,"Normally, you would go to where the defendant is located. Now --"
1978.78-759,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3153.687,3155.94,"Now, you attack the statute there wouldn't you?"
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3155.94,3157.248,"You could, and --"
1978.78-759,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3157.248,3162.585,"And there -- is your -- solely because of Williams Act, or are you relying on both?"
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3162.585,3168.423,Well we are relying upon constitutional privileges as well as a violation of the Act.
1978.78-759,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3171.525,3174.691,"Constitutional, do you mean due process?"
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3174.691,3178.667,The Supremacy Clause and the Commerce Clause which we believe the Idaho Act violates.
1978.78-759,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3178.667,3180.96,You are not arguing the due process here?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3180.96,3181.479,I'm sorry?
1978.78-759,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3181.479,3183.864,You are not arguing the due process here?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3183.864,3189.303,"I think there is some element of due process in here, but that was not specifically how we brought our suit."
1978.78-759,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3194.87,3199.778,Well the way I understand their policy is that's exactly what you're doing.
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3210.84,3215.397,I think what the District Court in Texas was doing was --
1978.78-759,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3215.397,3216.882,-- they never -- they say --
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3216.882,3217.75,Was making the --
1978.78-759,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3217.75,3228.554,"-- that you're into -- that the Federal District Court in Dallas is in interfering with the laws and the officials of Idaho, that's their complaint."
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3228.554,3246.618,"And our complaint is that the Idaho regulators by seeking to regulate extra territorially were damaging the plaintiffs, the federal plaintiffs who brought the suit in the Northern District of Texas where the very restraint occurred."
1978.78-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3274.994,3286.14,"And you would say if each of the other 50 states had exactly the same law and issued the same order, you think every state should be subject to suit in at least one place?"
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3286.14,3293.803,"Yes, I do under the 1966 amendments to the general venue statute allowing suit to be brought where the claim arose."
1978.78-759,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3311.669,3319.024,"And it's inevitable that if you spread that over widely, it's going to be quite inconvenient for someone."
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3319.024,3333.418,"Very inconvenient for someone and we do not think that any policy of judicial economy would be served by Great Western being required to sue one time in Idaho, one time in Maryland and one time in New York."
1978.78-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3335.408,3337.925,Well how many states have takeover statute?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3337.925,3342.691,"Approximately 32 or 33, I'm not sure of the exact number."
1978.78-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3346.618,3348.692,That would be four more suits for you.
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3348.692,3350.896,"Yes, right."
1978.78-759,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3350.896,3354.766,"Mr. Irwin, of course you don't have to have them all held unconstitutional in this transaction, I take it?"
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3354.766,3355.086,No.
1978.78-759,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3355.086,3356.661,Only three of them affected you.
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3366.236,3368.66,I think it's a little broader than that.
1978.78-759,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3392.717,3393.836,Right.
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3393.836,3404.152,"That order had been entered without any notice, hearing, posting a bond or other security which is held by both courts below restrain Great Western from going forward anywhere."
1978.78-759,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3404.152,3409.08,"Well now, did Mr. McEldowney when he signed that order violate the federal statute?"
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3409.08,3415.127,"I think by seeking to enforce this statute, he breached the duty or violation either one --"
1978.78-759,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3415.127,3416.375,Did he commit a crime?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3416.375,3418.329,"No, Your Honor, no he did not commit a crime."
1978.78-759,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3418.329,3426.727,"Well yet you're relying on the -- such district language from 27 that provides for criminal jurisdiction, aren't you?"
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3426.727,3432.563,But it is repeated when the civil jurisdiction provisions of Section 28 come into play.
1978.78-759,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3449.757,3458.625,"No it says “may be brought in any such district or in the district wherein the defendant is found, or is an inhabitant or transacts business.”"
1978.78-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3458.625,3465.898,But such -- do you think it refers back to any district in which a criminal violation could be prosecuted?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3465.898,3468.305,Where any act or transaction occurred which would constitute the violation.
1978.78-759,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3468.305,3476.06,Do you think it would be limited by the vicinage requirement of the Sixth Amendment?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3476.06,3477.148,I'm not sure I'm yielding.
1978.78-759,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3477.148,3492.816,"Well, the Sixth Amendment says as you know doubt know as well as I do that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to speedy in public trial by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed."
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3501.01,3501.988,Yes.
1978.78-759,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3501.988,3506.22,And do you think a crime was committed in Texas in this case by the state defendants?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3506.22,3508.563,No I do not think a crime was committed.
1978.78-759,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3524.257,3527.359,From this Court?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3527.666,3531.276,"Though not in this Court, not in this Court but in the lower courts."
1978.78-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3806.574,3812.311,What -- do you think Section 27 gives you right to sue?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3812.311,3813.327,Yes.
1978.78-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3813.327,3816.578,A so-called private cause of action then?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3816.578,3818.802,We would think so.
1978.78-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3819.399,3825.137,Do you have to find some section that's -- to do that right in those securities law or?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3825.137,3830.862,"In order to have subject matter jurisdiction under the 1934 Act, we would have to find a Section, yes."
1978.78-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3830.862,3832.497,"Well, you're suing a state official, aren't you?"
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3832.497,3833.523,Yes.
1978.78-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3833.523,3836.136,For interference with what you claim as a federal right?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3836.136,3847.129,"Yes, for violating the federal right, the federal regulation of tender offers as expressed in the Williams Act through a statute which conflicts."
1978.78-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3847.129,3864.349,Well all this section says is that actions may be brought -- any suit or actions to enforce any a viability or duty maybe brought in some -- does that automatically say any -- does that automatically provide for a private causes of action?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3864.349,3864.896,I don't think it --
1978.78-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3864.896,3866.85,Under this entire chapter?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3866.85,3869.155,I do not think it automatically does.
1978.78-759,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3870.203,3875.532,But your authority and for saying there is a private cause of action here.
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3875.532,3881.328,It was Great Western's tender offer which was in fact stopped.
1978.78-759,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3881.428,3891.768,"But you don't you have to go back to find out what Congress intended that you have a private cause of action, rather than relating the facts of this case?"
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3891.768,3892.533,"Oh, I see."
1978.78-759,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3897.523,3903.56,There have been -- if we ever held there was one under this particular section?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3903.56,3906.255,"Not under this section, no."
1978.78-759,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3984.377,3995.095,But if you had no right to sue as a plaintiff under this statute then there was never any occasion to pass on the validity of the Idaho statute.
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,3995.095,4001.49,May I say that we were not basing our right to sue on just the 1934 Act.
1978.78-759,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4010.986,4014.538,But then you certainly couldn't invoke Section 27 jurisdiction.
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,4014.538,4015.275,That's true.
1978.78-759,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4235.785,4243.329,"If the Idaho statue had been limited to intrastate activities, would it be preempted in your view?"
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,4243.329,4246.802,"I don't think so, because I think it would then operate like a state Blue Sky Law."
1978.78-759,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4246.802,4247.351,Exactly.
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,4247.351,4255.019,The constitutionality of which this Court upheld in 1917 in Hall versus Geiger-Jones.
1978.78-759,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4321.693,4322.909,May I ask this question?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,4322.909,4323.396,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-759,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4323.396,4331.813,"Your complaint also alleged the cause of action under 1983, what's the basis of that?"
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,4331.813,4361.027,"We believe that the delegation by Idaho under the Idaho Act to the target management of the right to determine whether or not the Idaho Act would come into play constituted an unlawful delegation to a vitally interested private party, and violation of the Civil Rights Act as expressed in 1983."
1978.78-759,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4361.027,4364.957,What civil rights?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,4364.957,4379.087,We believe that there is a discrimination involved if an outside party is subject to state regulation only at the behest of another private party.
1978.78-759,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4379.087,4380.951,You still rely on 1983?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,4380.951,4384.163,"We have not brought that forward in the brief, Your Honor."
1978.78-759,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4384.163,4385.259,Does that mean you've abandoned it?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,4385.259,4388.351,We've abandoned it.
1978.78-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4388.351,4395.495,"You haven't brought that forward in the brief but it's in your complaint, it's a jurisdictional question."
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,4395.495,4396.192,Yes.
1978.78-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4396.192,4403.525,And aren't you claiming that you have a right under the Federal Securities Law that's being violated?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,4403.525,4406.359,"Yes, but not only under 1983."
1978.78-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4406.359,4414.136,"Well I understand, but that refers to the federal constitution whether you certainly are claiming that one of your constitutional rights are being violated --"
1978.78-759,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4414.136,4414.595,That's right.
1978.78-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4414.595,4415.823,-- under the Commerce Clause.
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,4415.823,4416.979,Yes and the Supremacy Clause --
1978.78-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4416.979,4418.993,Well and you're suing a state official?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,4418.993,4419.121,Yes.
1978.78-759,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4419.121,4419.868,Right.
1978.78-759,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4419.868,4428.193,"And they're also claiming the violation of federal laws, and 1983 speaks of constitutional laws of the United States, doesn't it?"
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,4428.193,4428.84,"Yes ,sir."
1978.78-759,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4428.84,4431.712,Are you sure you're abandoning it?
1978.78-759,2,28588,ivan_irwin_jr,,4431.712,4432.89,I'll reinstate it.
1978.78-759,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4432.89,4442.538,Yes.
1978.78-759,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4442.538,4450.443,Mr. Easterbrook.
1978.78-759,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,4450.443,4453.527,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.78-759,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4469.393,4475.768,"If our interest is in identifying the proper forum for the suit, I suppose your argument is largely wasted then?"
1978.78-759,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,4475.768,4483.172,"My -- Mr. Justice Rehnquist, my argument would be entirely wasted if you find that there is no jurisdiction over this case."
1978.78-759,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4490.018,4491.283,Go on then.
1978.78-759,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,4491.283,4497.521,"I will -- I'll address the commerce clause first, and then I'll take up the Supremacy Clause arguments."
1978.78-759,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4923.724,4934.31,"Mr. Easterbrook, if tender offers are always so beneficial to stockholders as you suggest, well why did Congress enact the Williams Act?"
1978.78-759,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,4934.31,4948.253,"Mr. Justice Powell, there is substantial legislative history to indicate that Congress thought that tender offers were quite beneficial if conducted under a set of rules that allowed the shareholders to make an informed judgment."
1978.78-759,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4948.253,4952.203,"They've often been beneficial, but they've often been quite adverse."
1978.78-759,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,4952.203,4954.199,The -- that's right.
1978.78-759,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5228.367,5236.989,"Mr. Easterbrook, do you agree with Mr. Irwin that if the Idaho statute had been limited to intrastate activities that it would have been valid?"
1978.78-759,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,5236.989,5243.555,"The Commission's position is that even if it were limited to intrastate activities, it would be preempted by the Williams Act."
1978.78-759,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5243.555,5248.014,Has the Commission taken that position previously to this case?
1978.78-759,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,5248.014,5252.865,"I'm sorry Mr. Justice, I don't know whether they took it before this case, but that is the Commission's position, but commerce --"
1978.78-759,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5252.865,5257.035,So the Commission's position is that all 36 state laws are invalid?
1978.78-759,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,5257.035,5258.181,"It is, Your Honor."
1978.78-759,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5298.193,5303.492,"Any state law that makes addition as to the requirements, the Williams Act could be invalid under that analysis?"
1978.78-759,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,5303.492,5308.221,"In -- no, I think the Commission is not of that view."
1978.78-759,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5315.998,5319.122,Even if limited only to stockholders within the state?
1978.78-759,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,5319.122,5320.218,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-759,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5371.736,5379.698,Would it make a difference if the state statute is limited to corporations incorporated under the laws of that state?
1978.78-759,3,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,5379.698,5387.085,I think that would substantially reduce the opportunities for disrupting the balance that's been created by Congress.
1978.78-759,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5427.287,5431.636,"Mr. Heiser, you have a few minutes left."
1978.78-759,4,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,5431.636,5444.29,"As a preliminary matter, Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to point out to the Court that the typewritten brief of the Securities Exchange Commission was only received by as on the 5th of April with corrections on the 9th of April."
1978.78-759,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5455.564,5459.477,You may respond if you wish in the usual way.
1978.78-759,4,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,5459.477,5461.241,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1978.78-759,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5615.958,5626.696,"By the same token of course, the respondent company says that what Idaho did had a direct impact upon what the respondent wanted to do in the State of Texas."
1978.78-759,4,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,5626.696,5633.54,"Well, Mr. Justice Stewart what the respondent wanted to do was not only in the State of Texas."
1978.78-759,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5633.54,5635.082,And the other 49 states also.
1978.78-759,4,38002,peter_e_heiser_jr,,5635.082,5636.118,Exactly.
1978.78-759,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5734.745,5735.453,Thank you gentlemen.
