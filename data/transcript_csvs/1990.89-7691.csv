1990.89-7691,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,17.443,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-7691, Dale Robert Yates v. Parker Evatt, Commissioner, South Carolina Department of Corrections, et al.--"
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,42.26,45.362,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-7691,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,211.837,227.798,At this point or at some convenient point in your argument could you comment on the argument of the amicus that once evidence of the use of the knife is introduced the presumption of malice disappears under State law in any event?
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,231.25,233.202,Yes.
1990.89-7691,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,315.787,326.128,But at least as for Yates you certainly... I'm not sure that you don't know enough about the use of the weapon with respect to Davis.
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,335.668,336.118,No.
1990.89-7691,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,336.118,344.59,"--Well, but giving you the benefit of the doubt as to Davis... certainly as to Yates, the full circumstances of the use of the weapon were introduced."
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,347.459,348.008,"Yes, of course."
1990.89-7691,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,348.008,349.577,"That, that was quite complete."
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,349.577,360.349,"Of course, but under South Carolina law that does not create an irrebuttable or conclusive presumption of malice, or it does not... the State wishes to create a felony murder rule which does not exist in South Carolina."
1990.89-7691,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,403.212,409.799,"Well, but you're talking about malice... you're not contending that malice, for purposes of South Carolina law, means intent to kill?"
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,409.799,411.068,"No, it does not."
1990.89-7691,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,509.195,523.871,"I think it's more than being reckless, isn't it, to go into a store with a knife in your hand, and when someone tries to stop the robbery, to struggle with a knife in your hand and end up the struggle with the knife lodged in somebody's heart?"
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,528.442,533.43,"--Well, reckless, you know, is... under South Carolina... is more than negligence."
1990.89-7691,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,538.898,553.491,"Well, isn't that the case when you... when you commit a store robbery with a knife in your hand and struggle when someone tries to stop the robbery with the knife in your hand, even if you don't intentionally plunge it into someone's heart, struggle in such a fashion that that's the result?"
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,553.491,557.128,I do not contend that the jury could not reach that conclusion.
1990.89-7691,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,560.497,570.353,"Could it reach any other conclusion, other than this is the kind of thing that, other than an absolute intent to kill, which is covered by the intent requirement?"
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,570.353,593.134,"Yes, in all candor I just have to say that I think a jury could reach the conclusion that while it was reckless for him to have been in the situation, for him to be accosted from the side or from the rear by someone that he may not have even known was there, is not evidence that as a matter of law or that conclusively establishes the depraved and malignant heart."
1990.89-7691,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,629.574,633.795,Does the evidence show how many wounds were inflicted on Mrs. Woods?
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,633.795,634.678,"Yes, Your Honor, it does."
1990.89-7691,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,638.013,638.78,Nothing else?
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,638.78,639.699,Nothing else.
1990.89-7691,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,763.68,778.003,"Tell me, what did the... did the supreme court in this latest round here say it was harmless error because the jury... there was so much evidence of Davis'--"
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,778.003,779.689,That's correct.
1990.89-7691,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,779.689,783.391,--culpability that the presumption was harmless error?
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,783.391,784.843,That's correct.
1990.89-7691,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,784.843,789.128,And without any reference to Yates' culpability?
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,789.128,790.247,That's exactly right.
1990.89-7691,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,793.282,794.732,Because this is an accomplice case?
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,794.732,796.817,Because this is an accomplice case.
1990.89-7691,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,797.634,809.458,"But, I suppose under our cases the person who is sentenced to death must have himself or herself intended to kill somebody?"
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,809.458,821.064,"--Yes, well, the court below got around that by saying that well, he did intend to kill somebody, or at least the jury could have concluded that because he fired at someone else, at Willie Wood, and shot him through his out stretched hand and the bullet landed in his pocket."
1990.89-7691,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,824.884,831.122,"Well, I know, but I thought they said all they needed to do was to find that Davis was culpable?"
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,831.122,832.638,--That's for the conviction of murder.
1990.89-7691,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,859.439,865.628,So you're just arguing mainly here that there just... it couldn't have been harmless error because there was so little evidence?
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,866.295,873.199,"Well, that's the first... that's the first and I would submit the easiest way of disposing of this case."
1990.89-7691,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,945.545,947.497,"But the court's instruction said,"
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,960.638,961.307,Yes.
1990.89-7691,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,961.307,963.107,That doesn't refer to Yates.
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,963.709,964.209,"No, it doesn't."
1990.89-7691,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1089.065,1097.469,"--Well, what... are you suggesting we say that they focused on the wrong... on the wrong evidence, namely the evidence relating to Davis rather than to Yates?"
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1097.469,1098.504,--I would--
1990.89-7691,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1098.504,1101.206,And ask them to focus on Yates?
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1119.084,1119.45,--No.
1990.89-7691,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1121.619,1130.123,"Well, you, you expect us to... would it satisfy you if we said... sent it back again and said focus on Yates?"
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1130.123,1141.664,"Well, with all due respect to the South Carolina Supreme Court, I think the time has come when they need some more precise instructions on how this case should be decided."
1990.89-7691,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1144.132,1146.632,Your argument seems to be that they have focused on Davis rather than Yates.
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1146.632,1147.084,--Yes.
1990.89-7691,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1182.322,1191.26,"Do you... you want us to decide the whole thing here and say they focused on Davis rather than Yates, and focusing on Yates it couldn't possibly be harmless error, the presumption?"
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1191.26,1192.296,That's correct.
1990.89-7691,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1207.354,1210.406,"Let's assume that the jury focused on Yates, all right?"
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1215.61,1218.845,"Two presumption, unconstitutional presumptions of malice."
1990.89-7691,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1218.845,1219.378,All right.
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1219.697,1223.999,"And if the jury focused on Yates, their question would have been did Yates have malice at the time of the crime."
1990.89-7691,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1223.999,1228.367,"--One of the two presumptions was the bubble presumption, is that correct?"
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1229.117,1230.417,"It has been described in that way, yes."
1990.89-7691,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1230.417,1240.175,"Now, why, why doesn't the second sentence of that instruction automatically render the first sentence, ""if you consider it error"", to be harmless?"
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1256.934,1278.031,"Well, I think it... it would still have been a, a burden-shifting problem for the jury to determine whether or not the actual circumstances, in other words whether they believed the explanation enough to relieve... the circumstances suggest, the true circumstances, in other words if you, if you have been convinced of the actual facts, it still has a burden-shifting quality."
1990.89-7691,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1321.793,1341.573,"Could any jury have found that presumption to be operative, namely the doing of a willful, deliberate, and intentional unlawful act that wouldn't necessarily have found what is... what was necessary to establish malice under South Carolina law here, which is an intentional killing?"
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1341.573,1341.94,Sure.
1990.89-7691,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1347.81,1349.396,And that is not enough under South Carolina--
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1349.396,1350.012,--Absolutely not.
1990.89-7691,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1358.835,1359.235,--Yes.
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1363.537,1364.822,--Absolutely not.
1990.89-7691,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1408.733,1415.32,You say the Supreme Court of South Carolina made a statement of law and cited no authority for it?
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1415.32,1415.67,No.
1990.89-7691,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1417.172,1422.206,"Oh, you're paraphrasing the respondents' contention, not the supreme--"
1990.89-7691,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1422.206,1423.408,"--Oh, yes, absolutely."
1990.89-7691,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1442.87,1443.906,"--Very well, Mr. Bruck."
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,1449.308,1453.695,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-7691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1488.016,1491.653,Is that a satisfactory... I wanted to ask you just about that very point.
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,1501.175,1510.398,"Your Honor, I think following the harmless error analysis here the court in essence has concluded that the evidence is so overwhelming of Davis' malice that the jury would not have had to do that."
1990.89-7691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1520.37,1537.532,"No, I just want to focus for a moment, if I may, and I don't mean to cut you off, but on the proper test of harmless error is it merely that it would not have been necessary to rely on the instructions, or is it clear beyond... beyond a reasonable doubt the instructions could not have made a difference?"
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,1537.532,1544.119,"--I think it, the proper test would be beyond a reasonable doubt the instructions would not have made a difference in this case because the evidence is so overwhelming."
1990.89-7691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1544.119,1545.038,But that's not what they found.
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,1558.111,1563.699,"I think, in spite the articulate turn of phrase, I think that the record nevertheless supports the--"
1990.89-7691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1563.699,1567.751,"Well, the record might support it, but they didn't apply that test."
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,1567.751,1580.211,"--Again, I would say it's... a strange turn of phrase, but I think in the cases they cited and the way they wrote the opinion I would argue that... not focus on that one bit of language, that they had to consider the whole record here under Rose v. Clark, and properly decided the case."
1990.89-7691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1587.131,1592.451,"Well, you would agree, would you not, that it would not be sufficient merely to conclude that it was not necessary for the--"
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,1592.451,1593.001,--That is correct.
1990.89-7691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1593.001,1594.384,--jurors to rely on those instructions?
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,1594.384,1595.32,That is correct.
1990.89-7691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1595.32,1595.753,Okay.
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,1595.753,1603.09,"But I think, as this Court has said and many times, while it usually sends cases back for harmless error analysis, it can apply the harmless error analysis and it can do it."
1990.89-7691,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1649.051,1652.939,"What you really mean is you don't even need the jury, don't you?"
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,1652.939,1654.355,"No, sir, I wouldn't say that."
1990.89-7691,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1662.311,1664.061,"Well, what about harmless error as applied to Yates?"
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,1664.061,1664.747,--I'm sorry.
1990.89-7691,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1664.747,1670.983,What about whether this presumption was harmless error as applied to Yates?
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,1670.983,1674.935,"Well, here again this concerns the South Carolina law of accomplice liability."
1990.89-7691,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1727.237,1731.105,So if... Davis' malice automatically proves Yates'?
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,1731.105,1735.307,--If he meets the other... other tests and other elements of the law of accomplice liability.
1990.89-7691,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1738.711,1741.747,And whether the death penalty... we're talking about guilt or innocence here?
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,1741.747,1742.23,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-7691,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1742.58,1743.713,And not about the death penalty?
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,1743.713,1744.449,--That's exactly right.
1990.89-7691,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1745.132,1749.9,"And they death... whether the death penalty is, in this case is valid is still to be decided?"
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,1749.9,1750.852,--I think so.
1990.89-7691,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1771.099,1792.929,"You think... you think the... that it doesn't violate the notion of presuming somebody's intent as known... where it's known to the crime, you don't think it violates that rule against presuming it to presume it from the fact that your accomplice had it, had intent?"
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,1792.929,1794.395,"--No, sir, because again, once again--"
1990.89-7691,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1794.395,1796.414,"Well, it is sort of a presumption, isn't it?"
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,1796.414,1798.099,--I don't think it's just a presumption.
1990.89-7691,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.649,1802.451,"If Davis has it, Yates has it."
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,1805.17,1806.522,"--The jury, once again--"
1990.89-7691,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1806.522,1808.289,--That's not much of a way of proving Yates'--
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,1808.289,1811.907,"--Well, once again, even though the death penalty issue is not before the Court, the jury is not presuming."
1990.89-7691,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1827.417,1831.469,"--Mr. Shealy, what is the adjective you used before liability?"
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,1835.337,1836.104,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-7691,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1934.534,1943.289,"Well, they... you're really saying that the, whatever presumptions were given to the jury in this case are wholly irrelevant with respect to Yates."
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,1943.289,1949.043,"That did not affect, in the sense that they did not affect the jury's consideration of his mental state in any way, that is correct."
1990.89-7691,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2006.597,2022.908,"Well, it's not, but isn't it also correct, as your brother points out on page 4, that at another point, which he cites to page 96 of the Appendix, the judge said malice may be expressed by circumstances which show directly that an intent to kill was really and actually entertained."
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,2029.245,2033.216,"I don't think the judge did really identify malice as intent to kill, and let me explain why."
1990.89-7691,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2051.511,2054.045,"Mr. Shealy, would you slow down a little bit?"
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,2055.512,2056.612,--I'm sorry.
1990.89-7691,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2090.053,2099.408,Well I think if I sit down quietly with the instructions I may be able to follow exactly what you have just outlined.
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,2116.786,2134.515,"Following what was said by this Court in Francis, that jurors are assumed to be conscientious of their duty, they are assumed to understand instructions and to strive to make sense out of them, I think when you hear that, and if you listen to the plain language used there, we may just have a difference of opinion, but I think that what the jury was told is that this is the kind of thing you consider that is relevant for malice."
1990.89-7691,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2147.655,2154.576,"Mr. Shealy, in the... in South Carolina is it the practice to send the jury instructions in written form to the jury, or are they just delivered orally?"
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,2154.576,2155.761,--They are delivered orally.
1990.89-7691,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2155.761,2157.728,So that they had to just catch all this orally?
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,2157.728,2159.463,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-7691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2300.837,2304.74,"Mr.... may I ask you this question, just to be sure we don't, don't forget it?"
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,2337.962,2338.595,A couple of things.
1990.89-7691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2451.134,2457.788,"No, but it does seem clear that if there were a multiple stabbing your argument in favor of harmless error would be much stronger."
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,2457.788,2458.371,--I agree.
1990.89-7691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2458.371,2464.524,And if they thought there was a multiple stabbing it may well be that they came to a conclusion based on an erroneous premise.
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,2464.524,2467.16,I agree it would certainly be stronger if there were multiple stabbing.
1990.89-7691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2477.951,2484.522,"But see, you're in effect arguing that there is a basic for a harmless error determination for reasons other than those relied on by the State supreme court."
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,2484.522,2488.49,"Yes, sir, and I don't... the lunging is, I think... I do stick to that."
1990.89-7691,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2492.378,2500.798,"Or to put it differently, what you're arguing is that this error in the supreme court's harmless error determination was harmless error, basically."
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,2502.784,2504.518,That's Your Honor's phrase.
1990.89-7691,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2697.911,2701.263,But that is to say that you have a felony murder law.
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,2709.968,2710.82,There is not. The reason... I don't want to--
1990.89-7691,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2710.82,2712.57,But you're saying there is.
1990.89-7691,1,36764,miller_w_shealy_jr,,2714.355,2716.974,--I don't want to get into a semantic quibble.
1990.89-7691,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2786.051,2787.268,"Thank you, Mr. Shealy."
1990.89-7691,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,2790.605,2794.057,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1990.89-7691,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2944.188,2946.388,xxx?
1990.89-7691,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,2946.388,2950.926,"--Well, they probably found it aided by the instruction, the shared malice, if you will."
1990.89-7691,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2965.686,2977.576,"Well, suppose... do you think it was harmless error to... do you think that presumption was harmless error with respect to Davis?"
1990.89-7691,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,2977.576,2991.253,"--Absolutely not, for the reasons I have indicated, that it is not clear... it requires either intent to kill or something very, very close to intent to kill under South Carolina law, notwithstanding that a felony is being committed."
1990.89-7691,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3000.109,3008.363,"Suppose Davis was still around and they both were on trial, and all this happened, they were both convicted under these presumptions."
1990.89-7691,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3015.785,3018.07,"--Well, yes, I think so, but we would have had a very different trial then."
1990.89-7691,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3018.07,3020.453,"Let's assume that it wouldn't have, it wouldn't have."
1990.89-7691,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3023.974,3034.513,"I would say that it was not harmless error, because I don't think that this jury clearly focused on Davis' mental state in order to convict Yates."
1990.89-7691,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3145.133,3147.352,"Thank you, Mr. Bruck, your time has expired."
1990.89-7691,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3147.352,3147.869,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1990.89-7691,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3147.869,3149.369,The case is submitted.
