1980.80-420,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,2.019,"Thank you, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,10.171,14.065,Mr. Chief Justice and if it please the Court.
1980.80-420,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,14.065,18.116,Just hold a minute until your friends get ready.
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,19.578,22.854,Mr. Chief Justice and if it please the Court.
1980.80-420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,60.309,62.957,"Mr. Fahringer, might I interrupt you for a moment?"
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,97.325,113.393,"Well, Your Honor, I believe under that section, and I'm -- I'm not sure this is a final judgment or decree, but under that Section, you've invoked your power in First Amendment cases which this is as the Government acknowledges in their brief on a number of occasions because of the importance of the issue."
1980.80-420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,121.963,131.364,Do you think it's just the 12 that has -- 1257 is just an open-ended thing then that we -- if we think the issue is important that we can take it regardless of --
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,131.364,131.604,Well --
1980.80-420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,131.604,132.433,-- the language used by the Congress?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,132.433,149.332,"I -- I think you have in the past done that, in a number of cases involving injunctions and matters of that kind, which I believe this we come well within the reach of those cases and -- and I would -- I would beseech you to invoke your jurisdiction under that inherent power you have because of the importance of the issue."
1980.80-420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,149.332,153.189,We -- do we -- we don't have any inherent power.
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,157.424,172.091,"Your Honor, I just am of the view that the -- this case is relied upon in the amicus brief where they indicate you have done this before whether it has not been a final judgment is -- is -- we are a good candidate for -- for that type of disposition."
1980.80-420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,223.365,230.325,"On the -- on the practical side of the things, Mr. Fahringer, what does a prosecutor do when he's going to test the statute?"
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,237.178,237.921,Absolutely not.
1980.80-420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,239.189,241.217,"Certainly, the most vulnerable defendant."
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,241.217,244.181,"Absolutely, Your Honor, but I don't believe it --"
1980.80-420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,244.181,248.133,What does the highest court of the State say about this issue of --
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,248.133,252.203,"Well, Your Honor, they said and -- and this brings us to a very important issue in this case."
1980.80-420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,255.145,256.516,Are we not bound by that?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,256.516,258.058,"I don't believe you are, Your Honor."
1980.80-420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,269.77,272.394,You mean -- you mean the trial court prevails over the highest court of the State?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,272.394,282.151,"Well, Your Honor, I believe the judge who hears the witnesses, observes the witnesses, has been in the past been given great deference on fact finding issues."
1980.80-420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,291.817,304.819,"Well, don't -- don't we take the statement of the fact, the historical facts of the case as it comes from the highest court of the State, even though it may choose to disagree with the trial court?"
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,304.819,307.038,"I -- I don't believe you're obliged to, Your Honor."
1980.80-420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,317.621,321.999,"Well, but the very fact that he was in dissent means that the majority didn't -- didn't agree with them."
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,321.999,323.333,"No question about it, Your Honor."
1980.80-420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,351.239,353.013,For the purposes of what?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,353.013,353.239,"Well, Your Honor --"
1980.80-420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,353.239,355.106,-- via federal constitutional claim?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,355.106,356.219,"Yes -- yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,356.219,357.357,What is your federal constitutional claim?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,357.357,363.658,Our federal constitutional claim is we've been denied equal protection here under the Fourteenth Amendment because we were -- we were singled out --
1980.80-420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,363.658,365.532,It is in the matter of due process.
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,365.532,369.211,"Well, I think it is in terms of the burden of proof as a matter of due process, Your Honor."
1980.80-420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,387.132,398.362,They have had some equal protection cases where we've -- in the name of making a constitutional judgment with -- made our own judgment of the historical facts?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,398.362,407.567,"Well, Your Honor, what I think we have is, we have a long line of cases from this Court where you have given great weight to the findings of --"
1980.80-420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,407.567,409.941,Of District Courts maybe but --
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,409.941,411.061,"Well, I think the same --"
1980.80-420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,411.061,414.27,This just comes from -- this comes from the state court as Justice Rehnquist said.
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,414.27,423.336,"Well, Your Honor, forgive me but I don't believe there should be any difference in this Court in judging the fact finding process of the District Court or of a state trial court."
1980.80-420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,423.336,427.36,But Congress may have suggested that there should be.
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,438.643,441.413,"Well, Your Honor, let me -- let me just say this."
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,512.004,517.025,Is it possible to have a test case that's not selective?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,517.025,519.095,"Of course, Your Honor, of course."
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,558.191,566.929,"But, I said, my question was, will you have a one single, a test case?"
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,566.929,567.361,Yes.
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,567.361,570.052,Isn't that obviously a selective case?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,570.052,571.425,Absolutely.
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,573.096,574.19,What's wrong with it?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,574.19,578.709,"Well, what is wrong with it is here, Your Honor, I think it is inherently a suspect."
1980.80-420,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,612.85,618.995,Are you -- are you suggesting that by putting one political cartoon in another lies pornographic publication.
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,623.136,624.132,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1980.80-420,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,624.132,627.058,"Well, then, what's the significance of the political cartoon that you mentioned?"
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,627.058,630.256,"Because that's what inspired the prosecution, Your Honor, I say in all difference to the --"
1980.80-420,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,630.256,635.189,That's what -- did the highest court of Ohio say something about that?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,635.189,635.815,"No, Your Honor."
1980.80-420,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,642.383,656.638,"Of course as Justice Marshall had suggested, the prosecutor always selects and -- and you have conceited that if he knows what his business, he's going to select the strongest case for the prosecution and the most vulnerable defendant."
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,656.638,662.51,"What I -- what -- Your Honor, I welcome that question because I think that goes to the very heart of the issue here, and let me deal with it."
1980.80-420,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,681.474,682.718,What's the impermissible reason?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,682.718,683.735,The cartoon.
1980.80-420,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,683.735,692.154,"Well, then -- then we come back to the proposition that by putting one political cartoon, the publisher is going to be insulated from prosecution?"
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,692.154,693.766,"No, no, Your Honor, I'm not suggesting that."
1980.80-420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,727.052,737.014,"Mr. Fahringer, what in your opinion, if you had to pick one case from this Court on the question of selective prosecution, is the closest one that supports you?"
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,737.014,741.611,"Well, Your Honor, I would like to answer that question by saying that the rule that I would like --"
1980.80-420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,741.611,743.947,"No, I'm not -- I asked you with the case."
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,743.947,744.394,I'm sorry.
1980.80-420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,747.277,749.695,"I -- from this Court, I asked."
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,749.695,752.988,"Judge, there is no case indirectly in point in this Court."
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,847.447,850.859,Do you think that prosecutor was prejudiced against your client?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,850.859,851.874,I beg your pardon?
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,851.874,857.467,Do you consider the prosecutor being prejudiced against your client?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,857.467,859.556,"I -- I can't say that in good conscience, Your Honor, but what I can --"
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,859.556,864.47,You're still lying and all I've been saying is whether they're prejudiced against a group of people.
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,864.47,865.272,"Well, you --"
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,865.272,868.538,This prosecutor was prejudiced against a group people or an individual.
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,868.538,869.701,"Well, I -- Your Honor, I think --"
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,869.701,870.601,Is he?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,870.601,871.081,"Well, he would."
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,877.065,879.114,Is that same as racial prejudice?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,879.114,881.625,"Well, I think, Your Honor, there -- it's -- it's a --"
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,881.625,884.594,"Well, if so, what section of the constitution protects it?"
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,884.594,888.062,"Well, what protects this is, Your Honor, the First Amendment in terms of the --"
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,888.062,891.186,Do you said you were relying on the Fourteenth Amendment?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,891.186,898.128,"Well, I am, Your Honor, but what you have is it seems to me is a -- a coalescence of the Fourteenth Amendment on equal protection."
1980.80-420,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,902.817,913.384,"No, that won't be a matter, it won't be -- that -- be a matter of the merits at the trial, you'll have a defense under the First and Fourteenth Amendment on the merits of the trial, of the prosecution."
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,936.9,939.625,"Well, You're Honor I --"
1980.80-420,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,939.625,950.432,"And I must say that, sorry, the great discretion, unreviewable and uncontrollable, that we confide in prosecutors under our systems shocks our brothers in continental Europe, for example."
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,950.432,951.492,"Well, you honor, I --"
1980.80-420,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,951.492,952.505,But we do it.
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,952.505,958.661,I could only answer that by saying that then what you're really saying is that the -- the doctrine of selected prosecution should be abolished.
1980.80-420,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,958.661,973.736,"No, no, no, Yick Wo was something -- Yick Wo involved a statute or an ordinance of San Francisco, I guess it was, that was on its face applied all laundries, but in practical fact, applied only the Chinese laundries."
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,973.736,974.67,"Yes, that's right."
1980.80-420,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,974.67,976.073,"And that's not this kind of a case, is it?"
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,976.073,986.559,"No, but, Your Honor, if I may, if it please you, we have, growing up beneath you, in the Circuit Courts fault, you know, Steele, where they went after draft protesters."
1980.80-420,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1016.096,1017.192,We didn't say it.
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1017.192,1019.01,"Oh, I'm sorry, I beg your pardon."
1980.80-420,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1021.704,1024.815,"What about the RICO statute, are you familiar with that, Mr. Fahringer?"
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1024.815,1026.951,"Yes, yes."
1980.80-420,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1026.951,1047.238,"Supposing the Government, seeing the statute, passed for the first time, in charged with the duty to enforce it, picks out the biggest group of mobsters it can in the country and goes after them, rather than a group of smaller mobsters, would you say that was a selective prosecution?"
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1047.238,1051.531,"Well, You Honor, it would be selective but it might be justifiable."
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1133.285,1137.833,What would happen if the prosecutor prosecuted another magazine?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1137.833,1138.05,I think --
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1138.05,1139.808,"Right now, right now."
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1139.808,1143.322,"Well, Your Honor, significantly, none have been prosecuted, but --"
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1143.322,1144.441,You heard my question.
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1144.441,1146.975,"Judge, if they had prosecuted, Your Honor --"
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1146.975,1151.784,"I said as -- if at right now, they've prosecuted another one?"
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1151.784,1152.929,You mean right this minute?
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1153.19,1154.479,"Yes, sir."
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1154.479,1156.146,I would think that would -- that would --
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1156.146,1157.555,Would that solve the problem?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1157.555,1160.51,"I do not believe it would solve the problem, Your Honor, but I think it would --"
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1160.51,1161.9,Would that end your case?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1161.9,1163.243,"I don't believe so, Your Honor"
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1163.243,1164.014,Why not?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1164.014,1165.275,Because I think that it --
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1165.275,1172.084,"Well, supposed they file fixes against six magazines?"
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1172.084,1173.978,If they have done that after this case --
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1173.978,1175.644,Can they do it right now?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1176.949,1179.209,"I -- Your Honor, I think that would add greatly to their case --"
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1179.209,1184.233,So there's nothing that the Government can do now but turn your man loose?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1184.233,1190.018,"Well, Your Honor, I think the posture we're in here is that the facts are fairly well fixed."
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1211.68,1213.243,"Well, wouldn't they have a complaint?"
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1213.243,1214.149,I beg your pardon?
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1214.149,1216.716,Wouldn't they have a complaint?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1216.716,1217.11,Of course.
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1217.11,1219.863,That they have been selected out?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1219.863,1223.306,"Well, Your Honor, I think in proportions of reach, I mean if they go after five --"
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1223.306,1233.701,"I mean you get -- I was -- I don't know if things have changed, but I thought most that we would thought that if a prosecutor did not prosecute, the good Lord couldn't do anything to him."
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1233.701,1235.321,"Well, I don't think that's under selective --"
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1235.321,1238.192,"And nobody else, I thought that's what the law was."
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1238.192,1243.092,"The -- the doctrine of selective prosecution seems to militate against that, Your Honor."
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1244.488,1251.294,"In the first place, Yick Wo and Hopkins would not have a selective prosecution case, that you rely on so dearly."
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1257.987,1258.92,"I understand that, Your Honor."
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1259.418,1260.532,So that doesn't help you on that.
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1263.345,1276.855,"Well, I think, Your Honor, I was going to -- in response to Judge Rehnquist's question, the case of Blackledge versus Perry, which is a prosecutorial vindictiveness case is in the close neighborhood of what we're talking about here."
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1316.212,1331.478,"What would happen if, in a hypothetical case, a prosecutor prosecuted a man for murder, with eight fixed eyewitnesses, but it was shown that they were bitter enemies?"
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1341.116,1342.168,"Well, no, Your Honor."
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1350.067,1355.768,"I -- I don't know one town, there always had one murder."
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1355.768,1359.618,"Well, what I'm saying is, Your Honor, I assume he had been properly connected with the murder."
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1369.958,1374.596,"But you don't know yet whether this man has committed the crime, isn't it?"
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1374.596,1375.799,"In your example, you've given, Your Honor?"
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1375.799,1377.835,"No, sir, in this case"
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1377.835,1379.524,"We do not, Your Honor."
1980.80-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1379.524,1381.346,"And you don't want to find out, do you?"
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1381.346,1391.752,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I just am -- I'm critical of the fashion which the -- I think, Your Honor, rightly or wrongly, that these procedures represent a very real threat to the First Amendment."
1980.80-420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1438.745,1439.337,Can I interrupt you for a moment?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1439.337,1440.309,Yes sir.
1980.80-420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1440.309,1447.939,"Your -- your argument as understand it has got two elements.One, one of the large number of people that are basically the same is selected for prosecution."
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1460.141,1462.309,"I think that's an excellent question, Your Honor, and I welcome it."
1980.80-420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1468.897,1470.434,Why did he have to call his superiors in?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1471.742,1471.95,Well --
1980.80-420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1471.95,1472.485,-- like that.
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1472.485,1474.008,"But at the end, you said you did, Your Honor."
1980.80-420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1494.431,1495.742,"Well, what would you ask them?"
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1495.742,1500.074,"Well, what would I do is, I would say, “Has there been any consideration given to these other magazines?”"
1980.80-420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1500.074,1505.297,"But he already told you “No” on that, there was no consideration in prosecuting anybody but the Hustler as I understand it."
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1505.297,1506.368,"But, Your Honor, what he said --"
1980.80-420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1506.368,1513.213,"And the reason they picked Hustler was that Hustler, they say, was -- had a head office in Ohio."
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1513.213,1513.634,"Well, Your Honor --"
1980.80-420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1513.634,1519.059,Isn't -- don't you have to get rid or at least address the question whether that's an adequate justification for selecting them out?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1519.059,1520.641,"I don't believe it is, Your Honor, because --"
1980.80-420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1520.641,1520.693,Why not?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1520.693,1526.103,"-- because as they concede on their brief, they were mistaken when they said they couldn't bring people in from out of state."
1980.80-420,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1571.78,1575.098,Didn't he make that discission when he dropped the charges?
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1575.098,1576.076,"I -- Judge, I don't believe --"
1980.80-420,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1576.076,1582.32,"I just -- what the law, what case ever said that he's got to articulate his reasoning?"
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1582.32,1597.431,"Well I -- I read that into -- and again, Your Honor, I'm very impressed with the Falk decision out of the Seventh Circuit, where they say that, “Once -- in a First Amendment case, once a prima facie case is made out, the evidence must be compelling, and that the Government has a heavy burden.”"
1980.80-420,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1607.447,1614.206,"You think Falk is a constitutional case with a federal persecution, you read Falk as a constitutional holding."
1980.80-420,0,26991,herald_price_fahringer,,1614.206,1615.661,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1980.80-420,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1685.146,1687.817,Mr. Taylor.
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,1687.817,1691.048,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1980.80-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1801.682,1808.082,"To a 1257 extremely doesn't make any such distinction, does it?"
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,1808.082,1818.733,"No, and I -- I reluctantly have to say that I -- not that I would agree that the Court should have taken the case or that generally the Court should supervise all state court rulings in this area."
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1842.125,1842.137,Are you --
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,1842.137,1842.185,-- usually.
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1842.185,1850.936,-- arguing that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio is final within 1257 or that we ought to carve an exception to the finality rule?
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,1850.936,1852.869,"No, I think that --"
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1852.869,1853.694,"Well, which is it?"
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,1854.604,1855.626,"It's the second, Your Honor."
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1855.626,1856.531,Is an exception --
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,1856.531,1857.73,"It's an exception, I think that --"
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1857.73,1859.719,"Within -- within other cases, where we --"
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,1859.719,1860.831,"Yes, I feel what I'm saying --"
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1860.831,1862.292,What cases does it fall in then?
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,1862.292,1870.388,"It falls under, I think the broadening that you did in Cox in Construction Laborers v. Curry and then Mercantile Bank versus Langdeau."
1980.80-420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1870.59,1879.81,"Well, but we didn't -- we didn't purport to carve out an exception to the statutory rule, we don't have any power to do that."
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,1879.81,1880.929,Not an exception to the rule.
1980.80-420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1880.929,1887.19,The rule gives us jurisdiction only from final judgments of the highest courts of the state of the state in which the decision was made.
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,1887.19,1888.037,Right.
1980.80-420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1888.037,1897.312,"And therefore, the Cox case and the other cases upon which you rely simply said that the judgment was final --"
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,1897.312,1897.618,For all practical purposes.
1980.80-420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1897.618,1899.124,Within the meaning of the rule.
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,1899.124,1899.243,Right.
1980.80-420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1899.243,1900.785,Within the meaning of the statute.
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,1903.966,1921.96,"Well, by an exception, this Court has discussed it as if were an exception by saying, “Even though we have discussed finality in terms nothing further to happen in the trial court, we have on occasion said that when something further happens in the trail court but it is of no practical significance to the issue decided, that is an effect to final judgment.”"
1980.80-420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1923.898,1925.716,That's certainly is of this case.
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,1925.716,1926.22,"We'll, in a way it is."
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1926.22,1929.597,What has gone on in the trial court is of great significance.
1980.80-420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1929.597,1930.236,Yes.
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,1940.295,1942.204,"But, no, Your Honor, because it doesn't go away."
1980.80-420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1943.46,1947.478,It wouldn't go away entirely with respect to these petitioners if they were found not guilty.
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,1947.478,1952.309,"Yes, but that's why I said the difference between this case and the other cases it that here, it was --"
1980.80-420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1952.309,1957.926,"This Court is here to decide cases and controversies, not to make policy."
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,1957.926,1960.427,But our Supreme Court has already made policy.
1980.80-420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1972.547,1992.315,"Well, isn't that true of every single common law jurisdiction in this country, 49 States that a judgment of the highest court of the State is, although it's been cast in terms of A versus B, it lays down a rule of law that's applicable to all parties similarly situated?"
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,1992.315,1995.112,"Yes, Your Honor, it generally does."
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2014.955,2027.695,"But you say that half the trial that follows -- assume that the trial does take place in this case, may the defendant again argue that the prosecution should be terminated because he was selected out for an impermissible reason?"
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2027.695,2028.302,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2028.302,2029.803,He can do that at the trial?
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2029.803,2031.573,"Well, he can."
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2035.918,2039.124,Isn't that -- isn't that issue resolved as a matter of Ohio law?
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2039.124,2040.457,"Oh, yes, the Trial Court is bound --"
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2040.457,2040.775,You're not going --
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2040.775,2040.822,they can't reverse it.
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2040.822,2046.06,"-- to have another hearing with the same witnesses in -- during the trial, that you had on the issue as you had in this case then?"
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2046.06,2048.989,"The trial court is bound by the Supreme Court's ruling, as is the Court of Appeals."
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2048.989,2057.741,"So that if we either dismiss the appeal or affirm, the issue of selective prosecution will be totally terminated in this litigation?"
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2057.741,2060.054,"Yes, Your Honor, if you decide it as terminated."
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2061.045,2063.013,But if we dismissed the appeal either way.
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2063.013,2063.572,Right.
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2063.684,2066.129,-- then the prosecution will go forward on other issues.
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2066.129,2067.21,Okay.
1980.80-420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2071.002,2082.57,"If this case goes to trial and the defendant is convicted, you're not suggesting that is -- that under Ohio law, he can't present on appeal to the Court of Appeals?"
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2082.57,2083.126,"No, he must."
1980.80-420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2084.949,2094.349,"So he can make -- the -- the issue of selective prosecution, if we dismissed this case, could survive and be presented here if he is convicted?"
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2094.349,2095.063,That's correct.
1980.80-420,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2095.063,2097.791,"Well, but it's been decided in this case by the Supreme Court of Ohio."
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2097.791,2105.88,"Yes, and that's why your case is dealing with kind of making judicial economy, and that kind of thing, cutting down ways would decide that issue now."
1980.80-420,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2106.576,2125.723,"But if even though the Supreme Court of Ohio were to adhere to it's previous ruling, as is what we expected to do, opposing the counsel, that's certainly preserved the point, and again petition for certiorari with a final judgment, if he is convicted."
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2125.723,2128.951,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1980.80-420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2187.064,2196.59,"Well, didn't -- didn't we on McDonald say that speedy trail claims were not governed even within the federal system by Abney?"
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2196.59,2198.902,"Yes, and I think that we are close to that."
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2364.277,2368.267,"Under your statute, you could bring civil proceedings against these magazines too, can't you?"
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2368.267,2369.81,"We -- we can do both in Ohio, yes."
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2369.81,2377.862,Have -- have the -- has the civil injunctive power ever been invoked in your jurisdiction to try and curtail this practice among any of these magazines?
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2377.862,2391.385,"Your Honor, we did it once with the Hustler case because we -- after we charged Hustler, we were afraid that Hustler would start, you know, publishing more stuff about this case."
1980.80-420,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2410.653,2427.803,"Well, as a prosecutor making the choice or considering the choice between a civil injunction suit under criminal prosecution, would you take into an account the rather stringent additive this Court has expressed on the prior restraint of publications?"
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2427.803,2428.641,"Well, yes."
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2467.897,2470.474,-- injunction suit against Hustler?
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2470.474,2475.952,We filed it in the Court of Common Pleas and we had a discussion on discriminatory prosecution.
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2506.842,2510.053,"Is that case above in the same issue, or the one with political cartoon in it?"
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2510.053,2510.646,No.
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2515.175,2517.749,What is your position on the selective prosecution issue?
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2527.887,2529.482,"Well, it could be permissible."
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2532.193,2534.091,"But, are you arguing to this Court, today."
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2534.091,2535.809,"Well, but in this Court --"
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2535.809,2540.328,Do you think it's a permissible reason to -- you have -- say you had half a dozen magazines to choose from.
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2540.328,2542.427,"No, that wouldn't be permissible, (Voice Overlap) and I would do that."
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2542.947,2549.244,But does the record show that the cartoon played any part of the decision to prosecute this magazine?
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2549.244,2557.407,"No, Your Honor, it's -- I think that -- we tried to make it obvious, although I didn't know that -- I wasn't prepared to testify at the time when we had this hearing."
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2559.013,2566.393,"You -- you said the record really supports the inference that the cartoon was totally irrelevant, it would have come to your attention anyway and you would have picked Hustler anyway?"
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2566.393,2567.054,Of course.
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2570.028,2571.332,"-- think that was the case, did you?"
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2571.332,2571.99,"No, Your Honor."
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2619.299,2620.123,-- but does the record explain --
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2620.123,2620.88,-- something else.
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2620.88,2628.979,"-- does the record tell us why apart from the cartoon, a decision was made to prosecute any of these sophisticated magazines."
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2628.979,2629.132,"Well, --"
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2629.132,2632.286,"Because it had been rather widely distributed for two or three years, as I understand it."
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2632.286,2637.031,"Well I -- yes, for at least two or three years; more than that, actually; these magazines has been around for years, I guess."
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2637.031,2640.624,But what prompted the going after one of this group of magazines if it wasn't the cartoon?
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2640.624,2644.839,"Well, originally, it was because the police got complaints about the magazine."
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2646.102,2649.873,Did they get complains about any issues that didn't have the cartoon in it?
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2649.873,2658.068,"Well, it was the July -- It was the July ‘76 issue, the bicentennial issue, and it was just -- if it had been the July ‘75 issue, it might not have raised a stink."
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2669.187,2670.956,And what triggered the prosecution?
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2670.956,2672.93,"Well, that's what triggered us noticing the magazine."
1980.80-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2677.711,2684.848,Can you say then that the -- that's there absolutely no political factors involved in selecting this magazine for this prosecution?
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2684.848,2685.322,"No, Your Honor."
1980.80-420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2685.606,2688.456,What difference does it make that triggers the prosecution?
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2688.456,2688.775,That's what I mean.
1980.80-420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2688.775,2692.22,(Voice Overlap) have you conceded to my brother Stevens what you have.
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2698.423,2698.84,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2698.84,2705.839,And the petitioner can certain his defenses including the First Amendment or any other defenses that he has.
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2712.236,2713.08,"Well, it --"
1980.80-420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2713.08,2714.43,Or what triggered the prosecution?
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2714.43,2714.902,They would make a difference --
1980.80-420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2714.902,2717.542,The merits of the prosecution will be tested at the trial.
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2717.542,2723.296,"Right, it would make difference only if the prosecutor had the right and was -- was trying to send the cops after somebody."
1980.80-420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2723.296,2723.824,"Well, under our --"
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2723.824,2723.97,But usually it doesn't matter.
1980.80-420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2723.97,2728.291,"-- system the prosecutor has that right, unreviewable and uncontrollable, unless --"
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2728.291,2728.668,Unless it's vindictive --
1980.80-420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2728.668,2729.465,-- unfortunately.
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2729.465,2732.001,"-- like you said, like it has been decided in some other cases."
1980.80-420,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2746.087,2750.051,"Now, all the other magazines and said, “Why weren't they prosecuted?”"
1980.80-420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2750.051,2750.762,Absolutely.
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2750.762,2751.544,"Well, that s the reason."
1980.80-420,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2751.615,2753.746,We can do that thing and do that at the trial.
1980.80-420,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2753.746,2762.057,"Well, in any event, hasn't the highest court of the state resolve this question by saying that there was no improper selection?"
1980.80-420,1,18106,bruce_a_taylor,,2762.057,2762.346,Yes.
1980.80-420,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2819.539,2822.486,Mr. Levander?
1980.80-420,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2822.486,2829.862,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.I would like primarily to address the merits of petitioner's selective prosecution claim."
1980.80-420,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2976.402,2979.314,Is the Government going to try to bring Wilson here?
1980.80-420,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2979.314,2989.502,"Well, he can't, Your Honor, because we prevailed on the merits in the case after they reached the -- so -- but in deciding this jurisdictional issue, I urge the Court to be very aware of this problem."
1980.80-420,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3072.935,3077.405,"That situation, could he select his defendant because of the cartoon he published?"
1980.80-420,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3078.888,3082.179,"No, I think he could select him randomly, and the courts have so held."
1980.80-420,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3082.179,3082.842,But could he?
1980.80-420,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3084.557,3085.689,He could not do it.
1980.80-420,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3085.708,3087.113,You would agree he could not do that?
1980.80-420,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3087.113,3094.89,"If the cartoon is constitutionally protected and he was doing because he was punishing for an exercise of constitutional right, we would agree that would be inappropriate."
1980.80-420,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3094.89,3096.182,"Well, that's not the question."
1980.80-420,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3096.182,3097.368,That's not the question here.
1980.80-420,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3119.341,3121.201,Let me ask you one other question.
1980.80-420,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3131.176,3132.192,I believe it would be if --
1980.80-420,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3132.192,3133.324,It would be if it was one of reason.
1980.80-420,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3136.286,3136.985,That's exactly right.
1980.80-420,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3212.457,3219.294,"He can also pick -- can he, can he pick one he just doesn't like?"
1980.80-420,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3219.294,3221.532,"Well, if he -- then the question goes to me --"
1980.80-420,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3221.532,3231.588,"Say there's ten ad he's going to pick one, and he said, “Well, they're all absolutely equal they're all be valid prosecutions, I'm going to pick the one I like the least.”"
1980.80-420,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3231.588,3235.67,Or in this case the one that defends the prosecutor the most.
1980.80-420,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3235.67,3237.25,"Well, certainly, where he --"
1980.80-420,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3237.25,3241.345,Or what if he had to pick the one that he has the dad most protests about.
1980.80-420,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3241.345,3246.376,"That is entirely appropriate because it's an aim of the criminal law not only to punish, but to deter."
1980.80-420,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3272.629,3280.92,"Well, if he says that, “In my next campaign, I will get further if I go after this magazine rather than another?”"
1980.80-420,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3280.92,3283.367,"Well, one would hope that the prosecutorial decision making was not made on --"
1980.80-420,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3283.367,3289.21,"That isn't what I -- it isn't what I asked you, what about that?"
1980.80-420,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3289.21,3289.4,I don't think --
1980.80-420,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3289.4,3297.156,"Would have us understand that in tax cases and regulatory cases, as you would, in cases involving publications magazine and newspapers?"
1980.80-420,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3297.156,3297.595,"Yes, I --"
1980.80-420,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3297.595,3304.959,"You could say the same breadth of discretion and the prosecutor published -- prosecuting those papers because he doesn't like editorial point of view, for example?"
1980.80-420,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3304.959,3308.765,"Well, that's -- I mean -- they would enforce, obviously -- an obvious First Amendment defenses."
1980.80-420,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3308.765,3311.09,"But under your answer as I understand it, that's perfectly permissible."
1980.80-420,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3311.09,3311.477,But what's he prosecuting him for?
1980.80-420,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3311.477,3313.001,“We don't like the kind of editorials they've been writing we'll prosecute them?

1980.80-420,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3314.336,3315.558,What's he prosecuting him for?
1980.80-420,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3315.558,3316.373,"That's right, that's the question."
1980.80-420,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3317.03,3322.18,"You're prosecuting him for a crime that all the other newspapers are committing the same way, they want to do some (Voice Overlap)"
1980.80-420,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3322.18,3324.455,You can't prosecute him for printing the editorial.

1980.80-420,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3330.616,3333.635,"You're probably prosecuting the newspaper for tax evasion, or for something else."
1980.80-420,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3333.635,3339.531,"And -- and the sole reason that you wouldn't have prosecuted but for a particular editorial, that it seems to me might be inappropriate."
