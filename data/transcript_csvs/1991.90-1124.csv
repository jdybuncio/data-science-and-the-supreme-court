1991.90-1124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.318,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-1124, Keith Jacobson against the United States."
1991.90-1124,0,25717,george_h_moyer_jr,,9.32,11.733,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,139.811,141.794,"Mr. Moyer, refresh my recollection."
1991.90-1124,0,25717,george_h_moyer_jr,,145.767,150.522,--Entrapment was submitted to the jury and they did find--
1991.90-1124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,150.522,151.03,The jury found--
1991.90-1124,0,25717,george_h_moyer_jr,,151.03,153.514,--that the defendant was not entrapped.
1991.90-1124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,155.347,160.228,--But you say that it shouldn't have been up to the jury that there was entrapment as a matter of law?
1991.90-1124,0,25717,george_h_moyer_jr,,160.228,186.568,"There was entrapment as a matter of law, and I say that the jury verdict in this case, Your Honor, is fatally flawed because the Government was permitted to offer to the jury evidence that Mr. Jacobson suffered from a weakness, that he had a sexual desire to look at pictures, sexually explicit pictures of boys, and that he was a homosexual."
1991.90-1124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,189.53,195.045,"Well, why doesn't that tend to prove that he was disposed to commit the crime?"
1991.90-1124,0,25717,george_h_moyer_jr,,204.713,223.973,"--The Government developed this evidence, Your Honor, through sexual survey, attitude surveys and undercover correspondence with Mr. Jacobson after the Government initially included him in the American Hedonist Society."
1991.90-1124,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,235.951,237.163,Is that what the instructions said to the jury?
1991.90-1124,0,25717,george_h_moyer_jr,,237.163,238.455,"No, I don't think it is."
1991.90-1124,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,238.455,241.757,"Well, what did, was there an objection to the jury charge?"
1991.90-1124,0,25717,george_h_moyer_jr,,241.757,245.238,"There was an objection to the jury charge, Your Honor, and there were instructions offered."
1991.90-1124,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,245.238,246.55,About entrapment?
1991.90-1124,0,25717,george_h_moyer_jr,,246.55,247.849,That's right.
1991.90-1124,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,259.836,276.88,"Well, Mr. Moyer, do you take the position that the Government must always prove predisposition in these entrapment cases by establishing events that occurred before the Government started its sting operation?"
1991.90-1124,0,25717,george_h_moyer_jr,,276.88,279.721,"The cases indicate, Your Honor--"
1991.90-1124,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1576.96,1587.789,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1622.149,1626.153,I happened to look through them and most of them are boys standing up all by themselves.
1991.90-1124,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1626.153,1637.854,And yet in the covers on both magazines and in several other of the pictures it is clear that what you have is someone who is posed in a picture in order to focus on the genitalia.
1991.90-1124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1638.805,1640.427,"It's different from what your description was, though."
1991.90-1124,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1640.427,1652.906,"Well, a mere nudist magazine would be, as I am told by the Postal Service, would be a picture, for example, pictures of a nudist colony where you have people, for example, of both genders and all ages in all sorts of activities."
1991.90-1124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1657.28,1661.163,Do you agree that it was not unlawful to purchase them at the time they were purchased?
1991.90-1124,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1661.163,1663.805,"It was not a violation of Federal law, yes."
1991.90-1124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1666.089,1693.097,"May I ask you, since you say that's the short answer to the whole case and since you concede that at that time nothing illegal had transpired, take Justice Kennedy's hypothetical of someone who regularly used marijuana in a foreign country where it was lawful, and you had nothing except that evidence to support the predisposition count if you found the person eventually in possession of marijuana that a Government agent had somehow or other delivered to him."
1991.90-1124,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1697.07,1699.704,"It's sufficient to allow the question to go to the jury, yes."
1991.90-1124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1700.586,1702.589,"It's sufficient to establish it, too, because--"
1991.90-1124,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1702.589,1702.839,--That's right.
1991.90-1124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1717.95,1722.15,--What if he just purchased one item 5 years earlier?
1991.90-1124,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1722.15,1729.516,"Well, that may not be sufficient to show that he possessed with the intent to distribute, which is what you have to make out before you get to the entrapment defense."
1991.90-1124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1729.516,1730.365,But here we don't have an attempt to distribute.
1991.90-1124,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1736.412,1739.113,"Well, it's receipt, not mere possession that we have here."
1991.90-1124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1745.147,1748.969,But of course he hadn't seen the second set of magazines at the time he ordered them.
1991.90-1124,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1748.969,1751.172,"When you say the second set, I'm not sure which ones you mean."
1991.90-1124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1751.172,1752.431,The ones... the crime he committed.
1991.90-1124,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1752.431,1753.502,That's right.
1991.90-1124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1753.502,1759.257,"He had seen the 1984 magazine, but that, he's not being put in jail or punished for that."
1991.90-1124,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1759.257,1759.698,That's correct.
1991.90-1124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1759.698,1763.13,He's being punished for a magazine that he ordered without seeing it.
1991.90-1124,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1763.13,1764.112,"Oh, yes."
1991.90-1124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1826.251,1842.232,"No, I understand that, but I understand your opponent to be arguing that predisposition must rest on some evidence that he was willing to violate the law and had previously, before the Government engaged in the attempt to induce him to engage in this transaction, had previously done something that he thought was illegal."
1991.90-1124,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1852.919,1864.649,"--No, what you're... if what you're asking is do I have any change in the law cases where on day... on a certain day something that was not previously illegal became illegal, I don't have any case dealing with that problem."
1991.90-1124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1870.435,1876.467,"No, you're relying on evidence, and maybe that's enough, of his knowledge after the Government began its program."
1991.90-1124,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1885.376,1885.586,--That's correct.
1991.90-1124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1886.408,1889.561,"And do... well, I understand, but do you have any cases saying it's not required?"
1991.90-1124,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1889.561,1889.891,No.
1991.90-1124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1890.902,1893.383,"So this, whichever way we go we're going to have to make a little new law today."
1991.90-1124,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1893.383,1895.075,"--I suppose, on that point."
1991.90-1124,2,25717,george_h_moyer_jr,,3085.491,3086.951,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1991.90-1124,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3125.197,3133.56,"Well, most of Mr. Justice Roberts' opinion was not approved by the majority in Sorrells."
1991.90-1124,2,25717,george_h_moyer_jr,,3140.665,3147.0,"That's correct, Your Honor, and I don't cite the concurring opinion for that proposition."
1991.90-1124,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3179.511,3202.197,"Mr. Moyer, I've been thinking, if we adopted that proposition that you are urging on us, that it's unlawful for the Government to approach a person unless the Government knows in advance of approaching him that he has the predisposition, then I guess the Government couldn't put an ad in a magazine, you know, that suggested that it has child pornography for sale."
1991.90-1124,2,25717,george_h_moyer_jr,,3210.344,3224.984,"Justice Scalia, I think you have to distinguish between the subparagraph (a) sting that the Attorney General describes in his guidelines and the column (b) sting, or subparagraph (b) sting."
1991.90-1124,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3243.547,3249.524,"I don't see a whole lot of difference between, you know, a throwaway in the mail and an ad in the newspaper."
1991.90-1124,2,25717,george_h_moyer_jr,,3254.055,3261.94,"In this particular instance, Your Honor, it's clear that Mr. Jacobson was the target of a Government undercover operation."
1991.90-1124,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3283.806,3284.537,"Thank you, Mr. Moyer."
