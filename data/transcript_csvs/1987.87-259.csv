1987.87-259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.998,"We will hear arguments first this morning in Number 87-259, Jonna R. Lingle versus Norge Division of Magic Chef."
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,11.981,29.004,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, under Illinois law as in approximately two-thirds of the states an employer may not fire an employee for seeking workers' compensation benefits, and an employee who is thus victimized may seek redress in the state courts."
1987.87-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,255.741,260.974,But there certainly is a right under the collective bargaining agreement in this case.
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,260.974,264.848,There is a right under the collective bargaining--
1987.87-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,264.848,267.096,Which was vindicated.
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,267.096,269.359,--Which was vindicated.
1987.87-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,270.109,271.733,"Namely, there wasn't good cause for discharge."
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,271.733,276.139,The arbitrator found that there was not just cause for discharge in this case.
1987.87-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,276.139,279.169,And you think both causes of action can just go forward?
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,279.169,280.167,That is correct.
1987.87-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,289.743,293.554,And what was the relief that the arbitrator gave?
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,293.554,296.115,The arbitrator gave reinstatement.
1987.87-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,309.127,317.904,"Will the recovery... if you win, will the recovery... would the recovery in a state court action include back pay again, or what?"
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,317.904,329.071,"I assume that state law would provide for some sort of a setoff for interim income, and presumably interim income includes any back pay that was awarded by the arbitrator."
1987.87-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,329.071,329.805,If the state court--
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,329.805,330.898,Unemployment compensation as well.
1987.87-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,330.898,335.256,--If the state court suit goes first you get a complete recovery so you can't arbitrate.
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,335.256,341.848,If the state court action went first it would be unnecessary to arbitrate.
1987.87-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,341.848,343.596,"Well, it would just be barred, I suppose."
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,343.596,346.705,I don't know whether the employer--
1987.87-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,346.705,359.917,So the... but you don't think in the state court action it will ever be necessary to construe the contract or find what--
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,359.917,384.549,"--In this state court action it will certainly not be necessary, not only because there has already been an arbitral ruling, but also because the defense that has been raised by the company to the state law claim is that she filed a false claim, and whether or not it is necessary... whether or not that is a sufficient defense under a state law, one can decide whether it is a false claim without looking at the collective bargaining agreement."
1987.87-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,386.018,394.201,"--What if the arbitrator had found there was just cause for discharge, that this workmen's compensation claim was false?"
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,398.573,404.196,Then I would say that... the Illinois state courts haven't yet decided--
1987.87-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,404.196,405.134,"Well, what do you think?"
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,408.226,412.209,--I think that just as one can relitigate the cause of action--
1987.87-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,412.209,412.553,Yes or no?
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,413.521,427.75,"--Yes, you can, just as you can relitigate the cause of action with respect to an independent federal claim, for example, under Title VII, as the Court held in Gardner-Denver, just as one can relitigate the Fair Labor Standards Act claim, as the Court--"
1987.87-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,427.75,446.117,"--So in effect you are saying that the... it is just, what, contrary to federal law or to state law to permit a discharge on a false claim?"
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,446.117,454.504,"--Let me step back a moment, because in using the word ""relitigate"" the claim I think I conceded a bit too much."
1987.87-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,465.359,474.277,"The state law claim, however, I suppose it would be a good defense to a state action if the claim were false."
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,474.277,475.089,I don't know.
1987.87-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,477.323,478.603,"Well, what would you think?"
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,479.525,482.039,--In Gonzalez v. Prestress--
1987.87-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,482.039,489.178,"Assume it was a good defense, and the arbitrator has found that it was a false claim."
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,492.052,501.766,--I would say that it would be up to the state courts as a matter of state law to decide whether to adopt the same approach that this Court has adopted in Gardner-Denver.
1987.87-259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,522.257,535.003,"But even if there were some sort of of federal principle that required the state court to give collateral estoppel effect to the finding that the claim has been false, that would not affect your basic preemption argument, I take it."
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,535.003,538.814,I--
1987.87-259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,538.814,553.573,"I mean, the suit for discriminatory discharge for invoking the workmen's comp could still proceed even though the state court might have to treat a particular finding on that point as binding for factual purposes."
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,553.573,554.713,"--Yes, I understand."
1987.87-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,561.523,564.569,What about collateral estoppel vice versa?
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,573.815,578.485,I don't... I don't know.
1987.87-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,584.732,590.715,We usually don't go around trying the same fact twice in two separate proceedings and coming out different ways.
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,590.715,601.085,"--If you have two separate... two different jurisdictions and two separate claims, for example, in the Gardner-Denver type... Gardner-Denver was a claim which was... went forward in two different fora."
1987.87-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,614.346,623.186,But did they speak to whether any common factual issues that had been decided in one proceeding could be... that determination could be disregarded in the other?
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,623.186,628.636,"They didn't say disregarded, but they also didn't say it was accepted as conclusive."
1987.87-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,636.649,645.239,So you think the arbitrator might be able to ignore the state court judgment as to what the facts were?
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,648.519,657.578,"I don't know whether the full faith and credit clause, for example, would govern an arbitral determination through Section 301."
1987.87-259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,684.036,691.22,"Isn't your correct answer suggested by the Chief Justice's question, that what we have is an issue of preemption, not of collateral estoppe?"
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,694.375,697.155,That is certainly not this case.
1987.87-259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,923.314,924.641,I have a question.
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,955.442,968.607,"I would say no, that would certainly be a more explicit waiver, but then the question is, can the employer and the union contract themselves out of the procedures provided by state law, and I would say no."
1987.87-259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,968.607,998.331,"I know you have these federal precedents, but do you have any case holding that a state law claim like this cannot be waived by... we had a case under the Federal Arbitration Act a couple of years ago where they held that an employee's claim of some kind, even though California law said it could not be waived, the Court held that the Federal Arbitration Act applied, and the waiver was valid, so why wouldn't the reasoning of that case apply in the labor context as well?"
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,998.331,1001.5,The Federal Arbitration Act explicitly excludes contracts of employment--
1987.87-259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1001.5,1002.0,I understand.
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1002.0,1002.641,--in interstate commerce.
1987.87-259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1002.641,1003.219,I understand.
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1003.219,1006.093,And although... certainly in some of the--
1987.87-259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1006.093,1016.541,"But my point is, it seems to me the policy favoring arbitration in the union context is at least as strong as the policy favoring arbitration implemented by the Federal Arbitration Act."
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1016.541,1026.382,--But the waiver in that case at least has been made by the individual employee in an individual contract of employment.
1987.87-259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1026.382,1036.549,"Yes, but you certainly wouldn't say that a collective bargaining agent doesn't have the same authority to represent the individual employee in bargaining the terms of employment."
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1036.549,1043.249,Not with respect to bargaining away non-negotiable rights that the state has decided should be non-negotiable.
1987.87-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1131.385,1179.085,"Mr. Levy, so I can understand your position, I assume you would say our decision last term in Heckler, which involved a state statute that sought to impose liability for breach of a state... state-imposed duty arising from the contractual relationship of a union with the employees that it represents through the contract with the employer, you would say that that case would have come out differently if the state law had simply read every union shall have an obligation to provide for the safety of its employees on the job, assuming that that law would pass muster under the National Labor Relations Act."
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1179.085,1183.037,It would certainly not be preempted by Section 301.
1987.87-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1186.581,1188.128,That the NLRA doesn't allow.
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1188.128,1193.048,"--beyond those which 8(b)(1)(A) imposes on unions, and whether that is somehow inconsistent with the policy behind (8)(b)(1)(A)."
1987.87-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1193.048,1199.202,So the key is simply whether the state law springs into operation by reason of the contract or not.
1987.87-259,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1199.202,1201.201,"Under Section 301, yes."
1987.87-259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1201.201,1204.637,"Thank you, Mr. Levy."
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,1207.166,1235.359,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case is whether a state court judge or legislature may provide employees a cause of action for wrongful discharge when those employees are covered by the grievance arbitration procedures of a collective bargaining agreement and the employee's claim is unquestionably arbitrable under the terms of that agreement."
1987.87-259,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1285.918,1297.428,"Incidentally, counsel, you began by saying the question was whether or not a wrongful discharge cause of action can be prosecuted or is preempted, but this is a retaliatory discharge."
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,1299.458,1324.573,"We think that the retaliatory discharge claim in Illinois as it is so labeled in Illinois is simply another species of wrongful discharge tort, and I use the phrase to illustrate the point that I think... we think it is destructive of the policies informing Section 301 to allow states to single out a variety of causes of action that were meant to be grist in the mills of the arbitrators under the labor agreements, and that is why I use that term."
1987.87-259,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1324.573,1332.476,And it is improper to single out retaliatory acts for insisting on workmen's compensation rights?
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,1332.476,1339.771,"Yes, we say that that claim, that cause of action deals directly with employment rights."
1987.87-259,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1381.035,1392.531,"What if the union and the employer set out to say, you know, we are really going to have a comprehensive agreement here, we are going to provide for benefits in case you are injured on the job."
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,1400.574,1406.759,"No, I think the state in that situation can enforce its workmen's compensation."
1987.87-259,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1406.759,1411.459,Why is one different from the other if each situation is covered by the collective bargaining agreement?
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,1411.459,1427.094,"Because in that situation this Court has recognized, even in the Oliver decision, on which we place a lot of reliance, that state laws dealing with health and safety matters have historically been those that the Court has recognized where the state has a lot of leeway."
1987.87-259,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1461.518,1474.933,"Well, but in a workmen's compensation case you can certainly say it proposed smooth, speedy adjustment of grievances under the contract, and the contract gives the person the same rights they have against the employer as the Illinois law would."
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,1474.933,1477.557,--I think it could.
1987.87-259,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1489.85,1497.315,"But it is only demonstrably health and safety laws, not other important concerns of state public policy."
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,1497.315,1500.688,The states have the most latitude with respect to health and safety laws.
1987.87-259,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1516.792,1520.104,Is workmen's compensation a health and safety law?
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,1520.104,1531.927,"I think it is, and the reason why I am saying that the states have more latitude with respect to workers' compensation, I don't want to say that they have complete latitude."
1987.87-259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1597.493,1602.961,I assume that would apply to state minimum wage laws.
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,1605.584,1609.427,"That is of the type this Court was referring to, I think, in the Metropolitan Life case."
1987.87-259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1634.541,1637.649,They don't have latitude with respect to workmen's compensation?
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,1643.928,1646.083,"--We would agree with that, Your Honor."
1987.87-259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1646.083,1648.707,"But they do have latitude... you see, you--"
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,1648.707,1654.408,The employer and the union don't have latitude to contract out of workers' compensation.
1987.87-259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1654.408,1654.627,--Right.
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,1675.508,1679.648,I think I would respectfully disagree with that viewpoint.
1987.87-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1747.464,1755.773,But that sort of argument would mean that the state couldn't apply its minimum wage law.
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,1755.773,1758.725,"--No, I think, Justice White, that--"
1987.87-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1758.725,1760.943,"Well, look at all these other rights you get."
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,1760.943,1766.659,"--I think that is just simply in a different category, and it is part of the case--"
1987.87-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1766.659,1768.877,So you can't contract out of the minimum wage law.
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,1768.877,1770.236,--We would agree with that.
1987.87-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1770.236,1771.267,"Well, here is a state--"
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,1771.267,1771.845,And we also--
1987.87-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1771.845,1794.758,"--Here is a state law that says, if you commit this tort you are going to get actual damages, punitive damages, whatever it is, and now the union and the employer say, well, if you commit this... if you commit this act which is a tort under state law, all you are going to get is back pay."
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,1801.443,1804.582,"--No, I think the minimum wage law is different for two reasons."
1987.87-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1834.71,1849.86,"Let me ask you, preemption of state causes of action is... occurs because of some evil that non-preemption would cause."
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,1857.716,1858.295,I think that's right.
1987.87-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1860.09,1868.557,How can enforcing the state law in this case have a different construction and meaning to the collective bargaining contract?
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,1877.146,1878.223,--I think in a sense--
1987.87-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1878.223,1879.301,It is just a fact question.
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,1879.301,1881.801,"--No, I disagree with that."
1987.87-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1888.314,1888.72,Yes.
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,1888.72,1890.063,You don't need the contract to know that.
1987.87-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1905.698,1906.104,Right.
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,1906.104,1912.492,"And to the extent there is contractual just cause, that militates against a finding that there was impermissible motive."
1987.87-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1912.492,1915.381,"Yes, but it isn't a construction as to what is just cause."
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,1920.082,1924.706,I don't think it's necessarily just whether it is a false claim or not.
1987.87-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2009.078,2012.185,Which she would get if the action went forward in state court.
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,2012.185,2013.419,"Well, if she won."
1987.87-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2013.419,2015.809,Let's assume that she won.
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,2017.84,2021.089,"Well, she could seek that and a state court judge would have the power to award that."
1987.87-259,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2146.506,2149.786,"What do you mean by a minimum labor standard, Mr. Jackson?"
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,2153.77,2154.035,--Right.
1987.87-259,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2163.843,2165.013,"Well, but you used the term."
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,2168.653,2176.916,"--What I mean are those types of laws that this Court has picked over on a case-by-case basis such as those promoting public health and safety, child labor again--"
1987.87-259,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2176.916,2180.399,Picked over on a case-by-case basis in what sort of cases?
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,2180.399,2218.727,"--In the Metropolitan Life case, for example, the Court stated that laws protecting public health and safety would be preserved, child labor, minimum wages, those types of laws, occupational safety and health perhaps, and this, we would say, is consistent with our reading of Oliver, because even Oliver, which was a broad statement of Section 301 preemption, we would maintain, not National Labor Relations Act preemption, even Oliver said that perhaps those types of laws, health and safety laws, would be exempt from Section 301 preemption or federal labor preemption."
1987.87-259,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2218.727,2222.554,Certainly Metropolitan Life said so in really no uncertain terms.
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,2222.554,2226.177,"Metropolitan Life said so, but I think this raises another point."
1987.87-259,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2355.936,2359.717,But isn't that a rather unlikely possibility?
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,2366.87,2384.113,"That is one of the ironies in this case, because the reason why those exclusions are there, and in the cases we cite in our brief where they don't recognize the state cause of action that the petitioner asserts, the irony is, is because those states feel that such a claim would be preempted, so it is sort of a circular thing."
1987.87-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2399.592,2403.26,Are state causes of action for libel preempted?
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,2408.572,2411.571,--I think generally not.
1987.87-259,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2420.894,2425.69,But it is hardly either health or safety under your rather narrow definition of those terms.
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,2425.69,2430.376,"I think you are right, Chief Justice."
1987.87-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2638.088,2654.8,"Arbitration is a matter of agreement, and I suppose your client may resist agreeing to arbitration in the future if all these causes of action are going to go on to state court."
1987.87-259,1,19298,charles_c_jackson,,2654.8,2666.998,"--I think that's precisely correct, and the problem with that is that in terms of national labor policy, it is going to depend upon the strength of the parties in any given bargaining situation."
1987.87-259,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2767.926,2770.299,"Thank you, Mr. Jackson."
1987.87-259,2,38080,paul_alan_levy,,2772.236,2775.797,"Unless the Court has any questions, I have nothing else to say."
1987.87-259,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2775.797,2777.5,Very well.
