1990.90-906,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.39,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 90-906, Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority v. Citizens for the Abatement of Aircraft Noise."
1990.90-906,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,12.251,15.895,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-906,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,229.445,256.493,"Mr. Shapiro, by the same logic I suppose you would be... you're defending an effort by Congress to structure some kind of board of review with effective veto power, as this board has, over, for instance, the Federal funding of aid to the States for transportation or health services or welfare benefits, or anything else that the Federal Government provides money for."
1990.90-906,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,270.565,275.405,"Your Honor, we believe that this branch of the analysis doesn't solve the problem."
1990.90-906,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,288.295,303.585,"Well, Congress certainly had a gun pointed at the heads of Virginia and the District of Columbia, which wanted to establish an airport authority, and Congress said fine, you can do it but you're going to give us the veto in effect."
1990.90-906,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,303.585,311.182,"--But we believe, Your Honor, that in terms of this Court's analysis and in terms of practical realities it was an offer they could refuse."
1990.90-906,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,335.089,337.729,"Why does it just pose it, Mr. Shapiro?"
1990.90-906,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,343.305,347.539,"Well, there are... there are two possible conceptual approaches to this, Your Honor."
1990.90-906,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,371.975,376.73,"Well, but there... which is to say that there is Federal power being exercised."
1990.90-906,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,382.674,386.027,"Well, the Federal power takes the form of a condition."
1990.90-906,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,398.055,401.009,So you say there is Federal power being exercised in the form of a condition.
1990.90-906,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,401.009,402.129,"By Congress, yes."
1990.90-906,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,402.129,402.59,Oh.
1990.90-906,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,405.583,405.731,"No, I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1990.90-906,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,426.227,430.469,"Well, I mean, nobody contests that the statute that Congress passed is an exercise of Federal power."
1990.90-906,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,433.123,434.011,--That's correct.
1990.90-906,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,436.584,438.927,"Well, Congress certainly had the power to pass the statute."
1990.90-906,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,438.927,439.408,"--Yes, it did."
1990.90-906,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,440.096,441.027,"Well, then that's the end of the case."
1990.90-906,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,451.735,470.308,I think what is left is the question that Justice O'Connor raises about whether or not Congress may properly use conditions like this attached to Federal statutes as a way of effectively usurping executive authority.
1990.90-906,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,470.308,479.465,"But it's not... that would be a valid argument if they were using the condition in order, unconstitutionally, to exercise Federal power."
1990.90-906,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,495.317,505.452,"We... well, what we are concerned about... first of all we believe that in this case what exercise of Federal power there was did not violate the Constitution."
1990.90-906,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,564.463,576.032,"Just to finish up your response to Justice O'Connor, do I understand that the Government's only problem, the executive branch's only problem with this statute is a federalism problem, not a separation of powers problem?"
1990.90-906,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,580.907,581.057,No.
1990.90-906,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,621.965,622.514,"Well, Mr. Shapiro--"
1990.90-906,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,638.055,639.487,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-906,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,693.503,710.124,"I suppose if you interpreted the Constitution that way, a senator who has to be a citizen to be elected, should he abandon his American citizenship during his 6-year term, could continue to serve, because it's only a qualification for taking the office and not for continuing in it?"
1990.90-906,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,710.124,718.22,I... I don't know whether the language of that is identical to the language here.
1990.90-906,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,720.613,727.068,"But Mr. Shapiro, even on that assumption, does that really answer the issue that Justice O'Connor raised?"
1990.90-906,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,756.519,759.962,"--We don't think with respect to removal that it is, Your Honor."
1990.90-906,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,764.796,773.172,"No, but with respect to the authority that they exercise in their approval or disapproval power over the actions of the board."
1990.90-906,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,773.172,773.322,Oh.
1990.90-906,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,794.18,796.093,And I took it that was one of the concerns in her question--
1990.90-906,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,796.093,796.491,Yes.
1990.90-906,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,796.491,798.484,--as to whether a similar structure could be erected--
1990.90-906,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,798.484,798.614,"Yes, yes."
1990.90-906,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,798.614,801.717,"--in relation to welfare money to the States, highway money to the States, and so on."
1990.90-906,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,802.688,815.187,"Well, our answer to that is that in the unusual circumstances of this case we don't think the members of the Board of Review themselves are exercising congressional power or acting as agents of Congress."
1990.90-906,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,833.82,838.504,"Mr. Shapiro, are they representatives of all users or of users who have free parking spaces?"
1990.90-906,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,842.785,843.406,Both.
1990.90-906,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,843.406,845.089,You think they are typical users?
1990.90-906,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,845.089,850.111,There is no question that the parking spaces were a matter of some interest.
1990.90-906,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,853.433,854.725,But not to other users.
1990.90-906,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,854.725,867.444,"But they also have interests that are shared more broadly by all users, and indeed the legislative history suggests that they are concerned with their need to use the airport as individuals."
1990.90-906,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,875.118,876.91,"Thank you, Mr. Shapiro."
1990.90-906,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,878.723,898.465,"Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-906,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,972.844,988.335,"Well, Mr. Coleman, isn't the reality, though, that the members of the board are required to be Members of Congress, or at least a certain number of them, and they have to be members of a certain committee of Congress?"
1990.90-906,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1003.774,1005.857,"No, Your Honor, with all due respect."
1990.90-906,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1011.232,1011.843,Um-hum.
1990.90-906,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1011.843,1018.827,The speaker suggests the name.
1990.90-906,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1056.36,1065.597,"Mr. Coleman, as I understand your position, the phrase that these people shall act in their personal capacity cleanses it all."
1990.90-906,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1082.04,1085.762,"--Well, Your Honor, that would make it a harder case."
1990.90-906,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1086.069,1087.0,It would make it a different case.
1990.90-906,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1090.393,1091.973,"--Well, it may be harder, some of them... one of the--"
1990.90-906,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1091.973,1092.264,No--
1990.90-906,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1094.096,1095.547,--So that's a harder case.
1990.90-906,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1205.411,1224.263,"Mr. Coleman, in your research of, among the doings of the founders, that it is clear that people could hold both Federal and State office, but is there anyone who said that you could hold State office or be nominated to State office by virtue of your Federal office?"
1990.90-906,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1234.21,1235.372,"Well, Your Honor, that's not this case here."
1990.90-906,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1236.583,1248.09,"--I know it isn't, but this is a case where it is not just Federal officials who happen to run for State office or get appointed separately for, independently of their being Federal officials."
1990.90-906,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1255.569,1257.619,"--No, but there is in your cases, Your Honor."
1990.90-906,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1285.318,1287.26,"Well, you're not blaming me for that, Mr. Coleman."
1990.90-906,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1288.67,1293.886,"Well, I think you would know more about that case than the other people because you dissented."
1990.90-906,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1293.886,1299.59,But of course there was no question in that case that they were exercising Federal power.
1990.90-906,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1319.378,1330.234,"Well, the nine persons are selected from the group of 107 Congressmen and 47 Senators."
1990.90-906,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1338.719,1350.49,"Well, but as a practical matter a Congressman's powers during the time he is in office as a Congressman, his committee assignments, his perks, are all controlled by the Speaker."
1990.90-906,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1363.329,1368.063,"Well, but they, but the statute says no, he serves in his individual capacity."
1990.90-906,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1378.169,1396.702,"But, Mr. Coleman, all of our separation of powers jurisprudence looks to the practical effect of the constraints and the compulsions and the authority that a Federal agency has over its own officials, and in this case the Federal entity is the Congress."
1990.90-906,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1396.702,1398.124,"Well, can we look to the practical?"
1990.90-906,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1433.087,1437.859,But this Courts sits to protect the executive against its own improvidence from time to time.
1990.90-906,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1438.66,1439.211,"Yes, sir."
1990.90-906,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1456.942,1462.248,"Yes, but in the legislative veto cases the executive from time to time has taken the position that veto was all right, I think, had he not?"
1990.90-906,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1462.248,1462.859,--Yes.
1990.90-906,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1463.6,1464.442,In the one that was argued here.
1990.90-906,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1464.442,1467.436,--But the Chadha case he stood at the bar of this Court--
1990.90-906,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1467.436,1467.634,Right.
1990.90-906,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1467.634,1468.415,--and said it wasn't all right.
1990.90-906,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1468.415,1468.946,Yeah.
1990.90-906,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1468.946,1470.876,In addition--
1990.90-906,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1470.876,1474.129,It just shows the executive's views on these issues can change in different administrations.
1990.90-906,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1474.129,1474.85,--They can change.
1990.90-906,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1496.815,1499.156,"Very well, Mr. Coleman."
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,1501.477,1507.143,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-906,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1610.686,1634.661,"Ms. Goldman, what if instead of the transaction we have here Congress had simply said we're going to give a year-to-year lease to the Metropolitan Airports Authority, no Members of Congress on the review board at all, but the review board totally independent decides to abolish parking places for Members of Congress and Justices of the Supreme Court."
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,1654.683,1661.859,There would be not... no official ongoing role that Members of Congress play.
1990.90-906,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1679.182,1692.592,"Of course if Congress wanted to renew the lease, if Congress was content with the parking spaces it got but the executive was not content because the executive had not gotten parking spaces, the President could veto the lease renewal in that situation, couldn't he?"
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,1697.816,1700.538,"Assuming that statute was required, then the President would have that power."
1990.90-906,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1700.538,1706.004,--It's quite a different process than just having some individual Members of Congress or a committee of Congress decide to do it or not.
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,1706.004,1709.885,"It's a very different process, and that's precisely what's wrong with this arrangement."
1990.90-906,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1747.651,1753.066,"You say assigned it to nine of their Members, but it does provide that the Members are to act in their individual capacity."
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,1753.066,1762.263,"It does, but that label does not change the fact that the board must consist of nine Members, that they must be recommended by the congressional leadership."
1990.90-906,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1762.263,1769.389,"What do you do about the Chief Justice being on the board of the Smithsonian, being chairman of the board of the Smithsonian, which goes back quite a ways?"
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,1769.389,1776.545,"We certainly don't want to be accused of laying a hand on the arc of the covenant, as Justice Holmes said, and fortunately I don't think we have to in this case."
1990.90-906,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1784.103,1785.154,"They're artistic powers, is that--"
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,1786.696,1801.439,"--I'm not familiar with the day-to-day functions that the board would exercise, but it may be that those powers are not as significant to be a Federal office under the laws of the United States, so Members of Congress may be able to exercise those functions."
1990.90-906,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1826.303,1828.214,"Let me ask you a question, Ms. Goldman."
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,1842.185,1849.858,I believe that their appointment and service is inextricably tied to their role as a Member of Congress.
1990.90-906,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1849.858,1857.853,"Well, what distinction are we talking about here then, between acting in one's individual capacity and one's presumably official capacity?"
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,1858.955,1864.839,"Well, in the Federal scheme Members of Congress only have one identity, and that is their official role."
1990.90-906,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1880.811,1894.518,So you would have no issue to raise by the mere fact that some Members of Congress happen to end up on this board if it were not for the fact that membership on the board... that membership in Congress is a qualification for membership on the board?
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,1907.919,1915.403,"If Members of Congress are appointed to a State office, they are not serving as Members of Congress but are clearly serving in an individual capacity."
1990.90-906,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1915.403,1916.935,And their congressional membership is merely incidental.
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,1922.521,1929.657,"It is both the qualification, the requirement that they be Members of Congress, and also that that requirement came at least in part from Congress."
1990.90-906,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1940.384,1947.588,And why isn't the same... why doesn't the same problem exist for the congressional members of the Smithsonian?
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,1947.588,1954.885,It may not because the powers they exercise may not be as significant of a type of executive power--
1990.90-906,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1954.885,1956.644,"Well, what if the power is the power of a board?"
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,1956.644,1960.288,--It may be then a power that they cannot exercise.
1990.90-906,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1974.549,1987.977,Do you take the position that a member of the Board of Review loses the membership if the member ceases to be a member of the appropriate congressional committee?
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,1987.977,1989.459,"Yes, we do."
1990.90-906,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2007.733,2011.504,Is the removal point essential to your argument?
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2011.504,2012.295,It is not.
1990.90-906,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2020.389,2025.522,"Ms. Goldman, are you familiar with the national historical publications in the Records Commission?"
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2025.522,2026.975,"No, I am not."
1990.90-906,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2026.975,2043.858,"Well, this is set up by statute, and it provides that on this, which I assume is an arm of the executive, there shall be one judicial member appointed by the Chief Justice, one Member of the House of Representatives, and one Member of the Senate."
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2047.511,2052.704,"If its functions are advisory, it would certainly not be invalid."
1990.90-906,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2066.094,2067.005,Which you don't know.
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2067.005,2067.813,Which I don't know.
1990.90-906,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2067.813,2071.565,"Well, the Chief Justice has served on it and so have I and--"
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2071.565,2090.699,"Certainly the service of judges would not be prohibited under a decision in this case striking down the Board of Review, since there is no incompatibility clause for judges and there would be no aggrandizement if Congress required by statute that judges serve in this type of arrangement."
1990.90-906,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2114.157,2123.371,"--But they'd have to do it by statute, and they would have to get the President to sign it or override his veto, wouldn't they?"
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2123.371,2124.954,True.
1990.90-906,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2128.366,2133.98,"And you would say if the President willingly signed it and thought it was a good arrangement, it would still be invalid in your view?"
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2133.98,2145.309,"Yes, it would be, because the doctrine of separation of powers is not designed simply to protect the executive branch, in fact its primary purpose is to protect the people against arbitrary exercises of power."
1990.90-906,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2145.309,2150.161,And tell me how that is implicated in this case.
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2150.161,2159.948,In this case the respondents are individuals and organizations that represent individuals who are affected on a daily basis by the operations at National Airport.
1990.90-906,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2163.9,2167.643,"Well, protecting the executive here isn't about to cure your problem."
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2167.643,2169.544,--It's not about protecting the executive.
1990.90-906,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2170.906,2172.568,All it will do is delay.
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2172.568,2182.023,--It might do more than that by requiring that the Airports Authority take its actions through a democratic process as required by the Constitution.
1990.90-906,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2188.928,2198.024,"Well, if Congress had retained power over the airport, it could expand the airport with the... and the executive could go along?"
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2198.024,2199.824,It could do that.
1990.90-906,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2204.508,2217.068,"As you quoted in your brief, the problem with that is that Congress would have to pay for it, as you had an excerpt from some of the debate in which a Congressman said the beauty of it is that we control it but we don't have to pay for it."
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2217.068,2218.287,Exactly.
1990.90-906,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2290.256,2300.414,So is the federalism problem as you see it that Congress has had a hand in creating the very position to which they are directing the congressional appointment?
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2300.414,2300.955,Yes.
1990.90-906,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2309.971,2314.475,So do you say that this board is really created by Federal law?
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2314.475,2316.746,--It is mandated by a condition.
1990.90-906,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2341.023,2349.859,Do you think if there were a 1983 suit against members of the board that it would be an appropriate defense that they are Federal officers?
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2349.859,2359.055,"In this situation, because Congress retains significant Federal powers, I think they are Federal officers."
1990.90-906,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2372.065,2379.311,"Well, I suppose you can concede without sacrificing your position that they're both, both State and Federal."
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2379.311,2383.435,"I know no precedent for that, but I assume they have aspects of both."
1990.90-906,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2408.171,2422.931,"Ms. Goldman, do you think this statute offends more against separation of powers within the Federal Government or more against federalism, Federal-State relationships?"
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2422.931,2427.055,--This case concerns the Federal separation of powers.
1990.90-906,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2427.055,2432.18,We're not talking about federalism then in the sense of South Dakota against Dole?
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2432.18,2438.685,"I don't think we are, because in the kind of condition that was at issue in that case there was a question of who had the power."
1990.90-906,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2478.294,2494.852,"So you see there would be no problem if Congress said that every State university which obtained Federal funds should have a board of regents, five, six of whom are appointed by the President of the United States?"
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2494.852,2498.907,I think there would be a problem in that situation.
1990.90-906,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2500.667,2500.827,What would be the problem?
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2500.827,2505.671,--that the Federal Government is usurping State power in that instance.
1990.90-906,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2505.671,2507.723,"Well, why isn't that same problem present here?"
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2507.723,2514.037,Here there is a stronger Federal interest at the outset because of the presence of Federal property in this arrangement.
1990.90-906,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2521.043,2527.568,"Well, I assume the President would say the, and the Congress the same thing with expenditure of Federal funds at State universities."
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2527.568,2541.085,"--If Congress set up a review board that had power over the Federal monies, the connection to the Federal interest may be strong enough for the Federal doctrine of separation of powers to be called into play."
1990.90-906,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2553.644,2563.862,"But isn't the justification in each case the fact that there is Federal property in the form of Federal money going, and that these are conditions placed upon the Federal money."
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2566.296,2574.59,"I don't think they necessarily do, because Congress can pass a statute setting out the conditions that are attached to the use of Federal money."
1990.90-906,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2576.27,2587.479,Isn't the difference that the... we're not talking about a condition set once and for all by Congress which is binding because it is... it has statutory significance.
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2593.491,2595.134,--That is the... precisely the difference.
1990.90-906,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2595.895,2601.298,Don't we have that in both the State university example and the highway funds example?
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2601.298,2615.706,"--If Congress sets up an ongoing role over the Federal funds or the Federal property, then it is going too far, and that is Federal power that cannot go to Members of Congress."
1990.90-906,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2615.706,2615.847,Okay.
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2622.303,2627.428,As soon as there is an on-going role by the Federal Government it is a Federal separation of powers issue.
1990.90-906,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2627.428,2627.699,Okay.
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2632.003,2632.143,No.
1990.90-906,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2633.425,2633.565,Okay.
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2633.565,2635.546,--that comes up in that context.
1990.90-906,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2642.171,2644.883,Okay.
1990.90-906,2,37926,patti_goldman,,2644.883,2647.526,If there are no further questions--
1990.90-906,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2647.526,2649.898,"Thank you, Ms. Goldman."
1990.90-906,3,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2654.501,2656.422,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.90-906,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2813.441,2816.474,"Thank you, Mr. Coleman."
