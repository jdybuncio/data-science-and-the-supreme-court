1985.84-782,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,18.196,"Mr. St. Clair, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.84-782,0,29774,james_d_st_clair,,18.196,23.897,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-782,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,386.282,398.183,"Mr. St. Clair, is there a common law restraint against alienation by Indian tribes in their tribal lands?"
1985.84-782,0,29774,james_d_st_clair,,398.183,409.647,"I think, Justice O'Connor, I think in Oneida 2, this Court recently discussed an underlying common law."
1985.84-782,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,409.647,432.935,"That was my understanding, and so what I want to ask you is, do you think the statute here, Section 935, affected the common law restraints against alienation, because by its terms it says that statutes of the United States that affect Indians will be inapplicable."
1985.84-782,0,29774,james_d_st_clair,,437.433,444.914,"If Your Honor please, I think the answer is as follows."
1985.84-782,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,486.773,497.846,"Well, is your response that Section 935, even though it says, only statutes of the United States, means something more than that?"
1985.84-782,0,29774,james_d_st_clair,,497.846,515.073,"Yes, in this case, because the statute that we're interested in embodies and is a codification of the common law, so to in effect repeal that statute, you make that common law, what's embodied in that statute, non-applicable and clearly Congress had that in mind."
1985.84-782,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,515.073,522.211,"But if common law restraint exists separate and apart from the statutory one, that argument--"
1985.84-782,0,29774,james_d_st_clair,,522.211,525.054,I don't think it exists separate and apart.
1985.84-782,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,618.594,646.317,"--Mr. St. Clair, Judge Butzner in his opinion for the majority of the Court of Appeals referred to something that happened, I guess before the enactment of the Act itself, where he says an Indian expressed concern about the tribes' treaty reservation claim against South Carolina but a Bureau BIA officer assured him that any claim the Catawbas had against the state would not be jeopardized by carrying out a program with the federal government."
1985.84-782,0,29774,james_d_st_clair,,646.317,664.169,"Early in the 1900's, representatives of the Catawbas called upon representatives of the BIA, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the record I think is only fairly interpreted to mean they said, what about our rights under the Non-Intercourse Act."
1985.84-782,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,739.919,758.662,"Well, Judge Butzner apparently felt that comment was applicable in interpreting the meaning of congressional legislation, some assurance had been given to he Indians that if they made this deal with the federal government it wouldn't affect their claim against the state."
1985.84-782,0,29774,james_d_st_clair,,758.662,774.078,"--I think, if Your Honor please, the reference you are now making is a reference to the discussions previous to the memorandum of understanding of 1943, <forty-three odd> [= 43-odd] years later."
1985.84-782,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,774.078,777.124,He says this happened in 1958.
1985.84-782,0,29774,james_d_st_clair,,777.124,781.513,"Well, also again in 1958."
1985.84-782,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1281.747,1285.464,"Excuse me, can I interrupt you on your grammatical demonstration."
1985.84-782,0,29774,james_d_st_clair,,1299.412,1301.224,The members of the tribe.
1985.84-782,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1301.224,1307.955,"So, the ""their"" referred to members of the tribe, why couldn't later ""theirs"" and ""thems"" also refer to members of the tribe?"
1985.84-782,0,29774,james_d_st_clair,,1307.955,1319.372,"--Well, because ""Indians"" and ""tribe"" are used interchangeably in legislation such as this, and have been for many years in respect to other statutes."
1985.84-782,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1334.085,1337.865,"Well, maybe you're right as a matter of overall... in comparing it with another statute."
1985.84-782,0,29774,james_d_st_clair,,1344.643,1352.859,"Well, all I can say is, even the Non-Intercourse Act uses Indians and tribes as being co-terminous, meaning the same thing."
1985.84-782,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1568.944,1572.927,--Did the Court of Appeals pass on this state statute of limitations?
1985.84-782,0,29774,james_d_st_clair,,1572.927,1577.534,"I don't believe they did, to this extent in any event."
1985.84-782,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1761.147,1774.61,Mr. Miller.
1985.84-782,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,1774.61,1784.903,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1985.84-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2181.135,2186.149,"Where does that appear in the record, the 1763 claim being discussed at that time?"
1985.84-782,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2186.149,2187.992,They did not--
1985.84-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2187.992,2189.71,They didn't identify it?
1985.84-782,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2189.71,2191.164,"--No, Your Honor."
1985.84-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2195.723,2202.549,Is there anything in those contemporaneous papers that indicates that what they were referring to was the 17683 claim?
1985.84-782,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2202.549,2208.656,There is nothing in the 1959 Act legislative history.
1985.84-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2208.656,2212.358,Or the minutes of the meeting of the tribe in March of <fifty-eight> [= '58]?
1985.84-782,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2212.358,2229.446,"No, Your Honor, but the record in this case does reveal quite clearly, we believe, that that was as Mr. St. Clair referred, the tribe's shorthand method of referring to its treaty claim, the word ""claim"" against the state."
1985.84-782,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2722.06,2726.917,"Well, the argument is that the notice is on the face of the statute itself."
1985.84-782,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2726.917,2753.531,"I understand that, Justice O'Connor, and it's simply our position that that's not a very strong argument because the face of the statute itself, the Act as it was enacted, is the Act that was read to the Indians, and assured by their Congressmen and by the <BIA>[= BIA] that it did not... that it carried out the intent of their resolution--"
1985.84-782,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2753.531,2843.026,I'm not sure I understand what you're saying.
1985.84-782,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2845.698,2862.582,"--Well, what I'm saying is that there are incidents of Indian title, one of which if the freedom from the operation of state law defenses based upon the passage of time."
1985.84-782,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2864.299,2869.015,"Unless Congress had provided otherwise, which on occasion it has?"
1985.84-782,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2869.015,2870.14,--That's correct.
1985.84-782,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2870.14,2873.421,So the question is whether Congress provided otherwise here.
1985.84-782,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2873.421,2874.53,That's correct.
1985.84-782,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2874.53,2877.637,The language is rather clear.
1985.84-782,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2880.62,2893.866,"Your Honor, when Congress has intended to apply a statute of limitations alone, it has expressly said so, as it did in 29 U.S.C. Section 2415."
1985.84-782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2893.866,2902.127,But the purpose of Congress applying the statute of limitations... it's a question of Congress withdrawing a status which prevented the state statute from running.
1985.84-782,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2902.127,2920.917,"Well, I understand that that's the issue, Your Honor, but the question is, from what lands was that status removed was it removed from 144,000 acres of treaty lands or was it removed only from that <three thousand four hundred> [= 3,400] acres that was actually distributed?"
1985.84-782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2920.917,2932.725,"Well, I thought you were just making the argument that when Congress goes about applying a statute of limitations and... it spells it out very specifically, but that's when the statute of limitations is imposed by Congress."
1985.84-782,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2947.562,2960.588,"Well, taking that for a moment, then, the 1959 Act states that... does not say, state statutes of limitation will apply."
1985.84-782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2986.656,2991.248,Are you suggesting that state statutes of limitations are not general state law?
1985.84-782,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,2991.248,2992.872,"Oh, no, Your Honor."
1985.84-782,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3053.613,3061.093,Did the Fourth Circuit deal with the South Carolina statutes that were supplied to us recently?
1985.84-782,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,3061.093,3061.937,"--It did not, Your Honor."
1985.84-782,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3061.937,3063.125,I don't recall that it did.
1985.84-782,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,3063.125,3063.702,"It did not, Your Honor."
1985.84-782,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3063.702,3067.138,And did you raise that in the Fourth Circuit?
1985.84-782,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,3068.732,3070.231,We did not argue this--
1985.84-782,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3070.231,3071.403,On behalf of the tribe?
1985.84-782,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,3071.403,3077.651,"--We did not argue this point specifically, that it would result in an immediate extinguishment."
1985.84-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3094.394,3106.935,"While you are interrupted, for just a second--"
1985.84-782,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,3106.935,3107.84,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3107.84,3124.663,"--The record has the list of the 61 people, members of the tribe who voted, I guess it was 47 to 17 in favor of this transaction, and you indicated that 1763 treaty claim and they were conscious of expressly intended to preserve that at that time."
1985.84-782,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,3136.565,3141.843,"Well, I can only surmise, Your Honor, these were unlettered people--"
1985.84-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3141.843,3146.137,"Each of them was entitled to about 2,000 acres of pretty valuable land."
1985.84-782,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,3146.137,3152.885,"--They had been assured, Your Honor, that nothing in this statute would affect the status."
1985.84-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3152.885,3225.84,"I understand, but even granting all that, assuming that to be true, it's still a little tribal discussion and a critical part of their negotiations, it just puzzles me that they would say, well, okay, we've, got this claim."
1985.84-782,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,3233.759,3236.195,"They didn't have legal advice until 1975, Your Honor."
1985.84-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3236.195,3240.943,I understand that.
1985.84-782,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,3240.943,3242.88,Their claim had survived.
1985.84-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3277.006,3286.612,"It just seems puzzling to me that when a Congressman is dealing with them about a statute they wouldn't say, by the way, we would like this 144,000 acre transaction cleaned up at the same time."
1985.84-782,1,21235,don_brantley_miller,,3295.529,3300.949,"Well, the focus of that 1959 act was very narrow."
1985.84-782,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3340.606,3344.104,We'll resume there at 1:00 o'clock counsel.
