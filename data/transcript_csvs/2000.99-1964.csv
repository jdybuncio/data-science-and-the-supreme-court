2000.99-1964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.545,"We'll hear argument next in Number 99-1964, Timothy Booth v. C.O. Churner."
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,11.6,19.319,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,113.851,119.341,"But they also took out the words about effective, did they not?"
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,119.341,121.57,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-1964,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,169.579,175.607,"In this case the statute says, no action."
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,208.755,226.299,"Your Honor, when Mr. Booth brought his claim, it's true that he sought both what we know as injunctive relief and money damages and in fact that was the basis upon which Respondents opposed our petition for writ of certiorari, that this was a mixed case."
2000.99-1964,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,232.038,239.484,"Just looking at the statute, the statute, though, and the statute refers to action and this is a mixed action."
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,262.874,266.961,"--Actually, Your Honor, the Courts of Appeals have taken a different approach."
2000.99-1964,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,267.333,281.905,"So that's what I want to know, what's the rationale for allowing a person who has the mixed claim to go to Federal court at all, if he doesn't first go and exhaust what he has to exhaust?"
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,281.905,311.915,"--The Courts of Appeals haven't explained their reasoning in the decisions, but one possibility would be a practical one, which is if in a mixed claim situation the prisoner has to go back and exhaust both the injunctive and the monetary part, it's likely that their monetary claim... they would risk... face a high risk of forfeiting their money claim because it would be too late to exhaust that through the prison grievance system."
2000.99-1964,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,338.171,341.143,I don't follow that if he hadn't come to court at all.
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,392.412,400.586,"--My argument Justice Ginsburg is that when he brought his... he brought his mixed action, that is true."
2000.99-1964,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,432.786,436.13,But the point is he should never have come to a Federal court.
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,442.362,454.788,"If our interpretation is right on the money damages point, and I'd like to go there, if that's right then the approach that the Tenth Circuit took in the Miller case, I think, addresses the concern."
2000.99-1964,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,476.048,478.277,May I ask you about that?
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,493.964,494.336,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-1964,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,494.336,499.537,"But then the prisoner said, I'm not going to go on to steps two and three."
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,511.897,514.397,It's not exactly if you want money.
2000.99-1964,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,524.239,528.309,I'm just asking you to answer that question yes or no.
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,534.254,535.574,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-1964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,535.574,538.257,I don't understand how you get there from the statute.
2000.99-1964,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,559.599,562.572,"It could be all sorts of remedies, damages, injunctions."
2000.99-1964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,562.572,574.089,On what basis do you want it limited to only those remedies that provide your client the same relief he wants in the 1997e action.
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,575.12,581.808,"I think the answer to that question, Justice Scalia, lies in the whole purpose of administrative exhaustion."
2000.99-1964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,599.89,601.088,I understand that.
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,655.989,679.849,"--Your Honor, if Congress had intended to require exhaustion in every case, a blanket exhaustion rule, it would have and could have written such a statute, but it didn't do that in 1980 and when Congress had the opportunity in 1996, and I want to go back to the question about effective because I don't think I answered that completely."
2000.99-1964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,694.71,708.622,"I don't know what possible language I would use if I were writing a statute to demand precisely that result, other than the language, until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted."
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,713.452,724.969,"Let me suggest to you what we... that the kind of the statute that we would think would be this blanket exhaustion, exhaustion every case, it's a good thing for prisons."
2000.99-1964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,754.69,758.323,"Well, I'm not sure that that would work."
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,792.602,794.277,It might be--
2000.99-1964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,794.277,803.565,"And you're saying that it's just irrelevant to the courts, that there are some disciplinary mechanisms that the prisoner... that cover this incident."
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,813.556,821.524,"--Justice Kennedy, it's not... this isn't a general prison notification."
2000.99-1964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,844.724,849.72,The FTCA statute doesn't work because you don't make a claim for damages.
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,879.691,898.062,"--If the result is that all prison complaints and all prison problems are aired through the prison grievance system first, then I submit that Congress could have created that type of statute, but Congress didn't do that."
2000.99-1964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,898.062,902.354,"Well, I would agree with you that Congress perhaps could have been clearer about it."
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,983.209,998.525,"I agree that there's some ambiguity in the word remedy and procedure and it's something certainly that we've struggled with, with the word remedy in the statute, that sometimes it can mean an administrative procedure and sometimes it can mean the right."
2000.99-1964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1005.872,1010.413,"Well, if it's doing double duty, doesn't that nix your case?"
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,1010.413,1016.557,"--I don't think so, Your Honor, because it's still an administrative remedy as are available."
2000.99-1964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1031.617,1050.837,One of the practical difficulties of your interpretation is that I gather a prisoner by simply saying he wants money damages in any case can avoid the grievance system entirely even though money damages might not be a major part of what he wants.
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,1050.837,1062.726,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, this problem of bypass, I think, is a little, somewhat overblown in some of the briefs."
2000.99-1964,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1116.383,1124.351,"Ms. Winkelman, I wanted to get a clearer handle than I now have on the nature of the claim you think you have."
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,1171.905,1197.251,"--Your Honor, in that situation, Justice Ginsburg, the prisoner would have to go through the prison grievance system because the prison grievance system, while it couldn't provide the one-to-one correlation of the relief could provide the category of relief and certainly our position wouldn't preclude a cap such as the one that you posit your hypothetical."
2000.99-1964,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1246.913,1252.957,"I'd like to ask you now, I understand the nature of the claim you're asserting."
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,1308.447,1313.359,--Certainly that was a purpose of the Prison Litigation Reform Act.
2000.99-1964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1366.364,1379.367,"Ms. Winkelman, when Justice Ginsburg followed up on her question, I thought she was going to follow-up by asking what if the damages available in the prison grievance procedure were only 50 dollars?"
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,1415.404,1429.316,"--Certainly, Justice Scalia, there would be some threshold at which the prison grievance system's damages might be so nominal as to not be the kind of relief that we're talking about."
2000.99-1964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1458.106,1467.311,"If you're right, Ms. Winkelman, Federal judges are going to have to say, does this prison system allow for damages?"
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,1487.002,1507.807,"I think actually, Chief Justice Rehnquist, we're putting less uncertainty into the Act than Respondents' reading is because, even Respondents don't take the extreme position that such administrative remedies as are available means any procedure in existence."
2000.99-1964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1541.121,1551.524,"But, I mean, as is opposed to applying for a library card, is there really going to be much doubt about whether a prison system can address a type of grievance?"
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,1551.524,1560.812,"But if that's the case, Your Honor, then I'd go back to the point then the words are superfluous, why are they in there if there's no doubt?"
2000.99-1964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1560.812,1562.093,What words?
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,1567.954,1584.384,"If all Congress meant was, is there a procedure in existence or does the procedure address the subject matter, it didn't need to say such administrative remedies as are available because certainly it goes without saying that there would have to be a grievance procedure in existence and that that procedure--"
2000.99-1964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1584.384,1586.241,--Why does it have to go without--
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,1586.241,1596.272,--Because Congress couldn't have been intending to write a statute that would require a prisoner to exhaust if there was no procedure in existence to begin with.
2000.99-1964,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1596.272,1603.331,"--No, but the argument is... as are available, as we'll hear the complaint."
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,1616.668,1618.154,But available means--
2000.99-1964,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1618.154,1619.723,Available means they'll hear it.
2000.99-1964,0,37333,nancy_winkelman,,1626.411,1632.355,"--In that case, again I think it goes without saying, I think that those words then aren't necessary."
2000.99-1964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1650.559,1652.129,"Very well, Ms. Winkelman."
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,1657.33,1671.82,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1712.853,1713.968,And what does that mean?
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,1728.745,1732.749,"Your definition of available, Your Honor, is ours."
2000.99-1964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1736.259,1737.579,And what does it mean?
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,1751.696,1773.699,"What it means, Your Honor, is what Congress wanted and that is that there is a presumption that underlies, I think, the Petitioner's point and your initial question, which is that, just because money's not available there is nothing that this process can do for the prisoner."
2000.99-1964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1773.699,1775.268,"Well, his complaint is not money."
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,1779.272,1779.272,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1779.272,1810.48,"And the way the statute reads, it says with respect to prison conditions, no action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted and I gather the condition here is the fact that guards go about whacking people over the head and the remedies for that are presumably whatever remedies the prison provides for when you get whacked over the head, which might include money damages, but might not."
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,1810.48,1815.021,"Well, remedy in this statute means process, Your Honor."
2000.99-1964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1819.496,1821.254,Even though there's nothing at the end of it?
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,1837.312,1838.138,"No, it doesn't."
2000.99-1964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1880.164,1885.671,"Well, come on, this is a sort they likes-to-but-what kind of an argument."
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,1897.271,1900.532,You would still need the statute.
2000.99-1964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1906.271,1908.5,"Well, that's a different argument."
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,1922.468,1935.25,"--He says he doesn't want to go through it, Your Honor, but again I think we make a mistake to equate what the prisoner says he wants or needs when he files a grievance, with what the prisoner says he wants once he files his civil rights complaint."
2000.99-1964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1964.682,1977.231,And I assume the statute of limitations on his money claim or any other claim that he cannot get in the prison grievance system would not start running until the exhaustion of the administrative remedies?
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,1977.231,1979.088,"I do not think so, Your Honor."
2000.99-1964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2010.75,2013.268,"But if it's not... you're saying, tough luck."
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2026.642,2030.812,"--Your Honor, I agree with part of your question and respectfully disagree with the second part."
2000.99-1964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2050.214,2054.012,I could understand the deadlines for within the prison process.
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2084.188,2091.246,"--Well, the rationale is, Your Honor, first of all, the second part of your prior question ties into my answer to this question."
2000.99-1964,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2113.787,2115.152,"Well, if that's so, why doesn't it--"
2000.99-1964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2115.152,2128.359,"--A court might well say that a remedy, which took a greater length of time than the statute of limitations, was not available since the idea of exhaustion of remedies is to get ready to go to court."
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2128.359,2137.193,"Well, the idea of exhaustion of remedies, Mr. Chief Justice, is to prevent having to go to court, as Congress wanted this statute to work."
2000.99-1964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2137.193,2139.217,"Well, at any rate a predicate to going to court."
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2146.935,2147.596,Yes Your Honor.
2000.99-1964,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2147.596,2151.766,"Why do you take the position... there may be a very simple answer to this, but I don't know what it is."
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2159.346,2162.773,"I wouldn't assume that, Your Honor, and that was the point I was leading to."
2000.99-1964,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2162.773,2167.148,If you don't assume that then you don't have the problem that you got into with Justice Ginsburg.
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2167.148,2167.519,Right.
2000.99-1964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2167.519,2171.856,Could have eliminated the last couple of minutes of a very difficult discussion.
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2171.856,2192.001,"I was honestly trying to get to that, Your Honor, and that is, that that's my point behind the fact that courts do not lose the discretion here to determine whether exhaustion has taken place, which means that the prisoner's put in the position that Justice Ginsburg referred to and for no good reason that the prison simply dragged out the process."
2000.99-1964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2193.487,2195.716,Justice Souter was saying less than that.
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2218.628,2223.292,"--We believe that the prisoner could make an equitable tolling argument at the appropriate time, yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2251.156,2254.294,"Well, I'm somewhat concerned about your cautious answer."
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2268.578,2281.126,"That was in the context, Your Honor, of what I thought was Justice Ginsburg's hypo of the prison unreasonably dragging out the process for the purposes of blowing the statute of limitations."
2000.99-1964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2306.473,2313.326,I am concerned about the fact that there's no general tolling of the statute of limitations.
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2318.445,2321.788,"In Pennsylvania under these facts, it would be two years, Your Honor."
2000.99-1964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2321.788,2322.077,All right.
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2330.622,2339.704,"Well, if the deadlines in this process are honored by Pennsylvania, the process would take on average probably under 90 days, Your Honor."
2000.99-1964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2435.45,2438.256,May I ask you to clarify one other thing?
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2455.057,2457.575,"Yes, Your Honor, and that's... it is."
2000.99-1964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2488.966,2493.984,May I just clarify one thing in my own mind about your position?
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2517.556,2517.928,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2519.209,2521.355,And why again in that hypothetical?
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2521.355,2528.58,"--In that hypo, even though there could be no action taken against the guard, there could still be something that the prison could give the prisoner that would satisfy him."
2000.99-1964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2542.781,2545.011,Could you give me an example of this.
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2551.698,2552.169,Yes.
2000.99-1964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2552.169,2554.177,What could the prison give him that would help him?
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2554.177,2566.066,"The types of relief that they could try to satisfy him with, Your Honor, again, could be one of any... a single... a better cell assignment, a single cell, extra privileges."
2000.99-1964,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2566.066,2575.065,Let's add to the mix and say the prison transferred the prisoner immediately to another prison so there's nothing at all they can do for him there.
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2575.065,2583.915,"Your Honor, there are... yes, Your Honor, and I'll assume under your question that there's absolutely nothing the prison can do for that prisoner."
2000.99-1964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2606.19,2617.707,"Do you consider that to be an administrative remedy, even though it doesn't give any benefit to the inmate at all."
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2623.446,2625.221,"Well, again, our--"
2000.99-1964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2625.221,2640.164,"Until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted, I'd be inclined to say that if the prison can't give me any satisfaction that's going to do me any good, there is no administrative remedy available."
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2640.164,2642.765,"--Well, we define remedy as process, Your Honor."
2000.99-1964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2643.591,2644.417,"Oh, that's nice."
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2644.417,2644.722,--under this statute.
2000.99-1964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2644.722,2647.306,"It doesn't say process though, it says remedies."
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2647.306,2658.989,"The words are used interchangeably in the statute and when we do speak of exhaustion of remedies we don't, as I believe Justice Souter pointed out, we don't speak of exhaustion of the money or the injunctive relief, we speak of exhaustion of the process."
2000.99-1964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2664.108,2666.048,It means a process that provides relief.
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2666.048,2666.625,--Yes.
2000.99-1964,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2666.625,2678.308,"Then what if your prison system, describing the procedure, says the following relief can be given and they give a bunch of examples, but none of them include the hypothetical you've given me."
2000.99-1964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2678.308,2689.082,"You're suggesting there's sort of an undefined category of relief that might be granted by the warden independently, not as a result of a particular proceeding as I understand it."
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2689.082,2690.197,"I'm not sure I understand what you're referring to, Justice Stevens."
2000.99-1964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2690.197,2692.304,"Well, my hypo was the dead guard."
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2692.304,2693.13,"Yeah, oh, okay."
2000.99-1964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2693.13,2707.908,"And you say well they might give him a different cell or they might give him library privileges or something like that, but if none of that is prescribed in the procedure, that is, you know, the prison disciplinary remedy procedure, can you still say that's a part of the available remedies?"
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2707.908,2709.106,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2714.186,2720.335,Supposing the procedure has a limited set of remedies that it does authorize.
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2720.335,2721.161,--Okay.
2000.99-1964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2721.161,2724.605,"And then you're still saying, but that still would not be exhaustive."
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2725.514,2733.771,"We are still saying that the prisoner under you question, Your Honor, would have to exhaust the process because one, there still may be something that can satisfy him."
2000.99-1964,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2743.924,2761.923,"But you're not saying that there would be a satisfaction of the statue in the case in which the prison literally simply provided a forum for complaints and said we'll never do anything about them, but if you want to get them off your chest, sure you can come in and tell us."
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2763.781,2767.867,"That would not, Your Honor, and again that gets to our definition of available."
2000.99-1964,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2772.203,2777.321,"In other words, if some remedy of some sort is available, that's what you're saying."
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2777.321,2784.546,"--It doesn't hinge as much on remedy, Your Honor, as it does on whether the prison will take the complaint and address it in any way and under your question--"
2000.99-1964,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2784.546,2793.751,"Okay, but if it... when you say address, I assume address with the object of providing relief if there is merit in the complaint, some kind of relief."
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2793.751,2800.521,"--No, that would more be the Petitioner's interpretation of the statue as meaning that the prisoner has to get what he wants, that would not be our interpretation--"
2000.99-1964,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2800.521,2817.118,"No, I mean that is the prison's argument, but I mean, I'm suggesting that perhaps the prisoner would have a good argument here if the prison said, we have a system that does not provide relief."
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2833.38,2835.981,"--That would not be an available remedy, Your Honor."
2000.99-1964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2835.981,2836.247,--Why not?
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2841.804,2844.776,"It is not, Justice Scalia, as I'm interpreting the question."
2000.99-1964,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2845.148,2849.029,You're saying procedure leading to some conceivable relief.
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2849.029,2851.092,"--No, I'm just saying, will they address it all?"
2000.99-1964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2863.352,2871.32,"What about a chaplain in the armed forces, which perhaps sometimes serves that purpose, you know you go talk to the chaplain, nothing much happens."
2000.99-1964,1,25905,gerald_j_pappert,,2877.181,2877.736,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2000.99-1964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2877.736,2879.66,Mr. Gornstein.
2000.99-1964,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2879.66,2890.517,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1964,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2909.464,2912.437,"May I just, so I'll be sure I have time to get your answer."
2000.99-1964,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2918.092,2921.065,--Then we would say that no administrative remedies are available.
2000.99-1964,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2921.065,2921.436,You would.
2000.99-1964,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2922.634,2938.321,On that small point and I don't think it would come up very much because almost often... almost in all cases there would be something that the administrative process could do about the complaint and here we're talking about a complaint about excessive force.
2000.99-1964,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2995.246,2996.444,"And it was dictum there, of course."
2000.99-1964,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2996.444,3012.13,"Of course, it was dictum, but when Congress is reviewing a statute and are attempting to amend it, it's very unlikely that Congress is going to make fine distinctions about whether this Court had a holding or an analysis that was necessary to the holding or that it was dicta."
2000.99-1964,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3066.083,3071.367,"Your interpretation of the word remedy is more than process then, it's some relief."
2000.99-1964,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3071.367,3075.991,"--I think it's some relief, but that's what I think is implicit in a grievance procedure."
2000.99-1964,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3153.722,3155.868,"Thank you, Mr. Gornstein."
2000.99-1964,3,37333,nancy_winkelman,,3158.84,3163.465,"And I have three points, Your Honor."
2000.99-1964,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3216.469,3217.75,How is that a forfeit?
2000.99-1964,3,37333,nancy_winkelman,,3219.524,3228.235,Because if he misses one of these short time frames through the prison grievance system as is pointed out in McCarthy--
2000.99-1964,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3228.235,3229.516,That's the part I don't understand.
2000.99-1964,3,37333,nancy_winkelman,,3234.634,3239.63,--If he... the prison grievance system has three levels.
2000.99-1964,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3247.598,3250.67,"That's true of any claim that he has to... I mean, that would be true of every claim--"
2000.99-1964,3,37333,nancy_winkelman,,3250.67,3255.4,"--That's true, but in the injunctive context, he has something to gain."
2000.99-1964,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3332.637,3334.495,"--Thank you, Ms. Winkelman."
2000.99-1964,3,37333,nancy_winkelman,,3334.495,3335.238,Thank you.
2000.99-1964,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3335.238,3337.317,The case is submitted.
