1962.96,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,25.041,"Number 96, United States, Petitioner, versus Buffalo Savings Bank."
1962.96,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,27.932,33.371,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.96,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,174.395,177.594,"I'm sorry Mr. Jones, perhaps you've already said it."
1962.96,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,183.127,185.672,"January 15, 1953."
1962.96,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,188.031,188.598,Yes.
1962.96,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,188.598,202.319,"The mortgage was given to -- in 1946, seven years later, the federal tax liens came along in 1953 and four years later, the local tax did so that not the common case where we're worrying about a minute of time."
1962.96,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,334.79,337.143,Was that law in effect from the mortgage was (Voice Overlap) --
1962.96,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,337.143,338.009,Yes.
1962.96,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,370.961,375.58,"Well, did the Court of Appeals give it some interpretation or is that the one implicit anyway?"
1962.96,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,375.58,381.095,I think it would have to be implicit on the point and I'm not sure that this Court would want to make a new examination.
1962.96,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,381.618,383.182,"Well, could we --"
1962.96,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,383.182,389.106,It seems to be carrying off a lot of freight to say that a casual phrase that it's deemed to expense of sale would produce this (Voice Overlap) --
1962.96,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,389.106,395.058,"Well, if that's interpretation of the Court of Appeals (Inaudible) that statute would stop with that."
1962.96,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,395.058,398.801,I think that's the position.
1962.96,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,631.762,638.677,What if the mortgagee had paid the delinquent state taxes?
1962.96,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,638.677,640.887,After the -- after they arise in the federal tax lien?
1962.96,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,640.887,641.746,"Yes, yes."
1962.96,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,641.746,650.731,We would certainly take the position that that was not and have taken the litigation that if it's paid afterwards that's not given the original priority of the mortgage.
1962.96,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,660.846,664.131,"Oh, on your brief, I knew about the Bond case, that's in the Fourth Circuit."
1962.96,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,664.131,665.4,Right.
1962.96,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,665.4,667.772,Your brief seems to indicate a different point of view.
1962.96,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,669.373,675.935,"Well, perhaps at this point that we do think there's something that the mortgagee can do."
1962.96,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,910.901,914.679,"And you would concede that those come before the federal tax lien, wouldn't you?"
1962.96,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,914.679,916.299,The things like are an auctioneer's fee.
1962.96,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,916.299,917.284,Yes.
1962.96,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,917.284,923.497,And perhaps to the tax expenses accruing while it's in the hands of the Court.
1962.96,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,930.058,930.212,Or was (Voice Overlap) --
1962.96,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,930.212,939.311,-- it must be related in time to this mechanical process of using the judicial process to enforce a -- the right of a mortgagee.
1962.96,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,939.311,957.207,"Well, Mr. Jones, on your argument that the mortgagee assert (Inaudible) priority was a federal law (Inaudible) the federal lien by order of the state law?"
1962.96,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,957.207,969.591,"Well, I would say except it seems to me that the federal lien has already made a substantial concession in saying that any federal liens will give this man everything that he took prior to the date they recorded the federal lien."
1962.96,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,981.699,984.994,(Inaudible)
1962.96,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,984.994,992.828,"Well, of course that will depend a great deal on the individual figures but whatever you may say about the Federal Government's generosity, it far exceeds the state."
1962.96,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1106.331,1108.826,Section 71 of the 1951 Code?
1962.96,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,1108.826,1110.207,The 1959 --
1962.96,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1110.207,1111.352,1959.
1962.96,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,1111.352,1111.857,-- tax law.
1962.96,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1372.911,1385.631,"Mr. Jones, were you checking with the -- do I understand in the record that the absence of the state law first (Inaudible) the mortgagee, they did a (Inaudible) a tax lien."
1962.96,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,1385.631,1386.689,Under the federal law.
1962.96,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1386.689,1390.272,Federal government (Inaudible)
1962.96,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,1392.364,1392.537,Yes.
1962.96,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1392.537,1402.075,"-- to the second, as to (Inaudible) in the New York Court of Appeals, New York state tax came first, the mortgagee is second and federal tax third."
1962.96,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,1402.075,1402.984,That's right.
1962.96,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1402.984,1410.275,"Now, you contend for the -- whether the New York law has (Inaudible) the government tax comes first, the state tax second and (Voice Overlap) --"
1962.96,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,1410.275,1411.208,"No no, it's not that."
1962.96,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1474.799,1483.534,I don't quite understand the argument made with respect to what happened in the New Britain case on remand back to the Connecticut Court.
1962.96,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,1483.892,1496.062,"It is the con -- well, it is the intention, as I believe, of respondents that this Court did not realize that the effect of their holding to say that the mortgagee's preference would be limited, the amount of the mortgage."
1962.96,1,31378,john_horace_little,,1534.774,1539.648,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1962.96,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,3138.481,3142.535,"I have just three quick points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1962.96,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3258.76,3262.436,"In Massachusetts, the procedure is similar to that of Pennsylvania?"
1962.96,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,3262.436,3263.311,"Similar, yes."
1962.96,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3288.722,3295.064,(Inaudible)
1962.96,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,3295.064,3301.187,"Well, he can keep his mortgagor current by this escrow arrangement device so that he --"
1962.96,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3301.187,3304.504,(Inaudible)
1962.96,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,3304.504,3316.848,"When he have security, he has complete security against the federal tax under 3672 except to the extent that the state cuts in with its state tax so he can't -- assuming that he's correctly judged the security of the underlying property."
1962.96,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3323.58,3327.679,(Inaudible)
1962.96,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,3327.679,3329.952,Frankly in advance and by a suitable escrow agreement.
