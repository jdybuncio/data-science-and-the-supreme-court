1997.97-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.337,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 97-454, the United States v. Bestfoods, et al.--"
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,9.522,15.093,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,98.745,114.923,"Well, Ms. Schiffer, surely you would agree that under the statute not every parent is liable under this statute for the operation of a facility by a subsidiary."
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,114.923,117.208,--We would absolutely agree with that.
1997.97-454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,117.208,127.314,"And there mere fact that there are interlocking directorships, or perhaps managers who serve both corporations, wouldn't determine that, would it?"
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,127.314,130.515,"That is exactly correct, Justice O'Connor."
1997.97-454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,139.872,166.022,"Well, I'm not sure it should even do that, I mean, if our ordinary understanding of the corporate structure and reasonable investment-backed expectations is that we recognize the corporate separate entities, and we recognize that a parent can have a subsidiary and that a parent isn't liable for what the subsidiary does in normal circumstances."
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,166.022,194.541,"Justice O'Connor, what we're talking about here, and which is consistent with the common law, is what the action of the parents are as a company toward the facility, not what the actions of the parent are toward the subsidiary, and while there may be useful evidence in how the parent acts toward the subsidiary, the real question is, how did the parent company directly affect or actively participate in the management of the facility."
1997.97-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,194.541,199.945,"I think that's helpful, and I don't think the district court did that."
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,211.301,215.205,"Well, let me start first with the district court, Justice Kennedy."
1997.97-454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,275.277,276.527,"Ms. Schiffer, is that so?"
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,313.369,338.869,"--Your Honor, it may be instructive to look at some of the specific findings that the district court made, keeping in mind, again, that for much of the time, or for a substantial part of the time the subsidiary owned only this one facility, so that when we're talking about... when the district court was talking about activities of the subsidiary it was really talking about activities at this particular facility."
1997.97-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,372.573,373.973,"He was an Ott board member though, wasn't he?"
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,373.973,378.311,"--Mr. Williams was not an Ott board member, Your Honor."
1997.97-454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,382.163,382.696,Okay.
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,397.623,415.769,"We do not think the case... it would be a different set of facts, Your Honor, but we do not think the outcome would be particularly different, because we think what is probative and what the standard is is, did the parent company participate in management of the facility, and the activities of Mr. Williams were such that--"
1997.97-454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,415.769,434.648,"But you suggested at the outset that there's a distinction between controlling the subsidiary and directly controlling the facility, and if everything that they did to control the facility was done by directing an officer to do what he thought was appropriate, then the officer went ahead and ran the facility, would that meet your test or not?"
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,434.648,440.467,"--It's a very fact-specific test, Your Honor, but it is likely that it would meet it."
1997.97-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,469.487,487.198,"Were there any other individuals in Williams' position who had no position, nominal or otherwise, either on the board or in the management of the subsidiary, but who were nonetheless directing the subsidiary's own offices and employees?"
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,487.198,489.65,"I have two responses to that, Justice Souter."
1997.97-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,508.146,517.885,But were the ones who were not so related independently and directingly... directly giving orders to the subsidiary?
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,517.885,525.823,"--The district court's findings go to the CPC Development Company as an entity, not... one I believe can't discern from the facts--"
1997.97-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,525.823,528.359,So that's not quite on the same plane with Williams.
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,529.675,564.782,"--There was no one else singled out particularly, but I would suggest to the court that the district court's findings, which talk about CPC, not... in a number of instances, not CPC's officers, not CPC's managers, CPC itself, don't... doesn't... the Court doesn't directly say that its finding that those officers and managers were acting when they were involved with the Ott facility as in their CPC capacity, but it certainly is the sensible reading and the implicit reading we--"
1997.97-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,564.782,565.165,Well--
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,582.16,591.933,--If the legal... the legal standard we're espousing is that it is CPC that is actively managing the facility.
1997.97-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,620.369,628.456,"No, but unless we get a situation like Williams, how do we avoid the problem that Justice Ginsburg said that she had in reading the findings?"
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,658.91,689.013,"Your Honor, the legal standard is, was the parent company acting at the facility, and the district court findings which talk about CPC managing and controlling and operating at the facility don't give the Court an easy line but they certainly give the Court a base, a basis, with these extensive findings of fact, for determining that it was the parent company that was undertaking the operation."
1997.97-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,689.013,691.715,"Well, if I may interrupt you, I don't see that it gives me a basis."
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,737.077,748.552,"We think that this is not the same as any... as the typical parent of the typical corporation, because CPC here was undertaking much more active involvement."
1997.97-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,782.808,791.312,"Well, now do we know they have their CPC hat on by virtue of some unusual resolution of the CPC board that they were executing?"
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,802.02,815.677,"--Your Honor, what we have is very detailed findings of the district court about the day-to-day involvement and the overall managerial involvement of CPC at the Ott II facility."
1997.97-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,815.677,817.779,"Well, do we have any of the sort that I just asked you about?"
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,817.779,820.897,"Not that were in the district court findings, Your Honor."
1997.97-454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,820.897,822.031,Ms Schiffer--
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,850.75,853.035,"Not that I'm aware of, Your Honor."
1997.97-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,875.032,878.484,What is magic about the word manage?
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,914.824,925.214,Justice Scalia... and this is... we think that each statute needs to be looked at in its own terms for what it does.
1997.97-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,951.513,952.73,"I'm sorry, I used the wrong word."
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,959.618,965.522,"--Operate is the term that Congress used in this statute, and defined to mean operate so that--"
1997.97-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,965.522,974.544,"But we normally think that when a subsidiary is operating something the parent is not operating it, unless, you know, there's veil-piercing."
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,990.471,1018.038,"--We do not think this is a situation where what is the key test is the relationship between the parent and the subsidiary, which is what veilpiercing gets to, but rather what is the relationship of the parent company or any company to the facility, to the activities that are causing the pollution that then is leading to the cleanup, or to the activity of managing the whole facility, even without regard to the pollution, but which leads to the causing of the pollution."
1997.97-454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1036.516,1049.073,"May I interrupt with a... but in doing that you look at specifically what Mr. Arnold Ott did and James Eiszner and some of these others, and you have to sort of say what hat were they wearing at the time they did it."
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1052.109,1057.346,"It... there are not specific factual findings as to that, Your Honor."
1997.97-454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1057.346,1059.281,Do you know if there's evidence in the record on that point?
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1059.281,1067.554,The district court findings talk about each of those people and... who served at the same time--
1997.97-454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1067.554,1068.287,Right.
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1068.287,1069.904,--as both on the parent and on the subsidiary.
1997.97-454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1069.904,1071.939,But the district court doesn't tell us who paid their salaries.
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1071.939,1073.125,I don't have a recollection.
1997.97-454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1073.125,1074.375,Do you think that would be relevant?
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1074.375,1094.538,"I think it would be a factor, Your Honor, but even if the salaries were being paid by the subsidiary, if what the people were doing is acting in their capacity as... for the parent, and were making managerial decisions at the facility, then it would really be the parent who--"
1997.97-454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1094.538,1113.0,"Well, supposing... and with regard to Mr. Williams' case I guess is your strongest case, supposing the record showed that whenever he went down... went over to Muskegon or wherever he went to look at the facility and participate, he was especially put on the payroll of the subsidiary for that period of time, and paid by the subsidiary for the work he did, would that make a difference?"
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1113.0,1115.202,"--It would certainly be a factor, Your Honor."
1997.97-454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1116.202,1117.135,But we don't know whether that happened.
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1117.135,1127.443,"--What we know as to Mr. Williams is that he always worked for... he was an employee of CPC, and there's no indication in the record that he was in the employ of Ott II, the subsidiary."
1997.97-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1127.443,1137.031,"Ms. Schiffer, is it the Government's view that if its view of the law is accepted this Court could simply order the district court judgment affirmed?"
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1137.031,1146.471,"It is our view, Your Honor, that there were extensive factual findings in the district court that under rule 52(a) they were left undisturbed by--"
1997.97-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1146.471,1148.006,That really doesn't answer my question at all.
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1157.529,1163.349,"--Yes, it is, because our view of the law is essentially what the district court applied to its fact-findings."
1997.97-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1163.349,1168.567,Is it... suppose... I don't... I'm having trouble with the... you've said two separate things.
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1199.438,1209.811,"Under the standard that we propose, Your Honor, if Mr. or Mrs. Smith... if Mrs. Smith made active managerial decisions--"
1997.97-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1209.811,1214.198,"Look, I said Mr. and Mrs. Smith and their son, John, do everything."
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1247.186,1262.845,"--Any facility can have more than one operator, Your Honor, and it is our view that if Mr. and Mrs. Smith themselves personally operated the facility, that is, actively participated in the management of the facility, that they would be liable."
1997.97-454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1262.845,1264.314,Isn't the next case exactly that?
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1270.468,1272.101,"There was, Your Honor."
1997.97-454,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1277.555,1300.403,"So your view is that if a group of people incorporate themselves and they personally operate the dump, they are personally liable, so in this statute alone... I've never seen another statute like that... there is no way for a group of operators to form a corporation and thereby exempt themselves from personal liability."
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1311.545,1314.747,"Congress did say two things, Your Honor."
1997.97-454,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1338.445,1364.594,"Is there any other statute, of which you are aware, where it imposes liability is imposed on some entity... call it person, individual, whatever... and without saying it explicitly, the liability flows to individual shareholders, it flows to directors, it flows to the corporate form makes no difference, doesn't limit liability?"
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1364.594,1385.759,"Your Honor, the... in the... I'm not particularly aware of any other case, but decisions of this Court under other statutes have looked beyond corporate form to what is actually going on here, and here Congress was particularly concerned that those who were making decisions that caused the pollution would bear the economic responsibility for cleaning it up."
1997.97-454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1385.759,1408.958,"Well, Ms. Schiffer, your position on behalf of the Government does propose a very fuzzy sort of line here to do something that is quite contrary to normal investment-backed expectations, and which may not be clearly mandated by the language of the statute."
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1431.222,1436.942,The Sixth Circuit really looked at the concept of derivative liability.
1997.97-454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1449.183,1459.407,"Well, I know that's what you're saying, but it gets us back to that same question of how you draw the line and whether the statute is, indeed, that clear."
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1459.407,1479.805,"--Your Honor, we think that operate is, indeed, defined in a circular way, and we looked at the dictionary, but we think the Court can get some good guidance from the lender liability provisions adopted in the lender context, but which spell out a set of standards for how much activity and operation is necessary to meet the standard."
1997.97-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1479.805,1497.932,"And under that definition, and under what I think is your answer to Justice Breyer, and I want to be very clear about this, it would be very rare that a corporation would be solely liable and not have some of its principal managers, operators, officers, also liable, is that not right?"
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1497.932,1510.157,"It would not be... it would be very rare, Your Honor, because the ordinary corporation which is acting in a supervisory capacity through a subsidiary and not with active management would not be liable--"
1997.97-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1510.157,1512.276,"No, forget parent and subsidiary."
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1519.513,1520.663,"--Yes, and--"
1997.97-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1520.663,1545.663,"And the human actor is a cotortfeasor, and I take it your answer to Justice Breyer was that by using the word, any person, in 9607(b), that the Congress would make all of the people in his hypothetical that were actively participating in the waste disposal personally liable."
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1545.663,1548.465,"--We believe that that is correct, Your Honor."
1997.97-454,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1548.465,1549.832,And even if they hire somebody?
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1579.901,1581.836,"We do not think they are liable, Your Honor."
1997.97-454,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1581.836,1582.52,"Oh, well, why not?"
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1582.52,1584.705,"Because the concept is participation in management, and--"
1997.97-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1584.705,1586.324,"No, no, but what they do is... yes, they--"
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1586.324,1587.49,--not in management.
1997.97-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1587.49,1589.276,--It says owner or operator.
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1610.455,1611.389,Right.
1997.97-454,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1611.389,1618.795,"I'm saying, in the Government's view, is that kind of person who's, let's say, a fourth tier employee of the big corporation, also personally liable?"
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1618.795,1622.497,"If it was a small facility and they were the managers, they would be liable."
1997.97-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1626.699,1629.151,"May I ask you one question, though, before you sit down?"
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1690.224,1700.513,"--That's exactly correct, Your Honor, and we think that our theory is consistent with respecting the corporate form because it looks at what is the corporation doing for its own activities."
1997.97-454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1700.513,1733.651,"Right, but I thought in answer to Justice Breyer's question you were getting to the point where... of saying that whenever the employee of a corporation does the act which forms a part of the operation, that the employee is an operator and therefore liable regardless of whether the employee is acting as a maverick in relation to his corporate organization or whether he is doing exactly what his corporate organization told him to do, and now I think you're saying you're maybe not going that far."
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1733.651,1736.77,The test is participation in management.
1997.97-454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1753.732,1754.75,So--
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1760.904,1771.277,"In fact, what the cases that look at shareholder liability really are taking people who are shareholders and chief executive officers and really are the active managers."
1997.97-454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1771.277,1782.234,"I'm referring to a family corporation, the kind Justice Breyer described, a one-person corporation, a closed corporation, very small group, where they're all involved in running the business."
1997.97-454,0,35085,lois_j_schiffer,,1793.542,1801.815,"We think that is what Congress intended by its definition of the term, operator, to assure that those who are responsible for the pollution are responsible for cleaning it up, Your Honor."
1997.97-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1801.815,1802.815,"Thank you, Ms. Schiffer."
1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1804.565,1811.103,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-454,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1874.344,1880.164,But the Government told us very clearly that that is not the way it would have it.
1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1884.882,1885.734,Yes.
1997.97-454,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1885.734,1887.467,"And then I asked, well, how do we--"

1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3081.132,3081.567,Absolutely.
1997.97-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3081.567,3082.317,You could get them as an operator.
1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3082.317,3083.134,"Absolutely, Justice Scalia."
1997.97-454,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3092.006,3093.223,You wouldn't need it.
1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3093.858,3094.208,It wouldn't do you any good.
1997.97-454,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3136.969,3146.991,"But Mr. Geller, the Government told us that that was meant to deal with facilities that had long ceased operating, that that was otherwise controlled."
1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3153.795,3155.181,That's what they say.
1997.97-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3213.969,3221.456,"Mr. Geller, could I call you back to Mr. Williams again and ask you to address the findings of the district court concerning Williams?"
1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3239.001,3239.451,Well--
1997.97-454,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3239.451,3241.451,Where are you reading from?
1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3243.236,3247.621,"--There is no... if I could say, Justice Scalia, there's no evidence to support that finding."
1997.97-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3249.223,3257.329,"Well, it goes on to give what I take are... its... what it believed constituted exerting control."
1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3269.053,3269.386,Right.
1997.97-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3280.778,3281.444,What about the next one?
1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3281.444,3283.61,"--operating this facility, operating--"
1997.97-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3283.61,3289.448,"Operating... but the next one said, he instructed them regarding various responses to State and Federal--"
1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3289.448,3291.966,--There was a... they were negotiating--
1997.97-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3291.966,3292.55,--You say that's not operating?
1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3292.55,3293.585,--That's not operating this facility.
1997.97-454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3316.181,3326.722,"If we have a 4,000-page record on this, is it perhaps... if they've made the findings not supported, we should send it back under a correct standard, and is that correct--"
1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3326.722,3327.122,I--
1997.97-454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3327.122,3358.36,"--standard, in your view, the standard that if a parent operates simply as a shareholder... a shareholder, which includes appointing directors and doing those things that 100-percent shareholders often do, that that is not sufficient for liability, but if it goes beyond what shareholders normally do in the direction of making operational decisions, then it is liable, so we would look to what is normal in a relationship between parent and sub, a 100-percent shareholder."
1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3367.031,3371.168,--What the Sixth Circuit said was that the... that the parent--

1997.97-454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3372.535,3372.968,--No.
1997.97-454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3373.718,3374.401,--doesn't really capture it very well.
1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3374.401,3378.086,"--This is at 17 and 18 of the joint... of the appendix to the petition, Justice Breyer."
1997.97-454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3386.906,3386.973,"All right, then we use the word... is the word... is--"
1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3386.973,3391.977,"--the influence that the parent had over the subsidiary, which is what you're talking about now, I believe."
1997.97-454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3391.977,3404.986,--I'm looking for the best way to state what I think you might agree and everyone might agree that it's certainly possible for a parent to go out and begin to operate the facility irrespective of whether the subsidiary does as well.
1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3404.986,3406.552,If employees--
1997.97-454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3406.552,3406.936,All right.
1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3407.769,3419.996,"--If employees of the parent are directly involved in operating the facility, in other words, engaged in the day-to-day running of the facility, involved in the dumping of the hazardous waste of the facility--"
1997.97-454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3419.996,3423.881,What about making managerial decisions that determine how those operations will take place?
1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3423.881,3432.135,"--If you could show that the parent, as opposed to dual officers, which is what we have in this case, if you could show that the parent was making all of the decisions for the subsidiary--"
1997.97-454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3432.135,3432.585,Why all?
1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3432.585,3435.17,--Or decisions related to the facility--
1997.97-454,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3435.17,3440.224,How about actually participated in the management or operational affairs of the facility?
1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3440.707,3445.961,"--If you could show that the parent was actually doing that, but there's no evidence the parent was doing that in this case."

1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3561.367,3561.85,Well--
1997.97-454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3561.85,3564.219,"It just occurred to me, and I should have thought of it before, but--"
1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3564.219,3569.006,--It... I think it would be wrong because it equates participating in management with operation.
1997.97-454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3569.006,3572.791,--And you don't... you think participating in management is not--
1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3572.791,3573.241,I think it's a different--
1997.97-454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3573.241,3575.259,--enough to be an operator?
1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3575.259,3578.378,"--I think it's a different test, but I would also say that even if you did that, what CPC did in this case--"
1997.97-454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3578.378,3580.563,Would not... I'm not suggesting you're giving that away.
1997.97-454,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3580.563,3580.847,--Yes.
1997.97-454,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3584.282,3585.182,"Thank you, Mr. Geller."
