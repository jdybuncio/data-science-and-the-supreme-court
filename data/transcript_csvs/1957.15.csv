1957.15,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,14.986,"Number 15, Public Service Commission of Utah and Utah Citizens Rate Association, Appellants, versus United States of America and Interstate Commerce Commission."
1957.15,0,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,27.968,29.633,If the Court please.
1957.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,320.625,326.239,Is any member of your Commission sit with the I.C.C.?
1957.15,0,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,326.239,328.822,"I'm not sure, Your Honor."
1957.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,343.594,345.74,He must have been notified of course?
1957.15,0,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,345.74,346.736,They appeared as a party.
1957.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,347.954,348.98,A party but --
1957.15,0,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,348.98,352.381,"Yes, but not -- it wasn't in a joint board hearing --"
1957.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,352.381,352.531,It's not.
1957.15,0,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,352.531,353.916,-- if that's what Your Honor want to know.
1957.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,526.681,528.635,That was not codification.
1957.15,0,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,534.921,536.396,"That may well be, Your Honor."
1957.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,537.564,537.582,Yes.
1957.15,0,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,537.582,540.195,-- because that is under the Section 13.
1957.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,549.892,568.337,"But it makes an important distinction Mr. Rampton because under the Shreveport doctrine, it was merely -- Interstate Commerce Commission has power to find specific discrimination against a specific rate or commodity by virtue of the state rate."
1957.15,0,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,573.934,575.382,That is right.
1957.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,575.382,576.947,But this is a very different thing.
1957.15,0,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,576.947,578.592,"I appreciate that, Your Honor."
1957.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,612.598,613.764,You mean the ultimate finding?
1957.15,0,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,613.764,614.391,What's that?
1957.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,614.391,615.637,You mean the ultimate finding?
1957.15,0,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,615.637,616.533,The ultimate findings.
1957.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,663.796,672.533,"Would it -- would it trouble you, your argument -- the order of your argument if you tell us now what specific findings you challenge?"
1957.15,0,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,672.533,673.579,Yes.
1957.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,679.601,681.016,Don't -- just indicate what kind of issues were --
1957.15,0,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,681.016,693.544,The findings that conditions affecting the transportation of Utah freight intrastate are not more favorable than those affecting interstate traffic.
1957.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,707.908,717.973,"You -- you challenge -- you say there's no support for that, if there were support for that, would the conclusion of the Commission flow from that finding?"
1957.15,0,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,717.973,719.121,"Yes, under the doctrine in the King case."
1957.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,719.121,719.828,Yes.
1957.15,0,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,729.614,730.682,That is right.
1957.15,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,733.596,735.413,That's the case.
1957.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,735.413,737.297,"Well now, may I ask in that same connection."
1957.15,0,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,760.948,776.863,"Well, all of them would be involved in directly but the one that is involved directly at the moment would be number one."
1957.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,878.871,882.584,Well now your -- your minor premise is all factors.
1957.15,0,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,882.584,885.317,All -- all major -- all material factors.
1957.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,889.337,891.291,Well there are several hundred actual factors.
1957.15,0,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,891.291,893.087,Oh I -- I assume so.
1957.15,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,906.054,912.23,Would it disorganize your argument now just briefly to spell out what you consider the material factor?
1957.15,1,19913,calvi_l_rampton,,912.23,922.187,What I consider the material factor that they did not prove and that we think we'd prove -- we think we picked up a burden of proof that we didn't have to bear and show that there was a difference.
1957.15,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,926.197,926.776,The key?
1957.15,2,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,926.776,930.209,That's the key to the thing in my opinion.
1957.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,930.209,931.247,Density of traffic --
1957.15,3,19913,calvi_l_rampton,,931.247,940.218,"Density of traffic, Your Honor."
1957.15,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,944.048,950.848,I'm a little bothered by this rigorous syllogistic problem that you put to us.
1957.15,4,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,953.523,954.15,Well I -- I believe --
1957.15,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,954.15,954.767,Is it --
1957.15,4,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,954.767,959.007,"I believe the King case is an exercise in formal logic, Your Honor."
1957.15,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,978.662,979.112,Yes.
1957.15,4,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,979.112,982.573,-- with both intrastate and interstate lumped in there.
1957.15,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1008.756,1009.425,All right.
1957.15,4,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,1009.425,1015.75,"All right, now we come to the second step which I say is the minor premise in syllogism which is this."
1957.15,5,19913,calvi_l_rampton,,1029.839,1029.967,Yes.
1957.15,6,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,1029.967,1033.508,"If that breaks down, then the -- then it doesn't follow at all."
1957.15,6,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1036.67,1051.278,"I'm -- I'm suggesting that this is not a problem in arithmetic or mathematics that the fact does -- elements of the problem will awfully dubious, ambivalent and illusive."
1957.15,6,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,1051.278,1054.599,"Well I -- I quite agree with that, Your Honor."
1957.15,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1314.586,1319.524,"What you mean really is to lower the portion of a fix cost, is it?"
1957.15,6,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,1319.524,1320.053,Yes.
1957.15,6,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1320.053,1320.921,Or unit?
1957.15,6,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,1320.921,1330.938,"Yes, as your density increases you -- your proportion of the fixed cost becomes lower proportionately on each unit of transportation produce."
1957.15,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1330.938,1337.493,"Now, can you tell us quickly what -- what's the contest in the apportionment?"
1957.15,6,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,1337.493,1337.79,We --
1957.15,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1337.79,1339.168,Is it in the record?
1957.15,6,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,1339.168,1340.084,"Yes, it's in the record."
1957.15,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1374.355,1376.09,In the second volume?
1957.15,6,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,1376.09,1377.904,It's in the second volume.
1957.15,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1396.925,1403.709,What page is it?
1957.15,6,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,1403.709,1438.119,The Exhibit 64 it's referred to in my brief if I remember Your Honor but I can't seem to locate it very quickly.
1957.15,7,20266,charles_h_weston,,2730.871,2733.316,If the Court please.
1957.15,7,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2874.773,2877.326,What was that you said about both interstate?
1957.15,7,20266,charles_h_weston,,2877.354,2898.582,I say it's -- well if the revenue needs or determined by its entire operations which are naturally both intrastate and interstate and when Congress gave the condition prior to adjust interstate rates in relation to revenue requirements.
1957.15,7,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3041.835,3064.304,"Mr. Weston, could we agree as a starting point that the Commission could not in looking at the needs of the road and finding it needs more money and raise without more -- without more to raise the rates both of intrastate and interstate."
1957.15,7,20266,charles_h_weston,,3079.411,3083.072,"I certainly, I would agree on that and of course to us --"
1957.15,7,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3083.072,3087.082,"So that there's (Voice Overlap) required, I'm not now, getting to the facts of this case."
1957.15,7,20266,charles_h_weston,,3087.082,3087.479,Yes.
1957.15,7,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3087.479,3088.856,I just want to get my directions.
1957.15,7,20266,charles_h_weston,,3088.856,3089.565,Yes.
1957.15,7,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3089.565,3106.734,"So that, there is require because of the continuing authority recognized in the regulation of intrastate rate, a specific direction and a specific justification for touching intrastate road -- rates."
1957.15,7,20266,charles_h_weston,,3106.734,3109.307,"Certainly, I agree to what you said."
1957.15,7,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3109.307,3132.436,"And the Commission -- and this Court in addition to the other things it has held, had also rigorously insisted upon as -- emphasize the importance of being specific and responsible in relation to the rate system of the State and not having a change in the rate system of the States through merely from a change in the interstate rate, you agree with that?"
1957.15,7,20266,charles_h_weston,,3132.436,3132.733,Yes.
1957.15,7,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3134.031,3134.358,All right.
1957.15,7,20266,charles_h_weston,,3134.358,3145.628,And it was a very considerable hearing as the record here would indicate before it was on the action taken with respect to the interstate rate.
1957.15,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3145.628,3158.758,Could you state in a sentence that it might not be possible what has to be shown in addition to the showing that raised -- raised interstate rates 15% (Inaudible).
1957.15,7,20266,charles_h_weston,,3170.953,3183.53,I think that it has to be shown that the operating conditions within the State are no more favorable than those as to interstate commerce.
1957.15,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3195.609,3199.262,"Is that -- is that concededly true here, your second point?"
1957.15,7,20266,charles_h_weston,,3199.262,3213.641,"That second point, I understood, was contested by appellants in the brief that I also inter -- understood, Mr. Rampton to say that as to his evidence both ways on the point, he was not pressing that."
1957.15,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3220.596,3222.311,You say that -- excuse me.
1957.15,7,20266,charles_h_weston,,3222.311,3223.167,All right.
1957.15,7,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3265.432,3268.386,Does -- does Utah -- I ought to know but I don't.
1957.15,8,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,3276.326,3276.885,Yes.
1957.15,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3276.885,3278.182,We all agree to that.
1957.15,9,20266,charles_h_weston,,3292.513,3301.651,I don't think that it claims the first and I think that it claims simply that the railroads have not established the case --
1957.15,9,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3301.651,3301.899,Yes.
1957.15,10,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,3301.899,3303.713,-- for affirmative action for the Interstate Commerce Commission.
1957.15,10,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3303.713,3306.588,But it doesn't challenge the reasonableness which is the last point you've made.
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3306.588,3310.009,I -- I don't believe they could in this proceeding but in any case --
1957.15,11,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3310.009,3311.197,I don't mean in this proceeding.
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3311.197,3312.133,Yes.
1957.15,11,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3312.133,3316.225,You left me a little in doubt yet in your criteria.
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3334.468,3341.245,"That is the Commission has to find, I think, before it can act that the state conditions are no more favorable --"
1957.15,11,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3341.245,3342.55,What do you mean by favorable?
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3348.648,3350.271,It would be the -- yes.
1957.15,11,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3369.75,3372.714,Suppose by reason of mass transportation.
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3392.235,3394.141,"I certainly, think it would."
1957.15,11,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3430.899,3448.656,"Suppose the total quantity of transportation inside the State, to a such nature that so many (Inaudible) the result that the intrastate in Utah actually cost less than the others."
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3454.642,3466.78,I think that that would be doubtful if that result that you suggest could be doubtful if you are breaking the test all movement within the State of Utah.
1957.15,11,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3502.459,3508.48,"Mr. Weston, could I ask you this in order to make this case more concrete at least for me."
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3532.82,3534.088,That's the ultimate question.
1957.15,11,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3534.345,3539.326,"Well, I -- I only get the trouble about subsidiary and it means nothing to me usually."
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3554.592,3556.713,I think it follows from two things.
1957.15,11,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3563.487,3566.743,"Well, don't -- that's the conclusion but what appeared before the Commission."
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3566.743,3571.414,"Oh, well if you want me to talk about the evidence where, I can --"
1957.15,11,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3571.414,3573.041,"Well, isn't that what we finally agreed into --"
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3573.041,3573.708,All right.
1957.15,11,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3573.708,3575.882,-- to find out whether as a matter of fact --
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3575.882,3576.299,Yes.
1957.15,11,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3576.299,3581.544,"-- when you get through with the job, density more favorable or less favorable."
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3598.526,3610.302,"Well, let me devote myself to the question of the evidence relating to similarity in operating conditions."
1957.15,11,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,3676.432,3680.871,"What do you say to the other side that points that the traffic is more dense, there's more of it (Voice Overlap) --"
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3680.871,3682.488,Could I -- wait just a minute.
1957.15,11,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3718.643,3719.731,Well what's that proof?
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3721.945,3722.692,That --
1957.15,11,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3722.692,3724.387,What did that evidence proved?
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3724.387,3733.989,"It proves that they -- when they're operated in the same way that the -- and they're on the same train, same cars --"
1957.15,11,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3733.989,3745.018,"Yes, but suppose -- you suppose you had hundred -- a hundred car freight of which 10 cars were bound interstate and 90 cars were intrastate, would that make a difference?"
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3745.018,3745.637,No.
1957.15,11,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3761.956,3762.315,Yes.
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3776.191,3776.379,Yes.
1957.15,11,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3809.646,3831.304,"But if you don't take that into consideration, aren't you back to the -- to the point where we started when you were asked the question as to whether -- whether the -- the mere raising of the interstate rates gave the Commission the right to -- to raise the intrastate rates without more?"
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3831.304,3831.542,No.
1957.15,11,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3840.72,3858.498,"Well, what is that -- what does that prove, Mr. Weston as to what the cost of operating is intrastate wise and interstate wise and what is the revenue of contribution intrastate wise and interstate wise?"
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3871.648,3882.844,It shows that whatever expense they have as to one kind of traffic is applicable to the other because they handle it as a unit.
1957.15,11,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3883.483,3893.272,"Well, you don't mean by that that every train -- every train has both intrastate and interstate traffic on it, does it?"
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3893.272,3894.168,"No,no."
1957.15,11,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3894.266,3896.37,"Now, suppose you have -- supposed you have a hundred."
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3912.599,3921.467,"Well, it would not I think bear greatly on the question of whether the operating conditions are from the expense put were different."
1957.15,11,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3926.834,3928.391,The contribution that would --
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3928.391,3928.559,Yes.
1957.15,11,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3928.559,3929.216,-- to verify (Voice Overlap) --
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3929.216,3929.773,Here on then --
1957.15,11,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3929.773,3931.308,But isn't that important?
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3931.308,3934.51,"I think under some circumstances, it maybe, yes."
1957.15,11,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3934.51,3938.869,Isn't it essential to one of these hearings?
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3938.869,3961.172,"I think that when these identity in operating conditions is established, then it becomes incumbent to show in what respect that general proposition is not true and appellants did undertake to make such a showing here and they gave this density figures."
1957.15,11,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3961.172,3963.068,Who was the burden on --
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3963.068,3963.136,I think --
1957.15,11,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3963.136,3963.176,-- for showing that?
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,3963.176,3989.752,"I think it's initially on the railroads, but I think that after they established that the same methods are used in both inter and intrastate commerce, that then to chose special conditions affecting intrastate commerce that make that general proposition in our -- rest on the -- those who are contesting the application."
1957.15,11,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3989.752,3994.201,"Mr. Weston, your argument leaves me a little doubt."
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4018.254,4018.691,I --
1957.15,11,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4018.691,4038.724,And why didn't -- why isn't that urging if that that they have the power to say that despite Congress' definition there that they can show identity of operation by showing what everybody knows the average kind of train with the same kind of employees is entitled to equalized rate.
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4038.724,4040.478,I think that --
1957.15,11,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4040.478,4041.317,Maybe that's right.
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4047.972,4053.309,That's -- that's absence in showing they would take it out of that general proposition.
1957.15,11,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4085.923,4095.048,"Well, should the Commission show that is the burden on them or is the burden on the other end to show that there are special lines of that kind in such a state."
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4095.048,4106.707,I think that because of the identity in the manner of handling and which I think grows out of the fact that we have one way over the systems.
1957.15,11,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4106.707,4106.747,But I --
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4106.747,4107.607,Serving undistinguished --
1957.15,11,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4107.607,4109.022,I agree to that.
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4109.022,4112.883,"Well, that is the case really where the burden lies."
1957.15,11,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4122.433,4129.974,But isn't that just the same fact by saying that what we are faced with here is there are two sections.
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4165.125,4173.973,It maybe various things that might be shown that for example in raising the interstate rates would not increase revenue.
1957.15,11,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4178.363,4182.652,"Well, I guess that would be a little difficult to show when you get a 15% raise of freight."
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4186.792,4187.032,No.
1957.15,11,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4205.132,4212.756,What else -- what else -- you start -- you gave one that increase rates might lose traffic and now what -- what else would --
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4212.756,4233.962,"Well, one of the example I gave earlier of special conditions is to -- as to certain traffic, branch is heavy movement from the mine to consuming center with regular train movements producing operating economies."
1957.15,11,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4244.191,4247.385,"Well, this is general -- general increases."
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4247.385,4247.892,Yes.
1957.15,11,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4247.892,4251.143,Not specialize and pick up certain things --
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4251.143,4259.746,"I think that when you consider that, you have to consider the fact of what the Utah Commission did."
1957.15,11,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4297.75,4302.807,Well suppose the premise from which I understood Mr. Rampton argued is correct.
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4328.13,4328.218,Well --
1957.15,11,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4328.218,4333.575,"If he's right in that, where they right in -- was the Commission right in giving his raise?"
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4333.575,4349.175,"Well, rather than give such a general answer, I would like to deal with the question of the traffic density and what it really signifies because that is the factor that I think, Mr. Rampton stressed more than any other."
1957.15,11,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4349.175,4354.702,"I don't ask you to see before you did it, whether where would come out --"
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4354.702,4354.76,Well --
1957.15,11,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4354.76,4358.002,-- is that crucial or is it not.
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4359.048,4379.445,"I think that where you show differences, it should be shown with reference to what is intrastate as distinguished from interstate rather than just on what moves within the State is distinguished from what moves somewhere else."
1957.15,11,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4453.529,4455.904,I don't understand that [Laughter] --
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4455.904,4455.924,Well --
1957.15,11,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4455.924,4467.118,I mean I -- I think I know the meaning of all the word you brought it but I don't understand that in this whole table between intrastate and interstate.
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4468.346,4470.2,"That's what I think, that's our position."
1957.15,11,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4470.2,4471.917,"Well, I mean is that -- is that what you're saying?"
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4471.917,4475.648,"Yes, precisely."
1957.15,11,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4482.193,4489.506,"What are the -- from you point of view perhaps, on what artificial assumption was this table made?"
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4489.506,4493.119,"Well, I don't know that we can call it entirely artificial."
1957.15,11,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4500.349,4512.507,"Well, but -- but then the interstate was not based on whatever move interstate, is that right? Intrastate maybe descriptive for a portion of an interstate road --"
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4512.507,4512.774,Yes.
1957.15,11,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4512.774,4521.119,"-- but interstate is not descriptive if it excludes a shipment that takes place not wholly within Utah, is that right?"
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4521.119,4541.512,"The systemize figures covered their entire traffic but the intrastate figures covered not what was really interstate commerce but interstate commerce plus this mingled -- well, plus what was interstate commerce because as I say, came in the Utah from another State."
1957.15,11,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4541.512,4553.038,"But the other way around.Interstate on the right hand column of that table, is not descriptive or what we usually call interstate namely, something beginning in one State and not ending there --"
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4553.038,4553.375,That's right.
1957.15,11,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4553.375,4554.633,-- without going outside of it.
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4554.633,4561.328,It was the -- it was the entire system figures that would include the interstate commerce in other States --
1957.15,11,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4561.328,4561.486,All right.
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4561.486,4567.392,-- in which the railroads operated.
1957.15,11,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4567.971,4582.74,"Where is -- where is the -- where is the record confirmation of what you've said -- you've just said and since Mr. Rampton relied heavily on that density factor, it becomes very important."
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4582.74,4608.047,"If you'll turn to page 21 of our brief, the first paragraph, first paragraph in that page."
1957.15,11,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4608.047,4609.724,"Now, what you're saying -- let's see if I understand."
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4635.271,4636.07,Yes.
1957.15,11,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4636.07,4638.892,All right.
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4638.892,4643.523,"If you've turn to those we -- we cite record 293, I think --"
1957.15,11,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4643.523,4644.299,293 --
1957.15,11,20266,charles_h_weston,,4644.299,4645.996,-- of the record --
1957.15,12,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,4645.996,4647.673,We agree to that is so.
1957.15,13,20266,charles_h_weston,,4647.673,4649.787,Mr. Rampton said that he agrees that that is so.
1957.15,14,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,4649.787,4651.761,I -- I so stated in my argument Mr.--
1957.15,14,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4651.761,4653.518,"Well, I'm very sorry."
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,4657.268,4657.348,Well --
1957.15,15,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,4657.348,4665.471,"But when you're providing intrastate state rate, is that intrastate rate apply only to shipment with (Inaudible)"
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,4665.471,4665.671,"Oh, yes, yes."
1957.15,15,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,4665.671,4666.298,-- on interstate?
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,4666.298,4667.424,Yes.
1957.15,15,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,4667.424,4668.699,(Inaudible)
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,4668.699,4669.218,That's right.
1957.15,15,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,4670.246,4674.109,Intrastate applies only to those who (Inaudible) within the State.
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,4674.109,4675.514,"I thought, you said intrastate rate."
1957.15,15,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,4675.514,4677.101,No.
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,4677.101,4685.206,The intrastate rates which the Commission imposed of course apply only to those movements but the intrastate --
1957.15,15,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4685.206,4690.204,Intrastate is not confined physically to Utah.
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,4694.07,4696.304,We are now talking about this density figures?
1957.15,15,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4696.304,4697.11,Yes.
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,4697.11,4702.739,The density figures include the Utah part of the movement.
1957.15,15,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4702.739,4702.909,Yes.
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,4720.207,4722.423,I think that the correct definition should be --
1957.15,15,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4722.423,4722.96,No.
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,4727.219,4728.756,That is exactly right.
1957.15,15,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4728.756,4738.549,And that includes any portion of traffic no matter where originating so long as it's physically transpires within Utah.
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,4738.549,4739.266,Some of it.
1957.15,15,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4739.266,4739.803,Some of it?
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,4739.803,4739.871,Yes.
1957.15,15,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4739.871,4745.997,And we don't know what portion of (Voice Overlap) of the Southern Pacific may have originated in California or where not.
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,4745.997,4757.941,I think that that is the real explanation for that extraordinary difference is to the Southern Pacific in the density figures which you know that when you question Mr. Rampton.
1957.15,15,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4835.238,4853.301,"Well, but Mr. Weston as I understood Mr. Rampton, he isn't offering this to prove any beyond that indicates that there was a reason for a railroad to the law of any factor which was not develop and which the Commission didn't require them to develop."
1957.15,15,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4893.088,4895.204,That was made.
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,4895.204,4896.042,"Yes, the Commission --"
1957.15,15,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4896.042,4898.348,"I'm asking, must?"
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,4898.348,4900.332,"No, I don't think it must."
1957.15,15,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4906.37,4913.683,"Well, this is a railroad application for increase of the level of the intrastate rates to the interstate rate, is in it?"
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,4913.683,4917.306,The test is not just discrimination and I think that the Commission (Voice Overlap) --
1957.15,15,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4917.306,4920.657,"Let me get back to my question again, Mr. Weston."
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,4929.931,4929.941,Yes.
1957.15,15,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4929.941,4932.366,-- the same crews and so forth.
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,4932.366,4940.298,That at least is the initial step and when that has been taken then I think the burden the proof shifts.
1957.15,15,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4940.298,4958.124,"Well now, supposed that all appeared in this whole case were the statements of the two officers which you referred us to, in which they said and they could say it in five minutes, we used the same crews, the same rails, the same cars, the same tracks."
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,4966.576,4980.567,"No, it would have to show that -- for one thing, it would have to show that in fact the increase would bring a return an income and additional revenue and it would have to --"
1957.15,15,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4980.567,4981.435,I think (Voice Overlap).
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,4985.98,4986.949,"No, no, no."
1957.15,15,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4995.106,4996.531,Showing that there would be an increase --
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,4996.531,4997.07,So that --
1957.15,15,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4997.07,4999.126,-- what else do they have to prove?
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,4999.126,5005.282,They have to prove that the rates will be reasonable and the --
1957.15,15,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5005.282,5006.078,"Well, what goes into that?"
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5006.078,5009.092,-- rate is raised.
1957.15,15,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5009.092,5010.19,What goes into that?
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5011.707,5022.378,"Well, I think that all the elements that are there for reasonable rates must be considered by the Commission in the 13 (4) proceeding just as in any other."
1957.15,15,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5022.378,5023.955,"Well, all the elements doesn't help me."
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5027.219,5047.751,"The comparison with other rates on the same kind of commodity, something about the volume of movement and all -- I don't pretend to be a rate expert --"
1957.15,15,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5047.751,5047.821,Yes.
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5047.821,5053.128,-- but the various factors that would be considered in determining reasonable rates.
1957.15,15,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5053.128,5057.604,"Now, what else goes into the railroad case?"
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5057.604,5069.545,"Well, I think that -- I think that discrimination would probably be the -- the ultimate conclusion that would be drawn from those --"
1957.15,15,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5069.545,5070.114,From -- from that -- that would --
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5070.114,5070.384,Yes.
1957.15,15,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5070.384,5071.5,-- make a case then.
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5071.5,5071.957,"Yes, I think it would."
1957.15,15,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5071.957,5074.113,On places of which there could be an interest.
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5074.113,5074.54,Yes.
1957.15,15,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5074.54,5083.796,"Well, why doesn't that come down merely to saying the reasonableness of rates and increase of revenues is really all they have to establish?"
1957.15,15,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5091.862,5092.848,Do we know that?
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5092.848,5100.778,I -- I think that there may be many circumstances in which there would be special operating conditions.
1957.15,15,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5116.72,5118.465,Well now how is that possible?
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5121.487,5146.413,Because if -- if the flow is much more fast and even and if -- if its -- will say true from origin to destination so then that cost stops that -- that means that there is an actual -- actually a greater return at a given rate doesn't -- on some other traffic which --
1957.15,15,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5146.413,5159.237,"But you -- the operating conditions of tracks and rails that the people is doing, how is it possible for you that that not to be the same with reference to both interstate and intrastate?"
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5159.237,5167.556,That -- that means that when -- when that is established then you have to show your special conditions which take it --
1957.15,15,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5167.556,5168.043,"Well, I mean that --"
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5168.043,5168.981,-- take it out of that.
1957.15,15,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5168.981,5171.267,Does that have to prove?
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5171.267,5171.664,I --
1957.15,15,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5171.664,5172.123,How?
1957.15,15,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5186.511,5189.031,"Can we take judicial notice of that, if that so?"
1957.15,15,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5189.031,5189.358,"Well, I'm at --"
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5189.358,5204.171,At least we -- at least the Court isn't face with that in -- in this case because there was a testimony by officials who had experience who had been in charge of Utah operations for their railroads.
1957.15,15,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5204.171,5204.521,But suppose --
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5204.521,5206.964,They knew the conditions at first hand.
1957.15,15,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5206.964,5208.451,I don't know.
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5220.574,5220.674,I think --
1957.15,15,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5220.674,5221.373,Is that true?
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5221.373,5223.327,I think that -- that maybe true and I will think (Voice Overlap) --
1957.15,15,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5223.327,5232.953,"Well, I have no doubt about that but when it gives rates that are going to interstate -- things that are going interstate is carried on the same rate, doesn't it?"
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5232.953,5233.001,Yes.
1957.15,15,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5233.001,5233.917,To the same track.
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5233.917,5234.945,Yes.
1957.15,15,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5234.945,5238.358,"That's done in Birmingham, Alabama every hour of the day."
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5238.358,5239.436,That would be certainly.
1957.15,15,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5248.924,5249.92,That's in this case.
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5269.219,5270.465,I --
1957.15,15,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5270.465,5271.82,That isn't this case.
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5271.82,5272.16,No.
1957.15,15,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5276.03,5281.319,"Well, Mr. Weston (Voice Overlap) you're here as I recall it on Milwaukee-Chicago suburban case, aren't you?"
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5281.319,5282.056,"No, I wasn't."
1957.15,15,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5282.234,5284.158,Are you familiar with that at all?
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5284.158,5287.352,I wasn't in the court either.
1957.15,15,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5287.352,5299.669,As I remember that one the -- all of the evidence went to a breakdown of revenues and expenses on the suburban traffic as suppose to interstate.
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5304.128,5308.011,"Well, I'm not familiar with the details of that case."
1957.15,15,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5308.278,5317.496,"Mr. Weston, may ask you this question in -- in longer line that Justice Frankfurter was asking you about."
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5354.774,5359.483,I think that -- that -- that should be affirmatively show that that's case --
1957.15,15,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5359.483,5360.609,I beg your pardon.
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5360.609,5374.567,"That that should be affirmatively shown where that is the case and that -- where that was affirmatively shown, it would might establish conditions from a lower interstate rate."
1957.15,15,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5374.567,5389.86,"But do you -- do you contend that the testimony of these -- these officials excludes any such consideration in the State unless, unless it is rebutted by the State of Utah?"
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5389.86,5393.506,I think that that is enough if this -- if there is no rebuttal evidence.
1957.15,15,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5393.506,5395.003,So the burden is on them?
1957.15,15,20266,charles_h_weston,,5395.003,5395.772,"Oh, yes."
1957.15,15,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5395.772,5398.954,Yes.
1957.15,16,22089,elmer_b_collins,,5414.837,5422.507,May it please the Court.
1957.15,16,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5591.57,5609.029,"In this case, is it necessary for the railroads to prove discrimination so far as intrastate rates are concerned or is it the duty of the appellants to show that there is no discrimination?"
1957.15,16,22089,elmer_b_collins,,5609.029,5611.215,Mr. Chief Justice --
1957.15,16,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5611.215,5612.221,It must be one of the other?
1957.15,16,22089,elmer_b_collins,,5612.221,5621.408,"In this case, I was sorry to notice so many questions from the bench employing the use of the term burden of proof."
1957.15,16,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5735.935,5743.321,You haven't answered my question yet and I would like to know if you have to prove undue discrimination.
1957.15,16,22089,elmer_b_collins,,5743.321,5745.135,Against interstate commerce and --
1957.15,16,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5745.135,5745.435,Yes.
1957.15,16,22089,elmer_b_collins,,5745.435,5746.85,"-- that's what was proved here, yes."
1957.15,16,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5746.85,5751.695,"Now, will you tell us in your records what proof you rely on to that effect."
1957.15,16,22089,elmer_b_collins,,5751.695,5768.814,I -- all of the -- the oral testimony in the first volume until you get to that testimony which identifies itself as being testimony of protesting parties those who protest against the --
1957.15,16,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5768.814,5773.77,Could you tell us in -- in a few a words what the nature of that testimony was?
1957.15,16,22089,elmer_b_collins,,5773.77,5786.37,"Well, would you allow me to refer you to the -- to a better statement than I have time to make of it which has been made in the Interstate Commerce Commission's report and nobody -- are opponents don't dispute --"
1957.15,16,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5786.37,5786.64,All right.
1957.15,16,22089,elmer_b_collins,,5786.64,5796.338,"-- that the Commission has properly characterized the testimony that was introduced in the Commission's reports begins at page 94, volume one of this record."
1957.15,16,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6038.451,6039.749,You have five minutes.
1957.15,16,22089,elmer_b_collins,,6039.749,6040.685,Five minutes.
1957.15,16,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6073.695,6074.943,84?
1957.15,16,22089,elmer_b_collins,,6074.943,6076.029,"84, yes."
1957.15,17,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,6347.251,6358.605,"Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Sohm is going to handle our rebuttal but I would like the permission of the Court to break our argument once more to take just a moment to try and get myself out of trouble, Mr. Justice Frankfurter --"
1957.15,17,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6358.605,6361.839,You're not in trouble with me.I can assure you quite the contrary.
1957.15,17,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,6361.839,6364.362,I think I'll try to explain that exhibit.
1957.15,17,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6364.362,6367.833,"Well, I -- I -- except to that without another word."
1957.15,17,19909,calvin_l_rampton,,6367.833,6370.168,And it's -- it's in my brief how it was figured so --
1957.15,17,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6370.168,6379.024,I'm trying to call -- being troubled of my remissness?
1957.15,17,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6379.024,6384.543,Mr. Sohm.
1957.15,18,33995,keith_sohm,,6384.543,6388.673,I'm glad to say that we have no difficulty on the density problem.
1957.15,18,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6388.673,6393.521,"Well, the difficulty that -- you may have the difficulty as to what it means."
1957.15,18,33995,keith_sohm,,6393.521,6394.829,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1957.15,18,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7090.187,7092.371,Is its rates could be raised?
1957.15,18,33995,keith_sohm,,7092.371,7096.181,It -- its rate would be raised 15% along with the others.
1957.15,18,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7110.637,7113.409,The Bamberger road is part of what system?
1957.15,18,33995,keith_sohm,,7113.409,7120.506,"No, the Bamberger road is an individual railroad which operates over a distance of about 35 miles."
1957.15,18,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7120.506,7121.312,Within Utah?
1957.15,18,33995,keith_sohm,,7121.312,7122.969,Within Utah entirely.
1957.15,18,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7122.969,7123.288,Well how does it --
1957.15,18,33995,keith_sohm,,7123.288,7129.295,Now it does carry and we will admit that it does carry interstate commerce traffic as well as intrastate commerce traffic.
1957.15,18,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7129.295,7131.349,But does it connect with some road?
1957.15,18,33995,keith_sohm,,7131.349,7142.011,"It connects, I think all of the principal railroads, both the Southern Pacific, the Western Pacific and the Union Pacific and I believe the D & R.G.also."
1957.15,18,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7154.156,7155.803,Why should its rates be raised?
1957.15,18,33995,keith_sohm,,7156.869,7158.055,"Well, we -- we have --"
1957.15,18,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7158.055,7162.804,"Is it -- well, I don't mean economically but I mean legally."
1957.15,18,33995,keith_sohm,,7162.804,7162.992,Now --
1957.15,18,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7162.992,7166.054,It can't discriminate against any interstate road.
1957.15,18,33995,keith_sohm,,7166.054,7166.272,No.
1957.15,18,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7193.713,7208.261,"In these -- in these orders, am I wrong in being under the impression that Interstate Commerce Commission in making these certain full orders, usually, has a saving clause in the line --"
1957.15,18,33995,keith_sohm,,7208.261,7209.207,I have -- I don't know of the --
1957.15,18,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7209.207,7210.804,(Voice Overlap) they can come in and make exceptions to it.
1957.15,18,33995,keith_sohm,,7210.804,7210.972,I don't know --
1957.15,18,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7210.972,7211.19,Is that right?
1957.15,18,33995,keith_sohm,,7211.19,7214.599,-- if they usually do it or not but we -- we surprise them --
1957.15,18,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7214.599,7214.979,Did they do appeal?
1957.15,18,33995,keith_sohm,,7214.979,7215.855,They did here.
1957.15,18,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7215.855,7216.135,Yes.
1957.15,18,33995,keith_sohm,,7216.135,7216.371,We surprise them --
1957.15,18,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7216.371,7218.914,It's a conventional form of the order I think.
1957.15,18,33995,keith_sohm,,7218.914,7220.629,"Yes, maybe so."
1957.15,18,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7229.163,7229.411,Yes.
1957.15,18,33995,keith_sohm,,7229.411,7232.862,-- on the patterns used by the other orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission against to other states.
1957.15,18,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7232.862,7235.377,But in -- they didn't discriminate against Utah.
1957.15,18,33995,keith_sohm,,7235.377,7235.477,No.
