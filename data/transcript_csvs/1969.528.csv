1969.528,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,35.694,"Number 528, United States against Hiltons Hotels Corporation."
1969.528,0,33660,johnnie_m_walters,,44.768,51.242,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.528,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,382.478,387.586,This was a taxable year 1955.
1969.528,0,33660,johnnie_m_walters,,387.586,389.898,This began in 1953 sir.
1969.528,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,389.898,395.864,"Well, the transaction began in '53, I would guess probably the taxable year involved of 1954?"
1969.528,0,33660,johnnie_m_walters,,395.864,397.045,Yes sir.
1969.528,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,397.045,403.086,How on earth did it take 16 years?
1969.528,0,33660,johnnie_m_walters,,403.086,408.175,"Mr. Justice Stewart, I cannot answer that it seems an awful long time."
1969.528,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,408.175,412.477,It is an awfully long time.
1969.528,0,33660,johnnie_m_walters,,416.143,418.007,Yes sir.
1969.528,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,418.007,426.472,Is this expanded just in terms of the delays and in the Northern District of Illinois and in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals or what?
1969.528,0,33660,johnnie_m_walters,,426.472,447.658,"No doubt that's part of it and I would assume that in a situation such as this where you have large corporations involved, the administration on audits probably did not come until late in the statutory period and then all of the proceedings that followed that each eating up a little time."
1969.528,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,447.658,453.833,Of course it's only money I suppose.
1969.528,0,33660,johnnie_m_walters,,453.833,478.027,"The sole issue here then is whether the fees paid to the consultants, lawyers and others, in connections with the appraisal proceedings that followed the merger are deductible ordinary and necessary business expenses are non-deductible capital expenditures."
1969.528,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,556.875,562.375,What about the legal expenditures next to the mergers itself.
1969.528,0,33660,johnnie_m_walters,,562.375,564.4,"They are capital items, sir."
1969.528,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,564.4,565.39,They are not deductible?
1969.528,0,33660,johnnie_m_walters,,565.39,566.627,No sir.
1969.528,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,568.562,573.671,The lawyers fees were ignored at merger client and in fact they're non-deductible.
1969.528,0,33660,johnnie_m_walters,,573.671,574.938,That's right sir.
1969.528,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,574.938,575.9,After Woodward.
1969.528,0,33660,johnnie_m_walters,,575.9,580.248,Yes sir.
1969.528,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,648.248,654.612,"Well, the Eighth Circuit has decided this case very recently, am I right?"
1969.528,0,33660,johnnie_m_walters,,658.4,663.898,"I don't recall Mr. Justice, which came first calendar-wise."
1969.528,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,814.656,819.8,"Thank you, Mr. Walters."
1969.528,1,36177,milton_a_levenfeld,,822.015,825.496,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.528,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,884.976,893.122,"Well, would they have engage in this process of valuing their shares if they have not been going the acquire them?"
1969.528,1,36177,milton_a_levenfeld,,895.657,899.476,"The occasion for this expense was not the merger itself, Mr. Chief Justice."
1969.528,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,916.261,923.766,I was putting on the emphasis on the acquisition as distinguished from the merger to the extent that you --
1969.528,1,36177,milton_a_levenfeld,,923.766,924.597,The acquisition --
1969.528,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,924.597,925.213,--separate them.
1969.528,1,36177,milton_a_levenfeld,,925.213,926.922,"-- was not by Hilton, Your Honor."
1969.528,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,948.936,950.929,But which was the surviving corporation?
1969.528,1,36177,milton_a_levenfeld,,950.929,954.337,Hilton was the surviving corporation.
1969.528,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1197.713,1203.477,"What happened to the stock once it's held, treasury stock or (Inaudible)?"
1969.528,1,36177,milton_a_levenfeld,,1203.477,1218.042,"The -- as I read the statute, Mr. Justice White the stock became treasury stock and Waldorf was obligated to pay for it at its fair value."
1969.528,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1218.042,1225.866,"How does the purchase price of the stock and I mean, the tax loans, is that concededly a capital expenditure?"
1969.528,1,36177,milton_a_levenfeld,,1225.866,1227.362,That is conceding capital expenditures.
1969.528,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1227.362,1229.034,Why did you concede that?
1969.528,1,36177,milton_a_levenfeld,,1229.034,1245.45,I concede that Your Honor because of the fact that it was unnecessary for Hilton to exchange the one in a quarter shares for this shares that has ceased to become outstanding shares of Waldorf.
1969.528,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1247.323,1263.24,"Why wasn't -- why wasn't the expenditure for the actual price of the stock, why wasn't that as deductible as the miscellaneous expenses connected with the acquisition?"
1969.528,1,36177,milton_a_levenfeld,,1263.24,1269.153,"My point, Your Honor, is that miscellaneous expenses are not connected with the acquisition."
1969.528,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1275.684,1276.324,No what?
1969.528,1,36177,milton_a_levenfeld,,1276.324,1279.348,Functional relationship.
1969.528,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1280.344,1288.291,"You mean, you wouldn't have incurred these expenditures any way that you haven't required the stock?"
1969.528,1,36177,milton_a_levenfeld,,1288.291,1294.376,"It wasn't that, it was because we could not agree on price that we incurred these expenditures."
1969.528,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1294.376,1297.003,Right but you still want to divide the stocks?
1969.528,1,36177,milton_a_levenfeld,,1297.003,1299.299,"We have already inquired the stock, Your Honor."
1969.528,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1299.299,1301.688,I suppose you could've backed out.
1969.528,1,36177,milton_a_levenfeld,,1301.688,1306.083,We could not back out if nor could have the dissenting shareholders.
1969.528,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1306.083,1313.33,"But you knew in advance of the merger, if anybody consented you would have to buy the stock."
1969.528,1,36177,milton_a_levenfeld,,1313.33,1319.087,We know that if they did exercise their rights we would have had to buy the stock.
1969.528,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1319.087,1327.791,"But if certainly absent some dissent and absent the acquisition of stock, you wouldn't think (Inaudible)?"
1969.528,1,36177,milton_a_levenfeld,,1327.791,1329.692,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1969.528,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1544.236,1601.533,"What if the buyer and seller signed a contact for the purchase of the assets of a company and they signed the contract both sides are obligated to and they set that the two bought through with the transaction and they set the price of every item except one piece of real property over which they can't agree but they both agree that the name the appraiser will set the value and that's the price that will be paid and then the appraisers sets at the chargers of them of a good fee and they split it what about the buyer there on that appraisal be, doesn't he have to capitalize that expense?"
1969.528,1,36177,milton_a_levenfeld,,1601.533,1610.485,I will think Your Honor that that is part of the agreement as to purchase price prior to the consummation of the sale.
1969.528,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1610.485,1612.763,"Well, he doesn't know what it is going to be."
1969.528,1,36177,milton_a_levenfeld,,1612.763,1616.473,But they have agreed that it will be what is to be determined by the third party.
1969.528,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1616.473,1619.437,"Well, your answer is yes it would be a capital expenditure."
1969.528,1,36177,milton_a_levenfeld,,1619.437,1625.221,I think the answer is it probably would be a capital expense.
1969.528,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2187.345,2197.565,"I gather, that sounds to me on that argument that you could if you're right you should be able to deduct the price to the dissenter."
1969.528,1,36177,milton_a_levenfeld,,2197.565,2203.549,"Your Honor, I think there is a distinction between setting a price and paying a price."
1969.528,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2312.12,2314.09,Thank you Mr. Levenfeld.
1969.528,2,33660,johnnie_m_walters,,2320.017,2323.894,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.528,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2437.183,2443.0,Are there other decisions in the lower courts that the courts have gone opposite direction.
1969.528,2,33660,johnnie_m_walters,,2443.0,2445.717,"Mr. Justice, there are several decisions."
1969.528,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2445.717,2447.093,Some of the District Courts?
1969.528,2,33660,johnnie_m_walters,,2447.093,2451.764,"Yes sir, where they've gone both ways really."
1969.528,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2576.93,2578.815,Thank you.
1969.528,2,33660,johnnie_m_walters,,2578.815,2586.535,"Mr. Chief Justice, I would like a few minutes of rebuttal."
1969.528,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2586.535,2591.741,"Yes, you have -- excuse me."
