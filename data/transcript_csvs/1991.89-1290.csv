1991.89-1290,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.606,"We'll hear argument now in No. 89-1290, Robert Freedman v. Willie Eugene Pitts."
1991.89-1290,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,11.006,14.308,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.89-1290,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,105.583,112.07,"Well, you found for a time there was a racial balance?"
1991.89-1290,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,112.07,117.908,"That is correct, until such time as this racial... as this... these demographic changes came in."
1991.89-1290,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,117.908,118.841,How long was that?
1991.89-1290,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,120.007,120.257,Almost immediately.
1991.89-1290,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,123.709,126.678,--But there's no question that there was racial balance--
1991.89-1290,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,126.678,128.363,But there was racial balance in the beginning.
1991.89-1290,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,128.363,129.797,--as soon as there was neighborhood schools--
1991.89-1290,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,129.797,130.297,That is correct.
1991.89-1290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,152.691,160.797,--Would you agree that the school district had the obligation at the outset in 1970-71 to correct that imbalance?
1991.89-1290,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,160.797,161.397,Yes.
1991.89-1290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,165.515,184.809,"So is what you are saying that there is really at least a two-phase aspect to the remedial period: a primary phase in which there must be racial balance regardless of the cause, plus a disengagement phase that follows it, and that you are now in the disengagement phase?"
1991.89-1290,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,187.225,192.313,What we're saying is that there was compliance with the order as of 1969.
1991.89-1290,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,207.403,213.456,And yet there was total segregation for 20 years after Brown.
1991.89-1290,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,213.456,215.472,"--Almost, yes."
1991.89-1290,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,215.472,217.074,To 1966.
1991.89-1290,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,217.074,218.841,"Yes, that is correct."
1991.89-1290,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,218.841,235.767,"Mr. Lee, did the district court consider the possibility that the demographic changes in the seventies were attributable somehow to racially identifiable schools in the district?"
1991.89-1290,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,235.767,242.004,"As I read his order, that is simply not consistent with any of the findings that he made."
1991.89-1290,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,243.687,245.622,But no finding really dealt with that.
1991.89-1290,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,247.038,253.108,"--No, it happens that he did not make that specific finding."
1991.89-1290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,266.999,282.192,"But you agree that in the initial period when there is imbalance, even if that imbalance is caused by demographic factors, that the school district had a duty to realign the attendance zones to cause racial balance to the extent practical?"
1991.89-1290,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,282.192,284.192,"Well, that really wasn't this case."
1991.89-1290,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,400.769,411.875,"But you are asking that we say that with respect to some of the so-called Green factors, that it apply incrementally some how."
1991.89-1290,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,429.901,432.067,"Yes, it is an important question, Justice O'Connor."
1991.89-1290,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,477.477,478.596,"Mr. Lee, may I ask you a question here?"
1991.89-1290,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,516.119,517.721,I think... excuse me.
1991.89-1290,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,517.721,518.804,That's the whole... that's the question.
1991.89-1290,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,518.804,518.971,Yes.
1991.89-1290,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,524.172,539.032,"Well, I'm assuming the relevant finding of fact is (a), it is attributable to people moving into the county from Atlanta, and (b), there will be as a result of that change, racially identifiable schools only a year or two after the decree was entered."
1991.89-1290,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,540.8,549.989,"--I think I would be arguing the same thing, particularly if we could have had the additional finding that we have here that there's little that we could have done that would have made a difference."
1991.89-1290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,594.684,601.422,"Well, the constitutional violation is that this causes a stigma to the entire black community."
1991.89-1290,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,624.037,636.845,"That proposition, Justice Kennedy, that it is the stigma that is the controlling factor, has been considered by the Court on several occasions and never commanded a majority of the Court."
1991.89-1290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,687.525,707.339,"But isn't it plausible to say that the stigma is also controlled by the time that's elapsed so that the stigma that existed, say, in 1971 is much more clear to the community, is much more palpable, much more tangible than in 1991?"
1991.89-1290,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,707.339,709.523,And those can be difficult factual questions.
1991.89-1290,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,970.929,972.715,"Thank you, Mr. Lee."
1991.89-1290,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,974.781,982.237,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.89-1290,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1104.014,1104.947,Suppose they had.
1991.89-1290,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1126.26,1126.744,No.
1991.89-1290,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1138.566,1142.619,In Pasadena there had been desegregation in place for a number of years.
1991.89-1290,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1142.619,1161.765,"--The plan as I... I don't want to quibble about the facts in Pasadena, but the demographic changes in Pasadena began very promptly after the plan went into effect in 1970, so that in 1971 and '72, very early on, there were in fact racially identifiable schools."
1991.89-1290,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1200.12,1212.178,"But Mr. Starr, if I understand your argument, it really wouldn't have mattered if the plaintiff had objected violently all along the line because they wouldn't have been entitled to any protection from demographic changes not caused by the dual system."
1991.89-1290,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1212.178,1219.765,"If they had not been... because it may be, and I agree with Mr. Lee, that the facts are terribly important in each of these cases."
1991.89-1290,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1237.774,1253.569,"So to boil it down, what you're saying is they really wouldn't have had a valid argument to advance even if they had argued from the very beginning that something should have been done to prevent the creation of a lot of racially identifiable schools shortly after the decree was entered if they were caused by demographic changes."
1991.89-1290,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1253.569,1254.353,"Justice Stevens, I--"
1991.89-1290,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1254.353,1255.603,"It may well be right, but that--"
1991.89-1290,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1255.603,1262.673,"--Well, Justice Stevens, I think they should certainly be heard to say this plan was defective for the following reasons."
1991.89-1290,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1272.462,1279.932,"--I don't see why it would matter for the reasonably foreseeable because the thing that was foreseeable was not, under your argument, was not the consequence of illegal conduct."
1991.89-1290,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1279.932,1283.669,--I think reasonable foreseeability is important because it goes to good faith.
1991.89-1290,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1290.173,1291.273,"Well, why wouldn't it be in good faith?"
1991.89-1290,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1298.86,1300.46,--I think they could do that.
1991.89-1290,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1300.46,1302.395,So I don't see how foreseeability changes it a bit.
1991.89-1290,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1304.278,1321.871,"They could very well say our duty is to treat all students alike and not to treat them differently on grounds of race, and that we're entitled to have a proper and appropriate educational system as long as we don't engage in that."
1991.89-1290,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1345.65,1348.502,"Well, are you going to look at those factors incrementally?"
1991.89-1290,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1367.73,1368.832,"--Oh, I don't think so."
1991.89-1290,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1407.54,1416.396,Even if that were necessary in order to achieve the requirements on the other two factors that haven't been met?
1991.89-1290,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1416.396,1424.816,If there were a finding that that were necessary... I would... I certainly would agree if it were necessary in order to achieve the dismantling.
1991.89-1290,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1445.127,1456.418,"What you want us to hold, then, that once one of the Green factors has been satisfied, that it simply should be a presumption against further orders with respect to that factor?"
1991.89-1290,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1456.418,1458.484,I wouldn't put it in that way.
1991.89-1290,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1574.624,1576.34,"Thank you, General Starr."
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1579.259,1583.194,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court:"
1991.89-1290,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1636.328,1639.649,"Excuse me, what do you mean by fewer resources?"
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1639.649,1655.492,"The district court found in looking at those schools that are disproportionately black versus those schools that are disproportionately white that you consistently find that less money is spent per pupil in black schools, that the teachers in the black schools have less experience than the teachers in the white schools."
1991.89-1290,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1655.492,1659.627,I'm just wondering how that could be without a finding of discrimination.
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1671.685,1673.685,The district court suggested that was one element.
1991.89-1290,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1751.498,1772.761,"Could I ask what if it was unquestioned that the faculty had been appropriately desegregated and that resources were equal, but nevertheless, there was this student imbalance that was... that had been going on for years, almost immediately after the decree was entered?"
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1773.963,1779.267,"Well, the obligation of the school board in 1969 was to break the pattern of segregation."
1991.89-1290,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1785.255,1807.002,"Well, let's assume that if the staff and the resources are all... have all been solved, and you think the school board, nevertheless, has a constitutional duty to reassign students to counteract the demographic changes?"
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1807.002,1813.155,"I don't think the school district has an obligation to counteract purely demographic changes, and that's not what we're suggesting."
1991.89-1290,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1832.533,1842.389,"Well, you think the school board would have been required to reassign students to counteract demographic changes for at least 3 years."
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1842.389,1845.841,"Well, the Solicitor General, in their brief suggests 3 years, and we agree."
1991.89-1290,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1845.841,1846.341,Is that right?
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1846.341,1847.057,Yes.
1991.89-1290,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1847.241,1852.026,So there is a constitutional duty to counteract demographic changes.
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1852.026,1858.513,The phrase that's used in the Fifth and Eleventh Circuit to describe this phenomenon is one swallow does make a spring.
1991.89-1290,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1865.119,1866.036,"Well, I couldn't answer my question by quoting that."
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1866.036,1868.154,"I thought maybe I could, though."
1991.89-1290,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1868.77,1870.737,"Well, all you had to do is say yes."
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1871.439,1876.408,"That wasn't as eloquent as one swallow, which is not my phrase."
1991.89-1290,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1890.982,1893.248,"Well, is that, strictly speaking, true?"
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1935.991,1947.697,"I don't think there's any question that remedies have to be tailored to the problem, but what the school board's argument rests on is the notion that the Green factors don't interact in any way, that they're separate and distinct conditions."
1991.89-1290,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1947.697,1959.319,"Well, I thought in response to my questions that we got some response that conceivably they may be interrelated and that the remedies, conceivably, could be."
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1959.319,1964.604,"Well, I think the remedy has to be what cures the pattern of segregation that has built up."
1991.89-1290,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1974.46,1975.943,But we don't have a finding to that effect.
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1975.943,1977.526,We do not have a finding.
1991.89-1290,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1992.636,1993.719,"Well, the district court--"
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1994.269,2004.776,"Faculty... if a school district assigns disproportionately faculty to one particular school, that says something to the community about what that school is."
1991.89-1290,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2022.417,2036.058,"Well, I know, but the... at your first step, the school board has no responsibility and couldn't possibly have prevented these demographic changes which caused the student imbalance."
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2036.058,2037.891,"Well, I'm not sure that's clear."
1991.89-1290,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2039.991,2042.259,"Well, that was the finding of the district court."
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2042.259,2044.045,It was the finding of the district court.
1991.89-1290,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2044.045,2044.828,"You may not be sure of it, but--"
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2044.828,2048.679,"Well, the district court in its finding on this regard is somewhat anomalous."
1991.89-1290,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2064.672,2067.059,"--Well, the court of appeals didn't upset any of his findings."
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2067.059,2068.692,The court of appeals did not upset any findings.
1991.89-1290,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2088.404,2094.121,"But whatever they managed to do really didn't cure the problem, did it?"
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2095.658,2101.893,They were making it worse.
1991.89-1290,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2120.854,2133.662,"Well, you don't... I gather that immediately upon the entry of the decree and as soon as neighborhood zones were created and the black schools were closed that there was not this racial imbalance."
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2133.662,2136.364,There was racial imbalance from the very outset.
1991.89-1290,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2160.829,2172.37,"So you disagree with your opponent that as of the date of the compliance with the decree, that there was... that there was not an imbalance."
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2172.37,2172.786,That's correct.
1991.89-1290,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2173.969,2177.004,Didn't the district court make a finding on that question?
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2177.004,2186.543,"The district court made a finding on that question but then went on to say that the finding was irrelevant in some respects, in his view, because you couldn't just achieve compliance in one instant."
1991.89-1290,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2189.312,2199.667,Hadn't your clients also conceded at one point in the litigation that there was desegregation after the decree?
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2199.667,2201.536,No.
1991.89-1290,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2237.571,2243.356,"Was there objection by the plaintiffs, then, to this decree in '69 because they felt it was inadequate?"
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2243.356,2250.895,"--There was certain objection to the plan in 1969, but the court resolved that objection in the very first year in the favor of the plaintiffs."
1991.89-1290,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2278.859,2291.75,"Mr. Hansen, suppose you have a school district that is found to have been violating the law only in faculty assignment and in allocation of resources."
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2313.913,2314.615,No.
1991.89-1290,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2324.387,2324.737,Okay.
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2329.791,2334.41,In the context of a school district that has never been intentionally segregated.
1991.89-1290,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2357.256,2361.374,"Well, I mean, is it presumptively or inescapably?"
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2372.646,2375.229,I don't think the district court addressed this question.
1991.89-1290,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2379.197,2380.731,It addressed the question implicitly.
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2389.637,2394.357,"Well, again, we're... this is... it's an anomalous opinion because it doesn't say precisely that."
1991.89-1290,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2475.039,2475.789,"Well, wait a minute."
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2479.622,2484.609,Segregation purely as a result of demographics is not against the law.
1991.89-1290,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2502.7,2518.375,"Of course, if we go on that, we... this becomes almost a noncase, if you go on that finding that the school board is then causing imbalance in the school system deliberately."
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2518.375,2524.296,"--I think this... if you go on that finding, I agree with the Court, it does become a noncase."
1991.89-1290,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2537.087,2541.491,Only the court of appeals didn't go on that thesis that you just proposed.
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2541.491,2542.991,"--Well, the court of appeals didn't explicitly--"
1991.89-1290,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2542.991,2549.311,"The court of appeals decided on different grounds, and those are the grounds we're reviewing."
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2549.311,2551.811,--The court of appeals did not explicitly do so.
1991.89-1290,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2561.535,2582.198,"Well, is it your understanding that if the Eleventh Circuit's opinion is affirmed that the district court will then be under an immediate duty to direct the school board to take all steps necessary forthwith to have racial balancing throughout DeKalb County in student assignments?"
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2582.198,2583.281,"No, I don't think that."
1991.89-1290,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2600.076,2604.611,"Well if it had been 1970, you answer to my question would have been yes, wouldn't it?"
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2604.611,2605.694,"--Yes, it certainly would have been."
1991.89-1290,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2605.694,2609.563,What's changed between now and 1970?
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2609.563,2611.681,I don't think anything has significantly has changed.
1991.89-1290,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2612.048,2613.198,"All right, so then the duty is the same."
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2629.022,2632.141,--I think that's a reasonable and plausible interpretation of the Eleventh Circuit's opinion.
1991.89-1290,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2684.99,2686.609,What do you do about Pasadena?
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2686.609,2700.933,I think Pasadena stands for the proposition that the district court can't readjust... can't minutely readjust boundaries year after year after year after year indefinitely.
1991.89-1290,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2701.618,2708.105,Even though there are some other vestiges that are still apparent?
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2709.822,2716.628,"--That is not, I believe, what Spangler stands for, what Pasadena stands for."
1991.89-1290,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2754.217,2759.752,"Would you say that is... that wasn't even a vestige then, that had to be cured?"
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2759.752,2763.037,"I think faculty hiring can be a vestige, and I think it has to be cured."
1991.89-1290,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2763.356,2766.206,"Well, it wasn't cured in that case."
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2766.206,2767.122,--It had not been cured.
1991.89-1290,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2767.122,2780.847,And yet the Court said that the district court wasn't required and shouldn't have tried to keep up with demographic changes.
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2780.847,2784.001,"Indefinitely into the future, that's what the Court said."
1991.89-1290,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2784.001,2785.417,Or even right then.
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2785.417,2792.255,"But in Pasadena itself, thereafter, the district court was involved in student assignment issues and in faculty assignment issues."
1991.89-1290,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2812.133,2816.703,May I ask another question about your theory of back in 1976.
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2843.937,2858.03,"I think the... if the school board has contributed in part to the current segregation in student assignment, as well as the other areas, then I think that children in DeKalb County are entitled to a fully desegregated education."
1991.89-1290,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2878.375,2886.363,Do you think they were required to take that action by the terms of the actual decree that was entered or by the overriding obligation under the Constitution?
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,2886.363,2886.896,Both.
1991.89-1290,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3051.161,3061.701,"Counsel, there is some discussion in the record about subdistricting as a remedy that the board might have chosen."
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,3072.325,3079.563,You can... what a classic neighborhood school plan is is there are very tight little neighborhood schools and tight little boundaries around the school.
1991.89-1290,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3092.405,3102.511,"But if that had been true, given the demographics, then southern DeKalb County would have been almost entirely black within the district... within the subdistrict, would it not?"
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,3102.511,3104.011,Today that's true.
1991.89-1290,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3128.559,3131.511,"Well, the finding is the demographic changes were inevitable."
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,3154.191,3159.643,"--If you had done it subdistrict north, central, south, that's exactly correct."
1991.89-1290,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3185.091,3191.845,I just want to ask you one question about the change in population.
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,3203.986,3204.536,Both.
1991.89-1290,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3204.536,3205.069,Both.
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,3208.455,3209.557,No.
1991.89-1290,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3239.041,3240.66,I think I'm looking at the chart you're describing.
1991.89-1290,2,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,3247.314,3247.73,"Well, that's right."
1991.89-1290,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3279.165,3282.117,"Thank you, Mr. Hansen."
1991.89-1290,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,3285.686,3291.657,It is very easy at this point in time to suggest all kinds of things that should have been done in the past.
1991.89-1290,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3309.452,3324.73,"xxx you and your colleague on the other side, about whether at any point the students were... the student attendance problem was cured."
1991.89-1290,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,3324.73,3329.098,"Well, this simply represents a shift from the position that they earlier took."
1991.89-1290,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3336.871,3339.673,"35a of what, the petitioner's appendix?"
1991.89-1290,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,3339.673,3342.525,"--I'm sorry, the petition... the appendix to the cert of petition."
1991.89-1290,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3348.928,3357.784,"Well, your opponent quotes some figures indicates that's just wrong."
1991.89-1290,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,3357.784,3363.021,"Well, I know, but they conceded that in an earlier time according to the district court."
1991.89-1290,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3363.638,3366.054,And the court of appeals didn't disturb that.
1991.89-1290,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,3366.054,3367.006,--The court of appeals did not.
1991.89-1290,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3402.926,3404.095,"Mr. Lee, may I interrupt you right there?"
1991.89-1290,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,3404.095,3404.511,Yes.
1991.89-1290,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3404.511,3407.813,Supposing we agree 100 percent with you that that proposition is wrong.
1991.89-1290,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,3411.349,3413.201,"Yes, it does, Justice Stevens."
1991.89-1290,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3415.034,3417.653,"You mean only to that extent, only with respect to that?"
1991.89-1290,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,3417.653,3419.271,"Yes, only with respect to that."
1991.89-1290,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3419.271,3426.092,"But no, I'm asking does it... the relief you ultimately seek is to vacate the decree so you don't ever have to run into court and get permission to--"
1991.89-1290,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,3426.092,3426.292,Yes.
1991.89-1290,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3429.427,3433.013,--But you don't say that the entire decree should be vacated.
1991.89-1290,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,3433.013,3433.246,"--Oh, no, no, no."
1991.89-1290,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3436.547,3438.832,You still have... you still have a problem of--
1991.89-1290,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,3438.832,3439.934,We still have these other two.
1991.89-1290,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3441.118,3446.603,--You're just wanting be free from having to readjust student assignments.
1991.89-1290,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,3446.603,3447.105,That's right.
1991.89-1290,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3447.105,3450.89,The review should be the judgment of the court of appeals in the decree of the district court.
1991.89-1290,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,3450.89,3451.74,That is correct.
1991.89-1290,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3451.74,3459.744,"That still doesn't answer my question. My question, though, is still supposing that you corrected factor 6 or 5, or whatever it was, as of today, just assume."
1991.89-1290,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,3464.695,3465.879,We think so.
1991.89-1290,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3469.849,3471.533,"Thank you, Mr. Lee."
