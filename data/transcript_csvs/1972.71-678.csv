1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,61.84,64.459,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-678,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,268.363,269.463,It was a Jet?
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,269.463,270.546,"It was a Jet, yes sir."
1972.71-678,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,279.105,281.048,And the only persons aboard were the crew?
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,281.048,289.41,The crew were deadheading if the Court pleased to pick up some revenue paying passengers at another airport.
1972.71-678,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,439.156,440.723,"I think we will resume at that point after lunch, counsel."
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,440.723,446.548,Thank you very much.[Luncheon Break]
1972.71-678,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,446.548,448.91,Mr. Bostwick you may continue.
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,448.91,451.463,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1972.71-678,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,853.783,876.098,"That means that if you fly from New York or Washington to Miami or Palm Beach, Florida, and for varying times you are under, admiralty maritime jurisdiction or under conventional common law jurisdiction."
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,876.098,877.028,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice --"
1972.71-678,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,877.028,881.254,"You got over the sea a good deal of the time on that trip, aren't you?"
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,881.254,929.427,"We believe that the jurisdictional point arises, if there is a crash on that flight and there was some discussion in the early days of aviation concerning whether the airspace above the entire earth as well as the sea was subject to the maritime jurisdiction, but as a matter of fact the Federal Aviation Act is based upon the commerce clause and the regulations which affect aircraft passing over states and over water and land is based upon that clause, but where there is a crash on that flight, whether it is beyond one marine league from the shore, whether it is 2400 yards off the the Florida Coast as was the case in Kelly, or whether it is next to the Miami airport to the closest navigable water on takeoff or landing."
1972.71-678,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,977.587,980.075,Let me interrupt you if I may Mr. Bostwick.
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,1000.032,1014.0,"Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist what would follow we say is that the general maritime law would be applicable and that as it's going on for the past 30 years and those aircraft crashes beyond a marine league from the shore, The Death on a High Seas Act would be applicable."
1972.71-678,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1014.0,1016.119,But what if we do not have a crash at all?
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,1036.387,1040.175,"There is a case like that Your Honor, it is a D'Aleman."
1972.71-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1077.452,1080.612,Crashes on bridges?
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,1080.612,1083.038,"You mean an aircraft crashing on a bridge, Your Honor?"
1972.71-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1083.038,1085.744,No if an automobile crashes (Inaudible) on navigable water?
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,1085.744,1094.813,"Well, we don’t believe that this Court is going to be required to rule on automobile cases in this case."
1972.71-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1122.238,1128.001,What would your holding be for a private barge (Inaudible) in navigable water?
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,1128.001,1134.181,"Well, for car that drives off the bridge in navigable waters, if the person is killed in --"
1972.71-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1134.181,1135.32,Assume he has killed.
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,1143.955,1160.918,"If the person were injured in the water we believe it would be a maritime tort, but again we respectfully state that it is the nature of the aviation activities here which cause us to urge the present ruling upon the Court."
1972.71-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1171.938,1181.243,I don't know that (Inaudible) principle what if a plane crashed in navigable waters is the admiralty issue.
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,1183.224,1184.768,I will be as specific as I can.
1972.71-678,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1184.768,1197.346,"Mr. Bostwick, right on that, you have this one of your important premises, if not major premises that the airplane is supplanting sea going ships as the major means of transportation."
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,1230.233,1241.052,"Well, if the Court please, I believe the government has urged that this Court use this case to fashion a locality plus rule."
1972.71-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1305.773,1308.266,It should be on a locality basis?
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,1308.266,1330.809,"The locality basis has to do with the aviation cases because, assuming arguendo there is a plus required that it is present in the aviation cases and we do not believe that it is present only in those cases where the aircraft is being used as it was previously used, like a vessel or whatever it's 90% of its flight has been over water as opposed to 5% over the land."
1972.71-678,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1330.809,1333.222,What is the plus?
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,1333.222,1336.554,"Well, that's a -- if the Court please, a good question and I have been --"
1972.71-678,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1336.554,1342.949,"I thought I understood you say that it's a locality plus, if there is a locality plus, it satisfies you, what is it?"
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,1345.279,1360.575,"We believe it to be same plus stated by the Third Circuit in Weinstein and by dissenting judge in this case, that is the relationship between a downed aircraft in navigable waters and the perils that occur to the pilots and the passengers and the analogy to a downed ship."
1972.71-678,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1374.961,1376.474,"Well, it's true of the automobiles too."
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,1381.418,1401.445,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I am not taking the position that an automobile is necessarily outside an automobile crash in which people are killed going off a bridge, is necessarily outside of admiralty jurisdiction and as I say there are some cases in which admiralty has taken cognizance of automobile cases."
1972.71-678,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1415.894,1437.945,"Well, Justice Brennan asked you what is a plus here and as I understand your answer, it's because the aircraft went down in navigable water, the people in the aircraft confront basically the same problem the people going down in the ship confront and I wish to add the comment that I don't think either of those problems are distinguished between the people who are in a car about to drown in navigable water."
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,1443.064,1457.901,"Very well, and as a matter of fact the court in New Orleans agreed and found that the injuries as a result of drowning and the horror that goes along with seeing your husband drown meant that an automobile crash into navigable waters was admiralty."
1972.71-678,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1464.318,1465.37,Mr. Bostwick.
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,1465.37,1465.98,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-678,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1465.98,1478.322,"Assuming that this automobile goes over the rail as a result of an accident, being struck by another automobile, which law would apply?"
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,1478.322,1481.132,"Well, if the --"
1972.71-678,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1481.132,1488.513,"Well, assuming that the law -- the car was going over the state’s speed limit, you can't apply that in navigable water?"
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,1488.513,1499.751,"Well, if the crash occurred -- the automobile crash occurred and a person were drowned in navigable waters, we believe that the wrongful death claim would come about under this states' -- under this Court’s holding in (Inaudible) -- that there would --"
1972.71-678,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1499.751,1500.749,And what law would apply?
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,1500.749,1503.236,General maritime law would apply.
1972.71-678,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1503.236,1506.169,To the automobile accident up on the bridge?
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,1506.169,1510.217,"To the automobile accident in which the car goes into the navigable water, I thought that was your --"
1972.71-678,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1510.217,1520.769,"Yeah, but the accident occurred up on the bridge and he struck it and as a result of being struck by the other car, he went over into the navigable water."
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,1522.028,1537.578,"Well, it's our view that if the person died as a result of being in navigable water, then the fault would be determined by the general maritime principles which utilize comparative negligence and have a cause of action for wrongful death."
1972.71-678,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1541.49,1547.845,"But it certainly wouldn't be decided whether or not there is grease on the step, to maybe on the seaworthy, but you couldn't decide it on that case."
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,1547.845,1591.667,"No sir, I wish to reserve few moments in rebuttal, but in answer to your question Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the aircraft which fly over navigable waters as distinguished from automobiles, do have a maritime plus in that the majority of the passengers which used to travel by boat, now travel by air and there is a need, there is a vast number of aviation accidents, because of the number of airports built on and around navigable waters and the number of accidents which occur in and around the landing patterns."
1972.71-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1608.396,1611.064,That is the position that government has mentioned.
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,1617.13,1636.62,"Well, it is my understanding that the government would find that in some aircraft crashes, for example, the plane that lands in the water on the flight from Washington to Chicago, but which lands in Lake Michigan fortuitously that, that would not be in maritime nexus, not in maritime place --"
1972.71-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1636.62,1646.924,"Now the flight from Chicago to Washington DC that has to go into Lake Michigan, isn't much for substitute for a steamship to Washington?"
1972.71-678,0,37742,phillip_d_bostwick,,1646.924,1657.706,"It is no substitute at all, Your Honor, but the fact of the matter is that the people who are faced with possibly drowning in Lake Michigan meet the same parallels as anyone else in navigable water."
1972.71-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1657.706,1672.404,"Now, you have got a different approach."
1972.71-678,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1672.404,1678.407,Mr. Solicitor General.
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1678.407,1683.771,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-678,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1886.138,1887.903,Who is Mr. McAvoy?
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1887.903,1891.319,Mr. McAvoy is a witness for the Plaintiff.
1972.71-678,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1891.319,1893.587,Oh! I see.
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1893.587,1907.528,And the plane finally came to the rest -- to rest in the water here and this E. McA 9 is Mr. McAvoy's testimony that represents the place where it came to rest.
1972.71-678,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1966.975,1973.385,"General, where did you say the aircraft was when the Tower warned that there were a million birds?"
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1973.385,1980.147,The aircraft was here at the end of the runway -- at the beginning of the runway before takeoff.
1972.71-678,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1980.147,1982.033,It's run.
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1982.033,1982.709,"I am sorry, sir."
1972.71-678,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1982.709,1984.333,The aircraft has not started down --
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1984.333,1991.403,The aircraft had not started into the air at the time of warning was given.
1972.71-678,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1991.403,1994.909,Could the flight have been aborted?
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1994.909,1997.87,The flight need not have started at all.
1972.71-678,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1997.87,2000.502,"I mean, was that the choice of the pilot."
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2003.335,2006.632,"Yes, the tower could have instructed them not to go off."
1972.71-678,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2006.632,2010.833,I mean we are talking about a million birds that --
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2010.833,2025.498,"After you have given the pilot, the information there is a quite a bit of a practice in the air industry that the decision is up to the pilot, not to the controller tower."
1972.71-678,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2079.303,2083.779,What do you -- what do you understand them to be meaning when they say tort occurred on land?
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2116.705,2118.487,Number three is hitting the --
1972.71-678,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2118.487,2120.34,"Well, I say that was birds."
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2120.34,2122.397,"Perhaps, yes, that is perfectly --"
1972.71-678,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2122.397,2125.569,"Well, were they talking about number one, i. e. the negligence?"
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2125.569,2126.924,I don’t know Mr. Justice.
1972.71-678,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2132.466,2137.282,"Well, I just to -- how you understood the District Court and the Court of Appeal?"
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2137.282,2139.789,There are two defendants here.
1972.71-678,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2823.782,2835.36,"I suppose too Mr. Solicitor General, you could have an approach to the Washington Airport that would bounce the airplane off of Potomac and on dry land on the runway if it missed by a few?"
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2835.36,2843.031,That would be the converse and presumably that wouldn't be an admiralty if it stopped on dry land.
1972.71-678,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3245.429,3268.279,"Under this first proposed text Mr. Solicitor General, do I understand correctly that you would say if a plane was flying from New York to London and crashed in mid-Atlantic on account of somebody's negligence that admiralty there would have jurisdiction?"
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3268.279,3271.514,"I have -- my position on this is, that would not be an admiralty."
1972.71-678,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3271.514,3272.117,That would not be?
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3272.117,3273.055,That would not be.
1972.71-678,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3273.055,3273.684,Even though --
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3273.684,3276.153,It has nothing to do with the ship that --
1972.71-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3276.153,3277.37,The Death on The High Seas Act?
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3277.37,3283.321,"The Death on The High Seas Act would apply, because Congress has power to enact it under the interstate and foreign commerce power."
1972.71-678,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3283.321,3288.82,"But that even an international flight such as that, cross-Atlantic or cross-Pacific, that would not be in admiralty even though --?"
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3288.82,3299.288,That is the position which I am seeking to advance to the Court and that's the one which seems to me to -- when you get all through with it to work out the most satisfactory.
1972.71-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3376.761,3385.431,"But in your brief, you say, “in our view, an aircraft maybe (Inaudible) maritime commerce navigation only when it is (Inaudible)?”"
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3385.431,3386.475,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1972.71-678,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3393.255,3395.556,"Well, I must say, we all misunderstood you."
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3395.556,3416.229,"And as I have worked on this case, I have found myself less willing to stand on that ground which is the broad ground of the Six Circuit, and as it became more clear to me that there is no decision of this Court as to be overruled, qualified, the Court has never dealt with the problem."
1972.71-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3416.229,3421.589,"You always say, yes, we do have to ignore that plane (Inaudible) conventional act?"
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3421.589,3422.595,"No, Mr. Justice."
1972.71-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3422.595,3423.244,Why not?
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3423.244,3424.271,Because the --
1972.71-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3424.271,3427.29,It says (Inaudible)
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3427.29,3431.264,And Congress may well have power to extend it to admiralty.
1972.71-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3431.264,3433.2,"Well, it does say in admiralty?"
1972.71-678,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3433.2,3438.851,"Alright, but Congress didn't have the slightest idea that it was talking about airplanes when it passed that statute."
1972.71-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3438.851,3441.781,But you still say Death on The High Seas Act applies?
