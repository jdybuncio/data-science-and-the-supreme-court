1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,23.774,28.102,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,229.164,232.965,Is the panel's opinion in the record?
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,232.965,234.327,There is no panel opinion.
1960.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,234.819,236.322,Do you know what the panel was?
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,236.322,246.617,"The panel consisted of Judge Clark, Judge Waterman and Judge Lewis, a judge of the Tenth Circuit sitting by designation."
1960.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,248.163,249.027,My question was to --
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,249.027,249.232,"Oh, and the --"

1960.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,254.41,256.461,-- court en banc with the use on the original panel.
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,256.461,257.711,He was on the original panel.
1960.486,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,305.179,312.043,Could I ask you a question You said at the beginning that all parties in an agreement but the record show no misconduct by the District Attorney?
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,319.222,348.787,"If the record showed some misconduct by the District Attorney, we would then be getting into an issue on which there would be some disagreement between us as to whether that kind of misconduct, if it were egregious, could, at any time, have constituted the manifest necessity, reason of manifest necessity, for the declaration of mistrial permitting, under the previous cases from this Court and in other -- the lower federal courts, a retrial."
1960.486,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,427.445,435.342,What you're saying politely is that what you got here is a record show -- showing misconduct on the part of the judge?
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,435.342,440.634,"Well, not -- not affirmative misconduct, perhaps some sort of well, unexplained conduct."
1960.486,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,537.309,539.765,Did you make any objection of the mistrial?
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,539.765,544.579,"There was no objection made because none could be made, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1960.486,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,619.494,637.211,"The -- the record does show, it's fair to say isn't it, that although the judge was apparently suffering under some sort of misapprehension, that his motive seemingly was to protect the defendant from improper conduct on the part of the United States Attorney."
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,637.211,638.117,I'm not at all sure.
1960.486,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,640.19,644.478,"On this time, it's all set out here in your brief on pages 4 and 5, the whole -- the whole (Voice Overlap) --"
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,644.478,644.892,That's right.
1960.486,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,649.467,650.137,Yes.
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,650.137,660.245,"-- â€œYou heard me, I don't want anymore district attorneys coming down here telling me how I am going to try the cases and tell your chief, if he doesn't want to put anymore cases on -- before me, it's alright with me."
1960.486,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,661.689,662.149,This --
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,662.149,664.372,-- this would indicate some sort of anger --
1960.486,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,664.372,664.406,Yes.
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,664.406,669.416,"-- as to the, perhaps, repeated inaptitude."
1960.486,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,676.681,684.66,"Well, until you talked up here, you said the court, ""If you ask one more question that alludes to suspicion, I will withdraw juror and put this case over to January of next year."
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,687.829,688.385,"Well, that maybe."
1960.486,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,688.915,697.142,"-- he said -- certainly, so far as it appears here, this was an -- misapprehension as to what the United States Attorney was doing but --"
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,697.142,697.787,But Mr. Justice Stewart --
1960.486,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,697.787,699.659,"-- I was just talking about the judge's motive, motivation."
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,699.659,701.813,The motive -- the motive and that's the trouble --
1960.486,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,701.813,702.173,Motivation.
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,702.173,704.147,"(Voice Overlap) case, we have to speculate as the motives."
1960.486,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,723.068,727.003,"Or it might've been not to hear anymore criminal cases, just to do a civil business."
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,727.003,730.008,"That may have been his underlying and secret motive, I don't know."
1960.486,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,731.486,734.97,You -- you have all the record in here that refers to this at all?
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,734.97,736.59,This is the entire record.
1960.486,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,744.162,745.53,Yes.
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,745.53,754.311,-- is -- comes from the record which was before the Court of Appeals in the form of an affidavit of the Assistant United States Attorney in which he sets forth this portion of the transcript.
1960.486,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,781.42,784.915,"I take it the plea was interposed before the start of the second trial, wasn't it?"
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,784.915,802.416,"The plea was interposed before another judge of -- not the trial judge either in the first case of the trial judge and the second trial was interposed before Judge Rayfiel, who in turn, on a motion to dismiss the indictment, denied the motion.Judge Rayfiel's short memorandum of opinion is included on the record."
1960.486,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1296.929,1300.632,We'll recess now.
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,1300.632,1304.843,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1960.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1403.534,1405.443,"Now, aren't we getting to the dirty word?"
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,1405.443,1406.206,"No, no."
1960.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1415.221,1418.441,That's the verdict -- dirty thought.
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,1418.441,1423.41,"Well, may I be excused if I engaged in indulging a dirty thought for just a moment."
1960.486,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1438.318,1439.536,What are the balancing?
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,1439.536,1440.504,"Well, that's it."
1960.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1545.29,1549.098,You get all -- you get all that out of just reading the Constitution?
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,1549.098,1549.948,I get it out of reading the Constitu --
1960.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1549.948,1552.012,You just get it all out just by reading the Constitution?
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,1552.012,1552.183,No.
1960.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1552.183,1555.201,"Even though I have any history, would you get all that out of those few words?"
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,1555.201,1557.248,"Well, I -- I think the history supports me and --"
1960.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1557.248,1561.127,"Well, I know the history, but you said you got it all out by reading the Constitution."
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,1561.127,1575.147,"Well, Your Honor, I may have misspoken myself, but when I read the Constitution, because I've learned at the -- at the feet of great teachers, such as yourself, when I read the Constitution, I read likewise the dicta -- the precedents in the courts and the --"
1960.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1575.147,1575.967,Most of that.
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,1575.967,1576.263,Alright.
1960.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1576.263,1576.513,Most of that.
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,1576.513,1577.826,That's -- that's what I attempt to do.
1960.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1577.826,1580.288,"But if you merely get it from the word, then I'd like to have your (Voice Overlap) --"
1960.486,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,1580.288,1583.197,"No, I wasn't suggesting that, Your Honor."
1960.486,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1583.197,1586.569,Ms. Rosenberg.
1960.486,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,1586.569,1589.463,May it please the Court.
1960.486,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2150.585,2150.854,Did it --
1960.486,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2150.854,2153.153,He says -- I'm sorry.
1960.486,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2153.153,2154.034,Go on.
1960.486,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2154.034,2161.285,"He says, at page 21, ""This is a power that the District Court should exercise sparingly."
1960.486,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2451.222,2459.748,For your test is that the circumstances must be such that one can reasonably and fairly say that it was the equivalent of the trial on the merits?
1960.486,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2459.748,2486.972,"The equivalent of an acquittal, that is, if the prosecution, as I see it, if the prosecution is not ready, which, until this very recent case of Whitlow in the District Court, are the only cases in the federal courts that we've been able to find where retrial has been considered bad, had been situations where the prosecution was not ready, one way or another, one case could enter the nolo."
1960.486,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2709.742,2732.282,"Ms. Rosenberg, does it -- does that lead you to the conclusion that Mr. Rand was -- was expressing that -- that the action of the judge, according to your opinion, can be based on nothing in the evidence and still be justified?"
1960.486,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2748.358,2768.421,"Well, Your Honor, if I say it seems to me, it -- clearly the judge cannot arbitrarily agree into mistrial in circumstances where he says -- well, this witness isn't here, and I think the Government ought to have him."
1960.486,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3073.282,3075.397,(Inaudible)
1960.486,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3075.397,3080.196,That would amount to a waiver of jeopardy.
1960.486,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3281.257,3287.418,"Well, Ms. Rosenberg, are there -- are there any facts and if there are, I wish you would relate them."
1960.486,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3303.271,3312.78,"Well, if you ask -- if you ask me, do I think the judge was right?"
1960.486,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3312.803,3314.27,"No, I didn't ask you that."
1960.486,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3317.549,3318.589,"Your Honor, I have the transcript here."
1960.486,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3318.589,3326.199,-- you could face a sound discretion in favor of doing what he did here?
1960.486,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3326.199,3329.413,"Well, that -- as I see it, the question is what is sound discretion?"
1960.486,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3357.213,3359.442,"Well, may I ask you this?"
1960.486,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3387.898,3388.807,"I don't know, Your Honor."
1960.486,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3389.87,3391.037,"Well, I don't either that's why I'm asking you."
1960.486,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3391.037,3392.664,"Well, what I mean to say is this."
1960.486,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3462.558,3483.271,"Do we know -- have we any basis for knowing whether this judge has had prior experience with this Assistant U.S. Attorney and had to admonish him in the past and saw what was coming and made, if you please, too hasty or ill-judged judgment as to what was next?"
1960.486,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3484.2,3485.366,I don't know anything about that.
1960.486,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3490.176,3494.577,So the judge evidently had experience with this?
1960.486,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3494.577,3495.534,At that --
1960.486,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3495.534,3496.262,"I don't' know, I'm asking --"
1960.486,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3496.262,3497.043,I don't know.
1960.486,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3497.1,3497.783,(Voice Overlap) --
1960.486,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3497.783,3500.674,-- whether they've had bad experiences.
1960.486,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3500.674,3500.679,Well --
1960.486,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3500.679,3503.491,I do know the Assistant had been in the office for sometime.
1960.486,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3504.238,3506.713,He was very impatient and uncertain.
1960.486,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3506.713,3507.188,"Yes, he was."
1960.486,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3507.188,3513.78,And impatience sometimes arises out of past experience with an individual in relation to the present.
1960.486,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3513.78,3515.036,Sometimes.
1960.486,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3518.971,3519.992,Mr. Rand.
1960.486,2,27956,harry_i_rand,,3519.992,3522.27,Mr. Chief Justice.
1960.486,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3593.562,3603.581,"We do know what Story himself said about his opinion in Perez 10 years later, no, 10 years later in Gilbert."
1960.486,2,27956,harry_i_rand,,3623.951,3624.298,And in --
1960.486,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3624.298,3634.927,"-- Justice Story said that the Court, meaning his own opinion in Perez, made no reference to that constitutional provision or rather gave no exposition of it."
1960.486,2,27956,harry_i_rand,,3634.927,3635.111,And yet --
1960.486,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3635.111,3655.676,"So apparently, he made precisely the distinction that is made by the Government here, namely, the greatest historic distinction between either a verdict or an acquittal, when the trial reaches determination and at cases such as he ruled in Perez, where he didn't even think about the double jeopardy provision."
1960.486,2,27956,harry_i_rand,,3655.676,3662.642,"Well, with all deference, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, the reading which the Government assigns to, I think this is the Gibert case, the Gilbert one, follows by some other Justice."
1960.486,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3662.642,3663.589,"Yes, twosome."
1960.486,2,27956,harry_i_rand,,3663.589,3664.515,"Gilbert, yes."
1960.486,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3665.039,3666.311,Just 10 years later.
1960.486,2,27956,harry_i_rand,,3666.311,3666.777,That's right.
1960.486,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3758.448,3764.73,What I meant -- it so happens that I reread Gilbert only yesterday with all its 60 pages.
1960.486,2,27956,harry_i_rand,,3788.75,3789.147,In the Ball case.
1960.486,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3789.147,3791.646,"-- Ball case, 163."
1960.486,2,27956,harry_i_rand,,3799.531,3804.04,"Well, may I just urge, Your Honor, the reading of that portion on page 1302."
1960.486,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3804.04,3804.055,(Inaudible)
1960.486,2,27956,harry_i_rand,,3804.055,3827.506,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice."
