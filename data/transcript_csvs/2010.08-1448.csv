2010.08-1448,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.355,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-1448, Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Association."
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,11.056,14.117,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.08-1448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,85.01,90.773,"What's a deviant -- a deviant, violent video game?"
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,94.743,96.256,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.08-1448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,100.003,102.58,There are established norms of violence?
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,102.58,104.253,"Well, I think if we look back--"
2010.08-1448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,104.253,108.375,"Some of the Grimm's fairy tales are quite grim, to tell you the truth."
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,108.375,109.829,"--Agreed, Your Honor."
2010.08-1448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,112.563,113.14,Are they okay?
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,114.591,115.671,"--Not at all, Your Honor."
2010.08-1448,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,115.671,117.559,What's the difference?
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,150.248,151.328,"No, Your Honor."
2010.08-1448,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,163.51,169.617,"I think that misses Justice Ginsburg's question, which is: Why just video games?"
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,171.758,172.444,"--Sure, Your Honor."
2010.08-1448,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,192.028,198.013,"Well, do you actually have studies that show that video games are more harmful to minors than movies are?"
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,198.013,204.962,"--Well, in the record, Your Honor, I believe it's the Gentile and Gentile study regarding violent video games as exemplary teachers."
2010.08-1448,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,226.296,232.168,Suppose a new study suggested that movies were just as violent.
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,237.48,244.554,"--Well, Your Honor, there is scientific literature out there regarding the impact of violent media on children."
2010.08-1448,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,254.646,258.471,I don't think; is that answering Justice Kagan's question?
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,274.981,275.792,No--
2010.08-1448,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,275.792,281.431,"There are people who would say that a cartoon has very little social value; it's entertainment, but not much else."
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,292.693,304.595,"--Justice Sotomayor, cartoons do not depart from the established norms to a level of violence to which children have been historically exposed to."
2010.08-1448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,307.78,311.621,That same argument could have been made when movies first came out.
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,321.522,326.99,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that's the beauty of incorporating the three prongs of the Miller standard into California's law."
2010.08-1448,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,334.114,346.404,"How is this any different than what we said we don't do in the First Amendment field in Stevens, where we said we don't look at a category of speech and decide that some of it has low value?"
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,368.722,376.249,"Your Honor, California submits that when the rights of minors are at issue and not the rights of adults, the standard should be more flexible."
2010.08-1448,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,391.71,393.617,Could you get rid of rap music?
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,407.737,408.829,I would agree--
2010.08-1448,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,408.829,409.8,Could the State--
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,409.8,412.502,"--I would agree it's egregious, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.08-1448,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,413.204,420.247,"--Why isn't that obscene in the sense that you are using the word, or deviant?"
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,420.247,426.806,--I'm not sure initially that it's directly harmful to the development of minors in the way that we know that violent video games can be.
2010.08-1448,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,436.273,440.286,"When you talk about minors, what are you -- what age group are you talking about?"
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,457.468,473.678,"--Your Honor, I would submit that, just like in the obscenity context for minors, a law similar to the New York law at issue in Ginsberg, though California's law hasn't been construed or applied, I would submit that the jury would be instructed to consider minors as a whole."
2010.08-1448,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,478.926,480.408,How can they -- how can they do that?
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,488.765,494.216,"Your Honor, I think juries and judges do this every day in the--"
2010.08-1448,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,494.216,498.326,But California doesn't do that.
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,523.471,526.953,"--Justice Ginsburg, and I think rightfully so."
2010.08-1448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,534.654,539.982,An average minor is halfway between 0 and 18; is that 9 years old?
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,539.982,542.808,"--Fair point, Justice Scalia."
2010.08-1448,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,551.619,589.585,"Why wouldn't you, if necessary, simply say that a video game that appeals to the prurient, shameful, or morbid interests of those 18 -- or under, but let's take 18 -- and it's not suitable in the community for those 18, and it has no redeeming importance of any kind, no serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for those 18, that at least as to those, you can't sell it without -- the parent can buy it but the child can't buy it."
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,601.175,602.769,"Justice Breyer, absolutely."
2010.08-1448,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,602.769,603.533,Okay.
2010.08-1448,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,603.533,611.36,"Mr. Morazzini, could I take you back to Justice Scalia's original question, which was what counts as deviant violence or morbid violence."
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,637.974,639.019,Okay.
2010.08-1448,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,655.903,659.729,So anything that has those kinds of violence counts?
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,659.729,663.321,"--No, and then we would move to the three prongs of the Miller standard, Your Honor."
2010.08-1448,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,664.526,670.461,"Well, so how do we separate violent games that are covered from violent games just as violent that are not covered?"
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,670.461,682.144,"--Well, Your Honor, I think a jury could be instructed with expert testimony, with video clips of game play, and to judge for themselves whether--"
2010.08-1448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,682.144,684.643,I'm not concerned about the jury judging.
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,705.478,707.085,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2010.08-1448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,707.085,715.91,"Does he convene his own jury and try it before -- you know, I really wouldn't know what to do as a manufacturer."
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,715.91,720.503,"--Justice Scalia, I am convinced that the video game industry will know what to do."
2010.08-1448,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,726.235,730.279,So is what is covered here the mature category in the ratings?
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,733.637,737.368,"I believe that some mature-rated games would be covered, but not all."
2010.08-1448,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,737.368,738.073,Some but not all.
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,738.073,738.775,But not all.
2010.08-1448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,747.705,750.895,Let me just make one comment on that point.
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,839.92,849.384,"--Justice Kennedy, as with sexual -- the regulation of sexual material and obscenity, we had to start somewhere."
2010.08-1448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,869.986,879.778,"What about excessive glorification of drinking, movies that have too much drinking?"
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,949.622,956.497,"Well, Justice Scalia, I would like to highlight the fact that the material at issue in Ginsberg was not obscene."
2010.08-1448,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,964.6,968.835,"Well, I think what Justice Scalia wants to know is what James Madison thought about video games."
2010.08-1448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,973.768,979.625,"No, I want to know what James Madison thought about violence."
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,992.856,1004.461,"--Your Honor, as to minors, I believe, looking at some of the historic statutes States had passed, had enacted in the past, there was a social recognition that there is a level of violent material--"
2010.08-1448,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1004.461,1005.101,What's the earliest statute?
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,1005.101,1006.161,--Pardon?
2010.08-1448,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1006.161,1009.566,What's the earliest statute and how much enforcement was--
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,1009.566,1014.639,"Your Honor, I don't know the earliest statute off the top of my head."
2010.08-1448,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1021.982,1035.458,"Well, on the principle, I mean, it's been quite some years, hasn't it, before this -- since this Court has held that one instance that courts -- that the country, legislatures, can regulate are fighting words?"
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,1038.426,1039.362,--Absolutely.
2010.08-1448,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1039.362,1041.093,Because they provoke violence.
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,1063.912,1081.781,"Well, Justice Breyer, I think, in going back to Justice Scalia's question, I find it hard to believe and I know of no historical evidence that suggests that our Founding Fathers in enacting the First Amendment intended to guarantee video game retailers a First Amendment right--"
2010.08-1448,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1081.781,1084.343,Can I go back to what Justice Breyer was asking?
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,1115.281,1117.656,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.08-1448,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1127.307,1146.532,"So could I just make -- make sure I understand that, Mr. Morazzini, because as I understand the State has given up its argument that the interest protected by this law is an interest in preventing minors who see these games from going out and committing violent acts themselves; that the State is not saying that that's the interest in the law; is that correct?"
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,1152.607,1161.132,"Justice Kagan, we welcome that as -- as an effect of California's regulation, but the primary interest was the internal intrinsic harm to minors."
2010.08-1448,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1165.086,1167.457,--Can I have a point of clarification?
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,1179.191,1183.203,Justice--
2010.08-1448,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1183.203,1184.716,There are two sections to the act.
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,1198.368,1199.787,"--Yes, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.08-1448,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1200.243,1203.039,And your brief has not addressed the labeling requirements at all.
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,1203.039,1209.365,"--Well, we didn't, Your Honor, because one holding of the Ninth Circuit hinged upon the other."
2010.08-1448,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1246.753,1256.798,"That's an interesting concession on your part, that the labeling doesn't have a need separate from the restriction on sale."
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,1275.103,1284.598,"--Justice Sotomayor, I certainly did not attempt or intend to concede that the Ninth Circuit's opinion was correct in any sense in this case."
2010.08-1448,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1284.598,1286.911,"Well, you have conceded it by not appealing it."
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,1294.141,1298.001,"At this point, I would agree, Your Honor."
2010.08-1448,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1298.001,1299.171,Does--
2010.08-1448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1299.171,1308.556,"I gather that -- that if -- if the parents of the minor want the kid to watch this violent stuff, they like gore, they may even like violent kids--"
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,1317.069,1322.333,"Your Honor, under Ginsberg they are entitled to direct the development and the upbringing of their children in the manner they see fit."
2010.08-1448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1322.333,1322.442,Yes.
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,1322.442,1329.516,It's important to the State of California that the parent -- that we ensure that the parent can involve themselves in this important decision.
2010.08-1448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1329.516,1336.216,"So that's basically all this is, is a -- a law to help parents, is that right?"
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,1336.216,1343.15,"It's one of the two fundamental interests that are served by this law, yes, ensuring that parents can involve themselves in the front end."
2010.08-1448,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1369.97,1373.608,Do you think there is any barrier in California to minors' access to sexual material?
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,1373.608,1380.697,"I believe California has a law, Penal Code Section 3.3.1."
2010.08-1448,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1380.697,1382.963,--California has a Ginsberg type law.
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,1382.963,1383.369,Yes.
2010.08-1448,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1383.369,1385.494,Does your office spend a lot of time enforcing that?
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,1385.494,1388.68,"I'm not aware, Justice Alito."
2010.08-1448,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1410.793,1420.23,Is there -- you've been asked questions about the vagueness of this and the problem for the seller to know what's good and what's bad.
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,1451.091,1453.232,"Not that I'm aware of, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.08-1448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1453.232,1455.775,You should consider creating such a one.
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,1464.475,1474.363,"Your Honor, we -- we ask juries to judge sexual material and its appropriateness for minors as well."
2010.08-1448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1478.157,1480.875,Do we let the government do that?
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,1496.446,1499.195,"--Justice Scalia, California's not doing that here."
2010.08-1448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1518.267,1519.453,I can see your white light is on.
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,1532.572,1540.257,"Your Honor, I believe you are referring to the parental controls that are available on some of the new machines?"
2010.08-1448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1540.257,1540.569,Yes.
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,1540.569,1553.753,"As we submitted in our briefing, a simple internet search for bypassing parental controls brings up video clips instructing minors and young adults how to b pass the parental controls."
2010.08-1448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1553.753,1555.391,V-Chips don't work?
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,1555.391,1558.64,"I believe the V-Chip is limited to television, Justice Kennedy."
2010.08-1448,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1561.545,1562.516,"Thank you, Mr. Morazzini."
2010.08-1448,0,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,1562.516,1563.031,Thank you.
2010.08-1448,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1563.031,1569.355,Mr. Smith.
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1569.355,1571.402,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1607.45,1617.663,What about the distinction between books and movies may be that in these video games the child is not sitting there passively watching something; the child is doing the killing.
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1626.363,1627.692,"Well, Your Honor, it might."
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1633.518,1637.453,What was the state of the record that was present before the Court in Ginsberg?
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1637.453,1649.416,"--The state of the record was that they were aware of science on both sides and made a judgment that as a matter of common sense they could decide that obscenity, even somewhat at-large obscenity--"
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1649.416,1652.558,So the Court acted on the basis of common sense?
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1652.558,1652.776,--Yes.
2010.08-1448,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1663.973,1664.756,But the material wasn't obscene.
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1678.778,1680.498,"Your Honor, that's certainly true."
2010.08-1448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1690.976,1728.104,"Talking about common sense, why isn't it common sense to say that if a parent wants his 13-year-old child to have a game where the child is going to sit there and imagine he is a torturer and impose gratuitous, painful, excruciating, torturing violence upon small children and women and do this for an hour or so, and there is no social or redeeming value, it's not artistic, it's not literary, et cetera, why isn't it common sense to say a State has the right to say, parent, if you want that for your 13-year-old, you go buy it yourself, which I think is what they are saying."
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1728.104,1731.929,"--Well, Your Honor, the State has to have some reason to think that parents--"
2010.08-1448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1731.929,1732.915,"It does, it does."
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1781.503,1783.254,--There is two aspects of harm.
2010.08-1448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1789.954,1790.157,Yes.
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1820.958,1821.722,"--Well, two aspects."
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1832.813,1838.838,"I don't want to interrupt your answer, but any 13-year-old can bypass parental controls in about 5 minutes."
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1838.838,1842.822,"That is one element of about five different elements, Your Honor."
2010.08-1448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1877.075,1878.729,How much do these videos cost?
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1878.729,1881.478,"They cost in the range of $50 or $60 when new, Your Honor."
2010.08-1448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1881.478,1887.148,"Not too many 13-year-olds walk in with a $50 bill, do they?"
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1887.148,1896.909,"It seems very likely that the people, if there are any out there buying games without parental permission -- which the State, by the way, has not even tried to show -- they are likely in the 16-year-old category."
2010.08-1448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1896.909,1898.816,You are away from the common sense.
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1934.457,1938.423,"Well, there is various aspects of this that I think it's important to understand."
2010.08-1448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1947.906,1953.51,You mean love is not something that people have tried to encourage children to understand and know about?
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1959.899,1961.989,--There is a huge difference.
2010.08-1448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1962.722,1962.956,--Thank you.
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1967.25,1972.187,--We do not -- the difference is we do not make films for children in which explicit sex happens.
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1974.998,1975.7,Graphic violence.
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2005.921,2009.841,And parents have been doing that since time immemorial.
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2021.477,2024.99,"Is it your position -- I know this is a facial challenge, Mr. Smith."
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2033.331,2037.718,My position is that most people would think that that's an inappropriate game for minors.
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2040.67,2043.59,"I know you don't, but what is -- you are avoiding the answer."
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2047.825,2048.293,--My position--
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2048.293,2048.745,A minor?
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2048.745,2053.21,--My position is that there is not a violence exception to the First Amendment for minors and there should not be.
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2053.21,2068.878,"So your position is that the First Amendment does not, cannot, no matter what type of law, whether this one is vague or not, that the State legislature cannot pass a law that says you may not sell to a 10-year-old a video in which they set schoolgirls on fire."
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2068.878,2077.703,"And the reason for that is there is no possible way, it's an insuperable problem, to use the English language to draw an exception to the Constitution, to the First Amendment, that would--"
2010.08-1448,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2077.703,2089.277,What if the State passed a -- what if California took the list of video games that your association rates as mature and said there's a civil penalty.
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2093.415,2096.117,"--Exercising our First Amendment rights, we have decided--"
2010.08-1448,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2096.117,2096.694,You don't want that.
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2099.865,2110.766,"--What that would do is transform the ESRB, the private voluntary system that exists, into the censorship commission that this Court struck down in Interstate Circuit."
2010.08-1448,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2124.903,2136.539,"You seem to argue that there really is no good reason to think that exposure to video games is bad for minors, exposure to really violent video games is bad to minors; is that right?"
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2136.539,2142.505,I think it's important to draw a distinction between harm that could be cognizable under the law and appropriateness.
2010.08-1448,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2149.112,2157.42,"Well, Mr. Smith, is there any showing that the States could make that would satisfy you, that would say yes, that's a sufficient showing for this law to go forward?"
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2161.777,2162.416,"No, they don't."
2010.08-1448,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2162.416,2165.244,But are there studies that would be enough?
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2165.244,2171.475,"Well, I guess I can imagine a world in which expression could transform 75 percent of the people who experience it into murderers."
2010.08-1448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2194.965,2198.888,You really don't want to argue the case on that ground.
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2209.179,2222.597,"Your Honor, my main ground today is exactly that, that this Court said last year in United States v. Stevens it doesn't have a freewheeling authority to create new exceptions to the First Amendment after 200 years based on a cost-benefit analysis, and this is a test of that."
2010.08-1448,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2225.892,2234.498,But we have here a new -- a new medium that cannot possibly have been envisioned at the time when the First Amendment was ratified.
2010.08-1448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2256.41,2257.459,--And doing it.
2010.08-1448,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2257.459,2260.941,--and doing it is still a third thing.
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2283.979,2294.411,"We do have a new medium here, Your Honor, but we have a history in this country of new mediums coming along and people vastly overreacting to them, thinking the sky is falling, our children are all going to be turned into criminals."
2010.08-1448,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2319.917,2324.476,"Mr. Smith, do you think all video games are speech in the first instance?"
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2340.753,2345.514,"The games that we are talking about have narrative, events that are occurring, characters, and plot."
2010.08-1448,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2360.742,2365.519,So are we going to separate video games into narrative video games and non-narrative video games?
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2365.519,2368.47,"--You don't have to, as long as the law is limited to regulating narrative."
2010.08-1448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2380.731,2398.93,"Well, what about a law that says you can't sell to minors a video game -- it doesn't care what the plot is, but no video game in which the minor commits violent acts of maiming, killing, setting people on fire?"
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2401.426,2402.942,"Well, of course, Your Honor."
2010.08-1448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2404.331,2405.192,It's not speech.
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2411.72,2411.876,--I'm sorry?
2010.08-1448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2411.876,2425.572,"What the law would be directed at is not the plot, not the video game itself, but the child's act of committing murder, maiming, and so forth."
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2425.572,2433.132,"Well, the events in a video game -- what happens in the plot is a combination of what the game gives you and what the player adds to it."
2010.08-1448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2443.661,2445.361,The child is speaking to the game?
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2445.361,2445.923,--No.
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2463.057,2467.055,"Mr. Smith, your challenge is a facial challenge?"
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2467.055,2467.899,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2467.899,2479.037,"So that under -- whether you use the Salerno test or the Glucksberg test, if there is either one or any applications that would satisfy the Constitution, the facial challenge fails."
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2479.458,2483.861,Very clear under the law of this Court that those tests don't apply in a First Amendment context if the--
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2483.861,2501.151,"I thought we referenced them last year in the Stevens case, and the only reason we didn't have to decide which applies is because we adopted an approach that looked at overbreadth and said this statute is overbroad, and specifically didn't decide whether it could be applied in that case to crush videos."
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2501.151,2514.865,"--That's correct, Your Honor, but I think it's -- there is no argument here, I don't think, that if you can find one game out there to which this can constitutionally be applied, even though it would also be unconstitutionally applied with the vast amount of other cases--"
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2514.865,2535.56,"Well, I understood -- the tenor of much of the questioning, I think, is that there may be games and may be minors -- maybe a less violent game sold to a 17-year-old, perhaps that violates the First Amendment, but something like Postal 2 sold to a 10-year-old might well -- might well not violate the First Amendment to apply this law to that."
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2535.56,2535.95,"--Well, that may be--"
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2535.95,2551.037,"And the way we approached the issue in Stevens, where we had hunting videos and crush videos, would say that it's too broad to apply the law to everything, so we strike it down, it's overbroad, but leave open the possibility that a more narrowly-drawn statute might pass muster."
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2553.724,2555.097,--You certainly could do that.
2010.08-1448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2570.824,2571.557,It's not susceptible.
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2671.408,2677.249,"Your Honor, they do not suggest that there is any existing exception to the First Amendment that would apply to--"
2010.08-1448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2677.249,2678.906,This is not an exception.
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2685.465,2689.684,"--Well, they make a feint at trying to argue--"
2010.08-1448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2689.684,2693.759,"Let's -- to get you to focus on it, I'll say I've made the argument."
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2693.759,2694.181,"--There you go, okay."
2010.08-1448,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2733.886,2735.867,But they have plenty of evidence that--
2010.08-1448,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2735.867,2739.1,Why couldn't you make the same arguments with respect to the obscenity statutes?
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2739.1,2742.458,"--Well, Your Honor, because obscenity doesn't have strict scrutiny applied to it."
2010.08-1448,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2744.941,2749.847,Why shouldn't violence be treated the same as obscenity?
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2749.847,2753.422,"--Well, because first of all we don't have the same history of it."
2010.08-1448,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2784.115,2789.47,"Well, the Court -- the Court struggled for many, many years and to some extent is still struggling with obscenity."
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2800.809,2810.667,"--And if you take the Miller standards and you take two thing out of it, you take out of it explicit sex and nudity, and you take out an appeal to prurient interest, what do you have left?"
2010.08-1448,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2834.781,2837.183,You can make all those arguments with reference to obscenity.
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2837.183,2845.525,"--Except that you know -- we know, we all know at least with respect to Ginsberg -- adult obscenity I would acknowledge is a very difficult line."
2010.08-1448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2860.725,2867.129,And you started Ginsberg with something that is prescribable even with regard to adults.
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2867.129,2868.283,"Correct, Your Honor."
2010.08-1448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2868.283,2875.154,"You know that there is such a thing as -- as obscenity, which can be proscribed even -- even as to adults."
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2884.196,2886.801,Let me -- I think a little history is in order here.
2010.08-1448,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2908.452,2910.433,Let me be clear about exactly what your argument is.
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2927.8,2928.643,My position is--
2010.08-1448,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2928.643,2929.504,--Is it or isn't it?
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2929.504,2940.532,"--My position is that strict scrutiny applies, and that given the facts in the record, given the fact that the -- the problem is already well controlled, the parents are empowered, and there are great and less alternatives out there--"
2010.08-1448,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2940.532,2941.749,--So when you say--
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2941.749,2943.485,--There isn't any basis to say scrutiny is satisfied.
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2943.485,2949.498,"So just to be clear, your answer to Justice Alito is at this point there is nothing the State can do?"
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2949.498,2953.37,Because there is no problem it needs to solve that would justify--
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2953.37,2954.041,Could I just have a simple answer?
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2954.041,2954.696,"--The answer is yes, Your Honor."
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2954.696,2956.385,There is nothing the State can do.
2010.08-1448,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2956.385,2957.508,"--Mr. Smith, how can you say that?"
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2973.266,2974.08,I just--
2010.08-1448,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2974.08,2981.918,"And there is proof that some parents, as well intentioned as they may or may not be, have not been able to supervise that."
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2998.086,3005.752,"--The -- the existing solutions are perfectly capable of allowing this problem to be addressed, assuming it is a problem."
2010.08-1448,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3006.096,3008.611,But it's still about 20 percent of sales are going to kids.
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3008.611,3012.69,--That's when they send in somebody who's 16 to test the system.
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3027.071,3037.709,Could you have a law that says the State has to put -- the dealers have to put the violent video games in a particular area of the video store?
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3043.488,3051.626,"Well, if what you are saying is you are going to have a limit on the ability of minors to buy them because of walled off, and minors are not allowed to go pick them off the shelf--"
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3051.626,3051.813,Yes.
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3051.813,3054.608,"--then I don't know how that differs from the current law, Your Honor, assuming you could figure out--"
2010.08-1448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3054.608,3065.29,"Your answer -- your answer to the first question of Justice Alito and the Chief Justice was yes, isn't that -- that you are saying that there is nothing they can do?"
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3068.023,3069.131,--Yes.
2010.08-1448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3070.114,3070.317,I am right.
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3072.005,3078.283,"So they can't say, example, all the -- all the highest rated videos have to be on the top shelf out of the reach of children."
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3079.157,3081.454,I would think that that's probably not--
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3081.454,3082.905,"That's what they do with cigarettes or something, isn't it?"
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3082.905,3085.045,"--Except that cigarettes are not speech, Your Honor."
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3086.952,3088.811,"I know that cigarettes are not speech, Mr. Smith."
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3100.51,3102.335,"Well, truly the record doesn't support it."
2010.08-1448,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3110.458,3116.924,"But on that -- on that score, Mr. Smith, there is a study by the FCC."
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3159.612,3177.993,"What they did was they spent several years trying to come up with a definition that would allow anybody to figure out which violent TV shows have to be put into this violent adult category and which don't, and they eventually punted and said, we have no idea to do that; Congress asked us to do it; we cannot do it; and they punted it back to Congress to try to come up with a definition."
2010.08-1448,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3200.826,3232.719,"And you say there is no problem because 16-year-olds in California never have $50 available to go buy a video game, and because they never have TVs in their room and their parents are always home watching what they -- they do with their video games, and the parents -- and the video games have features that allow parents to block access to -- to block the playing of violent video games, which can't be overcome by a computer-savvy California 16-year-old, that's why there is no problem, right?"
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3232.719,3249.917,"I guess if what we are really going to do is judge the constitution of this law based on what 16 and 17-year-olds are getting and whether that would be harmful to them, I think the problem there is the line between 16 and 17 and 18 is so fine, that you are not going to be able to identify any real category of games that fits into that category."
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3268.517,3271.485,"We draw that kind of line of course in the death penalty area, don't we?"
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3277.513,3278.92,"You do draw that line, Your Honor."
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3278.92,3280.527,And we do it for drinking; we do it for driving.
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3280.527,3291.446,"But here you were assessing works of expression, deciding to decide what age they -- they would correspond to, and I don't think you can cut it that finely and say well, this is an 18 game; this is only a 17 game."
2010.08-1448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3302.91,3304.568,"Stick to the X things, maybe."
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3311.033,3311.844,"--Well, first of all--"
2010.08-1448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3311.844,3316.906,"And if as you experimented with other things, as they did in the obscenity area, you could discover you could limit it to that."
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3316.906,3318.762,"--I think the maybe is telling, though, Your Honor."
2010.08-1448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3330.57,3334.648,"Well, you have your rule, so why wouldn't the first step be they would follow your rules?"
2010.08-1448,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3344.003,3345.707,--Our rules wouldn't help you at all.
2010.08-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3370.976,3372.259,"Thank you, Mr. Smith."
2010.08-1448,2,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,3375.413,3377.441,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.08-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3416.693,3417.13,Excuse me.
2010.08-1448,2,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,3424.657,3427.391,"--That would be one factor to be considered, Justice Scalia."
2010.08-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3427.391,3428.861,Well--
2010.08-1448,2,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,3428.861,3429.844,The nature of a plot.
2010.08-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3429.844,3432.094,"--One factor to be considered, sure."
2010.08-1448,2,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,3436.621,3438.2,"No, Your Honor."
2010.08-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3450.195,3459.269,"You can't have artistic videos that involve maiming and cutting off heads and eviscerating people, right, so long as its artistic it's okay."
2010.08-1448,2,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,3459.269,3469.969,"If the level of the violence just as an obscenity, if the level of violence causes the game as a whole to lack the artistic, it is a balance, Your Honor, just as it is with sexual material."
2010.08-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3472.453,3474.653,"Artistic for whom, for a 5-year-old?"
2010.08-1448,2,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,3479.293,3481.477,"--Again, minors as a class."
2010.08-1448,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3483.056,3487.194,You think Mortal Combat is prohibited by this statute?
2010.08-1448,2,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,3487.194,3496.084,"I believe it's a candidate, Your Honor, but I haven't played the game and been exposed to it sufficiently to judge for myself."
2010.08-1448,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3496.084,3509.186,"It's a candidate, meaning, yes, a reasonable jury could find that Mortal Combat, which is an iconic game, which I am sure half of the clerks who work for us spend considerable amounts of time in their adolescence playing."
2010.08-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3509.186,3512.903,I don't know what she's talking about.
2010.08-1448,2,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,3512.903,3521.244,"Justice Kagan, by candidate, I meant that the video game industry should look at it, should take a long look at it."
2010.08-1448,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3537.907,3545.982,"Would a video game that portrayed a Vulcan as opposed to a human being, being maimed and tortured, would that be covered by the act?"
2010.08-1448,2,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,3545.982,3552.994,"--No, it wouldn't, Your Honor, because the act is only directed towards the range of options that are able to be inflicted on a human being."
2010.08-1448,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3552.994,3569.739,"So if the video producer says this is not a human being, it's an android computer simulated person, then all they have to do is put a little artificial feature on the creature and they could sell the video game?"
2010.08-1448,2,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,3569.739,3581.795,"Under the act, yes, because California's concern, I think this is one of the reasons that sex and violence are so similar, these are base physical acts we are talking about, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.08-1448,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3591.134,3601.274,"So what happens when the character gets maimed, head chopped off and immediately after it happens they spring back to life and they continue their battle."
2010.08-1448,2,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,3608.067,3609.128,I would think so.
2010.08-1448,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3613.363,3617.422,Isn't that feedback to Justice Scalia's question?
2010.08-1448,2,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,3617.422,3620.451,"Your Honor, this is a facial challenge."
2010.08-1448,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3627.385,3630.555,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.08-1448,2,46705,zackery_p_morazzini,,3630.555,3631.744,Thank you.
2010.08-1448,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3631.744,3633.054,The case is submitted.
