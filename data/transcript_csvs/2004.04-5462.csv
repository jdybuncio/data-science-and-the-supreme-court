2004.04-5462,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,4.949,We will now hear argument in Rompilla against Beard.
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,6.346,9.295,"Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-5462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,76.239,80.595,"Well, you're asking us, I suppose, to make a rule that you have to get paper records."
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,102.719,111.582,We are not asking the Court to set a constitutional rule that a capital defense counsel must obtain records in every capital case.
2004.04-5462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,120.676,127.39,"Well, you had three forensic experts, outside experts, and they didn't seem to think the papers were relevant either."
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,127.39,128.136,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-5462,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,174.19,180.712,"Well, counsel... counsel did make use of several relatives of the defendant who testified."
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,183.863,184.604,"Yes, Your Honor, including his son."
2004.04-5462,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,184.604,188.742,And he talked to all of them and talked to the defendant as well.
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,200.118,209.91,This Court made very clear in Strickland and Williams and in Wiggins that an assessment of counsel's representation must be done from counsel's perspective at the time.
2004.04-5462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,229.279,233.268,That... that seems to me an... an extraordinary non sequitur.
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,239.994,241.855,"--That... that's what she testified to, Your Honor."
2004.04-5462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,242.517,244.34,What she testified to makes no sense.
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,244.34,251.327,"--She gave a second reason which was that counsel, when they pursued life history mitigation, the family would respond, we hardly know him."
2004.04-5462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,257.305,270.74,"Well, the... the portions of his life history that... that are the most appealing are the portions from his youth, before he went into the... into the juvenile institutions, and they were certainly with him during that period."
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,270.74,283.417,"And third and most significantly, Justice Scalia, she testified that they were not willing to provide life history mitigating... facts about his life history because of, quote, whatever else was going on with them, unquote."
2004.04-5462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,304.702,306.787,Let me... let me take you back to the... to the experts.
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,357.533,364.316,"Sure, because counsel themselves testified to that at the post-conviction hearing and the experts themselves said... now, let me--"
2004.04-5462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,364.316,365.02,Mr. Nolas?
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,365.02,365.612,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-5462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,365.612,374.475,Wasn't it the case that those experts were hired not primarily or even secondarily for mitigation purposes?
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,420.811,427.749,"Yes, Your Honor, and the... the respondents use the word mitigation that Ms. Dantos used in her testimony."
2004.04-5462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,450.581,462.228,Was there any indication that after the guilt phase was over and before the sentencing phase began... I take it it was just a matter of hours or almost days till the sentencing... till the sentencing phase began.
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,469.662,470.1,"No, Your Honor."
2004.04-5462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,508.329,513.164,I thought what you just quoted said that they... that they would intend it to be used in the mitigating phase.
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,513.164,524.515,"--Mental infirmity at the time of the offense at the penalty phase, not life history mitigation, not how did he do in school, was there abuse in the home, was there neglect in the home, was their mistreatment in the--"
2004.04-5462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,524.515,527.464,Doesn't... doesn't all that bear upon mental infirmity at the time of the offense?
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,539.144,539.81,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.04-5462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,543.068,547.857,--We... we just let him off because we're... we're sympathetic to his present state?
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,554.508,556.806,"--It's... it's not let him off, Your Honor."
2004.04-5462,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,591.184,601.297,"Mr. Nolas, you haven't mentioned it, but didn't one of the three experts suggest that there be a... a follow-up inquiry into the... the abuse of alcohol by the defendant?"
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,601.297,605.707,"Dr. Gross suggested that there be a follow-up inquiry into... into alcohol, and that--"
2004.04-5462,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,605.707,608.709,My understanding is that nothing was done in response to that.
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,609.546,615.55,"--In response to that, the reasonable thing would be why did this man's parole records indicate that he should abstain from alcohol."
2004.04-5462,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,620.046,621.16,Which... which you're saying they did not do.
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,622.408,626.702,--They testified that what they did they asked... they asked the other experts to look into it.
2004.04-5462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,649.266,655.606,"Mr. Nolas, there were some records that the prosecution sought and used."
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,659.164,667.435,"Yes, Your Honor, and that was, I guess, the simplest way to respond to Justice Kennedy's original question, which is what is the duty that these lawyers have."
2004.04-5462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,695.429,696.507,What did the prosecution use?
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,700.165,705.364,--And the transcript that's included of... in that trial of the prior offense victim's testimony.
2004.04-5462,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,715.14,716.511,--And what would they have found?
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,716.511,727.993,"They would have found achievement test scores in that prior conviction case file indicating that Mr. Rompilla had never progressed beyond the third grade, indicating that he functions below 96 percent of the population."
2004.04-5462,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,764.099,773.699,"Mr. Nolas, are you telling us that all that information would have... was in the file that described the... the criminal history that the prosecutor used in his case?"
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,773.699,774.434,"--Yes, Justice Stevens."
2004.04-5462,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,774.434,775.639,And they didn't even look at that file?
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,775.639,777.361,"Yes, Justice Stevens, what I just read to you."
2004.04-5462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,779.11,784.479,Is this the document that's on the lodging at page 31-34?
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,784.479,788.483,--If I may have Your Honor's indulgence for a moment.
2004.04-5462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,820.185,829.161,You... you want us to adopt a constitutional rule that at least in Pennsylvania counsel have to consult these... these records--
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,829.161,830.046,--When--
2004.04-5462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,830.046,831.282,--as a constitutional matter.
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,831.282,843.761,"--Justice Scalia, when State law tells you that what you're going to find in juvenile and adult records is exactly what the ABA standards say capital lawyers should pursue, it's not diligent to ignore the--"
2004.04-5462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,843.761,844.882,So your... your answer is yes.
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,844.882,846.06,--Yes--
2004.04-5462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,846.06,850.289,You want a constitutional rule that in Pennsylvania counsel must look into these records.
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,850.289,851.072,"--Yes, plus."
2004.04-5462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,851.072,877.06,"What about a rule that says you must consult the file of the case that's being used by the prosecutor to produce seriously aggravating circumstance, at least where that file is readily available, and you must follow up indications in that file that suggest a significant mitigating defense?"
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,877.06,877.93,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-5462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,877.93,878.538,All right.
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,878.538,879.316,And--
2004.04-5462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,879.316,884.307,And that's nothing special to Pennsylvania if you know that the prosecutor is going to use a certain file.
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,884.307,890.018,--The... the only that's special to Pennsylvania is what Pennsylvania law tells you you're going to find in those files.
2004.04-5462,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,895.101,895.698,What... what--
2004.04-5462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,895.698,898.006,For what purpose did the prosecution use the files?
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,898.006,904.438,The prosecution told counsel I'm going to use these files as part of my case and eventually use them for aggravation purposes.
2004.04-5462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,904.438,906.63,Use them for... he did use them for aggravation.
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,906.63,907.121,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-5462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,907.121,908.486,In... in what respect?
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,908.486,918.956,"He put on... he... he had an assistant district attorney take the stand and read the transcript of the victim's testimony in the prior case, which was included in that folder."
2004.04-5462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,957.271,964.027,"I... I don't like to either direct your own argument or the questions from my colleagues, but the Simmons issue here--"
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,964.027,964.145,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-5462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,964.145,965.953,--it seems to me is important and--
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,965.953,967.446,"Yes, Your Honor, I will turn to that."
2004.04-5462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1010.949,1011.332,Wiggins.
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,1011.332,1011.95,--In Wiggins.
2004.04-5462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1012.447,1013.05,Wiggins.
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,1013.05,1025.214,"Because they relied upon what they themselves knew was a remarkably set of sources, a family and a client who were not willing to discuss the information when they knew records were available that would have discussed the life history."
2004.04-5462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1039.487,1051.15,"--If there had been no questions from the jury, it seems to me that you wouldn't have had an argument at all because the counsel was allowed... the counsel was allowed to argue this to the jury and did argue it to the jury."
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,1051.15,1054.755,"--The... the questions are very significant, Your Honor."
2004.04-5462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1057.117,1062.215,"Would you... would you agree that but for the questions from the jury, Simmons was complied with?"
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,1065.703,1066.338,--The--
2004.04-5462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1066.338,1068.242,--without being... without being contradicted.
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,1068.242,1075.217,"--Justice Kennedy, the caveat is that the court instructed the jury that the arguments of counsel are not evidence and that the law would come from the court."
2004.04-5462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1089.659,1089.782,No.
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,1102.88,1115.046,"--The constitutional obligation under Simmons itself would be to say is there something here or in... in the words of Justice O'Connor, did the State put future dangerousness in issue."
2004.04-5462,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1116.453,1118.198,"Well, it didn't expressly."
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,1153.36,1164.485,"--And that may be... that would have been the case, Your Honor, had the Pennsylvania Supreme Court not adopted the very interpretation of Your Honor's concurrence in Simmons that Kelly adopted."
2004.04-5462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1196.565,1200.197,And what's the best argument you have that future dangerousness was an issue?
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,1200.197,1203.647,"There are several factors in that regard, Your Honor."
2004.04-5462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1218.836,1224.664,"Well, of course, that also bears on the... on the fact of his depravity, that he was just... he just didn't learn."
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,1224.664,1226.089,--He... he sent the--
2004.04-5462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1226.089,1229.565,I don't know if that's necessarily future dangerousness or... it's equally blameworthiness.
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,1229.565,1236.163,"--Justice Kennedy, he sent the clear signal to the jury that this is a violent, frightening man, and then he tied it all together with this comment."
2004.04-5462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1248.216,1248.349,"Well, that goes to his blameworthiness."
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,1260.343,1271.234,I would submit to the Court that that argument indicates to a reasonable jury future dangerousness as much as the argument in Simmons itself--
2004.04-5462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1271.234,1278.221,"Can you imagine any capital case, if we accept that argument, in which future dangerousness is not at issue?"
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,1297.49,1297.958,--And... and--
2004.04-5462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1297.958,1299.451,And that seems to be not what we've said.
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,1299.451,1302.25,"--And, Justice Scalia, that's not, however, the issue before the Court."
2004.04-5462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1309.333,1309.999,But... but that--
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,1309.999,1310.116,I--
2004.04-5462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1310.116,1315.114,--that goes... I... I would make that argument to show how... how horrible this crime was.
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,1332.153,1343.629,"--And... and this is in the context of a prosecutor who elicited that Mr. Rompilla had been paroled 3 and a half months before the offense, that his niece and nephew were scared of him, that he could not rehabilitate yourself."
2004.04-5462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1364.227,1377.799,"And... and you... you expect us in all future cases to read the prosecution's argument and... and say, well, has it gone over the line from just his depravity into he's future... you know, he's going to be dangerous in the future?"
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,1377.799,1378.307,--But--
2004.04-5462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1378.307,1381.384,I think that puts too much of a burden on... on the Federal courts.
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,1381.384,1384.712,"--But, Justice Scalia, it's not just the depravity argument."
2004.04-5462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1427.533,1434.764,"This... this prosecutor also said, before he got into isn't it frightening, I'm not asking you for vengeance."
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,1447.191,1450.759,--Future dangerousness is... is what we would submit to the Court.
2004.04-5462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1450.759,1451.334,How about justice?
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,1459.696,1466.539,When you tell a jury that a person is a violent recidivist who learns the lesson... he's a recidivist.
2004.04-5462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1503.647,1513.689,"I thought that there was no problem in any State but Pennsylvania because now all of them... when the jury wants to know does life mean life, the judge says yes."
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,1513.689,1515.588,"--In all of them except Pennsylvania, Your Honor."
2004.04-5462,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1564.569,1564.776,"Yes, you may reserve your time."
2004.04-5462,0,17914,billy_h_nolas,,1564.776,1565.502,"Your Honor, thank you."
2004.04-5462,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1565.502,1570.579,Ms. Zapp.
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,1570.579,1574.227,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"

2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,1646.7,1655.063,"Well, I think Simmons could be understood... and in fact did establish a bright line rule that the prosecutor had to actually argue it had to invite the--"
2004.04-5462,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1655.063,1655.142,No.
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,1661.888,1665.013,--I think he had to use words that communicated that.
2004.04-5462,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1670.011,1670.512,Well--
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,1670.512,1671.951,--using different... different words.
2004.04-5462,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1671.951,1710.016,"--if we... if we don't adopt that kind of explicit words criterion, do you deny that the... that the argument that the prosecutor made, particularly the... by... by introducing the... the evidence of... of the prior crime for purposes of the aggravating factor and the argument that he made about how the defendant had learned from his prior crime... do you... do you deny that... that those were in fact, not with the talismanic words, but that those in fact were... were arguments that suggested future dangerousness?"
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,1710.016,1710.757,"I do, Your Honor."
2004.04-5462,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1729.896,1735.576,But I... I don't see how the... I... I guess my... my point is I don't see how you can avoid it.
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,1778.802,1794.622,"Well, I think this Court has said that you can draw that line because... and you have to draw that line because in this situation... because in every situation, every capital situation, the evidence that necessarily has to be discussed as part of sentencing can be--"
2004.04-5462,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1794.622,1795.865,"No, but this is... this is a special case."
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,1833.465,1848.574,"--I... I don't think so in the specific context of this case, Your Honor, and that's again because the evidence in this situation really did not show a continuing sequence of... of conduct and only talked about two episodes."
2004.04-5462,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1867.23,1867.23,What--
2004.04-5462,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1867.23,1870.045,"Ms. Zapp, I guess... I guess I'm confused about your case."
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,1889.939,1892.387,"We are, Your Honor, and... and--"
2004.04-5462,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1892.387,1894.488,So you're not... you're not making the argument.
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,1894.488,1896.216,--We are not making the argument.
2004.04-5462,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1896.216,1900.189,But you're saying the argument could have been made at... at the time of this trial--
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,1900.189,1900.69,Yes.
2004.04-5462,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1900.69,1902.317,--and before our later jurisprudence.
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,1902.317,1903.485,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-5462,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1903.485,1907.554,--And why would that argument have been reasonable?
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,1907.554,1908.999,Because--
2004.04-5462,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1908.999,1924.193,"In other words, why... why would we... why would it be reasonable to assume that this Court had... had established a constitutional rule going to jury instruction that rested on a kind of talismanic criterion?"
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,1924.193,1941.201,"--Well, because the concurring opinion, which provides the... this precise holding, identified that specific conduct as triggering and could be understood at the time to require that specific conduct to trigger an instruction in these circumstances."
2004.04-5462,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1941.201,1946.309,What... what specific words in... in the concurring opinion gets to the talismanic point?
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,1946.309,1967.296,"The specific words were the... the Court's instruction that an... about a charge on all ineligibility had to be supplied, and I'm going to quote from the Court's opinion where... where the prosecution argues that the defendant will pose a threat to... to society in the future."
2004.04-5462,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1991.658,2002.325,"And... and you're... you're depending on the word, in effect, argue as... as requiring... or as... as being a basis to say the argument has got to use talismanic words."
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2002.325,2005.802,Not... not that... not that it has to use talismanic--
2004.04-5462,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2005.802,2006.505,You're saying it has to be argued.
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2006.505,2010.249,"--Exactly, that has to be argument as opposed to some other form of communication--"
2004.04-5462,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2010.249,2014.836,"Not... not just intimated, not just suggested, but the jury... you have to argue that this person--"
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2014.836,2015.609,--But by--
2004.04-5462,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2015.609,2016.42,--is dangerous in the future.
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2016.42,2017.386,--But by contrast--
2004.04-5462,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2017.386,2019.135,That's a reasonable interpretation of it I would think.
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2019.135,2019.61,--Exactly.
2004.04-5462,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2019.61,2038.751,"And on that interpretation, why wasn't it an argument within the meaning of... of your point, when the prosecutor here got up and said, isn't it frightening, he has, in effect, learned from his past experience, now he knows enough to kill the witnesses?"
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2038.751,2040.404,"Well, first of all, Your Honor--"
2004.04-5462,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2040.404,2043.966,Wasn't that an argument which... which goes to future dangerousness?
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2043.966,2047.209,"--Well, first of all, Your Honor, he did not make that argument."
2004.04-5462,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2065.784,2070.726,"Ah, but what immediately follows... first he said it's absolutely frightening twice."
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2087.058,2103.559,"--But... but again, Justice Ginsburg, that goes to the idea that the defendant has ratcheted up his crime, that instead of taking the opportunity to reform his life, he's gone further and that makes this crime worse and... and more worthy of harsher treatment from a punishing standpoint."
2004.04-5462,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2120.941,2124.065,"I... I know you want to get to the other issue in this case, but let me ask you."
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2151.596,2159.159,"Well, Your Honor, I'm not sure of the practice in other States, but I can tell you that in Pennsylvania... and this is a point I need to correct from my opponent's argument."
2004.04-5462,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2236.482,2238.764,And that explains why your State is the only holdout.
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2238.764,2240.603,"Well, I'm sorry."
2004.04-5462,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2294.896,2306.095,May I ask you a question about the competence of counsel issue?
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2340.962,2345.101,"Not in this circumstance, Justice Stevens, and... and for this reason."
2004.04-5462,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2400.211,2401.703,"Well, maybe they... assume that's all true."
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2402.839,2402.968,--Right.
2004.04-5462,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2402.968,2403.97,--they needed to know.
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2414.466,2431.239,"Well, they knew from interviewing their client what his criminal history was, and at that... this point, they had every reason to believe they possessed a fair and accurate assessment of his background, and the decision not to... to go... to... to take a look at this was... was reasonable under the circumstances."
2004.04-5462,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2437.463,2457.009,"They thought they had... it was reasonable when they, on their own, suspected that this man might not even be competent at the moment to stand trial, that he... that they might have a... a basis for an insanity plea, that it was reasonable for them to rely just on what he told them without looking at the record that was in the prosecutor's hands?"
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2457.009,2459.024,"Oh, no, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.04-5462,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2485.771,2486.225,I understand that.
2004.04-5462,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2489.729,2492.385,Could... could I find out what she said came late?
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2493.532,2494.257,--The... the--
2004.04-5462,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2494.257,2495.366,--it came... what came relatively late?
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2495.366,2495.483,--The... I'm sorry.
2004.04-5462,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2499.115,2500.406,Came up late.
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2500.406,2502.944,Comparatively late over the course of this case.
2004.04-5462,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2512.021,2526.623,"My question is this, that I take it on page L31 is the record that existed in this horrendous rape '74 case with Jo, whatever, the woman, the bartender."
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2535.758,2540.516,This is the record that did exist.
2004.04-5462,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2540.516,2540.889,Yes.
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2547.764,2549.679,I believe--
2004.04-5462,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2549.679,2561.699,I'm... I'm back with Justice Stevens then and I wonder how it's possible a lawyer wouldn't look at the record in that very case if only to see if the prosecutor is characterizing the situation accurately.
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2667.976,2672.973,"--Well, Your... Your Honor, in response to that, I would say this."
2004.04-5462,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2686.545,2689.756,This sounds to me like a constitutional argument for serendipity.
2004.04-5462,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2700.971,2702.507,Do you agree with that?
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2702.507,2704.294,"Well, I think there is--"
2004.04-5462,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2704.294,2704.71,No.
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2706.155,2707.867,"--Well, I think there's... there is an element."
2004.04-5462,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2707.867,2709.92,You either agree with Justice Kennedy or not.
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2709.92,2712.532,I can agree with... I do agree with it in part.
2004.04-5462,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2712.532,2712.65,You do agree.
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2713.652,2718.979,I... I do agree that there is... that there is certainly that involved in... in this.
2004.04-5462,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2718.979,2740.947,"--I mean, my question, obviously, is, is not the reason that you want to examine the criminal record in the case that is being used horrendously against your client is to find out both as to what happened at the time and also the background that would be relevant in respect to your client?"
2004.04-5462,1,17308,amy_zapp,,2744.91,2751.171,"But... but, Justice Breyer, yes, certainly looking at a record would serve those purposes."
2004.04-5462,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2771.604,2777.096,"Thank you, Ms. Zapp."
2004.04-5462,2,42961,traci_l_lovitt,,2777.811,2781.187,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-5462,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2836.168,2841.602,But a rap sheet and so forth will not have normally what this person is like.
2004.04-5462,2,42961,traci_l_lovitt,,2849.874,2850.594,I... I think--
2004.04-5462,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2850.594,2879.921,And... and so I... don't you think it's a reasonable... or do you think it's a reasonable constitutional requirement to say that where cases of prior history of the client are being used by the prosecution to say what a terrible person he is... and he may be... that you... the... the lawyer in a capital case at least should look at the court records in that case to learn something about what this human being is like and why?
2004.04-5462,2,42961,traci_l_lovitt,,2884.257,2887.164,--I think there are two answers to that question.
2004.04-5462,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2916.779,2923.371,"Experts that were hired primarily to say what is his present mental condition, not what happened in the past."
2004.04-5462,2,42961,traci_l_lovitt,,2923.371,2939.194,"--No, Justice Ginsburg, and I'm glad you brought this up because I'd like to point the Court to JA1069 and 1079 which is where Dr. Cooke testifies, as Justice Scalia anticipated, that he was, in fact, asked to... asked to look at the mitigation evidence, and he did look at mitigation evidence."
2004.04-5462,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2941.519,2945.017,What was the primary reason that those experts were engaged?
2004.04-5462,2,42961,traci_l_lovitt,,2945.017,2945.369,--Dr.--
2004.04-5462,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2945.369,2946.275,The primary reason.
2004.04-5462,2,42961,traci_l_lovitt,,2946.275,2947.827,--Dr. Cooke's and... Drs.
2004.04-5462,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2953.858,2954.47,Where... where is this?
2004.04-5462,2,42961,traci_l_lovitt,,2954.47,2960.001,"--First, Dr. Cooke is at JA1079 and 1069."
2004.04-5462,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2964.743,2977.457,I thought it was not contested that in fact the primary reason why these doctors were engaged was that the defense attorney wanted to see if there was a basis for a plea of insanity.
2004.04-5462,2,42961,traci_l_lovitt,,2982.086,2985.03,That is... that is definitely contested with respect to Drs.
2004.04-5462,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3000.972,3009.184,And Dr. Gross is the one who... who in his report suggested a follow-up on alcoholism I think.
2004.04-5462,2,42961,traci_l_lovitt,,3009.184,3010.208,Yes.
2004.04-5462,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3010.208,3020.81,"And one way, at least a kind of a threshold step to follow up on alcoholism, would have been to look at the... the personal history report in the file of the prior case."
2004.04-5462,2,42961,traci_l_lovitt,,3046.927,3052.595,"No, because counsel looked... followed up in an objectively reasonable place."
2004.04-5462,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3059.374,3061.171,The... the two other psychiatrists or psychologists?
2004.04-5462,2,42961,traci_l_lovitt,,3061.171,3061.588,--The two... the two other psychiatrists.
2004.04-5462,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3063.337,3065.667,"Wel, were they... were they hired to... to look into alcoholism?"
2004.04-5462,2,42961,traci_l_lovitt,,3065.667,3066.083,No.
2004.04-5462,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3102.983,3103.537,Would you tell me again?
2004.04-5462,2,42961,traci_l_lovitt,,3109.388,3113.504,--That they received everything they needed to challenge the aggravation case through discovery.
2004.04-5462,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3114.748,3118.784,"So even if they did, would it... you still think it would be prudent not even to look at the file?"
2004.04-5462,2,42961,traci_l_lovitt,,3118.784,3122.389,--They had everything they needed to challenge the aggravation--
2004.04-5462,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3122.389,3124.07,"Well, they didn't have as much as they would have had if they'd looked at the file."
2004.04-5462,2,42961,traci_l_lovitt,,3124.07,3125.536,--But the Sixth Amendment question--
2004.04-5462,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3125.536,3126.367,Do you agree with that?
2004.04-5462,2,42961,traci_l_lovitt,,3126.367,3135.07,"--I... I think that they had... obviously, in retrospect, the court files would have been helpful, but they had nothing to signal that the court files would give them more information."
2004.04-5462,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3135.07,3135.193,"Well, I understand that."
2004.04-5462,2,42961,traci_l_lovitt,,3146.883,3147.705,They did.
2004.04-5462,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3159.753,3160.697,You're saying they did get copies of the--
2004.04-5462,2,42961,traci_l_lovitt,,3160.697,3164.526,"--Yes, yes, and that's her testimony at JA506 to 508."
2004.04-5462,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3171.601,3172.379,What is the it?
2004.04-5462,2,42961,traci_l_lovitt,,3172.379,3177.866,The it being the transcripts of the proceedings that were used in the aggravation case.
2004.04-5462,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3177.866,3180.485,But not everything that was in that file.
2004.04-5462,2,42961,traci_l_lovitt,,3180.485,3181.359,But they did not--
2004.04-5462,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3181.359,3184.425,There was a lot more than just the transcript of the proceedings in that file.
2004.04-5462,2,42961,traci_l_lovitt,,3184.425,3185.23,--Exactly.
2004.04-5462,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3191.486,3207.757,"Well, the serious question to me is... is... in many of these cases which we see, there are horrendous child abuse histories, and child abuse is a terribly difficult thing to get at and it's something that might not convince most juries of anything because they're all over the place."
2004.04-5462,2,42961,traci_l_lovitt,,3230.471,3232.365,"Well, the testimony is clear."
2004.04-5462,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3257.687,3262.16,But Strickland was about a strategic decision to pursue one kind of defense rather than another.
2004.04-5462,2,42961,traci_l_lovitt,,3303.53,3306.293,But this was the current... this is the current Federal practice.
2004.04-5462,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3332.447,3335.033,"About what records to go to, and here they went to none."
2004.04-5462,2,42961,traci_l_lovitt,,3335.033,3342.579,--Because that objectively reasonable investigation affirmatively indicated that the records would contain nothing.
2004.04-5462,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3380.638,3382.42,"--Thank you, Ms. Lovitt."
2004.04-5462,3,17914,billy_h_nolas,,3389.694,3390.233,"Yes, Your Honors."
2004.04-5462,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3543.649,3544.513,Only?
2004.04-5462,3,17914,billy_h_nolas,,3544.513,3547.904,That's the lawyer herself saying what she asked the doctors to do.
2004.04-5462,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3549.04,3555.882,"I think it's uncontested that all three looked into that, but the point that has been made is that the last two went beyond that."
2004.04-5462,3,17914,billy_h_nolas,,3557.775,3563.486,"--I disagree with that, Your Honor, and you should look at those pages from Ms. Dantos and then look at the pages from Dr. Cooke and Dr. Sadoff."
2004.04-5462,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3621.869,3623.357,"Thank you, Mr. Nolas."
