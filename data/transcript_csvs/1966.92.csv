1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,1999.394,2002.153,Now --
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2002.153,2008.493,May I ask you about this -- the purpose of this inspection.
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2016.5,2031.523,Your Honor that was set forth in the -- during the proceedings in the Superior Court by the district attorney who was representing the respondent and --
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2031.523,2032.974,In testimony?
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2032.974,2035.05,He made it clear.
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2035.05,2035.862,In testimony?
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2035.862,2036.005,No.
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2123.151,2126.639,Where is that statement of the district attorney at the (Voice Overlap) --

1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2132.384,2139.465,"36 and 37, thank you."
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2139.465,2147.056,"Now, there has been no contention here that there was any failure to comply with the ordinance."
1966.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2227.062,2245.747,"Well, how will I notice that Mr. Krause stated that this particular inspection was to conduct an annual routine inspection of the premises indicating that it is done once a year but I see that the Section says, at least once a year and has often thereafter is maybe deem necessary?"
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2245.747,2246.583,That's correct Your Honor.
1966.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2248.68,2252.799,"So that it actually, they maybe -- I suppose almost everyday."
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2253.338,2257.755,"Well I think this, now bear in mind that this is where hotels and apartment houses."
1966.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2257.755,2258.308,Yes.
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2258.308,2263.222,"And I think if there is a health problem in a hotel, you'll find them in there just about everyday till it's fixed."
1966.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2263.222,2275.148,"But in any event as regard to this building the record is clear that this was just a single inspection, annual, one and after -- not more a often --"
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2275.148,2276.485,I don't know.
1966.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2281.183,2281.422,But I was saying --
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2281.422,2282.467,-- because they couldn't get in.
1966.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2282.467,2282.769,Yes.
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2285.267,2286.486,The same single inspection.
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2288.187,2302.097,"Mr. Harris, may I ask you if it is actually the practice of the City and County of the San Francisco to inspect every apartment in the City of San Francisco every year?"
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2302.097,2304.592,"No, I don't think that is the practice Your Honor."
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2304.592,2323.698,"Well, then I'd like to ask you this concerning this situation because Mr. Krause said that, so that here we have an inspector going to the premises to conduct an inspection of the premises pursuant to Section 86 in the municipal code part 3."
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2352.413,2358.972,"Well, Your Honor, I think I misunderstood your original question."
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2358.972,2359.393,Very well.
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2359.393,2361.926,There are thousands and thousands of apartment units --
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2361.926,2362.064,But --
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2362.064,2362.942,-- in San Francisco.
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2362.942,2363.479,But what --
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2363.479,2371.388,I meant to say that it is not my understanding that the health inspectors attempt to inspect every single apartment in that city every year.
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2373.442,2373.882,"Well, (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2373.882,2376.051,-- physical capacity available to them.
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2376.051,2376.794,I do too.
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2376.794,2386.294,"Now, whether they attempt to go into each apartment house, bear in mind that this apartment house had 16 apartments on the second and third floors."
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2411.199,2411.242,You think --
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2411.242,2413.286,"Oh, but I'm sure they don't try to do that."
1966.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2413.286,2417.438,Do you think they'd try to get into every apartment house though whether they do inspect (Voice Overlap) --
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2417.438,2420.342,I think they -- I'm certain that they do try to --
1966.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2420.342,2421.12,Either as a figure (Voice Overlap) --
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2421.12,2421.482,-- go to each house.
1966.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2421.482,2435.207,"Figure in one of the amicus briefs is that -- that the Los Angeles Health Department made 46,000 inspections in apartments in one year."
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2435.207,2435.418,Well --
1966.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2435.418,2439.506,In which -- they've got people -- at least to go in every apartment house.
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2439.506,2452.685,"In San Francisco when -- as we point out in our brief, there are 50,000 inspection trips directed to 16,000 apartment buildings in the fiscal year of 1964."
1966.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2468.389,2468.793,I just think --
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2468.793,2472.763,None of this was developed in the record as far as the frequency of their inspections.
1966.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2472.763,2475.355,There are inspections of brand new buildings routinely --
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2475.355,2477.477,"Oh, very, very intensive but --"
1966.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2477.477,2477.551,Yes.
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2477.551,2489.761,"-- once the -- it's been clear than the only equipment is improperly, I -- this is my own suggestion that perhaps you might want to look into the Fillmore District or Hunters Point rather than waste time going back."
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2494.37,2503.121,"But Mr. Harris, may I ask this, was this living quarters of the petitioner a part of the apartment house?"
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2517.258,2524.709,"Well, as I understand it Mr. Chief Justice, the -- he was a tenant of the entire ground floor which had no apartment as such Your Honor."
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2524.709,2526.97,It had no connection with the apartment house?
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2526.97,2532.608,"Well, it was the ground floor and then the second and third floors were individual apartments, eight on each floor."
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2532.608,2533.066,"Yes, yes."
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2533.066,2537.303,The ground floor was restricted to commercial use by the permit of occupancy.
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2537.303,2538.577,Yes.
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2538.577,2545.229,"What facilities Mr. Camara -- now, Mr. Camara had a store properly at the front of the building."
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2545.229,2545.94,Yes.
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2545.94,2555.446,What facilities he had in the back for living or whether he lived there is not disclosed by the record except by his own statement that he did in fact lived there.
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2555.446,2556.707,"Yes, yes."
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2556.707,2566.115,"Now under our housing code, that would -- that in itself is not a basis for any abatement proceedings as to Mr. Camara or anything else."
1966.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2603.248,2609.902,"I thought this was a -- there's confusion here, in the briefs too as I read them."
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2646.162,2648.371,"Well, yes sire -- no Your Honor."
1966.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2651.396,2653.073,There was a violation?
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2653.073,2664.474,"Well, but the violation under the ordinances in San Francisco, you cannot let apartments without affirmative occupancy and that limits the manner in which you have let them."
1966.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2664.474,2664.925,"Now, what is the --"
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2664.925,2667.957,But if that -- that is a matter for the owner of the apartment house.
1966.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2669.97,2697.832,"Well, I don't see any -- maybe I missed it but I don't remember any reference in your brief to the health and -- provision or whatever other provision it is you refer us to the Section 86 part 3 requiring an inspection at least once a year from apartment houses for the purposes of the occupancy permit."
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2702.496,2703.699,There certainly is Your Honor.
1966.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2703.699,2704.518,"Now, what is that?"
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2704.518,2705.292,It certainly is.
1966.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2710.635,2717.056,"Number one, is there anything -- is there a reference in your brief something else?"
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2717.056,2720.778,"Well, certainly it should be a reference to that Section."
1966.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2720.778,2730.496,"As I read your brief, I thought that all you were saying was that the reason that you were seeking the inspection right here was this occupancy --"
1966.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2730.496,2731.4,First Section 101 --
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2731.4,2732.012,Well --
1966.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2732.012,2735.779,-- quoted on page 41 of your brief?
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2735.779,2736.927,"Yes, that's correct Your Honor."
1966.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2737.16,2742.199,Section 101 of the code.
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2742.199,2750.257,"Well -- no, that is the -- that's the -- that is the declaration of policy."
1966.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2752.758,2753.08,That's clear from your (Voice Overlap) --
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2753.08,2753.739,-- your finding that --
1966.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2753.739,2764.106,"-- brief -- it's clear from your brief that the purposes of the occupancy permit, your ordinances do provide for routine inspection."
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2774.419,2774.547,Well --
1966.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2774.547,2789.936,-- whether that -- and I'd like to know whether Mr. Camara was told that the inspector wants to get in this -- for some purpose other than the occupancy permit inspection.
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2789.936,2808.316,"Your Honor, improper occupancy which is using a place to live in that is not designed for that purpose specifically provided as one of the grounds upon which a building may be a substandard building."
1966.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2851.669,2860.694,"Well Mr. Harris, I don't know if this -- I gather Mr. (Inaudible) was seeking to releave for all this, wasn't it at page 37?"
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2860.694,2861.528,That's correct Your Honor.
1966.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2861.543,2868.063,"And he says this is a reason of the ordinance, Section 86 and that's the one annual inspection, isn't it?"
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2868.063,2869.13,"That's correct,"
1966.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2869.13,2881.102,And I am sure the effect of this is apparent to the Court where the importance of the city inspectors know how many people are occupying the building apartment because they won't have all the power in conjunction with (Inaudible).
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2888.128,2888.374,No.
1966.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2889.918,2890.479,I assume there is a --
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2890.479,2892.126,There is no other indication Your Honor.
1966.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2897.882,2899.469,That's Mr. Justice Fortas question.
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2900.179,2901.271,Well maybe I've -- I haven't --
1966.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2901.271,2902.889,-- was the only reason they went?
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2902.889,2904.564,That's -- is the reason that they went.
1966.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2905.382,2906.153,"And, well I would --"
1966.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2906.153,2910.441,Our we concerned with the fact that there may indeed has been other violations of some other --
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2910.441,2912.486,I'm not saying there were any other violations.
1966.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2923.461,2924.325,For what purpose?
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2924.325,2929.235,"Now, for what purpose, do exercise or perform their duties and their duties are to determine whether these --"
1966.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2929.235,2929.3,"No, no, no, no."
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2929.3,2930.723,-- are substandard buildings.
1966.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2930.723,2931.276,No.
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,2947.134,2947.71,"Now, it relates to hotels and apartments."
1966.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2947.71,2973.769,And if we have to -- are you -- the questions going through my mind is whether you're saying that even if the inspector is obeying as to the reason for asking for access he still has a right of access without obtaining a warrant or anything else or let me put it another way.
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3025.967,3026.06,No --
1966.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3026.06,3026.826,-- the specific questions --
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3026.826,3027.401,"Yes, that is --"
1966.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3027.401,3053.558,"-- that I am putting you now is this, its a matter of fact in your brief as I read it, there is an attempt to defend this particular inspection only as I read it on the grounds that it was part of an annual inspection provided by ordinance with purposes of this kinds of permit of occupancy."
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3053.764,3055.309,It's correct Your Honor.
1966.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3055.309,3062.374,"-- if there is anything -- if there was any other purpose to be served, I'd like to know what it is, number one."
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3071.322,3096.507,"Well, it's clear from the record Your Honor and we've taken the position and I don't mean by what I have said here to -- in anyway affect that position that this inspection was attempted pursuant to the ordinance calling for an annual inspection of apartments and hotels in the City of San Francisco."
1966.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3104.493,3104.921,But in the course to --
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3104.921,3105.277,Now --
1966.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3105.277,3109.739,"-- making that inspection they might have various concerns, isn't that -- is that what you're saying?"
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3109.739,3111.031,That is quite true Your Honor.
1966.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3111.031,3111.077,Yes.
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3111.077,3113.472,They would have countless concerns.
1966.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3133.548,3145.495,"Do you know whether -- when they make those (Inaudible) or a checklist, inspected suppose to employ that if it looks fire hazard, overcrowding, health hazard, (Inaudible)?"
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3145.495,3155.892,"Well, the record does not touch on that Your Honor and I can't say, as a practical whether that's true or not."
1966.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3155.892,3157.641,Why have you taken this (Inaudible)?
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3157.641,3159.665,I would think it certainly would be.
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3159.665,3168.876,"Mr. Harris, one of the things that bothers some of us and me at least is this."
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3269.202,3272.922,If I could take that up in both of the hardship Mr. Chief Justice --
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3272.922,3274.095,"Yes, in your own way."
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3274.095,3284.943,The -- I think the -- what Your Honor has suggested would be a very prudent course for a lady who is confronted by a man who says he wants to make an inspection.
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3291.36,3291.874,But anybody can get a --
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3291.874,3292.713,Now --
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3292.713,3294.289,Anybody can get a --
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3294.289,3301.915,Certainly that could happen and I think a lady might be very prudent not to rely simply on those credentials.
1966.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3302.067,3303.592,Don't they have a picture (Voice Overlap)?
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3303.592,3304.527,"Well, it probably."
1966.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3314.634,3316.293,"Yes, (Inaudible) the picture."
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3316.293,3318.425,That's true.
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3574.439,3575.609,How do we know?
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3577.363,3583.966,"Your Honor, I have faith that the American Civil Liberties Union would be citing them one after another had there been any abuses?"
1966.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3644.175,3649.342,What's your remedy now (Inaudible)?
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3649.342,3653.146,Our remedy is to charge him in a warrant -- a complaint Your Honor.
1966.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3653.146,3667.605,"And (Inaudible) somebody to -- why wouldn't we just inspect the -- go to the magistrate for a warrant to search, that it is for (Inaudible)."
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3667.605,3668.31,Well --
1966.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3668.31,3673.195,Could you tell us the --
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3673.195,3678.226,I think the fact is that there are not very many of these.
1966.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3686.267,3693.379,"Do you think its criminal federally and the claim (Inaudible) the reasons before they're made, just duly do this?"
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3693.379,3694.935,"No, I don't think that's it Your Honor."
1966.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3702.399,3706.711,Is that the really a (Inaudible)?
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3706.711,3707.676,"Well, it's going to --"
1966.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3707.676,3710.298,If people are going to let the inspectors (Inaudible) --
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3710.298,3719.147,"No, I -- the fact is that we found about 15% in San Francisco in fire inspections who didn't let inspectors in voluntarily."
1966.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3724.658,3724.916,But yes (Voice Overlap) --
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3724.916,3726.024,-- the Court announces that --
1966.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3726.024,3740.635,"-- the Court also said, however, maybe your constitutional right to require a warrant but would the -- inspector can get the warrant, and what would it be to such a (Inaudible)."
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3754.2,3754.709,"Well, no."
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3771.662,3791.126,"Well, let's deal with the question I asked you a little awhile ago that for a moment there's a woman in her home alone with her children and a man comes to her door and says, “I will come in and inspect your house."
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3825.306,3827.009,"Well, I hope not Your Honor."
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3827.009,3827.182,"Well, (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3827.182,3829.662,I hope not but she has no right --
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3829.662,3847.188,"But if you have a right to insist on this man coming in to her house and there are just thousands and thousands of women in that situation in our state, what do you going to do about it?"
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3855.719,3856.71,"No, Your Honor."
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3891.772,3894.257,"You mean by repetitive business going back, --"
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3894.257,3894.578,If she could --
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3894.578,3896.901,-- back and back and back.
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3896.901,3897.637,"She can say, “Come in in another week.”"
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3897.637,3921.749,"Well, why wouldn't it be much easier to let -- to have him get this authorization to make the inspection go and so on said lady, there is the -- here's the warrant that the judge issued and the -- its much easier than -- even in this case for the man who went back three times just to have him -- tell him no, I won't let you go in."
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3925.883,3932.49,"Well, what -- Your Honor, what standards would the magistrate use under that circumstance as to whether or not he should issue a search warrant --"
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3932.49,3932.581,Well --
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3932.581,3933.412,What facts would he ask for?
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3933.412,3949.971,"Well, I am -- for myself, I would suggest that if you have a health ordinance that calls for annual inspection for apartment houses and it's his duty to go to this apartment house."
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3970.042,3971.172,I think Your Honor --
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3971.172,3983.011,I think that most people would do that -- would let people in anyway if there's no danger of any -- anything wrong happening.
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,3988.792,3996.148,"Well, you'd never know for one thing any more of that search warrant were not a forgery than -- for the people whether that's suspicious."
1966.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4005.68,4007.36,"No, it's an administrative warrant."
1966.92,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,4007.36,4011.65,It would be a different thing and the Fourth Amendment does not have anything to do with that.
