1967.445,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,29.33,"AVCO Corporation, petitioner, versus Aero Lodge Number 735, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers et al."
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,30.919,34.21,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1967.445,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,231.511,234.054,"The state court had granted what, a temporary restraining order or --"
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,234.054,234.675,Temporary injunction Your Honor.
1967.445,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,234.675,235.875,-- [Voice Overlap] injunction or what?
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,235.875,236.7,Yes.
1967.445,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,236.7,237.511,What did he call it?
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,237.511,245.457,"Temporary injunction, it was a fiat it's called under Tennessee chancery practice, and simply granted our application for a temporary injunction."
1967.445,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,245.457,247.295,On an ex parte hearing or was there a --
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,247.295,253.547,"No, well Your Honor there was an ex parte hearing solely because the union didn't choose to show up."
1967.445,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,253.7,254.18,They were given a --
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,254.18,260.451,"-- notified by telephone call although it doesn't show in the record one way or the other, that's the fact."
1967.445,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,260.451,264.502,"On the Tennessee chancery Mr. Swigert, do these things ever go to final hearing?"
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,264.502,271.65,"They can whether anyone ever finds it necessary to go to file a hearing, I don't know."
1967.445,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,295.628,298.625,"Was there any law violations, any violence in the picket --"
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,298.625,307.415,"No, no Your Honor, this was a peaceful stoppage and we allege no violation of law in the petition."
1967.445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,652.371,661.403,But it did -- there's no doubt that it encroached on the state courts in the sense that the applicable law was changed?
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,661.403,663.392,Well --
1967.445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,663.392,663.482,To some extent?
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,663.482,668.307,"-- I'm coming to that point and I'll be there right now, Your Honor."
1967.445,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,722.883,731.537,"Well that -- you don't think it goes so far, Mr. Swigert as saying that even where an action maybe brought in a state court that the --"
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,731.537,742.164,"But I'm reaching that point and this is my next point. Congress did create this law, it did empower you to fashion a substantive law and you have done it."
1967.445,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,742.164,742.437,Yes but that --
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,742.437,743.881,But it did not --
1967.445,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,743.881,747.858,"-- substantive federal law, whether the action is brought in a state or federal court."
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,747.858,757.058,"If it's brought in a state court under 301, but what if the petitioner doesn't elect to bring his action into state court under 301?"
1967.445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,763.25,771.136,You mean if to suggest that if the suit on the contract that is brought on the state court and 301 is never mentioned?
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,771.136,772.063,I'm sorry Your Honor.
1967.445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,772.063,774.353,It still has a suit on a collective bargaining contract --
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,774.353,774.881,Apply --
1967.445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,774.881,782.667,-- in fact 301 itself doesn't even mention state court?
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,782.667,783.346,No Your Honor but --
1967.445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,783.346,788.953,So there would be no -- is there any really -- does anybody every mention301 on suing on a collective bargaining contract in a state?
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,788.953,790.81,"Yes Your Honor, I've done it many times."
1967.445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,790.81,791.802,Why?
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,791.802,796.42,"I have brought -- well I won't say many times but you can,."
1967.445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,798.94,800.125,But why would anybody do that?
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,800.125,808.38,Well I don't think you'd be very well advised to do it in view of the suggestion now that that automatically makes it removable.
1967.445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,829.861,831.866,Is this position critical to this case for you?
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,831.866,833.745,No I don't I think it necessarily is.
1967.445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,833.745,843.302,I mean you're going to make the same -- even if you said that the substantive law governing suits of collective bargaining contracts in state courts is federal law.
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,846.319,849.426,"Yes sir, this is an additional string to our bow."
1967.445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,927.47,935.764,"Well what if you just had asked to go injunction of this suit for damage in state court, not asking 301 or anything --"
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,935.764,936.078,I think --
1967.445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,936.078,937.543,Would've had been removed from it?
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,937.543,956.066,"Only if we had elected to file that suit -- oh but that's just Your Honor, this is what Pan American says and what (Inaudible) says and other cases, only if we had elected and stated in our petition that we were bringing the suit under federal law, would that damage suit had been removable?"
1967.445,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,962.854,975.721,"But if federal law applies here, I assume that it is -- that it compels the decision of the state court."
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,975.721,981.543,Your Honor my point is that federal law does not apply here because we brought a suit under state law.
1967.445,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,986.872,993.1,You mean to say that the choice of forum determines which law applies?
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,993.1,1003.234,"No Your Honor, not the choice of forum, but the allegations of the petition and that's what this Court said (Inaudible) it's what you said in Pan American Petroleum and in a number of other cases."
1967.445,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1003.234,1010.704,And your position then is that the plaintiff can determine where the federal law or state law will apply?
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,1010.704,1014.317,He can determine what law he wants to bring his suit in.
1967.445,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1027.107,1041.617,"But if we should conclude that it was the intention of the Congress that federal law should apply here, I don't assume you would urge that despite that, the plaintiff's choice would govern?"
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,1041.617,1045.656,"No Your Honor, but up to now the Court has determined the contrary."
1967.445,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1066.961,1076.471,But in your opening statement you did say that the questions in the present case were expressly reserved in Dowd in the last footnote.
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,1076.471,1084.106,"The general question of whether a state court suit could be removable was reserved and this is a facet of that question, yes sir."
1967.445,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1084.106,1087.844,And also the applicability of Norris-LaGuardia.
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,1087.844,1090.639,"And the applicability of Norris-LaGuardia, yes sir."
1967.445,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1360.949,1361.757,Mr. Swigert.
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,1361.757,1361.915,Yes.
1967.445,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1361.915,1374.293,May I ask if you claim that the federal courts do not have jurisdiction because of the facts that you allege in your complaint or because of the remedy that you assert?
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,1374.293,1395.913,"We did not, Your Honor, allege the jurisdictional prerequisites to an injunction suit under federal law which would have been that unlawful acts were threatened or had been committed, and secondly that public officers charged with the protection of property could not or would not protect."
1967.445,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1418.332,1422.417,I'm not quite clear about your answer yet.
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,1435.001,1435.607,Both Your Honor.
1967.445,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1435.607,1443.121,"Now let's just assume that in your case, you allege all the facts that you alleged."
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,1450.347,1456.534,"No Your Honor because in the body of our petition, we allege that we were entitled to injunctive relief."
1967.445,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1456.534,1461.17,"No, I say in the absence of your asking for injunction relief."
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,1468.151,1469.491,No Your Honor because --
1967.445,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1469.491,1469.589,Why?
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,1469.589,1480.861,"-- I'm not referring to the prayer, I'm referring of our petition, I'm referring to the body where we set forth the facts that entitled us to relief under Tennessee law."
1967.445,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1480.861,1496.564,"Well, that's what I'm asking you if it is -- if the request for an injunction was not made in your case, would the federal courts and had jurisdiction over the facts?"
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,1496.564,1508.233,"No Your Honor because we, as I've indicated sought to invoke only Tennessee law, not federal law, and unless you allege a federal cause of action you can not have federal relief."
1967.445,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1512.251,1530.58,"Well if your facts, if your facts as you state them would entitle to -- entitle the federal courts to jurisdiction, would the fact that you -- you will have a prayer for an injunction divest the federal courts of jurisdiction?"
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,1530.58,1558.166,"Well Your Honor, my answer would be that if we allege the facts necessary to allege a federal cause of action and had it elected by the language of our petition to rely on the federal cause of action then the fact that we didn't pray for injunctive relief would not mean that it wasn't the federal cause of action."
1967.445,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1558.166,1565.905,"You're not, Mr. Swigert before you sit down, you're not asking the Court to reconsider the Sinclair case are you?"
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,1565.905,1566.656,No Your Honor.
1967.445,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1566.656,1568.321,You're not.
1967.445,0,33039,j_mack_swigert,,1568.321,1594.222,"I don't think it's necessary for the decision of the case, because in Sinclair all as I understand -- I consider Sinclair an authority for us and not against us because in Sinclair you specifically stated -- it was a agreed by the conferees that no change in the existing and the injunction provisions of Norris-LaGuardia should be made."
1967.445,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1603.061,1605.886,Mr. Dunau.
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,1605.886,1609.548,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1967.445,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1740.43,1745.909,"But we don't need to decide here in this case, do we, whether a state court may issue that injunction?"
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,1745.909,1746.831,No sir.
1967.445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1749.968,1752.064,But you discuss it in some length in your brief.
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,1752.064,1756.774,"Yes we do, only because we cannot be entirely sure what -- (Inaudible)"
1967.445,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1756.774,1759.21,You would be delighted if we did decide that --
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,1759.21,1760.776,I would be delighted if you --
1967.445,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1760.776,1760.912,-- your way.
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,1760.912,1762.656,-- decided the state court had no jurisdiction.
1967.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1765.449,1767.79,"Now, while you mean that as a matter of federal law?"
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,1767.79,1768.369,As a matter of federal law.
1967.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1768.369,1772.258,Even a state court which has no little Norris-LaGuardia Act?
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,1772.258,1772.533,The --
1967.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1772.533,1775.033,May not because it has to apply federal law?
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,1775.033,1775.66,That's correct.
1967.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1775.66,1777.462,Grant an injunctive remedy?
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,1777.462,1778.132,If the court --
1967.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1778.132,1784.82,"But you didn't -- the union did not take that position as I understand it, they took no position did it in the Tennessee state action?"
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,1784.82,1788.664,"No, no response of pleading was ever filed in the Tennessee action --"
1967.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1788.664,1791.449,"But if you had, I gather, that's the kind of response to pleading you'd filed?"
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,1791.449,1800.929,"We would certainly would have claimed that federal law precludes a state from issuing a strike injunction in a suit under a collective bargaining agreement, yes sir."
1967.445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2232.738,2240.067,"Now, there is some question about whether the original action arose under the law of the United States, is there not?"
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2240.067,2254.138,"Only sir if one takes the position that if a complaint is silent, it does not mention Section 301 then there exists somehow a state law which may still be invoked."
1967.445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2254.138,2256.951,"You don't need to mention 301 in the state court, do you?"
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2256.951,2266.698,You do not need to mention 301 but your silence on the subject doesn't remove 301 as being the only law under which such an action can arise.
1967.445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2266.698,2268.504,I don't understand that.
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2271.079,2275.236,"Well, I thought that that was settled with respect to --"
1967.445,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2275.236,2283.978,Well just because the federal law is -- applies to suits on collective bargaining contracts doesn't mean that it arises under 301?
1967.445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2283.978,2284.7,Precisely.
1967.445,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2284.7,2292.098,Nor does it mean that it arises under federal law within the meaning of the jurisdictional statute?
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2292.098,2292.71,Sir.
1967.445,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2292.71,2295.359,Or rather the removal statute?
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2295.359,2297.403,I think it does.
1967.445,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2298.318,2300.351,I know you do.
1967.445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2300.351,2306.675,You said that but I just wondered why?
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2306.675,2344.444,"I think this Court said in an International Association of Machinist v. Central Airlines when it discussed not a 301 action, or a 301 contract, but when it discussed a Section 301 Railway Labor Act contract, it was the same question under a 301 contract as under a Railway Labor Act contract as the action arise under federal law or under the state law, it is true that in the Central Airlines case the action was initially begun in a federal court."
1967.445,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2344.444,2346.556,That's the same rule?
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2346.556,2361.678,"It's the same question whether the -- or the arising under question is the same whether you're concerned with does the federal court have jurisdiction if the action is brought originally in the federal court, or does it have jurisdiction on removal."
1967.445,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2361.786,2368.29,"And the -- just the fact that the federal law might control a case doesn't mean it arises under as a general proposition, is it?"
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2368.29,2383.073,"Well no, in the sense that if you in truth could allege a state action but the result of that action would be, or the aim of that action would be defeated by bringing in federal law as a defense."
1967.445,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2409.224,2421.617,Now would you say that -- what would you say if this case had -- if this complaint had alleged violence or mass picketing?
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2421.617,2430.221,We would say that the state court had jurisdiction to reach the questions of violence in mass picketing and that's all that they would have the power to reach.
1967.445,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2430.221,2431.636,Would it have been removable?
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2431.636,2433.096,"Yes sir, I think it would have been."
1967.445,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2461.557,2470.609,Do you know of any cases that have dealt with the question of whether state courts may award to punitive damages in 303 actions?
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2470.609,2474.674,In a 303 action?
1967.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2478.878,2483.143,Gibbs I gather didn't -- Gibbs was a 303 but a Federal Court 303.
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2483.143,2484.518,It was a federal court 303.
1967.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2484.518,2496.096,"There was something said in 303 generally about in case of violence state power to award punitive damages, wasn't it?"
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2496.096,2499.671,"If I remember correctly, but this is really off the top of my hat."
1967.445,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2512.665,2518.275,But you don't recall any cases in the -- that have been decided in state courts?
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2518.275,2527.493,"No sir, but I'm just reminded that Morten Saw, this Court decided that you couldn't award punitive damages in a Section 303 action and my recollection --"
1967.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2527.493,2536.827,"And yet if there were violence, I take it in that very situation a state court could be empowered, would it not, to allow punitive damages?"
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2539.248,2544.689,"With respect to the violence, but not with respect for example to a claim of a 303 claim."
1967.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2544.689,2548.244,Wasn't that Gibbs?
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2548.244,2549.472,Gibbs had --
1967.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2549.472,2551.331,Well I mean don't waste your time on that?
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2551.331,2552.007,I'm sorry I just --
1967.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2552.007,2553.522,Yes.
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2553.522,2576.754,"No, with respect to the arising under requirement, I think that what this Court said in Machinist v. Central Airlines controls here, the Labor Management Relations Act, Section 301 contract is a federal contract and is therefore governed and enforceable by federal law, and I think that ends the question of arising under in this case."
1967.445,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2754.361,2765.277,"If an action for damages were brought against the union for breach of contract in the state court, is it your -- would you contend that that could be removed?"
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2765.277,2766.825,Yes sir.
1967.445,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2798.489,2805.645,What is the jurisdiction that would be left to the state court not subject to removal to the federal court?
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2805.645,2806.244,None.
1967.445,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2806.244,2810.367,None.
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2810.367,2832.708,"Now we think that when Congress made the determination that a strike injunction was not important to the enforcement of a no strike promise, it could not have said that it is important to the enforcement of a no strike promise if you bring your action in a state court, but it is not important if you bring your action in a federal court."
1967.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2840.915,2841.585,"Mr. Dunau, may I?"
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2841.585,2842.312,Yes.
1967.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2842.312,2856.526,"I must confess, did you in answering Mr. Justice Fortas, embrace a suit where actually there had been violence and violence alleged and injunctive relief or damages based on violence were sought?"
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2856.526,2857.387,No sir.
1967.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2857.387,2858.058,You did not.
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2858.058,2858.416,No sir.
1967.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2858.416,2859.605,That would not be removed.
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2859.605,2866.104,No sir because violence is a matter which is within a state court jurisdiction and as to which state law continues to be applicable.
1967.445,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2866.104,2870.161,"Yes, and it does not arise and that sort of nature would arise under federal court."
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2870.161,2872.935,"Does not arise under federal court, precisely sir."
1967.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2885.445,2887.736,Well then you'll be getting into First Amendment area wouldn't it?
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2887.736,2889.305,-- getting into a First Amendment area.
1967.445,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2898.106,2930.269,"Well I probably did misunderstand you earlier, because I thought you said that if there were violence and suit were started in the federal -- in the state court, and there could -- for injunction let's say, then there could be a removal to the federal court and the federal court would also take the issue of violence as in on the pendent jurisdiction theory which I think some third paragraph of 1441."
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2930.269,2935.045,Well I ought to them differentiates three separate situations.
1967.445,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2938.694,2940.679,"Yes, you mean to say if the --"
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2940.679,2941.373,If the actions are --
1967.445,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2941.373,2953.633,"-- lawsuit is for what, the damages for violence alone just like it's an action for damages on account of assault and battery or trespass and etcetera?"
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2953.633,2954.466,That's correct sir.
1967.445,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2954.466,2960.214,"Alright, now that would be kind of rare, wouldn't it, in these disputes?"
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2960.214,2963.089,It's hard to imagine violence associated from someone --
1967.445,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2963.089,2963.635,Yes it is.
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,2963.635,2966.086,-- dispute.
1967.445,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2994.266,3027.234,"So actually would it be a correct summary of your view taking in to account your previous colloquy with me and the colloquy with Mr. Justice Brennan that your argument leads us to the position that state courts would have no jurisdiction that would be immune from removal to the federal courts except possibly a simple, plain vanilla action for damage on account of violence?"
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,3027.234,3031.121,"That I think would be correct, yes sir."
1967.445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3051.945,3056.669,"Plus Hughes v. Cardinal departed from that ideal, didn't it?"
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,3056.669,3060.34,"It departed from the ideal and that's why I say it's an ideal, it's not a fetish."
1967.445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3060.34,3064.467,"Well if it were an ideal, how did we decide Hughes v. Cardinal the way we did?"
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,3064.467,3064.829,It seems to me --
1967.445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3064.829,3072.311,We could've very easily decided it the way we were asked to decide it in conformity with the ideal that you now suggest should be the touch stone?
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,3072.311,3085.16,I think that the Court could have decided it the other way and then would have had a very difficult problem of formulating what shall be the rule of limitations if it is a federal rule which shall be uniform throughout country shall --
1967.445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3085.16,3088.651,"It just take five votes in this Court, we could have set any rule of limitations you wanted, couldn't we?"
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,3088.651,3098.397,"But I assume sir that five votes takes a lot of thinking before justices vote, and so that I don't suppose it's quite so easy before the vote gets cast."
1967.445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3188.136,3214.617,"I thought this Court had said many, many times in recent years that the real basic ideal of federal labor law and federal labor policy is the peaceful, orderly, lawful adjustment of labor disputes and the fostering of atmosphere conducive to the making of collective bargaining agreements and the enforcement thereof."
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,3215.05,3221.765,I certainly would not disagree with that expression of federal labor policy.
1967.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3311.613,3327.502,"I suppose if this view prevails that this action is removable, as a practical matter, we will probably never see a case where we have to test the authority of the state court to issue a strike, except in violence cases, would we?"
1967.445,1,17581,bernard_dunau,,3327.502,3345.946,"I'm not sure Your Honor because I suppose there may be lawyers who would feel that in a particular state court with particular state judges that they would get a more understanding adjudication of their problem than they would get before a particular federal judge, and therefore would not remove so it could still come up."
1967.445,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3393.901,3395.165,Mr. Swigert.
1967.445,2,33039,j_mack_swigert,,3395.165,3407.906,"Central Airlines relied on with the respondents turned solely on the intention of Congress, and this Court held that Congress intended there to establish an exclusive remedy, but here Congress didn't."
1967.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3509.038,3509.866,May I ask you a question?
1967.445,2,33039,j_mack_swigert,,3509.866,3511.513,"Yes, yes sir Mr. Justice Black."
1967.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3511.513,3531.658,"Basically, so far as these differences are concerned are there any difference between what you're asking what the other side is asking, accept that your method will permit by a filing of a state suit to avoid the Norris-LaGuardia prohibition against the injunction?"
1967.445,2,33039,j_mack_swigert,,3531.658,3534.492,"Your Honor, that was true in 1947 that you could."
1967.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3534.492,3538.847,"Now you said the effects, what -- if that's what's involved --"
1967.445,2,33039,j_mack_swigert,,3538.847,3539.917,I believe --
1967.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3539.917,3540.229,-- what else is involved?
1967.445,2,33039,j_mack_swigert,,3540.229,3553.278,"-- I believe, if I understand your question, I believe that so because before 1947 you could always avoid Norris-LaGuardia by filing an injunction suit in the state court and I think Congress intended to continue that so today you can still do it."
1967.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3553.278,3563.458,"So you're reaching it, the discussion now, on arguing that the 301 federal limit is not exclusive, you just reach it that way?"
1967.445,2,33039,j_mack_swigert,,3563.458,3564.451,It is not exclusive.
