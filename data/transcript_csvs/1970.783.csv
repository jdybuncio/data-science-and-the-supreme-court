1970.783,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.518,"-- this morning in Number 783, Clay against the United States."
1970.783,0,18867,chauncey_eskridge,,12.877,21.387,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.783,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1329.341,1333.879,May it please the Court.
1970.783,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1600.231,1605.908,Are you speaking now Mr. Solicitor General of the hearing officer appointed in Kentucky?
1970.783,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1605.908,1613.576,"The hearing officer appointed by the Department of Justice who held a hearing in Louisville, Kentucky."
1970.783,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1674.639,1700.392,"I think its common ground however Mr. Solicitor General, is it not, that the dispositive question is the particularized beliefs of this individual registrant, or that individual registrant rather than the basic tenants of the religious sect to which he adheres?"
1970.783,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1700.392,1701.343,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1970.783,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1701.733,1705.006,"And both ways, there are two sides to that coin?"
1970.783,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1705.006,1720.022,"I agree it is the beliefs of this individual, except that in this case, this individual has stated unequivocally that he accepts the beliefs of the sect, and there has been introduced at the hearing as establishing his beliefs."
1970.783,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1736.682,1742.533,"I wasn't suggesting that he could or should, but he didn't confine himself to that, did he?"
1970.783,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1742.533,1743.566,"No, Mr. Justice."
1970.783,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1744.226,1749.375,-- I incorporate all that by reference and then now he said now he added a few things.
1970.783,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1749.375,1752.7,"He had not only incorporated there all by reference, he said “I stand on it” --"
1970.783,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1752.7,1753.362,Yes.
1970.783,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1753.362,1756.414,-- which his not merely incidental background.
1970.783,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1756.414,1758.293,"That was rather a starting point, wasn't it?"
1970.783,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1759.49,1761.373,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1970.783,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1938.678,1952.179,"And just so I can be clear, as I follow your argument, the basis in fact I suppose was not like the Witmer case based on the applicant's insincerity, lack of sincerity, was it?"
1970.783,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1952.179,1964.134,"Our position is that the question of sincerity is not before the Court now, not having been raised in the petition and not being covered by the grant of certiorari."
1970.783,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1982.5,1989.917,"What I'm interested in learning is what among the various possible basis, what was the basis in fact?"
1970.783,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2012.779,2017.824,"Well, I believe that the only one that is before the Court now is the latter one."
1970.783,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2018.697,2020.105,Selective objection?
1970.783,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2020.105,2044.56,"That is the only question that is covered by the grant of certiorari, whether petitioner's conviction should be vacated in the light of this Court's decision in Welsh, because the denial to petitioner of a conscientious objector exemption may have been based upon the Department of Justice's erroneous characterization of his objections to participation in wars as political and racial."
1970.783,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2046.528,2049.808,"Well then, we're not involved with selective objection, are we?"
1970.783,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2049.808,2054.079,Mr. Justice I believe it does just as in the Negre case.
1970.783,2,18867,chauncey_eskridge,,3359.231,3360.818,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1970.783,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3360.818,3366.571,May I ask you before you get underway and avoid an interruption perhaps.
1970.783,2,18867,chauncey_eskridge,,3416.4,3416.753,May I answer that question?
1970.783,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3416.753,3420.645,Would that be a reasonable inference to draw from that statement of belief?
1970.783,2,18867,chauncey_eskridge,,3420.645,3421.328,No sir.
1970.783,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3421.328,3422.026,It would not?
1970.783,2,18867,chauncey_eskridge,,3422.026,3422.452,No sir.
1970.783,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3422.452,3425.074,Then what does it mean?
1970.783,2,18867,chauncey_eskridge,,3438.276,3439.718,No sir.
1970.783,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3581.122,3602.607,Do you think then it would be irrational on the record for the draft board and Appeal Board to have read this paragraph that I quoted to you as a conditional refusal only?
1970.783,2,18867,chauncey_eskridge,,3602.607,3605.642,That one sentence you mean?
1970.783,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3619.71,3629.297,Very well.
1970.783,2,18867,chauncey_eskridge,,3630.861,3631.583,Yes sir.
1970.783,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3631.583,3632.403,Thank you very much.
