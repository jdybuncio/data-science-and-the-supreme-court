1992.92-6073,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,"We'll hear argument next in No. 92-6073, Richard Lyle Austin v. the United States."
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,30.44,35.125,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-6073,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,176.728,179.633,I thought we rejected the application there.
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,179.633,185.574,You indicated that you rejected the application to actions between private parties.
1992.92-6073,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,315.298,316.34,What does this prove?
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,316.34,329.69,"--Well, it shows I think that there should be some sort of check on the Government, just as Justice Scalia says it makes sense to scrutinize Government actions more closely."
1992.92-6073,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,333.621,337.564,"And so, the Constitution automatically erects a shield against it?"
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,337.564,347.242,"I think that the Constitution protects individuals from Government overreaching if that happens, if there's a possibility of it."
1992.92-6073,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,350.243,359.639,"Well, what do you do with a case like Calero-Toledo which says that even an innocent owner... and no one contends, I take it, that your client is innocent."
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,359.639,360.008,No.
1992.92-6073,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,360.008,364.262,Even an innocent owner can... the property can be taken under traditional forfeiture law.
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,364.262,370.707,Calero-Toledo needs to be distinguished and possibly even looked at again I think.
1992.92-6073,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,372.006,373.018,"Well, what's the matter with it?"
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,375.158,378.252,"--Well, Calero-Toledo, the Eighth Amendment wasn't raised."
1992.92-6073,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,411.041,421.209,What difference does it make how much money you're talking about if it's money being taken from an innocent person?
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,446.044,447.206,Correct.
1992.92-6073,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,447.206,454.332,But all these in rem things at common law could be imposed against a totally innocent person.
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,461.235,471.133,I think that in rem forfeiture under common law and as... at the time that the Framers knew it is different than the forfeiture that we're experiencing today.
1992.92-6073,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,481.728,482.519,Cars.
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,482.519,496.357,"--Which are instrumentalities... which can be instrumentalities of drug use, but when it comes to someone's home or in this case the business, these were incidental, in effect, to the drug use."
1992.92-6073,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,502.291,507.656,"Well, what if he did... what if the defendant just did business out of his house, the drug business out of his house?"
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,507.656,514.62,"If there was... if the house was used specifically for that purpose, if it was... if there was a history--"
1992.92-6073,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,514.62,515.861,Then no proportionality?
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,515.861,521.424,"--Then there should be proportionality, but it should be analyzed under a series of factors."
1992.92-6073,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,538.526,544.419,"I thought this particular statute does provide a defense for innocent owners, does it not?"
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,544.419,545.03,"Yes, it does."
1992.92-6073,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,545.03,551.375,"I mean, we're dealing here with what could be characterized as a punitive sanction."
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,551.375,552.724,"I believe that's true, yes."
1992.92-6073,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,568.745,577.722,"You mean, if... let's assume you have a good, old... the most old-fashioned old-fashioned in rem forfeiture statute around."
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,600.468,607.113,"I think that... first of all, I think Congress in a sense has enacted that type of law under (a)(4)."
1992.92-6073,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,607.113,619.309,"I understand, but I understood your argument to be that since an innocent person gets off in this one, we should impose the proportionality requirement because that renders it punishment, whereas the ordinary in rem thing was not punishment."
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,619.309,619.83,That's correct.
1992.92-6073,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,620.591,634.39,"So, your answer to my hypothetical would be yes, that if Congress got tender-hearted and said, well, let's make an exception to our traditional in rem forfeiture of pirate ships and we'll say if the owner of the ship was innocent of the piracy, we won't forfeit it."
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,642.954,644.606,"--Well, I think that would depend on--"
1992.92-6073,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,644.606,645.478,--because that would be too much punishment.
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,645.478,647.258,--It could depend on the cases.
1992.92-6073,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,651.092,656.635,It seems to me it's in rem whether or not you decide to let the innocent person off.
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,658.415,660.916,"It can be in rem, but it can also be punishment."
1992.92-6073,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,660.916,669.993,"Well, is it punishment if the owner has not engaged in punishable misconduct?"
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,669.993,670.544,It would--
1992.92-6073,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,670.544,671.165,"I mean, how--"
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,671.165,672.485,"--It certainly would be punishment then, yes."
1992.92-6073,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,673.486,678.739,--If the owner has not engaged in punishable conduct.
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,678.739,681.38,--If the owner has not engaged in punishable conduct--
1992.92-6073,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,681.38,683.182,Then how would that be punishment?
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,683.182,690.328,"--Well, if the owner had not done anything wrong and yet had the property seized and forfeited, then obviously--"
1992.92-6073,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,690.328,690.668,Yes.
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,690.668,692.92,--that certainly would be punishment to that particular person.
1992.92-6073,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,692.92,694.432,I wouldn't have thought so.
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,699.504,705.918,"If the person has done nothing wrong it seems like, then it would be punishment if the person would have their assets taken."
1992.92-6073,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,738.861,747.495,"Yes, but you would be making the same argument if this forfeiture was done after a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt."
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,747.495,750.167,"That's true, yes."
1992.92-6073,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,751.928,755.18,"Well, why don't we talk about the case like that?"
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,756.872,757.723,"--Yes, I would."
1992.92-6073,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,778.856,797.638,"How about somebody like Mr. Harmelin, as we call them all Mister, in the drug case from Michigan where he was convicted of a relatively minor offense, possession I guess perhaps with intent to distribute, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment?"
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,809.787,810.696,"That's true, you did."
1992.92-6073,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,818.894,821.755,We felt the Constitution didn't prohibit the States from doing that.
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,821.755,827.929,"--Yes, that's true, and... but the amount of drugs in that case was 600 and some grams I believe too."
1992.92-6073,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,827.929,830.52,And yours was only 2 grams?
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,830.52,831.602,"Only 2 grams, yes."
1992.92-6073,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,831.602,840.405,"In your case, do you agree with the correctness of the Government's statement that if your client had been prosecuted federally, the fines could have amounted to $1 million?"
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,840.405,844.119,"Well, I think the statute probably allows that, but that never would have happened."
1992.92-6073,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,844.119,849.692,"Well, if it had happened, is the... would the application of the statute be unconstitutional?"
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,849.692,854.985,I think one could argue that that would be an excessive fine for someone that... who is in forma pauperis.
1992.92-6073,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,865.564,873.928,"I assume the higher the fine... the poorer you are, the easier it is to impose a higher fine."
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,878.352,885.295,"Usually I think it would... usually, at least in my experience, the fine is not imposed if the person is not able to pay it."
1992.92-6073,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,885.295,889.469,"Well, why... what is the reason why it's disproportionate here?"
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,895.523,896.305,Right.
1992.92-6073,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,904.88,911.302,"Well, it depends entirely upon how serious the society considers a drug offense to be I suppose."
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,911.302,920.728,"I think that's a factor, but also we're asking the Court to take into consideration the other factors, that someone who has lost everything they have for a relatively minor offense--"
1992.92-6073,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,920.728,932.546,"Well, it's not relatively minor if society really has its face set against drugs and has provided for... at the Federal level at least, for penalties of the sort that has been mentioned."
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,941.653,949.897,"--It is harmful to society, and the... certainly the Government has to have laws which help it in its war on drugs."
1992.92-6073,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,958.144,961.016,"Well, from the statistics you gave, it isn't."
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,961.016,965.548,"Well, that's true, but this person lost everything because of it."
1992.92-6073,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,976.014,982.769,"He's at least able to start over again in a way that Harmelin never was, spending the rest of his life in jail."
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,982.769,983.791,That's true.
1992.92-6073,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,984.271,988.202,Have you got any cases on your side?
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,988.202,994.076,"Well, I think the Halper case is on our side, at least as far as the punishment issue."
1992.92-6073,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,999.361,1005.275,Have you got any cases applying it to the... to civil cases?
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,1005.275,1015.391,"The Whalers Cove case from the Second Circuit applies it, although the Whalers Cove case on the facts finds that it does not apply."
1992.92-6073,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1029.969,1032.262,But it applied the Eighth Amendment anyway.
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,1032.262,1033.512,It applies the Eighth Amendment yes.
1992.92-6073,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1045.079,1051.524,Have you got any State supreme court cases on your side?
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,1051.524,1053.535,"--No, not that have applied the Excessive Fines Clause."
1992.92-6073,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1054.036,1055.916,Or under their own constitutions?
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,1055.916,1057.689,"Not that I'm aware of, Your Honor."
1992.92-6073,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1148.167,1157.573,What did the prior or the old law mean when it defined the objective of the in rem action as remedial?
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,1163.126,1164.598,"Yes, that was one of the--"
1992.92-6073,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1164.598,1167.21,"Well, that's exactly what's being done here, isn't it?"
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,1167.21,1173.783,"--Well, I guess I'd argue that the body shop and the mobile home were not instrumentalities."
1992.92-6073,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1183.981,1189.434,"Well, ships were not necessarily designed for smuggling either, but they were used for that."
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,1197.778,1205.335,"--I think that in those cases too, though, that the item was specifically used to store drugs and it was used to transport drugs."
1992.92-6073,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1205.335,1207.976,"Well, the mobile home was being used to store drugs, wasn't it?"
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,1207.976,1209.626,Not--
1992.92-6073,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1209.626,1214.742,"I forget where the cocaine was found, but I mean, there's a bag of cocaine either in the body shop or the mobile home."
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,1294.223,1302.088,"--Well, I guess I'm arguing that the Excessive Fines Clause should apply to this forfeiture whether the person is guilty or innocent."
1992.92-6073,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1306.643,1330.435,"Well, then do we take the next step and say in the most garden variety of old-fashioned in rem actions, there is likewise going to be a proportionality defense, and in fact, it will always work I suppose because the owner is always going to be innocent or innocence is always going to be... strike that."
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,1332.288,1334.269,I don't think guilt is irrelevant.
1992.92-6073,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1335.641,1341.524,"Well, it's irrelevant under the traditional in rem action as you were describing it."
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,1355.002,1358.344,"Well, I don't know."
1992.92-6073,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1359.305,1363.557,"Well, if I'm innocent, it's disproportionate to take a nickel out of my pocket, isn't it?"
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,1363.557,1364.569,"--That's true, yes."
1992.92-6073,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1364.569,1365.768,Then it's always going to succeed.
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,1365.768,1368.522,I don't know.
1992.92-6073,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1382.201,1388.835,"Well, I suppose the Government can always decide that certain property is malum in se."
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,1392.386,1393.237,Yes.
1992.92-6073,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1393.237,1396.64,It has no proper use or it's dangerous to the public.
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,1396.64,1398.23,That's true.
1992.92-6073,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1398.23,1403.635,I would think there would be many reasons where you could take property even from someone who's totally innocent.
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,1403.635,1410.951,"Yes, that's true, especially if the property is used... has a specific purpose in advancing the drug business."
1992.92-6073,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1422.348,1426.181,But none of those categories would be applicable to the property involved here.
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,1426.181,1427.962,"--I would say that's true, yes."
1992.92-6073,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1429.594,1432.847,Are you saying... I want to... I am not... I want to be sure I'm following your argument.
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,1463.307,1479.427,"I think that's one of the factors that should be taken into consideration I guess; that among other factors, one of the factors should be is this property used all the time for illegal purposes or is its use incidental to the particular use... illegal use."
1992.92-6073,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1479.427,1486.743,And do you draw a distinction between instrumentalities of crime and proceeds of illegal activity?
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,1486.743,1490.937,"I believe that proceeds of illegal activity... yes, that's correct."
1992.92-6073,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1490.937,1493.137,And which do we have in this case?
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,1493.137,1498.713,"Well, this is not proceeds or instrumentalities I would say because these--"
1992.92-6073,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1498.713,1501.993,Then how did they get... how could they forfeit it if it isn't one or the other?

1992.92-6073,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1511.59,1516.223,"Yes, but it's real property, homes, et cetera that are used in the furtherance of the drug trade, isn't it?"
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,1516.223,1525.839,"--Yes, but I would argue that it's not an instrumentality because it hasn't been specifically adapted for that use, that it's... the fact that it was done in that particular place was incidental to it."
1992.92-6073,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1525.839,1539.209,"And you're, in effect, arguing we should limit the historic law like illegal distilleries and things like that to properties that had no legitimate... basically had no significant legitimate use."
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,1539.88,1547.264,I would say that those particular items would be more likely to be forfeited than something that had some legitimate use.
1992.92-6073,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1550.355,1554.579,"Well, it would seem to me that if they had no legitimate use, that it would always be proportional to forfeit it."
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,1563.043,1568.187,"If it's always used for... I guess that kind of depends on what the property is, though."
1992.92-6073,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1581.306,1585.859,"Well, but if it's their business and the only use is illegal, it's not the kind of business we want to preserve."
1992.92-6073,0,39592,richard_l_johnson,,1585.859,1586.36,That's true.
1992.92-6073,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1592.974,1593.904,"Very well, Mr. Johnson."
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1594.945,1606.463,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-6073,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1634.632,1637.384,"Mr. Estrada, historically... do you know the answer to this?"
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1650.642,1660.959,The... there is no contemporary case that we've been able to find in which a specific issue was made of the fact.
1992.92-6073,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1702.587,1706.377,"In that case, Mr. Estrada, was it a leasehold interest or a fee interest?"
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1706.377,1709.16,--I think the fee interest was forfeited.
1992.92-6073,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1766.227,1769.4,Didn't they set aside... I haven't looked at the case for quite a while.
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1771.553,1778.785,That is not my recollection.
1992.92-6073,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1778.785,1783.978,"And your understanding is that even though it was a leasehold, actually what was forfeited was the fee interest in the property."
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1783.978,1790.944,"That is what... how we read the case, and the statute I think was very clear."
1992.92-6073,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1799.059,1801.162,"What's the name of the case, Mr. Estrada?"
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1801.162,1801.723,Dobbins--
1992.92-6073,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1801.723,1802.21,Dobbins?
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1802.21,1805.233,"--Distillery, which is cited in our brief, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.92-6073,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1847.862,1856.247,"Well, now, doesn't Halper indicate that a civil pecuniary sanction, designed to be remedial, can be punitive?"
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1856.247,1874.86,"I think Halper indicates that there are certain cases in which the Court will disregard the label that Congress has chosen to put on a given exaction, but under certain very limited circumstances."
1992.92-6073,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1978.21,1979.268,Where it would meet the standard.
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1984.113,1992.499,--I think every case in which the Government conduct is challenged can be subjected to a Halper inquiry.
1992.92-6073,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2030.443,2044.732,"Well, we can accept in this case, can we not, Mr. Estrada, that the purpose of the forfeiture statute is supplementary to the criminal laws because it deters and punishes?"
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2044.732,2078.154,"I think you can certainly accept that the civil forfeiture statute in this case is part of a whole set of weapons, if you will, that Congress chose to use for a very grave social issue, and we certainly concede that it is part of the statute that certain owners will be deterred from using the property in this way."
1992.92-6073,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2101.109,2107.113,"Well, in addition to deterrence, it's punishment, is it not, in the civil forfeiture context that we have here?"
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2107.113,2121.172,"--We don't think that what we have in this case, either as a general matter or in the specific facts of this case, that we can call this punishment in the constitutional sense, Justice Kennedy."
1992.92-6073,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2121.172,2147.699,"Well, in the brief that the Justice Department filed in the Parcel of Land case that we decided earlier this term, the Solicitor General is quoted at length from the Senate committee report indicating that the purpose of these laws would be to deter and punish further because criminal sanctions were ineffective to combat the drug trade."
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2156.966,2160.378,"Yes, I think we would."
1992.92-6073,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2206.968,2209.61,"If we thought it was punishment, do you lose?"
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2209.61,2213.423,"Excuse me, Justice Stevens... I mean, Justice White."
1992.92-6073,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2213.914,2218.856,"If we thought this was punishment, this amounted to punishment, would you lose?"
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2218.856,2219.767,No.
1992.92-6073,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2232.166,2241.91,"But you would say, however, that if it is punishment, it is... the Eighth Amendment is applicable to civil cases."
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2241.91,2243.312,Yes.
1992.92-6073,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2256.349,2259.512,Does it have to be some connection with a criminal case?
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2259.512,2260.394,--Yes.
1992.92-6073,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2305.183,2313.768,Do you think historically the excessive fines notion applied at all in civil cases?
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2313.768,2314.67,No.
1992.92-6073,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2345.748,2363.841,"So, the answer historically would be if a fine is payable to the sovereign as a fine, if it's as punishment, it doesn't make any difference that it's a civil case."
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2363.841,2366.432,"That is right, Justice White."
1992.92-6073,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2423.11,2427.441,"So, what if we say that we think this is punishment contrary to your belief?"
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2434.617,2459.193,"We don't think that the constitutional standard in that event would be significantly different because in either case, you would be looking at whether the Government exaction is extremely out of kilter with what the Government is trying to do with the exaction."
1992.92-6073,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2459.193,2473.352,"So, what would be the standard under the excessive fines route if we said, well, this is punishment, and so the Excessive Fines Clause applies?"
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2473.352,2491.474,"We think that the standard would be comparable to the standard that the Court used in Harmelin, which is in the first instance to ask whether the fine or the punishment is grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the crime."
1992.92-6073,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2491.474,2495.665,"So, you do say that the standard would be roughly the same--"
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2495.665,2497.287,"Yes, we do, Justice White."
1992.92-6073,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2521.254,2532.009,"--Mr. Estrada, historically did these in rem forfeitures contain an exclusion for the property of innocent persons?"
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2532.009,2541.537,"Yes, Justice Scalia, in a very limited sense."
1992.92-6073,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2679.526,2682.539,It doesn't stop... it doesn't turn it from remedial into punitive.
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2682.539,2685.57,"--Correct, because that has always been there."
1992.92-6073,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2721.655,2757.288,"Just looking at it from the other side, that sort of provides an answer to the question that I asked your brother, and that is, assuming we do find that there's something punitive here and we don't classify it as immune from review merely as a remedial forfeiture, there seems then to be a historical basis for us not to have to worry about the case of the truly innocent owner subject to the classic historical forfeiture because that person, based on your case from Fork Ranch, may very well have had a defense to the forfeiture all along."
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2757.288,2766.094,"I think we have to... yes, but I think we have to distinguish two meanings of innocence in this context."
1992.92-6073,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2784.894,2814.613,"In the case of the parents whose child uses the house to store drugs that he sells on the street, you would say if they had reason to know that he was using them, their property would historically be... on historical grounds be subject to forfeiture in the absence of any statutory defense; whereas, if they had not in any way been negligent in failing to know of the fact that he was using his room as a storehouse for the drugs he was selling, they would have a defense."
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2814.613,2828.905,"Well, I think that that's not necessarily the case because I think what Chief Justice Marshall had in mind and what we have had through the history is the imposition of a very high standard of care--"
1992.92-6073,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2828.905,2830.565,A... an affirmative obligation--
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2830.565,2831.196,--on the owner.
1992.92-6073,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2831.196,2831.737,--really to take--
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2831.737,2832.356,"Right, and--"
1992.92-6073,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2832.356,2833.427,--to take care that it not be used.
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2833.427,2838.609,"--Correct, and I think that that is, in fact, what we think has historically justified civil forfeitures."
1992.92-6073,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2867.959,2874.263,"And that, of course, would be your answer to the claim of the so-called innocent owner who was merely negligent."
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2874.263,2874.944,Right.
1992.92-6073,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2874.944,2875.615,Yes.
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2875.615,2904.523,"Yes, and we would say that as a historical matter, that person wouldn't have that type of a claim because the whole point of having a remedy of this type is to take note of the fact that there are certain things that only an owner can do and only an owner can take care of his property and make sure that it is not broken into and turned into a crack house, for example."
1992.92-6073,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2904.523,2915.871,"But all that analysis, Mr. Estrada, proceeds from the line of cases that essentially began with forfeitures in the maritime area and forfeitures of certain kind of chattel."
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2935.593,2936.644,"Well, I think--"
1992.92-6073,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2936.644,2938.497,And didn't the Framers recognize that?
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2938.497,2944.368,"--There were two types of forfeiture at early common law, Justice Kennedy."
1992.92-6073,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2987.918,3003.948,"It seems to me that the Framers were concerned that the criminal laws not be used to impose excessive punishments, and certainly in the early history of England, that was true with reference to forfeitures for felonies."
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3003.948,3011.174,"Right, but it is not the same type of forfeiture that is at issue here, Justice Kennedy."
1992.92-6073,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3076.146,3077.405,"May I ask you a question, Mr. Estrada?"
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3120.906,3124.416,"Well, it would not happen under this statute because of the--"
1992.92-6073,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3124.416,3125.267,No.
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3131.482,3133.452,"--Yes, although--"
1992.92-6073,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3133.452,3140.687,"--in a case where you know that it's the kind of business that has special duties and special concerns on the one hand, and just rent it as a residence on the other?"
1992.92-6073,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3140.687,3156.999,"--I think the mode of looking at the question would be the same in the sense that you would ask the same questions, i.e., whether the owner did everything that he physically could to ensure that this didn't happen."
1992.92-6073,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3207.19,3208.963,"Thank you, Mr. Estrada."
1992.92-6073,2,39592,richard_l_johnson,,3211.194,3213.665,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1992.92-6073,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3258.485,3266.0,Would the answer on proportionality be different if it was 600 grams instead of 2?
1992.92-6073,2,39592,richard_l_johnson,,3266.0,3275.735,"I would argue that that would be a more... that would be a factor which would be more detrimental to Mr. Austin, obviously, yes."
1992.92-6073,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3277.057,3279.539,Even though he's deprived of his entire livelihood.
1992.92-6073,2,39592,richard_l_johnson,,3279.539,3288.755,"--If it was 600 grams, there's more of a chance that probably the place was being used to store drugs too."
1992.92-6073,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3329.511,3336.895,"So, the more lenient Congress is with respect to the mental element, scienter, the more it is criminal?"
1992.92-6073,2,39592,richard_l_johnson,,3336.895,3339.579,--I don't think I'm saying that.
1992.92-6073,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3340.478,3349.874,"Well, I thought you said that if the statute provides that lack of scienter is a defense, then that tends to make it a criminal statute."
1992.92-6073,2,39592,richard_l_johnson,,3350.915,3351.496,"--Yes, that's true."
1992.92-6073,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3353.096,3358.569,"So, the more lenient Congress is with respect to the party involved, the more it's criminal rather than civil."
1992.92-6073,2,39592,richard_l_johnson,,3360.51,3374.471,"--Well, one of the factors of whether or not it's punishment is whether or not scienter is involved, and that... in this particular case, if you are an innocent owner, then that is a defense to the civil forfeiture."
1992.92-6073,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3395.585,3396.714,"Thank you, Mr. Johnson."
