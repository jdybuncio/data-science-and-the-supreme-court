1971.70-63,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,15.883,"We will hear arguments next in No. 63, National Labor Relations Board against the Plasters’ Union, No. 65, Texas State Tile & Terrazzo Company against the Plasters’ Union."
1971.70-63,0,37058,norton_j_come,,24.305,28.111,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,672.933,679.151,"What is the language you just quoted, you are putting from what, the CBS opinion in this Court or the Court of Appeals opinion in this case?"
1971.70-63,0,37058,norton_j_come,,679.151,687.872,"I am quoting from the Court of Appeals opinion, Justice Stewart at record 375."
1971.70-63,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,687.872,691.998,"That is attached to your brief too, is it not, in the appendix?"
1971.70-63,0,37058,norton_j_come,,691.998,708.173,"It is in the yellow of the above appendix, 375."
1971.70-63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,708.173,710.304,The Court was relying on --
1971.70-63,0,37058,norton_j_come,,710.304,710.947,The court was --
1971.70-63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,710.947,713.842,Dictum in this Court in the CBS case?
1971.70-63,0,37058,norton_j_come,,713.842,715.55,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-63,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1076.424,1080.525,What does a 10 (k) order say by the way?
1971.70-63,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1088.636,1122.933,"No, let us look at the one here which is set forth on the page 54 of the appendix and the board says, “Para layers employed by Texas States and Martini Tile who are represented by the Tile Setters are entitled to perform the work of applying the coat of Portland cement."
1971.70-63,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1130.687,1140.035,Was that the kind of an order that the unless clause (D) talks about?
1971.70-63,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1146.659,1155.22,"Yes, the board -- the general counsel and the board have so interpreted that as applying to a --"
1971.70-63,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1155.22,1155.975,To a 10 (k) order?
1971.70-63,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1155.975,1158.246,"To a 10 (k) order, yes Your Honor."
1971.70-63,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1158.246,1167.022,Because they are really saying that here is some work to be done and the bargaining representative for that work is a certain Union?
1971.70-63,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1168.63,1179.536,"Well, a 10 (k) order does not run to a particular Union because otherwise you get into trouble with the 8 (b) (2) and 8 (a) (3), Your Honor."
1971.70-63,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1189.081,1196.522,"There is nobody in this case disputes that, that unless clause indeed refers to a 10 (k) --"
1971.70-63,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1196.522,1198.901,Not to my knowledge.
1971.70-63,1,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1601.198,1605.514,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1687.875,1696.988,(Inaudible) to no unfair labor practice complaint to be filed and no 10 (k) proceeding could be started?
1971.70-63,1,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1696.988,1697.571,That is right.
1971.70-63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1701.881,1704.763,Let us assume the picketing does occur --
1971.70-63,1,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1704.763,1704.959,Well --
1971.70-63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1704.959,1705.723,And the --
1971.70-63,1,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1705.723,1710.365,I think the question is why does a picketing start?
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,2454.894,2461.062,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-63,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2529.568,2543.042,"Well is it not correct that the Courts have historically allowed the board that is presumed of expert experience, wide latitude in dealing with the practical aspects of these things?"
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,2543.042,2563.074,"I think Mr. Chief Justice, the Courts have allowed the board wide latitude in dealing with practicalities but I think what we are dealing with here is policy, a policy that Congress set down in Section 10 (k) and therefore, the board does not have the latitude it would, if it was simply applying a mechanical doctrine."
1971.70-63,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2563.074,2579.481,"Well, as a practical then I take it you disagree with the statement of the Court of Appeals, that the employer is just an innocent bystander who does not care one way or the other, about the outcome of the jurisdictional dispute?"
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,2579.481,2601.883,"No, I agree with that statement because I believe, what Judge Leventhal was stating there, is what the legislative history reflects and that is, that this section of the Act and as this Court has said, in fact, the whole dominant theme throughout Section 8(b), 8 (b) (4) is to protect neutral employers."
1971.70-63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2682.178,2685.829,"But in this case, the Plasters were not working that at all?"
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,2685.829,2690.659,"Oh Yes, Justice Marshall, the Plasters were working there for a plastering contractor."
1971.70-63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2691.918,2693.469,They are on that job?
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,2693.469,2702.55,They were the ones who put the scratch coat which is the preliminary coat on the wall at to which the Tile Setters came and put their float coat on.
1971.70-63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2702.55,2706.321,They were regular employees of the contractor?
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,2706.321,2713.898,"Well, now, they were not regular employees of the Tile Setting contractor, they were regular employees of the Plastering contractor who also had a --"
1971.70-63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2713.898,2715.167,(Voice Overlap)
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,2715.167,2717.477,"Yes, who also had a sub --"
1971.70-63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2717.477,2720.661,They were not employees of the Tile sub-contractor?
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,2720.661,2721.424,No sir.
1971.70-63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2723.069,2728.436,"So, would not the sub-contractor have an interest in protecting his own employees?"
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,2728.436,2729.262,"Yes sir, he has --"
1971.70-63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2729.262,2732.717,Then he is in outside the office?
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,2732.717,2734.524,He has the interest but Congress set --
1971.70-63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2734.524,2736.373,But it is not sufficient you say?
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,2736.373,2743.987,"No, I say, the Congress said in the 10 (k) proceeding, that is not were his interest was going to be protected."
1971.70-63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2765.988,2777.58,"Well, I just think realistically, that an employer would -- the last thing he would want would be one more union to deal with, am I right?"
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,2777.58,2782.284,"That may very well be the case, yes, but that is not the interest that Congress should be protected."
1971.70-63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2782.284,2783.612,Why?
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,2783.612,2794.997,"Because you see Justice Marshall, if Congress had wanted to give him that sort of protection, they would have drafted 10 (k), so that he was bound by the decision."
1971.70-63,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3090.695,3094.347,It does not say that is the only thing it is.
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3106.204,3118.733,"I believe Mr. Chief Justice that the way that it is written, referring specifically to the clause in Section 10 (k) that he is clearly talking about the use of the term in 10 (k)."
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3626.046,3635.926,"The board (Inaudible) employer though that even if it settled the 10 (k), even if the board’s power is upheld in this case?"
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3635.926,3655.34,"That is precisely one of our main arguments in support of our position that the board is not turning out its duty, simply for that reason that the board cannot force the employer to do anything and this employer can ignore the voluntary procedure that the two unions have entered into."
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3661.039,3666.916,It would not be a problem here as one of the unions would obey the joint board?
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3666.916,3674.681,"Mr. Justice White, the policy or the rule that the board is following here is discouraging unions."
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3678.32,3684.677,"Is not that correct that if the Tile Setters would disclaim the work, the whole proceeding would be aborted?"
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3684.677,3686.443,"Under the board Safeway doctrine, yes sir."
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3686.58,3688.63,"Well, then why does not the Tile Setters do it?"
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3688.63,3692.825,Because of the policy that the NLRB is following that we are trying to get reversed in this case.
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3692.825,3701.109,"I know, but the Tile Setters, what they are saying is that we did have a voluntary way of settling our dispute through the Joint Board, but we just would not comply."
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3701.109,3708.344,They said that they would not comply because the employer is not bound and that we know that if the employer is not bound the NLRB --
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3708.344,3713.908,"I do not care for whatever reason that is, that the employers never bound, whether there is a hearing or not?"
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3713.908,3714.155,Well --
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3714.155,3717.564,"And that so, I do not know what kind of an argument that is?"
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3717.564,3719.764,The argument runs like this.
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3730.684,3731.031,Then the --
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3731.031,3731.461,So we --
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3731.461,3733.198,The employers still would not be bound?
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3733.198,3735.693,"No, but we have a second bite at the apple."
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3735.693,3742.683,"(Voice Overlap)Nevertheless, the union is not complying with the Joint Board determination?"
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3742.683,3743.639,Absolutely!
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3743.639,3752.741,"And they -- if it did and disclaimed, there would be no 8 (b) (4) (D) and no 10 (k) proceeding?"
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3752.741,3753.925,That is correct.
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3753.925,3770.164,"Now, so what we really have here is a situation, where not only the employer has not agreed to the settlement, but one of the unions has done."
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3770.164,3771.335,Only as a result --
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3771.335,3782.262,"Well, (Voice Overlap) if one of the unions, that the Tile Setters really would comply with the Joint Board determination --"
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3782.262,3782.499,Yes sir.
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3782.499,3784.396,There would be no dispute here.
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3784.396,3784.561,That is right.
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3784.561,3796.731,"The fact is, that they will not disclaim, they are still claiming the work and so they are -- there just is not any voluntary adjustment yet, even between the unions."
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3796.731,3797.542,No sir.
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3806.461,3810.228,"But they are refusing to comply, and they are still claiming the work?"
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3810.228,3813.34,"Yes sir, but I think it goes somewhat in the circle."
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3826.332,3828.171,"There would, oh yes, there would still be."
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3836.041,3839.409,Not if they lost as they did before the Joint Board.
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3841.628,3843.063,Why could not they?
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3843.063,3849.621,"Because the NLRB would then seek an injunction against them, presuming a charge is filed against them."
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3855.168,3857.714,What would be their unfair labor practice?
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3857.714,3862.45,Striking to force a change in the assignment of work contrary to a board order.
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3862.45,3864.121,"Well, it would not be contrary to a board order?"
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3864.121,3867.769,"Yes, because the board order was the Plasters."
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3868.539,3877.937,"I do not mean -- I mean the Joint Board, let us assume the Joint Board gave it to the Plasters, right?"
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3877.937,3878.873,Yes sir.
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3878.873,3881.159,"Now, the Tile Setters did not comply."
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3881.159,3882.48,That is correct.
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3882.48,3888.502,"Now, if the board gives it to the Plasters --"
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3888.502,3889.587,The NLRB.
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3889.587,3890.191,The NLRB?
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3890.191,3890.525,Yes.
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3890.525,3895.076,"Gives it to the Plasters, then the Tile Setters are bound?"
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3895.076,3899.408,"Yes, they are bound in the sense that if they strike."
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3899.408,3901.279,They would be on an 8 (b) (4) --
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3901.279,3901.535,Right!
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3901.535,3902.061,8 (b) (4) (D).
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3902.061,3904.757,"Yes sir, that is correct."
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3932.307,3945.476,"Really, what you are saying is that of course for this proviso to be applicable, you have to assume there is been a settlement or a message for settlement."
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3945.476,3947.539,You mean the abstention provision?
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3947.539,3948.15,Yes.
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3948.15,3950.541,"Now, the abstention provision comes into a fact if (Voice Overlap)"
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3950.541,3957.616,"Well, the board with satisfactory evidence that they have adjusted or agreed upon method for a voluntary adjustment to the dispute."
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3957.616,3958.067,That is right.
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3986.134,3998.471,But you are saying what the board must do is to recognize the fact that there has been a voluntary adjustment here in a sense that if the Joint Board has determined the dispute.
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,3998.471,3999.074,Yes sir.
1971.70-63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3999.517,4005.611,And that the board must recognize that one union is bound by it.
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,4006.494,4007.174,Yes.
1971.70-63,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4009.335,4012.78,"Well, I gather they are not bound (Inaudible)"
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,4012.78,4015.805,"Well, both unions are affiliates to the building, infrastructure trades --"
1971.70-63,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4015.805,4017.639,"Alright, but what is important?"
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,4026.384,4026.972,That is correct.
1971.70-63,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4026.972,4030.739,And the disputes have been submitted to the Joint Board and just decide it --
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,4030.739,4031.046,Yes.
1971.70-63,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4031.046,4034.017,-- and the looser refused to be bound.
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,4035.18,4035.509,He refuses --
1971.70-63,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4035.509,4036.579,Is that satisfying?
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,4036.579,4037.293,He refuses to --
1971.70-63,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4037.293,4039.278,But what are the reason he does?
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,4044.466,4045.143,"Yes sir, it is."
1971.70-63,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4049.979,4052.265,Then it is very effective then is it not (Voice Overlap).
1971.70-63,2,20675,donald_j_capuano,,4052.265,4090.577,"It would be affective but for the rule of the board in this case Mr. Chief Justice because then there would simply be no reason for a union not to comply because it knew it was not going to get a second bite at the apple with the NLRB and with the record of the NLRB, we submit that the losing union before the voluntary procedure, many times is encouraged to seek the second hearing, before the NLRB where perhaps the employer's for reference would be held valid."
1971.70-63,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4093.204,4099.12,"Thank you, Mr. Capuano."
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4100.362,4104.058,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4113.749,4115.424,It is always easy to say that as it was.[Laughter]
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4115.424,4116.374,Yes.
1971.70-63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4118.787,4120.435,You thought you would not feel better --
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4120.435,4128.582,"Well, there are times of Mr. Justice Brennan, when an advocate is upset about the way he has won below."
1971.70-63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4165.832,4169.22,All which overrides (Inaudible)
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4169.22,4172.134,"We do believe so, 13 years --"
1971.70-63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4172.134,4174.064,That is the fact that --
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4174.064,4176.249,"Well, it is been 10 years."
1971.70-63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4188.848,4189.991,What case was that?
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4189.991,4194.884,CBS sir.
1971.70-63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4194.884,4211.961,"What is your view of why this abstention provision is triggered here where a union has apparently agreed upon a method for settlement, but then repudiates it is entire undertaking and still insists on having the work?"
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4211.961,4212.803,"Well, what we --"
1971.70-63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4212.803,4228.283,"Why then, is this abstention provision triggered when not even one of the unions or once -- one of the unions has been agreed on the affect?"
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4228.283,4235.069,"As we read the statute Mr. Justice White and the language is on page 3 of the board's brief, I guess that is what we have all been referring to."
1971.70-63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4235.069,4236.734,Yes.
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4236.734,4250.467,"The board is instructed to the differ when it receives satisfactory evidence that they, the parties have adjusted or agreed upon methods for voluntary adjustment of the dispute."
1971.70-63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4261.598,4270.786,I agree but apparently one of the unions is not only repudiated this agreement to abide by the adjustment but they had repudiated the method of adjustment?
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4270.786,4273.314,"Well, if no, they have not repudiated the method."
1971.70-63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4283.486,4291.757,"But we were still going to claim the work regardless of the method that we previously agreed on, which seems to me a repudiation of the entire procedure?"
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4291.757,4305.119,"Well, I do not think so because it maybe repudiation but it is one that is correctable in light of -- we believe in light of Section 301 which applies to agreements between the unions."
1971.70-63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4306.041,4314.398,You mean the Joint Board determination pursuant to the agreement to submit to the Joint Board would be enforceable (Inaudible)
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4314.398,4316.311,"Yes, I believe, so it is an arbitrary award."
1971.70-63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4319.247,4321.508,Then is that (Inaudible) an agreement?
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4321.508,4322.301,"Yes, there are."
1971.70-63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4323.046,4324.756,An agreement between two unions?
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4324.756,4335.635,"Yes, there are, there are decisions holding that agreements between unions to submit this type of dispute to arbitration or an enforceable --"
1971.70-63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4335.635,4347.116,"Why is not that kind of an issue then -- why is not that kind of an issue I thought for one, for the court enforcement?"
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4348.898,4349.018,Well there are --
1971.70-63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4349.018,4354.106,I mean the end result of such an enforcement proceeding to be a disclaimer?
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4354.106,4369.427,"Well, it would be but then you have problems of -- well, it would be, it would be a judicially required disclaimer, but what you have Is as long as the board continues on its policy of not recognizing the award, you have a practical point."
1971.70-63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4381.69,4387.608,"Tell me, if the union has prevailed may result to be awarded."
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4393.411,4394.118,Yes.
1971.70-63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4397.034,4399.538,"In this instance, only the Plasters --"
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4399.538,4399.921,That is correct.
1971.70-63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4401.701,4403.222,Then the employer could.
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4403.222,4403.599,No.
1971.70-63,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4534.818,4536.755,"That of course is the question before us, is it not?"
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4536.755,4550.75,"Well, we believe as I said, Mr. Capuano has tried to spell out our affirmative arguments and as I say, we think they have also been spelled out fully by the Court below."
1971.70-63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4630.857,4641.561,"Mr. Gold, I gather your whole argument really comes down before (Inaudible) that in this case, there was a method --"
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4641.561,4641.969,Yes sir.
1971.70-63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4641.969,4647.567,-- and that is if there exists an agreed upon method that in this case?
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4647.567,4648.219,Yes.
1971.70-63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4648.219,4656.735,"That is whether or not the method is in fact employed, both setup should employed it all?"
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4656.735,4658.662,"No, I think that the parties have to --"
1971.70-63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4658.662,4660.863,"They at least have to employ, is that it?"
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4660.863,4661.132,Yes.
1971.70-63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4665.44,4668.652,"As had agreed upon method, but it must be at least employed by this?"
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4668.652,4668.879,Yes.
1971.70-63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4673.065,4677.828,"Yes, but do you stop should, that is as far as (Inaudible)."
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4690.545,4698.642,"Right, because at that point, there is a method of assuring the statute provides method."
1971.70-63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4714.22,4744.36,"The board's answer is that there is another party, but the employer, but if the board, even if the employer is a party, dismisses the proceeding, when there is a disclaimer, I would think you would say, or what you do, I take it that when there is a binding method agreed upon, the board should recognize that it is binding on the parties, and it should be therefore, given to a disclaimer."
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4744.36,4744.835,Right.
1971.70-63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4747.711,4749.829,I mean even if the employer is a party?
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4749.829,4750.317,Right.
1971.70-63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4769.099,4777.233,And then you wind up by saying that it is not to the board that would assist order to bring the repudiating union in line.
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4779.33,4779.836,Correct!
1971.70-63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4779.836,4782.806,Under 301 or I take it a state proceeding?
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4782.806,4816.203,"Well, I would think it would be 301, but I would point out that the board plays as a rule and they admitted in footnote 21, what happens is, if you have a repudiating union, that union cannot utilize economic force because the board treats its order dismissing the proceeding or quashing the hearing as a board order and treats the loosing union as if it is lost before it, and if that losing union ever tries to use economic force, it will get a 10 (l) injunction against it."
1971.70-63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4816.203,4818.465,It will have to be a new proceeding?
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4818.465,4819.193,No.
1971.70-63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4824.374,4825.255,Arbitrary?
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4825.255,4825.866,Yes.
1971.70-63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4825.866,4826.259,But why?
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4835.257,4877.93,"Well, as I say, the board takes the position because I think and I think it has to because the whole purpose of the statute would be undermined that the dismissal is the equivalent of an order and that somebody who -- a union which strikes after a dismissal on the ground that there has been a settlement, is striking contrary to a board order because the whole purpose as Senator Morse explained as we note in the introductory section of our brief, the whole problem here have prior to 10 (k) was it they were meant union method of settlement which Congress wanted to encourage but which did not work where the -- where a union had a great deal to lose."
1971.70-63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4883.683,4886.151,Had there ever been a 301 proceeding on board's (Inaudible)?
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4886.151,4889.923,"There are some 301 proceedings pending as I, as --"
1971.70-63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4889.923,4895.301,Everyone and anyone come (Inaudible)
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4895.301,4897.265,I am not aware that any has come to decision.
1971.70-63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4964.6,4978.264,"But when there is a disclaimer and the Safeway doctrine is applicable and the proceeding is dismissed, is that dismissal order the -- would the dismissal order be a basis for a charge?"
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4978.264,4979.053,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4979.053,4981.177,If the Union repudiated the disclaimer?
1971.70-63,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4981.177,4982.117,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-63,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5014.909,5019.227,Thank you Mr. Gold.
1971.70-63,4,37058,norton_j_come,,5029.829,5071.211,"I think that when all that is said on the other side, we come back to what in our view is really the simple question here, namely whether or not in view of the vital interest that the employer has in the resolution of a jurisdictional dispute plus the fact that Congress was interested in having these disputes settled in the public interest."
1971.70-63,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5125.651,5127.913,(Inaudible) is not binding on employer?
1971.70-63,4,37058,norton_j_come,,5127.913,5148.697,"Well, it is binding in all -- for all practical purposes because the employer is not at all going to a stand up under the economic pressure of a picket line or a strike."
1971.70-63,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5154.831,5161.922,"Do you agree Mr. Come, was the Joint Board award since it goes vested on principle on the filling?"
1971.70-63,4,37058,norton_j_come,,5161.922,5164.492,"I think that, that is an open question, Your Honor."
1971.70-63,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5200.057,5203.54,What I am suggesting is that the court (Inaudible)
1971.70-63,4,37058,norton_j_come,,5203.54,5203.907,Well –
1971.70-63,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5203.907,5205.691,It does say that the (Inaudible).
1971.70-63,4,37058,norton_j_come,,5205.691,5207.193,"No, that is correct Your Honor, but –"
1971.70-63,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5207.193,5210.499,"As intended but they also thought of remedies, I suppose?"
1971.70-63,4,37058,norton_j_come,,5210.499,5226.752,"Well, I think that is the basic problem and I think that you do not get an answer to this from the legislative history because as is often the case, the problem that comes up is one that was not directly focused on."
1971.70-63,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5283.431,5289.618,"I could not agree with you more, but the Congress legislated otherwise, I suppose that the Congress could put it in order?"
1971.70-63,4,37058,norton_j_come,,5289.618,5303.135,That is correct Your Honor but as I say one of the tools that we believe has to be brought to bear here is the economic realities of the situation which we submit Congress could not have been blind to.
1971.70-63,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5303.718,5319.2,"So your basic argument, at least at the superficial level of a semantic statutory construction is simply that party, the parties to such dispute includes or may include the employer?"
1971.70-63,4,37058,norton_j_come,,5319.2,5319.812,That is correct.
1971.70-63,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5319.812,5322.685,"And the Congress did legislate, just the way you said it?"
1971.70-63,4,37058,norton_j_come,,5322.685,5335.452,"That is correct and that is even if you interpret dispute as the court below interpreted, it is not central to our argument that dispute has to be the dispute over the jurisdictional strike."
1971.70-63,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5349.936,5350.839,Thank you Mr. Come.
