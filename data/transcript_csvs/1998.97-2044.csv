1998.97-2044,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.987,"We'll hear argument first in No. 97-2044, United States v. Haggar Apparel Company."
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,9.106,11.891,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-2044,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,93.426,98.18,"Well, is... are these supposed to be interpretive regulations or legislative regulations?"
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,98.18,102.048,These are... the regulations that are at issue in this case are interpretive regulations.
1998.97-2044,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,102.048,106.749,"All right, then if that's the case, then what they have is the power to persuade but not the power to control."
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,106.749,107.701,Absolutely.
1998.97-2044,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,108.784,109.117,All right.
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,112.069,118.057,"--The question that the Federal circuit resolved was a different question, incorrectly in our view."
1998.97-2044,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,132.732,140.505,"Well, I mean, you'd think... if... if it's an interpretive regulation and therefore it has the legal force that... whatever is given to the power to persuade, though not the power to control."
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,154.83,177.111,"Well, if... if by the expert body you're referring to you're referring to the Court of International Trade, the Court of International Trade is a specialized court just like the Tax Court, and the Tax Court, just like the Court of International Trade, has been directed by this Court in decisions such as National Muffler Dealers and for the Court of International Trade in the Zenith Radio case to defer to the agency's reasonable interpretation."
1998.97-2044,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,177.111,185.217,"Mr. Jones, did you agree with the premise that... that for interpretive regulations, we accord the agency only the power to persuade and not to control?"
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,186.217,186.533,I--
1998.97-2044,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,186.533,190.252,--the power to control so long as it was... it's within the range of the ambiguity.
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,196.339,196.739,--No.
1998.97-2044,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,203.66,205.195,"--Bicker, because I think--"
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,205.195,205.645,--All right.
1998.97-2044,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,205.645,206.245,--it's crucial to this.
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,209.731,216.051,"Well, it is crucial to the disposition of the case ultimately that the court do what this Court said it should in Zenith Radio which is to defer to--"
1998.97-2044,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,216.051,216.8,But what is it precisely?
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,223.537,223.887,--Yes.
1998.97-2044,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,223.887,224.989,--which is not quite Chevron.
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,233.845,245.468,"You're asking a question that I think it's fair to say the Court has never answered, which is in this... there... there's a high Chevron and a low Chevron, and then there's in between that hasn't been fully elaborated by the Court."
1998.97-2044,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,299.87,305.774,"I didn't understand all that, Mr.... this is a much more difficult enterprise than I had ever imagined."
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,307.141,310.326,"Well, I think the Court has resisted the temptation to vulcanize--"
1998.97-2044,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.326,318.563,"I really had thought there was... I had really thought there was just one, and I thought Skidmore was pre-Chevron and speaks from an era that... that simply bygone."
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,319.08,322.3,--I may be referring to this in a more academic than a practical way.
1998.97-2044,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,353.819,367.496,"--At any rate, are you saying that the interpretive... the authority of the Treasury in this Customs area is identical to its authority in the Internal... for the Internal Revenue Code?"
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,367.496,369.013,"It... I... well, it's more than that."
1998.97-2044,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,511.704,519.524,"Mr. Jones, suppose you had a statute that said in so many words the court shall decide the question de novo."
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,519.524,523.076,If... you know--
1998.97-2044,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.076,528.111,Might not... might not the... the respondent's disposition apply in that situation?
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,528.111,535.466,"--Well, no, and... and certainly I want to address that, but I also want to point out that they cited a Law Review article authored by you for that proposition."
1998.97-2044,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,560.915,565.836,"Well, Zenith Radio... they talked about administrative practice, as I recall."
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,565.836,567.771,There were Treasury decisions.
1998.97-2044,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,567.771,571.807,And... and this... that's somewhat different than an interpretive regulation.
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,571.807,573.057,It's a lesser--
1998.97-2044,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,573.057,575.509,It may be... it may be that this is an even stronger case--
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,575.509,575.992,--Yes.
1998.97-2044,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,575.992,577.46,"--I assume that you would argue, but there is a difference."
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,577.46,586.916,"Yes, and the difference would be, as you pointed out, to suggest even greater deference would be owed to the agency's formal interpretation set forth in an interpretive rule."
1998.97-2044,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,593.922,595.255,Can I ask you one quick question about that?
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,623.607,624.491,The... the--
1998.97-2044,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,624.491,627.559,"--customs as it does in the law, say, income tax?"
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,627.559,631.261,"--Well, there's two... two types of... of law... two ways to answer that."
1998.97-2044,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,652.759,661.329,"But as a matter of practical fact, is there like a whole section of people in the Treasury whose job it is to look over the customs and tariff laws and to propose--"
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,661.329,661.781,"Well, there's the customs--"
1998.97-2044,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,661.781,662.781,--changes and do all these things?
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,664.9,665.316,"--Oh, of course."
1998.97-2044,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,667.466,667.852,Right.
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,667.852,669.602,"In the customs area, there's the Customs Service."
1998.97-2044,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,669.602,676.506,And do they do roughly the same thing in respect to evaluating substance of laws and what the proposals are and so forth or not?
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,678.058,681.593,You're asking a question that I think might be beyond my ability to answer.
1998.97-2044,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,681.593,682.81,--Maybe we should take evidence on this.
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,689.113,690.615,I think what makes a difference is--
1998.97-2044,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,690.615,693.983,Do you want us to give more deference if the agency is intimately involved?
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,693.983,701.221,"--I just want the Court to... to repeat what it held in Zenith Radio, which is that the standard amount of deference is owed to these regulations that are--"
1998.97-2044,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,701.221,711.577,"Mr. Jones, do we also owe deference in this area to interpretations by the U. S. Trade Representative or by the International Trade Commission?"
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,711.577,712.06,--No.
1998.97-2044,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,749.368,752.82,"So, if we don't defer no these regs, we don't defer to anything, or our Court doesn't defer."
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,752.82,753.237,It--
1998.97-2044,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,753.237,754.037,There's nothing else to defer to.
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,754.037,760.158,"--I can't... it's hard for me to come to grips with such a broad proposition, but certainly--"
1998.97-2044,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,760.158,763.86,"Well, I don't know what other sources there would be if it wasn't the commission or the trade rep."
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,763.86,772.048,--There... there is no other source of interpretive authority under the Tariff Act other than the Treasury acting through the Customs Service.
1998.97-2044,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,790.927,803.151,"Mr. Jones, on Zenith Radio, I think that the respondent has said, well, that's for countervailing tariff and it has nothing to do with classification."
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,803.151,808.52,Respondent has done a good job of... of fairly confusing something that's really very clear.
1998.97-2044,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,870.427,878.331,Would you... would you comment on the... on the final clause of the introductory provision of the regulation which says nothing is--
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,878.331,878.714,Yes.
1998.97-2044,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,878.714,883.985,--intended to deprive the importer of the rights of judicial review?
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,883.985,884.468,Right.
1998.97-2044,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,884.468,886.603,Do you... under your view is that just surplusage?
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,886.603,890.555,"Well, I think it's more... it's sort of polite surplusage."
1998.97-2044,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,937.002,939.321,Most of the FCC's rules are interpretive rules.
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,940.154,940.921,It's very common--
1998.97-2044,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,940.921,941.939,--Are they Chevron III?
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,950.129,950.545,"--Oh, I--"
1998.97-2044,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,950.545,953.581,--that we give greater deference to legislative rules than interpretive rules.
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,953.581,969.007,"--I think, Justice Scalia, that if you look at the Chevron... the... the paragraph in Chevron that talks ultimately about reasonable agency rules, a couple of sentences earlier you'll see a standard, a sentence talking about deferring when it's not arbitrary and capricious."
1998.97-2044,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,979.229,981.148,One paragraph in the Court's opinion in Chevron?
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,981.148,985.016,"--Well, it... it reflects decades of opinions."
1998.97-2044,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,985.016,994.039,This is a... this is a major distinction in administrative law that... that... that we are going to give lesser deference to those rules of an agency that are interpretive rules.
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,995.772,998.541,"Well, if... if I'm wrong about that, then--"
1998.97-2044,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,998.541,1004.445,"--To my mind, the force of the FCC rules, which are almost entirely interpretive, is... is... is no less than the force of--"
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1004.445,1011.099,"--It is a different articulation of the degree of deference, whether as a practical matter, as I said earlier, it results in different decisions--"
1998.97-2044,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1011.099,1016.252,"--Well, if it doesn't result in different decisions as a practical matter, why... you know, why confuse us with it?"
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1016.252,1030.826,"--I think because it is in fact a very complex subject, that when Congress tells an agency to do something, it may be... and it does it, maybe that has a little more legislative effect than when the agency is just interpreting something without any legislative direction."
1998.97-2044,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1030.826,1031.462,Do you think--
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1056.208,1073.503,Let me make clear that I... this case does not turn on this distinction because all we're saying is that what we... all that I'm saying and I believe that the United States is saying is that... is that we believe that what is... what I've described as the lower Chevron deference standard applies in this case.
1998.97-2044,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1083.609,1083.859,"Okay, but you--"
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1093.065,1096.084,I'm relying on that assumption.
1998.97-2044,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1103.772,1105.641,How about... how about the answer to my question?
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1121.234,1130.423,I think that there is a logical and substantive difference between the two formulations.
1998.97-2044,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1130.423,1132.373,Which is what?
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1132.373,1155.789,"Which is that when Congress has given an agency an express authority to interpret a specific statutory phrase... for example, an agency might be told to decide what... what kind of chemicals are bad pollutants, and when it does that, its determination is going to be upheld unless it's arbitrary and capricious and it's utterly unsupported by the statute."
1998.97-2044,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1172.333,1176.035,An unreasonable interpretation should be sustained in the other situation.
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1176.551,1178.237,--I... I can't draw that distinction.
1998.97-2044,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1178.237,1178.537,I can't either.
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1180.52,1185.024,I think that the distinction is not on whether another one could be unreasonably sustained.
1998.97-2044,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1192.261,1193.761,If I could--
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1197.379,1198.498,Please do.
1998.97-2044,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1198.498,1202.033,You don't have to answer if you want to make a different point.
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1213.257,1213.724,Yes.
1998.97-2044,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1213.724,1221.78,"And... and so, does this reg mean that if you have two pairs of trousers, company A puts chemicals in it and company B doesn't."
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1233.938,1243.694,"If... if one... I don't want to be tautological because I don't think there is a simple tautological answer, but the tautological point is that if the permapressing occurs in the foreign country--"
1998.97-2044,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1243.694,1245.16,What is just what I said.
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1256.134,1263.523,"--Yes, there is a difference because in... in your hypothetical the... the material that was permapressed was improved."
1998.97-2044,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1265.307,1265.807,All right.
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1267.659,1268.075,--Yes.
1998.97-2044,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1268.075,1275.415,"Because how can it be that... that... that when you do exactly identical things to the two pairs of trousers, all you did was put them in a press and you pressed them like that--"
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1275.415,1281.235,"Because the regulation addresses the statutory issue, and so let me put the issue in the... in the context of the statute."
1998.97-2044,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1396.11,1396.36,--But what about the split that's involved?
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1402.93,1407.232,"Well, all of the permapressing operation for this purpose is done in Mexico."
1998.97-2044,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1407.232,1407.716,But the--
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1407.716,1408.084,Let me answer that.
1998.97-2044,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1411.036,1414.088,"--The chemical process occurred in the United States, didn't it?"
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1414.088,1430.747,"--Well, the chemical spraying of the fabric occurred in the United States, but the permapressing, as described on page 20 of the joint appendix in the complaint is... is obtained when... and I'm quoting the complaint... the heat of the oven expels a molecule of water from the pre-polymer in the fabric, which cross-links the cellulose fibers."
1998.97-2044,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1444.091,1446.959,The statute allows painting--
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1446.959,1447.426,Yes.
1998.97-2044,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1447.426,1448.393,--and calls it incidental.
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1452.197,1455.149,"Well, again in saying that paint--"
1998.97-2044,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1455.149,1455.715,"I don't know what I'm supposed to know about this, but--"
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1455.715,1461.052,"--in saying that painting can be incidental to the assembly process, the history makes clear that it's painting of a minor nature."
1998.97-2044,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1478.93,1483.382,"--Of course, this... this current issue... is that an issue of the validity of the regulation?"
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1483.382,1483.732,No.
1998.97-2044,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1483.732,1485.751,Or is that an issue of the application of the regulation--
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1485.751,1486.351,It is--
1998.97-2044,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1486.351,1486.951,--to these facts?
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1486.951,1496.357,"--It is... it is the latter, and... and we think that the facts clearly reflect that the regulation should properly be applied in this case, but in fairness, the court has not--"
1998.97-2044,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1496.357,1497.357,That's not the... is that the issue that we have?
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1497.357,1500.224,--It is the ultimate issue that the courts have.
1998.97-2044,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1511.366,1515.901,"Why... why is... I mean, the chemical... it says chemical, treatment of permapressing."
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1515.901,1516.284,Yes.
1998.97-2044,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1516.284,1523.34,"It doesn't say anything in the reg about the chemical treatment taking place in Mexico, but it does use the example of permapressing."
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1523.34,1523.756,"Well, it--"
1998.97-2044,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1523.756,1529.042,"So, your interpretation, which is Treasury's interpretation, is a general interpretation of the reg."
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1529.042,1529.51,--Yes.
1998.97-2044,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1529.51,1531.627,If the permapressing... it isn't this case.
1998.97-2044,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1532.962,1533.646,True.
1998.97-2044,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1546.669,1548.205,"Very well, Mr. Jones."
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1549.688,1553.025,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-2044,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1634.811,1641.298,"But, Mr. Phillips, an agency certainly doesn't have to go through notice and comment rulemaking in order to bind it's own people."
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1642.781,1656.725,"It does need to go through comment and notice rulemaking when it adopts a regulation pursuant to headnote 11 which provides the procedures with regard to the admission, okay, that's applicable to this particular kind of case."
1998.97-2044,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1699.151,1701.234,"Well, where do we find these, Mr. Phillips?"
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1701.234,1702.686,"--I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.97-2044,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1717.862,1721.331,"Well, the Government is not trying to foreclose judicial review."
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1721.331,1730.503,"Well, the notion that what this regulation is really talking about is simply to prevent all judicial review is... is inconsistent with the nature of the comments that were made."
1998.97-2044,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1752.535,1755.82,It certainly is clumsily put if that's what they... that's what they had in mind.
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1755.82,1766.193,"Well, but the... the other alternative interpretation is that it's utterly superfluous, that is, that... that the IR... I mean... excuse me... that Customs decided to tell the world that it was not going to foreclose judicial review."
1998.97-2044,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1775.216,1777.401,May I... may I ask you sort of a broad question?
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1794.445,1797.231,"That is the argument that we make, yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-2044,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1798.164,1802.801,"So, the mere fact that they provide for de novo review, that's the end of the ball game for you."
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1802.801,1809.472,--I think that is the clearest evidence that Congress did not mean to have issues decided in the first instance by a particular agency.
1998.97-2044,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1817.311,1827.934,"And you don't think there could be a category of cases in which the facts would be reviewed de novo, but there would be some degree, whether low, high, intermediate, some degree of deference to the agency's view of the law."
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1827.934,1831.203,"Well, since the ultimate question really is one of... of congressional intent--"
1998.97-2044,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1831.203,1831.655,Right.
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1831.655,1840.391,--I could imagine a situation in which Congress had expressed itself in a way that it meant for the de novo review to be limited to the facts and in a way that would allow the contrary inference.
1998.97-2044,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1852.318,1879.301,"Isn't it equally clear that Congress can specify that there will be de novo review, including de novo review of rulings of law in a given case, without thereby implying anything about what would be a proper source of determining what the proper... what the correct law is, i.e., without in any way implicating that there should not be deference in... in looking to agency regulations in making the ruling for?"
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1879.301,1884.353,I don't think that's the natural inference to draw from that kind of extraordinary scope of... of judicial proceeding.
1998.97-2044,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1934.353,1938.988,"On 2a of your brief, I don't find the section that you're referring to."
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1938.988,1939.255,--I'm sorry.
1998.97-2044,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1948.361,1948.794,Thank you.
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1948.794,1949.561,I misread the 0.
1998.97-2044,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2006.078,2011.915,Why doesn't that... why doesn't that just prevent... present the kind of situation that Justice Souter alluded to?
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2037.049,2040.334,"I think that's a gross overstatement, that the agency rules are nullified."
1998.97-2044,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2058.463,2058.963,"Well, it's never entitled--"
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2058.963,2059.379,--no.
1998.97-2044,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2059.379,2062.581,"--to Chevron deference if it's inconsistent with the statute, I mean, if that's what you're saying."
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2062.581,2065.033,"No, but they... but they reviewed it in two different ways."
1998.97-2044,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2094.636,2114.198,But the situation that you describe where the importer can make entirely new arguments in the court seems to me to argue for the necessity for the uniformity that would be attained by following the... the regulations of the agency.
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2114.198,2115.8,I don't think so.
1998.97-2044,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2169.2,2170.636,Congress has to say that?
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2170.636,2171.269,Yes.
1998.97-2044,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2171.269,2173.302,Why... why would Congress have to say that?
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2177.223,2179.073,To be sure as a matter of--
1998.97-2044,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2179.073,2184.21,Are we going to have a special law in every Department that the employees of that Department shall obey the... the Secretary?
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2184.21,2186.812,"--In general, you'd hope not, Justice Scalia."
1998.97-2044,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2214.279,2214.796,Proposition.
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2241.03,2241.566,"No, that proposition is incorrect."
1998.97-2044,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2241.566,2242.082,All right.
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2244.768,2255.624,Because it is the President and the... and the... and the U.S. Trade Representative and the International Trade Commission that serve the policy making role vis-a-vis Congress and vis-a-vis the rest of the world.
1998.97-2044,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2308.091,2309.341,I... I saw that too.
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2322.332,2322.851,--Yes.
1998.97-2044,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2322.851,2328.153,"I mean, a hugely important job at that time, say, in the 19th century or earlier."
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2338.376,2339.176,You mean back in the--
1998.97-2044,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2339.176,2339.626,Yes.
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2339.626,2340.493,--in the 19th century?
1998.97-2044,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2340.493,2341.145,"Yes, 19th century."
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2341.145,2349.751,"My guess is they would have turned to the... to the Commissioner of the Port Authority of New York, as well as to the Secretary of Treasury, because these people independently seem to be acting."
1998.97-2044,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2359.107,2373.116,"On the one hand, you describe an agency that has such extraordinary independence that they have to be told to follow regulations through notice and comment, and on the other, you say they have no policy making authority."
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2409.373,2409.74,Right.
1998.97-2044,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2450.515,2452.065,Does 2638 have nothing to do with appraisals?
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2457.586,2458.102,--Right.
1998.97-2044,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2458.102,2461.24,--they do get deference when it comes to appraisals?
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2462.24,2463.006,I'll--
1998.97-2044,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2463.006,2464.525,--Setting the value of the goods.
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2464.525,2470.511,"--Well, the... there has been some lower court decisions dealing with deference under those circumstances."
1998.97-2044,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2475.38,2478.332,"So, you think the same thing goes for appraisals as for classifications."
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2478.332,2478.915,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-2044,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2567.473,2581.214,"Why... why... why is it that because there's no administrative record in the scheme we are reviewing here, that the Secretary is entitled to no deference as to the regulations?"
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2583.65,2596.14,"Well, I think it's an odd notion to say that how you take your regulation and apply it to a specific case is a decision that the courts will utterly ignore."
1998.97-2044,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2606.681,2621.358,"Well, it seems to me that this is a case where uniformity is all the more necessary and that we should, therefore, defer to the regulations as the source of law even though in the Court of International Trade there will be a de novo hearing on a new record."
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2624.81,2627.762,That would be... I would think that more persuasive.
1998.97-2044,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2665.487,2672.541,You... you just... how are the... what are Customs hearings of this sort normally about?
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2694.323,2697.125,I think it is more the latter than it is the former.
1998.97-2044,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2697.125,2699.225,"Well, do we have any... because if it's... I mean, I guess that's your argument."
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2719.354,2726.542,"Well, perhaps Mr. Jones would be in a better position to give you a broader based assessment of what Customs hearings are about, but--"
1998.97-2044,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2726.542,2737.433,"Well, isn't entirely possible that they might involve factual inquiry into things like precisely what was done in the United States and precisely what was done in Mexico--"
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2737.433,2738.699,"--Yes, I would... I would expect--"
1998.97-2044,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2738.699,2739.183,--as a factual matter.
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2746.003,2749.657,"--Oh, I'm... I'm sure there are lots of disputes that raise lots of factual questions."
1998.97-2044,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2774.772,2779.426,"Mr. Phillips, could you repeat your argument with reference to 2638 for me?"
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2793.334,2793.703,--Right.
1998.97-2044,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2793.703,2798.904,"Now, why does that have anything to do with the rules that should govern the disposition of the civil action?"
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2799.839,2812.397,"Well, what... what it says, at least to me... it seems an... illogical to say that we have a set of rules and the agency acts pursuant to those rules and makes a decision."
1998.97-2044,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2812.397,2812.914,Right.
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2812.914,2817.968,But that decision could have been based on completely the wrong... everything could be wrong about that--
1998.97-2044,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2817.968,2818.884,"Well, but they're two different decisions."
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2818.884,2819.718,--because you didn't have to raise the argument.
1998.97-2044,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2819.718,2821.086,They're two different decisions.
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2822.453,2823.02,Right.
1998.97-2044,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2823.02,2825.122,"And you say, these goods didn't come from Mexico; they came from Spain."
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2844.701,2849.169,"Well, it's... it's very much the same question Justice Kennedy asked me, and obviously I'm not being as persuasive as I'd like to be."
1998.97-2044,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2849.819,2851.871,"Indeed, you... you've persuaded me to the contrary."
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2852.721,2854.39,"--Now, I'm really unhappy."
1998.97-2044,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2855.04,2861.877,"It... it seems to me that if... if you're position is right, 2638 is inexplicable."
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2873.952,2879.356,"Oh, I think to define precisely the breadth of the... of the de novo review."
1998.97-2044,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2880.522,2880.789,--de novo.
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2882.391,2894.866,"--But... but, see, the difference is that if you go back to the... to the example that the Solicitor General points to, which is review of IRS protests, you have to identify the precise grounds and you are stuck with the precise grounds that you've identified."
1998.97-2044,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2901.602,2914.26,"But when you answered Justice Stevens' question and my question, why isn't this a preeminent case for applying at least a uniform source of law on which we can then make a de novo determination based on the facts?"
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2914.26,2918.997,"Well, there's two answers to that."
1998.97-2044,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2943.179,2949.5,"Well, but the Court of International Trade in a case like... is certainly bound to follow the decisions, say, of the Federal circuit, is it not?"
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2949.5,2951.285,"Oh, to be sure, and of this Court--"
1998.97-2044,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2951.285,2961.658,"So, de novo doesn't mean you just decide as an original proposition for yourself what the law is if other courts which are above you in the hierarchy have said differently."
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2961.658,2969.247,--That's... that's clearly the case and that's the fair inference you'd draw from the... from the statutory scheme Congress has created of... of appellate review.
1998.97-2044,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3004.92,3006.872,But what makes it so important?
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3010.907,3023.715,"--If you contrast that language, Justice Ginsburg, to the language in Zenith, the grant of authority in Zenith, you would say the same thing there, but the term, ports of entry, isn't included in the grants of authority to deal with countervailing duties."
1998.97-2044,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3031.337,3040.276,"Well, but your argument is... is also that this language is just a reflection of a long historical tradition of the distinctiveness of the Customs Service and whatnot."
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3053.334,3060.174,"--Well, it may not have been observed in part because I don't think the issue of... of deference arose... was briefed in Zenith."
1998.97-2044,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3127.132,3129.584,"Of course, in 1974 there was no Chevron then."
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3130.651,3132.317,--That's true.
1998.97-2044,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3141.423,3141.756,"Well, one question about that."
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3152.295,3175.727,"Well, they would certainly have a... a stronger argument, although I... I think the more compelling arbitrariness of this regulation arises in the different treatment of the pants that Haggar has itself because they have one set of pants that come in chemically treated from the United States that are pressed and then receive a permanent press as a consequence of that, and another pair of pants that are pressed and then baked and are both treated in the same way."
1998.97-2044,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3179.112,3188.654,"Well, that could be a question of the application of the regulation, not... not whether permapressing can't be taken out from this--"
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3188.654,3202.712,"Well, I guess it goes to the... to the validity of a... of a regulation that... that tries to use the term permapressing which is I think not a self-defining concept and one that doesn't seem to provide much help in terms of how to resolve any specific case."
1998.97-2044,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3229.862,3237.349,"--But the... one of the things about Mast, the last factor in that, seems that... that the importer would always win because it's always cheaper to do it all someplace else."
1998.97-2044,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3237.349,3255.144,"--Well, except that if the cost of the assembly process is... of the incidental parts... incidental... of the parts that aren't the assembly process are expensive, as in a case like General Motors or Chrysler, then... then you would bar it under those circumstances and you'd say it's not incidental because it's not a minor operation."
1998.97-2044,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3274.641,3276.024,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."

1998.97-2044,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3353.176,3356.794,"If we could get down to the last thing, if you have just a moment to it."
1998.97-2044,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3356.794,3357.161,Sure.
1998.97-2044,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3357.161,3364.631,The argument is in the end you are absolutely absurd to make a distinction between pressing a little longer and pressing and baking.
1998.97-2044,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3364.631,3369.601,"Well, I don't think that there are facts in this case that involve pressing a little longer."
1998.97-2044,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3441.733,3456.374,"Mr. Jones, I... I wish you could give me some... make up some explanation for the extraordinary provision in the regulation that says, you know, this... this will not deprive anyone of the right to judicial review."
1998.97-2044,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3456.374,3457.459,"Well, I think--"
1998.97-2044,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3457.459,3467.849,"Of all of the materials brought forward by... by the respondent, I really think that... that is the one that most smells like what he says this whole system is set up to do."
1998.97-2044,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3467.849,3471.919,"--If you look at the very first sentence of that paragraph in the regulation, it says, these sections--"
1998.97-2044,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3471.919,3472.585,"Where are we, Mr. Jones?"
1998.97-2044,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3472.585,3473.402,--I'm sorry.
1998.97-2044,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3484.392,3486.492,That's at page 36 of the red brief.
1998.97-2044,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3486.492,3487.111,--Thank you.
