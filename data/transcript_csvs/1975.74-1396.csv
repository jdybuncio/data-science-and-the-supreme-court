1975.74-1396,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,54.914,"We will hear arguments next in 74-1396, Michelin Tire Corp. against Wages."
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,57.626,61.755,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,118.399,124.069,And the state has taken no cross-petition from the decision adverse to it in the Supreme Court of Georgia?
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,124.069,141.127,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, except the state is not actually the party, it is the local Gwinnett County tax officials who imposed the taxes, of course, pursuant to Georgia constitutional provisions, but the State of Georgia, as such, is not a party."
1975.74-1396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,141.127,153.489,"I suppose your argument that you suggested a moment ago that the Supreme Court of Georgia’s decision is wrong because it has treated differently two things that are alike, would not necessarily win for you here."
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,159.862,185.609,"That could well be, Your Honor, but it is our position contrary to what you just said that we do think that if the result of Georgia Supreme Court decision is to accord less immunity to an unpackaged import then that accorded to a packaged import, that it is wrong because the constitutional prohibition is to command immunity for all imports, whether packaged or unpackaged."
1975.74-1396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,185.609,195.755,But you have got to make your comparison with some authoritative decision on the liability for a packaged import.
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,202.417,210.803,"Well, we submit there are numerous decisions of this Court which clearly recognized tax immunity for packaged imports, if the Court please."
1975.74-1396,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,231.022,236.294,Would these tubes fit any other tires than Michelin Tires?
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,236.294,240.926,"If Your Honor please, I do not believe that answer is in the record and I do not honestly know."
1975.74-1396,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,249.479,252.105,"Well, I take it, we are not concerned with the tubes in this case, are we?"
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,252.105,263.414,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Blackmun, except to the extent that our argument that the decision of the Georgia Court accords unequal treatment to packaged and unpackaged imports."
1975.74-1396,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,268.45,274.482,"I suppose if you lose here, your client can start packaging its tires than you have something?"
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,274.482,293.069,"Well, that would be one way under the present decision of the Georgia Supreme Court, that our client could avoid taxation by putting each tire in a separate package so long as the package was not broken and the tire would -- if the Georgia Supreme Court is to be consistent, would be immune from taxation."
1975.74-1396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,293.069,298.401,Or another way would be to separate them by style and size at the point of origin?
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,298.401,298.781,"Yes, sir."
1975.74-1396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,298.781,300.274,In Nova Scotia or France?
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,300.274,304.367,"Or France, yes sir."
1975.74-1396,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,569.542,576.392,"You are not suggesting that the journey would not be ended until they were put on an automobile, would you?"
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,576.392,577.043,No --
1975.74-1396,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,577.043,578.904,Where do you think the journey would end?
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,578.904,599.662,"The journey would end, Mr. Chief Justice, in my opinion, at the point at which the tires had reached a retail selling type operation where they were to be sold at retail for local consumption at the point of final destination."
1975.74-1396,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,599.662,610.416,Maybe that is another way that your client can avoid the taxes to ship directly to the retailer from France or Nova Scotia?
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,612.408,615.364,"I suppose it could, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1975.74-1396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,660.526,669.565,"Of course, Brown against Maryland was the tax requirement of a license on someone who sold imports, it was not a general ad valorem property?"
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,669.565,683.281,"That is correct, Your Honor, but the arguments that a general ad valorem non-discriminatory ad valorem tax is not prohibited by the Import Clause had been consistently rejected by this Court for more than 100 years."
1975.74-1396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,683.281,686.948,What do you make of the case of May against New Orleans?
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,686.948,691.468,"I think May versus New Orleans, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, was purely an original packaged case."
1975.74-1396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,706.657,711.455,You do not think then that -- do you pronounce it Gwin-nett or Gwinnett?
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,711.455,712.067,"Gwinnett, Your Honor."
1975.74-1396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,712.067,731.928,"You do not think that Gwinnett County is entitled to any sort of pro rata contribution from your client for the fire protection or the police protection that it provides for your client’s warehouse, even though it gets pro rata contributions from other people who get exactly the same services?"
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,731.928,734.266,"May I answer that in two ways, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1975.74-1396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,734.266,735.261,In as many ways as you want?
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,735.261,749.562,"I would point out, number one, that Gwinnett County does receive taxation from the Michelin Property which is the land and the buildings and the typewriters, desks, that type of property."
1975.74-1396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,791.07,792.993,I thought it said “impose or duties.”
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,793.301,798.592,"Well it does, but that has been construed to include a general ad valorem tax."
1975.74-1396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1057.839,1058.771,It did not hold that because --
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,1058.771,1060.365,-- in their original form or package.
1975.74-1396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1060.365,1070.151,It did not hold that because what it was dealing with was a license tax on who sought to solely sell imports.
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,1076.764,1094.544,"Well, I would not argue, Your Honor, that that may not have been the specific holding of Brown versus Maryland, but that certainly is the interpretation which has been placed upon that decision by this Court for almost 150 years."
1975.74-1396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1094.544,1112.659,Would you say that once an importer pays a duty exacted by the federal government no further tax burden of any sort may be placed on his sale of those goods that are imported?
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,1115.676,1130.877,"I would with one exception, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, if the article which has been imported is still held by the importer in its original form or package in which imported."
1975.74-1396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1161.443,1164.212,Where do you distinguish between wholesale and retail?
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,1167.584,1173.68,"Well, the Import Clause prohibits taxation upon any imports."
1975.74-1396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1188.99,1192.231,"Can you not say the same that retail goods, they are still flowing."
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,1194.989,1210.859,"Well sir, that argument can be made, but I think it is logical to assume that there is no further flow through once a tire or any other imported article reaches a retail outlet which is selling to local customers."
1975.74-1396,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1228.661,1241.997,"Mr. May, it is of no import, I suppose and I do not mean that as a pun either, but how much tax are we talking about here annually, roughly?"
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,1241.997,1245.682,"Your Honor, I will give my guesstimate."
1975.74-1396,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1251.851,1254.666,Same principle whether it is $300 or (Inaudible)?
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,1254.666,1255.889,"Yes, sir."
1975.74-1396,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1255.889,1257.155,Mr. May.
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,1257.155,1259.254,"Yes, sir, Mr. Justice Powell."
1975.74-1396,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1259.254,1267.497,"You are arguing your third point which as I understand it, is that the importer has the right to sell in this country."
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,1287.331,1290.159,"If Michelin were the importer, do I understand --"
1975.74-1396,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1290.159,1294.025,"If Michelin is an exporter, Michelin in France --"
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,1294.025,1294.543,"Yes, sir."
1975.74-1396,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1294.543,1301.197,"-- makes a contract to sell to a Georgia wholesaler, just take this warehouse."
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,1311.772,1331.657,"It would in my own judgment, Mr. Justice Powell, if the Georgia Corporation is deemed to be the importer because Chief Justice Marshall said the property, the thing imported, while remaining the property of the importer in his warehouse in the original form or package."
1975.74-1396,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1345.706,1350.436,"So you are saying that there must be, in those circumstances, two sales."
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,1360.766,1361.993,Yes sir.
1975.74-1396,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1361.993,1365.933,"While I have you interrupted, may I put this question."
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,1390.133,1395.268,"I think they could, Mr. Justice Powell, provided that the goods that were at the transit had stopped --"
1975.74-1396,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1395.268,1396.636,That is exactly the same?
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,1396.636,1416.445,"Yes sir, but as you are obviously aware, this Court has again for 100 years made distinctions in the cases involving interstate commerce and imports, and of course, we all know the reasons for that because the Import Clause has an absolute prohibition, whereas the Commerce Clause is nothing but the power to regulate --"
1975.74-1396,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1416.445,1419.299,"Mr. May, you put so much emphasis on retail."
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,1436.238,1441.127,"No, sir, not under the facts in this record, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1975.74-1396,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1441.127,1443.743,"Well, they are wholesalers."
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,1449.356,1450.61,"Yes, sir."
1975.74-1396,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1450.61,1452.377,So that they would not be covered?
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,1452.377,1460.619,"Well, if they were bought from that warehouse, Mr. Justice Marshall, but there is no evidence in this record that anything --"
1975.74-1396,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1460.619,1474.148,"I am not talking about this, but you keep emphasizing they are not liable until they go to retail and I am saying, could there not be a place where they could go liable and be a wholesale."
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,1475.852,1481.04,"Yes, it is conceivable, Mr. Justice Marshall, that that could be true if the correct facts existed."
1975.74-1396,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1481.04,1483.1,Right.
1975.74-1396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1483.1,1494.654,"In other words, if they were sent out from this Gwinnett County warehouse to wholesalers or in six states, your case would be the same as if they were sent to retailers?"
1975.74-1396,0,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,1495.301,1496.895,Because there are still in the flow.
1975.74-1396,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1577.955,1580.484,Very well.
1975.74-1396,1,28074,hosea_alexander_stephens_jr,,1584.048,1592.94,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1396,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1891.735,1909.826,"Does this record show whether the tires that were resting in the warehouse at the time of the arrival of the shipment were subjected to a tax, speaking of this record?"
1975.74-1396,1,28074,hosea_alexander_stephens_jr,,1912.808,1914.34,"Yes, sir."
1975.74-1396,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1914.34,1926.71,"Are those tires to which the current “imports” were added, were those tires subjected to a state tax?"
1975.74-1396,1,28074,hosea_alexander_stephens_jr,,1926.71,1927.419,"No, sir."
1975.74-1396,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1961.348,1968.619,Has your plan just begun to levy tax on these tires for the first time?
1975.74-1396,1,28074,hosea_alexander_stephens_jr,,1968.619,1981.198,"Yes sir, they were what is known as NOD assessments, and of course, as the record indicates at one point, there are approximately five other import firms located in the county."
1975.74-1396,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1994.38,2001.927,How does Gwinnett County mechanically go about levying its tax in this case?
1975.74-1396,1,28074,hosea_alexander_stephens_jr,,2006.39,2013.363,"Well, theoretically, Your Honor, all concerns are suppose like paying income taxes to voluntarily --"
1975.74-1396,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2013.363,2014.496,Self-assessment?
1975.74-1396,1,28074,hosea_alexander_stephens_jr,,2014.496,2017.21,It is a self-assessment situation.
1975.74-1396,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2031.787,2034.806,But it is as of a particular date each year?
1975.74-1396,1,28074,hosea_alexander_stephens_jr,,2034.806,2046.467,"Yes sir, January 1 of each year is the critical date for ad valorem tax purposes in Georgia."
1975.74-1396,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2259.881,2282.888,"Mr. Stephens, is this, I ask as I always do in ignorance, is the fact situation here somewhat similar to what I have seen in photographs of ships coming into Baltimore loaded with VWs on decks and they are not wrapped."
1975.74-1396,1,28074,hosea_alexander_stephens_jr,,2302.737,2304.874,I believe that is --
1975.74-1396,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2304.874,2307.984,It seems to me that this is somewhat comparable to that?
1975.74-1396,1,28074,hosea_alexander_stephens_jr,,2307.984,2316.02,"I believe that was the holding of the Volkswagen Pacific case from California, Your Honor."
1975.74-1396,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2537.092,2538.306,Do you have anything further Mr. May?
1975.74-1396,2,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,2538.306,2542.6,"Very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to make two or three quick comments."
1975.74-1396,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2554.631,2559.458,I suppose that means no more than there is always a first time to levy a tax?
1975.74-1396,2,22794,earle_b_may_jr,,2559.458,2562.277,Yes sir.
1975.74-1396,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2706.235,2706.917,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
