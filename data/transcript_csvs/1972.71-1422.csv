1972.71-1422,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,38.84,"We’ll hear arguments next in number 71-1422, Kaplan against California."
1972.71-1422,0,41299,stanley_fleishman,,39.718,45.186,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1422,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,273.273,278.528,"But this-- your client wasn’t convicted for reading something, was he?"
1972.71-1422,0,41299,stanley_fleishman,,278.528,283.685,"My client asserts the right to defend the right to read, Your Honor."
1972.71-1422,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,338.375,363.352,"Well, the-- Your-- Stanley Sy would seem, at least superficially, to uphold the right to read but Reidel on the other point, on the other hand, indicate that that does not mean that your client has the right to sell, wouldn’t it?"
1972.71-1422,0,41299,stanley_fleishman,,367.514,369.164,"No, my client is--"
1972.71-1422,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,369.164,373.823,"No, I think you have to go a little further than to assert the right to read, because your client--"
1972.71-1422,0,41299,stanley_fleishman,,373.823,374.561,I have--
1972.71-1422,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,374.561,376.261,Was not convicted for reading anything.
1972.71-1422,0,41299,stanley_fleishman,,376.261,377.297,"Your right, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1972.71-1422,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,525.353,530.337,"That means through any medium that’s available legally, doesn’t it?"
1972.71-1422,0,41299,stanley_fleishman,,530.337,537.377,"It says really “through any medium” which is through books, magazines, or through any communication as I would see it, Your Honor."
1972.71-1422,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,537.377,550.995,"Well, California is simply saying in this case that the medium, that is the store and I’m not now speaking of the book, the store operating as it was operating violates California’s laws."
1972.71-1422,0,41299,stanley_fleishman,,552.469,556.411,"It does not violate California statute, Mr. Chief Justice, because--"
1972.71-1422,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,556.411,559.273,What is California’s claim with respect to that?
1972.71-1422,0,41299,stanley_fleishman,,559.273,565.676,This-- it would violate the statute if the statute would give in the broad reach that the state has claimed for it.
1972.71-1422,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,675.308,691.006,"Mr. Fleishman, if we said in Roth that obscenity as such as not protected by the First Amendment, why need the state to show what you call a state interest in order-- if it’s dealing with what is arguably obscene."
1972.71-1422,0,41299,stanley_fleishman,,691.006,713.286,"Well-- because, Your Honor, and this really is the heart of my argument that even though obscenity is not speech and, therefore, is not protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, even so, an adult has the right to read obscenity and this right to read, even obscenity, is a fundamental personal right."
1972.71-1422,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,725.352,731.772,"Well, then you’re saying that what we said in Roth isn’t entirely correct."
1972.71-1422,0,41299,stanley_fleishman,,740.725,741.488,Not entirely.
1972.71-1422,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,788.925,792.28,Would you require every single exercise the state police power--
1972.71-1422,0,41299,stanley_fleishman,,792.28,792.411,No.
1972.71-1422,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,792.411,793.786,To be justified on that source?
1972.71-1422,0,41299,stanley_fleishman,,793.786,794.53,No.
1972.71-1422,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,794.53,806.231,Supposing the state decides to build on land that it owns a large freeway that obscures your view of the sunset from your backyard.
1972.71-1422,0,41299,stanley_fleishman,,811.071,815.1,"No, and I think this is the distinction that was drawn in Griswold."
1972.71-1422,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,902.899,905.488,"Mr. Fleishman, you got me confused again."
1972.71-1422,0,41299,stanley_fleishman,,909.923,927.485,"We are dealing with the right of petitioner to assert the right of the reader in precisely the same way, Your Honor, that Mr. Baird was given standing to assert the right of the unmarried woman who wanted to obtain a contraceptive."
1972.71-1422,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1034.32,1039.719,"Mr. Fleishman, your case stands or falls on the issue of standing, I take it."
1972.71-1422,0,41299,stanley_fleishman,,1039.719,1042.69,"That is, on this aspect of the case, that is true."
1972.71-1422,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1321.647,1332.896,"Now when you speak of variable obscenity test, am I right in understanding that you mean just to capsulize the arguments you’ve just made, is that it?"
1972.71-1422,0,41299,stanley_fleishman,,1332.896,1335.029,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1422,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1338.225,1339.385,Right.
1972.71-1422,0,41299,stanley_fleishman,,1339.385,1340.701,Exactly.
1972.71-1422,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1414.122,1420.73,"Very well, Mr. Fleishman."
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,1426.973,1432.286,"May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.71-1422,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1585.998,1598.234,Does Los Angeles have any special squad or special mechanism to keep minors and other children out of these stores?
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,1598.234,1599.9,Not for that specific purpose.
1972.71-1422,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1638.162,1646.534,Is that group specially trained for pornographic literature or in literature generally?
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,1646.534,1655.592,"Well, for the most part, there especially trained for porno-- the few that works on them would be specially trained for pornographic literature to some extent."
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1705.156,1707.114,You say that the record shows that there were complaints.
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,1708.858,1709.587,The--
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1709.587,1711.629,"What were they complaining about, I mean."
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,1711.629,1721.801,"It wasn’t gone into great detail in the record, but the people were complaining that obscene books were being sold from this bookstore."
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1723.6,1731.269,Is there any-- does the record show that these were being displayed to people who-- to passers by who--
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,1731.269,1737.19,"Well, the record only reflects that the complaint had been turned over to Sergeant Schidel."
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1741.291,1746.566,"Well, the record just doesn’t who what the complaint was about, does it?"
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,1746.566,1754.717,"He stated, as I recall, that there had been complaints from citizens that Mr. Kaplan was selling obscene books."
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1754.717,1757.705,To un-- showing of non-willing people who are offended?
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,1757.705,1761.121,"No, just selling obscene books from his store."
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1763.469,1770.126,Does the record indicate what the surrounding environment was of the store?
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,1779.284,1780.927,I think I know what you’re driving at.
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1780.927,1782.28,"No, I’m asking you a question."
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,1784.331,1786.71,"Well, the answer is yes to some extent."
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1792.596,1794.412,Minors can enter?
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,1794.412,1794.902,Cannot.
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1794.902,1795.48,Can’t.
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,1795.48,1798.147,Cannot enter the store.
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1813.475,1815.092,Were there displays?
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,1817.207,1818.021,As I recall--
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1818.021,1819.4,Were it on display?
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,1819.4,1821.314,"Inside the store, he did."
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1837.083,1847.062,Do you know where in the record this evidence appears?
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,1849.393,1852.001,I’ve gone into it in my brief and made reference to it there.
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1852.001,1853.065,"Alright, fine."
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,1853.065,1858.17,It’s not a particularly detailed area.
1972.71-1422,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1858.17,1863.734,"Well, isn’t this at pages 44 and 45?"
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,1895.026,1896.978,"No, I recall more than that."
1972.71-1422,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1896.978,1908.0,I see.
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,1909.147,1913.192,I think it was at page 38 of the transcript.
1972.71-1422,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1913.192,1921.696,"Well, that was in the Times."
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,1921.696,1941.978,"It says the purpose was to investigate citizens’ complaints regarding obscene matter being sold at that location and, later on, either board or cross examination was brought out that the complaints came to him via a City Councilman’s Office and the people had apparently complained to the City Councilman."
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2358.072,2367.83,"Now, I suppose the compelling reason is that it’s a national constitution, isn’t it?"
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2367.83,2368.257,It’s true.
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2369.821,2397.656,"And unless one were to adopt the view expressed by, I think, only two members of this Court in modern times, Mr. Justice Jackson and Mr. Justice Harlan, that the Fourteenth Amendment does not fully incorporate the First Amendment against state action and, because it is a national constitution, there’d have to be-- it’s the constitution."
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2402.316,2408.147,It is correct that it is the national constitution and that is really the only argument for a national standard.
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2408.147,2409.431,"Well, that’s a pretty good one, isn’t it?"
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2409.431,2411.468,"Yes, it is.[Laughter]"
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2491.787,2515.557,"And what is protected by the national or federal constitution, the constitution of the United States which has the same meaning in every state unless, as I say, you are pressing to us the view taken by Mr. Justice Jackson and Mr. Justice Harlan that the Fourteenth Amendment does not incorporate the First Amendment."
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2517.087,2517.763,"No, I would not."
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2517.763,2523.38,"It’s a very, very respectable view held by two very fine members of this Court."
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2526.03,2537.042,"The view that I have is that the Court in Roth defined obscenity and it merely said it goes beyond contemporary community standards, and if--"
1972.71-1422,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2537.042,2547.027,"Are you suggesting that, Mr. McConnell, the very use of the term “community standards” in Roth may have suggested something other than a national standard?"
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2547.027,2548.984,You took the words right out of my mouth.
1972.71-1422,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2563.678,2570.846,"But didn’t Mr. Chief Justice Warren, when he was sitting, say it’s precisely that along with Justice Harlan and the others?"
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2570.846,2586.683,"Yes, he did, and I submit that if you-- on the one hand, if you make the community too small, then you have the same situation analogous to Butler versus Michigan where you’re reducing what people can read to a very limited sort of audience."
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2614.129,2623.631,"So a community to one or two, in your view, could convict a bookseller if that was the community standard of--"
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2623.631,2623.882,No.
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2623.882,2630.199,Of selling the works of Karl Marx or the writing or the publications of the John Burk Society?
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2630.199,2630.906,"No, I think that one or two--"
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2630.906,2632.93,Could they if those were the standards of the community?
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2632.93,2634.99,One or two is obviously too small.
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2640.185,2651.928,Well-- and where-- the constitution would have nothing to say if the community decided that the works of the John-- the publications of the John Burk Society were obscene and convicted somebody for selling it?
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2651.928,2658.395,"No, not at all because I would assume that the publications of the John Burk Society wouldn’t appeal to the prurient interest."
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2658.395,2665.547,But why is that so different and why isn’t-- what’s so different about that constitutionally?
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2665.547,2668.391,"I’m not sure I understand the question, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2668.391,2672.736,"Well, I’m not sure I understand your argument and I’m trying to test it."
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2672.736,2688.265,The argument is simply that there is no logical reason to me why it is more feared to somebody such as the petitioner to say that community standards in the nation as a whole have to be determined.
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2722.911,2733.343,"How about the man doing business in that rural area, could he constitutionally be convicted of selling dos capital?"
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2733.343,2735.036,"No, if he makes the community too small or--"
1972.71-1422,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2735.036,2739.382,"Does the community think that’s offensive and obscene, that particular book?"
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2739.382,2740.269,"No, I don’t think so."
1972.71-1422,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2778.026,2780.239,Where was that point in Stanley?
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2780.239,2780.851,I beg your pardon?
1972.71-1422,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2780.851,2783.844,Where was that point in Stanley?
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2783.844,2785.197,Where did that point come up in Stanley?
1972.71-1422,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2785.197,2788.893,National Standard?
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2788.893,2790.643,"In Mr. Fleishman’s argument, sir?"
1972.71-1422,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2790.643,2792.468,"No, you said that it was in Stanley."
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2793.608,2795.544,"No, I-- if I did, I--"
1972.71-1422,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2795.544,2797.322,Isn’t that not what you told us?
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2797.322,2799.87,"If I did, the wrong words came out of my mouth."
1972.71-1422,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2800.402,2810.722,"Well, I understand that suppose the California unanimously object that people read Suite 69, could they stop a man from reading it?"
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2810.722,2810.83,No.
1972.71-1422,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2810.83,2811.619,The answer is no.
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2811.619,2814.512,"No, of course not."
1972.71-1422,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2823.64,2831.775,Could they stop a man from going door-to-door with a magazine and a plain package from selling that?
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2831.775,2838.383,"Well, I don’t know the practicalities of trying to sell somebody a brand new package."
1972.71-1422,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2840.619,2842.051,"Well, I understand."
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2854.772,2858.106,"Technically, under the statute it would, but it’s one of those forty things that just could--"
1972.71-1422,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2858.106,2860.046,It would?
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2860.046,2865.14,"I think the way the statute is written, it would in--"
1972.71-1422,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2865.14,2870.447,"Well, suppose somebody comes in somebody’s house and says “I like having sexy books."
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2877.725,2881.485,"Well, then I think you’re in an area that’s already been settled by this Court."
1972.71-1422,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2908.081,2914.401,There’s no way they’re going to get a complaint unless somebody voluntarily went in that store and looked.
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2914.401,2915.999,"Well, I would have to disagree."
1972.71-1422,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2926.599,2931.776,"Is there one iota of that in this record, in Los Angeles?"
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2931.776,2933.175,No.
1972.71-1422,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2933.529,2934.347,I’m talking about--
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2934.347,2934.859,This record--
1972.71-1422,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2934.859,2942.886,"So far, this record just show that somebody had to go in there voluntarily and find out that he was selling dirty books."
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2942.886,2952.523,"According to this record that’s true, yes, but I think under Stanley and under-- versus Reidel, it doesn’t make any difference that the police had to go find out."
1972.71-1422,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2969.037,2970.882,What do you mean the policeman?
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2973.279,2975.82,Not in the sense that Mr. Fleishman is talking about.
1972.71-1422,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2985.233,2989.019,The seller assumes that he’d like that.
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,2989.019,2991.015,"No, the seller assumed he was."
1972.71-1422,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2992.729,2995.19,"Well, this is the man you convict and he is the seller."
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,3000.46,3002.075,That’s right.
1972.71-1422,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3002.075,3003.311,And he accommodated him.
1972.71-1422,1,45645,ward_glen_mcconnell,,3003.311,3020.702,"That’s right, but just briefly, if I may, I think that the obscenity of Suite 69 is clear from reading it and the jury’s judgment here was based on comparable evidence which this Court had considered previously."
1972.71-1422,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3178.874,3179.54,Mr. Fleishman.
1972.71-1422,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3179.54,3183.208,"Mr. Fleishman, may I ask you a question before you commence?"
1972.71-1422,2,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3193.239,3194.24,"Yes, sir, I would."
1972.71-1422,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3365.428,3380.129,"Mr. Fleishman, under that which is then the right of the reader rather than the seller, I take it that the state may limit a 17-year-old’s right to read in a way that it can’t limit an adult’s right to read."
1972.71-1422,2,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3380.129,3384.177,The Court has so held in Ginsberg against First-- against New York and we do not--
1972.71-1422,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3384.177,3389.743,"Of course, there, the theory was selling and purveying rather than the right to read, wasn’t it?"
1972.71-1422,2,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3389.743,3390.268,Not quite.
1972.71-1422,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3442.695,3445.541,"The same rationale that limits a minor’s right to vote, for example."
1972.71-1422,2,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3445.541,3458.051,"Exactly, so that my argument does not, in any way, touch the Ginsberg’s-- Ginsberg against New York argument, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1972.71-1422,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3458.051,3467.721,"In order to reach that results we’d have to combine voting rights with First Amendment to get that analogy, wouldn’t we?"
1972.71-1422,2,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3472.251,3489.033,"That is correct, Your Honor, but this Court, on a number of occasions, has already taken the step in terms of saying that the right of a minor is not as great as the right of adult."
1972.71-1422,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3502.345,3516.546,Are you saying that states have a certain amount of latitude in determining this that California might say age 17 and New Hampshire might say age 20 just as they can on contract liability?
1972.71-1422,2,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3516.546,3518.232,There is certainly some latitude.
1972.71-1422,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3728.463,3729.362,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
