1957.106,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,220.59,222.339,Is there a hearing on those regulations?
1957.106,0,37018,neil_brooks,,222.339,223.386,Not at that time.
1957.106,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,225.601,227.943,There's no hearing unless there's an objection.
1957.106,0,37018,neil_brooks,,227.943,230.734,"That's right, Your Honor."
1957.106,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,230.734,232.457,-- Secretary on his own (Inaudible).
1957.106,0,37018,neil_brooks,,232.457,233.226,He can indeed.
1957.106,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,235.257,238.117,Was there any objection here by anybody?
1957.106,0,37018,neil_brooks,,238.117,245.194,"There was an objection here by the market agency, the complainant in the administrative proceeding."
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,1862.011,1863.027,May it please the Court.
1957.106,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1863.027,1876.025,"I evidently see this (Inaudible) appears to me, not that I'm saying the court below was right but it seems to me is very simple on what it is."
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,1972.43,1973.107,Justice please.
1957.106,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2030.609,2045.573,You construe that regulation of the Board as telling people to do business with Denver that you can't do business with others unless you agree not to solicit for any other agencies.
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,2045.573,2046.006,Not at all.

1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,2050.991,2052.364,"Well, that's right."

1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,2087.167,2087.737,That's right.
1957.106,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2087.737,2090.047,But not the agent.
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,2090.047,2090.233,No.
1957.106,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2094.156,2094.605,That's right.
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,2094.605,2095.913,"Now, the market --"
1957.106,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2095.913,2099.305,Does it include any state like Utah or whatever?
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,2099.305,2099.481,No.
1957.106,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2104.201,2106.125,So the man is down in Colorado Springs.
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,2113.426,2115.309,May I elaborate?
1957.106,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2115.309,2115.964,That's a question.
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,2119.567,2122.995,The regulation bears upon market agencies.
1957.106,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2473.261,2477.469,"Mr. Sellers, may I ask you this question for me to understand this more clearly."
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,2532.527,2534.7,No.
1957.106,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2534.7,2535.443,You address it.
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,2535.443,2535.796,This --
1957.106,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2535.796,2545.377,"Is this for certain limitation or in some way it curtails their freedom to do what they please in relation to the Denver market, is that correct?"
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,2545.377,2546.229,That's right.
1957.106,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2551.678,2554.725,"Now, what I want to know is this."
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,2581.647,2605.565,"If the Court please, the regulation or the -- the statute doesn't say that you may only do business at one market neither does this stockyard regulation say that you may only do business at one market."
1957.106,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2659.399,2663.397,But it does to some extent curtail their freedom.
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,2663.397,2663.446,It does.
1957.106,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2663.446,2666.969,And -- and you say that --
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,2666.969,2667.405,To the extent --
1957.106,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2667.405,2694.394,"-- validity under faith must either mean that to make any regulation curtailing their freedom although they own a license for the Denver market and there is this statutory construction scheme that's been summarized or that on the basis, the kind of limitation of freedom that it sees the Denver agency, it's obviously a discriminatory or exemplary jurisdiction."
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,2694.394,2701.001,May I say that this is only one regulation.
1957.106,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2742.334,2753.64,"You say doesn't -- the regulation doesn't fit your Denver agency, you can take business to ship cattle to Los Angeles, it doesn't do that, does it or does it?"
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,2753.64,2769.101,The -- the regulation says that you can undertake to solicit sitting on the Denver market and setting yourself out as a market agency to serve this market.
1957.106,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2783.378,2791.155,Why would -- why would they say that he'd be registered for Denver unless it wanted to do also Denver business.
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,2794.09,2795.492,It should not.
1957.106,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2795.506,2797.288,Mr. Sellers --
1957.106,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2797.288,2799.737,"That doesn't settle the question, does it?"
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,2849.886,2849.926,No.
1957.106,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2849.926,2851.03,"It produces it, doesn't it?"
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,2851.03,2852.167,If the Court please.
1957.106,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2854.97,2856.193,Well --
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,2856.193,2863.642,The market agencies are merely agencies not -- not marketing agencies generally.

1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,2899.054,2900.367,"Oh, yes."
1957.106,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2900.367,2902.93,"And market agents, is that right?"
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,2902.93,2903.765,"Yes, sir."
1957.106,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2903.765,2913.104,"To furnish upon reasonable request without discrimination, reasonable stockyard service at such time."
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,2969.164,2969.852,The --
1957.106,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2969.852,2972.086,-- that I've read (Voice Overlap) --
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,2972.086,2982.502,"The respondent here, the Producers Livestock Marketing Association is a market agency."
1957.106,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3035.84,3036.859,I understand that.
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,3036.859,3039.457,They are simply people operating on the market.
1957.106,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3039.457,3042.608,What is this Utah (Inaudible)
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,3042.608,3046.559,They are the market agency operating on this market.
1957.106,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3046.559,3048.553,Why are they opposing to this?
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,3048.553,3055.691,"They are opposed to it because they want -- if the Court please, I -- I can't talk without getting off the record."
1957.106,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3057.37,3058.481,Well --
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,3058.481,3060.352,All that we have here is a --
1957.106,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3060.352,3063.946,They cannot.
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,3078.119,3102.623,"If -- if it is true that under this regulation that they have -- they are soliciting business, the people operating -- the personnel operating -- representing this agency at Denver is soliciting business in that area for other stockyards or for other markets then the wording of the regulation would certainly seem to say that that's what they could not do."
1957.106,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3102.623,3104.526,"Now, the problem I have is this."
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,3133.939,3143.444,"Well, the case came before the Court as I said without any evidence whatsoever."
1957.106,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3143.666,3147.238,Was it possible for that within a case without any evidence?
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,3147.238,3151.998,The responsibility is upon the respondent here.
1957.106,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3159.268,3159.922,On its face?
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,3159.922,3160.441,No.
1957.106,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3162.844,3164.614,"Well, that's what the Court decided on."
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,3164.614,3165.316,"Well, that's right."
1957.106,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3183.696,3185.42,Can you justify the regulation in your answer?
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,3185.42,3197.658,"We -- we denied that the regulation had the meaning that they attributed to it, and we put the matter into issue for a hearing as to what the regulation would mean."
1957.106,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3434.36,3439.299,"Now this -- is this your case, Mr. Sellers?"
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,3500.523,3501.537,Precisely.
1957.106,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3501.537,3530.01,"Now would you mind telling us, if you don't mind, why does anything there for anybody to decide if this means what the Court said that they must not restrain the freedom of the people to come in to that market agent and do business, when it's conceivable and has to be conceded that the regulation does in the statute."
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,3530.01,3542.475,"Let's assume, if the Court please, that evidence would show that the impact of this regulation is actually to foster competition at the Denver market."
1957.106,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3543.331,3545.025,But that doesn't (Voice Overlap) it says --
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,3545.025,3546.317,It could well do that.
1957.106,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3546.317,3556.667,"-- that to deny them service, it's their duty to furnish upon reasonable request without discrimination, reasonable stockyard services."
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,3577.92,3579.489,"Well, we are not a marketing remarkable agency."
1957.106,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3579.772,3581.37,But what are you going to argue on the stockyard?
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,3581.37,3584.589,Well but they are subject to the statutes just as we are in the same obligation.
1957.106,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3584.589,3588.6,Certainly if (Voice Overlap) but they haven't passed any regulation yet.
1957.106,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3588.6,3589.433,Mr. Sellers.
1957.106,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3589.433,3593.671,They tried to deny to certain people the right to get stockyard services from them.
1957.106,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3593.671,3602.044,Why don't you admit what Mr. Justice Black said and say you can't tell and do all the facts to shed on the situation.
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,3602.044,3605.439,You said it much more precisely than I've tried to say it for 15 to 20 minutes.

1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,3613.191,3615.276,Yes.
1957.106,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3615.276,3623.558,"Now, I want to find out if you operated differently in Denver than elsewhere."

1957.106,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3636.56,3636.981,None at all?
1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,3636.981,3637.79,Not a license.

1957.106,1,16964,ashley_sellers,,3648.719,3649.426,That's right.
1957.106,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3649.426,3660.572,"Now, he's assigned -- well, what this consists of is an office in the livestock exchange, and half a dozen so tends in the public stockyard, isn't that right?"
