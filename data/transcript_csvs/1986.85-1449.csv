1986.85-1449,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,14.174,"You may proceed whenever you are ready, Mr. Gardner."
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,14.174,16.776,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,136.586,142.257,The argument that you are preventing future people from engaging in it is not terribly persuasive.
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,161.57,165.105,"I would agree, Your Honor, the difference being--"
1986.85-1449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,165.105,179.496,"So if, indeed, there is some overreaching here, and it is a bad thing to have cities or anybody doing this sort of thing... it's hardly something to be worried about, that we're preventing it from happening in the future."
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,179.496,182.365,"--If in fact it were overreaching, I would agree, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,249.675,253.477,"He also gave up the right to defend himself in court, too, I suppose."
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,259.197,260.317,--He had a choice.
1986.85-1449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,271.707,282.646,"Do you think there are very many cases in which the defendant would say, I'd much rather go to trial on the criminal charge, than just have you dismiss the charges?"
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,282.646,290.836,"--Commonly, I would expect that a defendant who is assured of his innocence will do that."
1986.85-1449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,292.621,298.775,"Assured of his innocence, he'd still want to go to trial, even though you know nothing is all that certain in trials?"
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,298.775,308.63,"--Well, I would expect, Justice Stevens, that that's very similar to the plea bargaining situation and we see people who stand trial despite plea bargain offers on a daily basis."
1986.85-1449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,310.665,315.034,Those are a choice between one of two different criminal trials.
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,320.271,335.881,"--Well, there are plea bargains which are very near total exoneration, situations in New Hampshire, for instance, where an individual can plead to a lesser included misdemeanor and suffer a conditional discharge which allows him an automatic annulment of his record in one year."
1986.85-1449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,338.067,340.185,It's still fairly serious.
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,340.185,349.457,"--It is certainly not going to jail, for instance, and it's something that if it were done in this case, we would not be here today over."
1986.85-1449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,383.096,390.6,"Do you suppose a bargain would be enforceable if the prosecutor said, we'll dismiss the charges if you give $1,000 to the police benefit fund?"
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,390.6,398.955,"If you give $1,000 to the police benefit fund... I would liken that to the blackmail that Justice Scalia--"
1986.85-1449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,398.955,401.14,"Well, why is that any different from this?"
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,401.14,406.692,"--Well, because in that case the prosecutor is doing something that's wholly outside his ambit."
1986.85-1449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,406.692,410.496,You mean he has a duty to prosecute if he thinks there's prima facie evidence?
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,410.496,415.114,"He has a duty to prosecute, but his duty is not solely to convict."
1986.85-1449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,422.303,426.105,Don't you think the police benefit fund serves society?
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,426.105,432.742,--Not as directly as the prosecutor's activities on behalf of society in judging whether or not in a particular case--
1986.85-1449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,432.742,438.496,"Well, here you can settle a loss to it for less than $1,000, if it's a frivolous case."
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,440.515,465.463,"--Well, the distinction, I would suggest, Your Honor, is that again the prosecutor in the situation where he garnered $1,000 for the police benefit society would in fact be outside the ambit of proper prosecutorial discretion, whereas in this situation, I would suggest, he was well within the proper area of prosecutorial discretion."
1986.85-1449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,465.463,471.717,--garnered the release for two or three police officers who otherwise might be subjected to personal liability.
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,471.717,480.842,"The prosecutor in this case, Your Honor, did not... the is no evidence that the prosecutor in this case demanded a release."
1986.85-1449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,514.979,520.799,"In other words, it was settled on the assumption that there was a meritorious 1983 claim that would otherwise be filed, is that it?"
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,520.799,524.685,--It was not... I would not suggest that it was settled on the assumption that there was a meritorious claim.
1986.85-1449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,547.334,553.021,Why is that inconvenience to the individual police officer any different from the benefit to my police fund?
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,553.021,558.258,--Because the police officer in the criminal justice system is a public servant.
1986.85-1449,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,579.939,598.919,"Mr. Gardner, if the 1983 suit has a dollar settlement value, how is the case different from just having the police say, if the respondent will pay the city $1,000 it will dismiss the charges?"
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,598.919,606.406,"I would suggest, Your Honor, that not all cases have a dollar settlement value on account of their inherent value."
1986.85-1449,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,606.406,609.291,You said this one probably did.
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,609.291,622.951,"I was suggesting that I have a file cabinet full of releases in cases which I don't believe are meritorious, that have been settled because the settlement value... the nuisance value of the case--"
1986.85-1449,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,622.951,626.319,"Well, let's suppose there is a dollar settlement value."
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,632.656,642.162,"--Well, a dollar settlement value, as I understand it, if this were a case that were being pursued, would run to Mr. Rumery rather than vice versa."
1986.85-1449,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,646.9,652.72,"Well, he is giving up his suit, something of value."
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,652.72,660.724,"And he is also... he is voluntarily waiving something which he knows, because he has been advised by counsel, he's thought about it."
1986.85-1449,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,676.585,698.749,"Well, isn't that very fact something that makes it different from plea bargaining because here the city has something else it's concerned about other than just the operation of the process of the enforcement of the criminal law in reaching this agreement?"
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,707.772,725.066,"In the plea bargaining context, he's obviously pleading to a reduced offense, even to the point of a reduced offense that is perhaps not going to cause him any disability for any great period of time into the future."
1986.85-1449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,725.066,730.804,"And what was the motive of the prosecutor, or the reason--"
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,730.804,734.958,"In our case there were several motives, I think."
1986.85-1449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,747.599,759.406,--Do you think determining whether... should a factor in determining whether to dismiss the case be that this will protect some public official?
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,759.406,764.81,"The factor in determining whether to... well, that should be a factor."
1986.85-1449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,774.583,783.939,"Well, what that means to me is that you would otherwise pursue the criminal case if it weren't for this factor?"
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,783.939,785.574,--If that were the only factor.
1986.85-1449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,785.574,794.329,"Well, no, but if you say it's a factor, there are bound to be some cases where that's the factor that determines whether you will try the case or not."
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,794.329,796.829,I would suggest that if that were the factor--
1986.85-1449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,796.829,806.387,"So you think that you're justified in trading off the public interest in having this criminal case tried, against releasing the public official?"
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,806.387,817.242,"--I would suggest that if that were the only factor, Justice White, what we would be talking about is a coercive situation, inherently coercive, and I would trust the trial court to find that it wasn't a voluntary waiver."
1986.85-1449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,817.242,819.694,But you say it can always be a factor.
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,819.694,829.15,"If it's the only factor, I would suggest that in that particular case, it was clearly a coercive situation."
1986.85-1449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,829.15,844.945,"Well, here's a case where you had otherwise tried... there has to be some situations like this that you would otherwise try, but you did not because there is this factor of possibly gaining the release of a public official?"
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,844.945,850.13,"I would suggest, Your Honor, that there is absolutely no evidence in this case that it would otherwise have been tried."
1986.85-1449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,862.806,867.508,"Mr. Gardner, I think the issue in this case is whether a per se rule is appropriate."
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,882.887,888.339,"Well, if there's going to be a per se rule, then obviously that's what we have to do."
1986.85-1449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,896.278,898.062,Which do you think is the correct presumption?
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,905.883,918.91,"--I would suggest, Your Honor, that this Court have faith in the prosecutors of America and assume that those cases, if they were not meritorious, would have been dismissed despite the release, or the obtaining of a release."
1986.85-1449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,920.993,934.884,"Then really, there's no consideration for the release except that the defendant got out of a meritless criminal trial, and I suppose there's a lot of pressure on a defendant to give a release in that situation if he's faced with a trial, even if he thinks he's going to win."
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,934.884,945.691,"--Well, I wouldn't say that he was getting out of a meritless criminal trial, just because the prosecutor determines that he's not going to prosecute the case."
1986.85-1449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,960.784,969.307,"--We can't really assume, in other words, that all the cases that are dismissed are necessarily meritless cases."
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,971.759,975.461,"I'm not a prosecutor, Your Honor, but I would suggest that there are--"
1986.85-1449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,975.461,977.746,And many cases that have merit are never brought.
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,977.746,979.53,"--Many cases, that have merit are never brought."
1986.85-1449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,984.316,1019.59,"But what you're saying is that a case that has merit but nonetheless, despite its merit, might otherwise be dismissed because a witness would have to, as in this case, a woman in a rape case who didn't want to testify would have to be called, that otherwise the prosecutor might dismiss the case; nonetheless would have to go forward to it despite the inconvenience to this raped witness, unless the prosecutor could be sure that by dismissing it, he was not letting the city in for an enormous suit for false prosecution."
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1019.59,1020.54,I'm saying that in each--
1986.85-1449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1020.54,1021.441,You're not saying that?
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1021.441,1037.701,"--What I'm saying is that in each case you have to look at the case when the decision has to be made, and determine whether at that time the situation resulted from a voluntary, knowing, deliberate waiver of the right to bring the action by the individual."
1986.85-1449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1037.701,1067.32,"Can the motive of saving the city from a suit, or individual policemen from a suit, also exist when a prosecutor accepts a plea bargain to a lesser offense, so that in some cases where the prosecutor might otherwise consider dismissing the charge entirely, he insists upon accepting a plea to a lesser charge in order to be sure that the city wouldn't be subject to suit for false prosecution subsequently?"
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1067.32,1070.939,"Well, that certainly could happen, and it's obvious that--"
1986.85-1449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1070.939,1079.361,Does pleading guilty to a lesser included offense eliminate the possibility of bringing a false arrest or false prosecution action later?
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1079.361,1080.98,"--To my understanding, it does, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1080.98,1084.949,"Mr. Gardner, what is the source of law in this area?"
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1090.603,1095.49,"To my understanding, Your Honor, the First Circuit applied federal law--"
1986.85-1449,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1095.49,1097.64,But you're here now in the Supreme Court.
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1102.811,1106.595,"--In that I'm very pleased because they decided the case against me, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1115.718,1122.724,"Well, but public policy is ordinarily a matter for state courts to decide in New Hampshire."
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1122.724,1125.759,--Except when it affects constitutional rights.
1986.85-1449,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1125.759,1141.686,"Well, is the source of law here the federal common law, basically because it's a 1983 action, like immunity in 1983 is a federal law, or the validity of a release is also a federal question?"
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1141.686,1171.455,"There is a suggestion, or I would suggest, Your Honor, that the First Amendment, the right to petition for redress of grievances, might arguably be applied and the suggestion might be that an individual who waives his right to seek redress or through the civil rights remedy for a deprivation of his constitutional rights has in effect waived his right to petition the Court for redress of grievances."
1986.85-1449,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1192.903,1194.303,But where do we look?
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1203.092,1212.198,"I think, in order to determine what test to apply, I think the Court should look to what test it has applied in interpreting waivers of constitutional rights."
1986.85-1449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1242.051,1243.503,"--I mean, informed or voluntary."
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1245.769,1247.471,I think that it's important to look at--
1986.85-1449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1247.471,1251.257,"--The thief comes up and says, your money or your life, you know, and--"
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1251.257,1252.442,--I think that's coercive.
1986.85-1449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1252.442,1257.161,"--You know, there used to be a Jack Benny story, and he'd say, hmm, you know, he'd pause for a couple of minutes."
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1272.253,1288.615,"I agree, and I would suggest that the trial court is the best court to determine that, and the best way to have that determined is to give the trial court the latitude to look at whether the release was signed voluntarily after deliberation and in an informed manner."
1986.85-1449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1297.488,1302.825,"Yes, but in Justice Scalia's example, I suppose that if the lawyer was with the man that he'd give him the same advice?"
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1314.83,1318.782,"There are three prongs to the test, and I would suggest that is not voluntary."
1986.85-1449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1335.041,1349.968,"Isn't the reason the holdup is involuntary is that the victim runs the risk of substantial harm if he doesn't hand over the money, and a man who elects to stand trial in a public criminal proceeding may also run the risk of substantial harm to his reputation?"
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1349.968,1360.526,"--The man who refuses to accept a plea to second degree and stands trial to murder in the first degree, stands a substantial risk of capital punishment in some states."
1986.85-1449,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1391.997,1395.782,Can I get back to the Chief Justice's question.
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1405.472,1408.857,--I urge the Court not to find a constitutional violation in this case.
1986.85-1449,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1411.809,1416.362,"Well, how has your client been harmed?"
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1418.064,1420.214,"By the First Circuit's opinion, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1420.881,1422.199,What did it do?
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1422.199,1431.455,"--In that it found that a per se rule would be applied in every case, and our facts in this case demonstrate--"
1986.85-1449,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1431.455,1433.257,That denies your client what?
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1433.257,1437.959,--That denied my client the benefit of the release which Mr. Rumery had executed.
1986.85-1449,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1437.959,1444.446,And that violated what section of the Constitution?
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1444.446,1445.231,I'm not sure.
1986.85-1449,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1446.731,1451.052,"Well, if it doesn't, why... where do we get jurisdiction?"
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1454.42,1471.632,"--Well, it seems to me, Your Honor, that jurisdiction is the question of whether or not the Court accepts jurisdiction on the basis of the respondent's claim that his constitutional rights have been violated, and the Court accepted cert because of the discrepancy of the decisions of the various circuits on this question."
1986.85-1449,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1471.632,1477.4,"Mr. Gardner, I understood that you were denying that there was any violation of constitutional rights."
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1477.4,1487.575,"I have taken the position that my client, who is the town of Newton, New Hampshire, entered into an agreement--"
1986.85-1449,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1487.575,1492.879,"I understand that, but you are saying that there has been no violation of constitutional rights in this case?"
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1492.879,1494.161,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1495.497,1499.782,It seemed to me that you were not making that entirely clear.
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1499.782,1501.651,I'm sorry.
1986.85-1449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1529.302,1530.837,"Mr. Gardner, may I just ask this."
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1540.026,1541.676,The First Circuit didn't reach that.
1986.85-1449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1541.676,1549.048,I suppose that one could view the opinion as allowing those... the release to still be valid and binding as to state law claims?
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1549.048,1551.75,I would expect so.
1986.85-1449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1573.247,1578.483,The constitutional issue... did the First Circuit decide a constitutional question?
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1578.483,1592.975,"Well, the First Circuit determined that it violated Mr. Rumery's right under the First Amendment to seek redress of grievances by virtue of his signing this document."
1986.85-1449,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1592.975,1594.975,Where does it say that?
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1608.251,1611.353,"I would certainly suggest, Your Honor, that it was briefed on both sides and--"
1986.85-1449,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1611.353,1621.042,"Well, I had been briefed, but where does the Court of Appeals say that it was void, the covenant was void, under the First Amendment?"
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1634.385,1643.324,"--And which both sides took as a finding that under the First Amendment, he was entitled."
1986.85-1449,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1649.228,1655.881,"--You suggested earlier, did you not, Mr. Gardner, that there was perhaps a due process claim here?"
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1655.881,1659.083,"Well, again I'm in the unusual circumstance of--"
1986.85-1449,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1659.083,1662.285,"Your adversary should be arguing this, not you, I guess."
1986.85-1449,0,20898,donald_e_gardner,,1662.285,1663.619,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1698.142,1699.244,"Thank you, Mr. Gardner."
1986.85-1449,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1702.196,1709.016,"Mr. Bauer, would you pick up on this constitutional question and tell us why you think we have a constitutional question before us?"
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,1709.016,1710.183,"I certainly will, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1710.183,1715.67,"And it is true, isn't it, that the First Circuit did not cite a single United States Supreme Court decision?"
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,1715.67,1716.454,"That is true, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1716.454,1718.806,It didn't mention the Constitution of the United States?
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,1718.806,1720.241,"No, it did not, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1720.241,1721.108,It did not?
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,1721.108,1723.043,That's correct.
1986.85-1449,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1789.885,1794.539,"Specifically, what provision of the Constitution?"
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,1794.539,1819.104,"Specifically, Your Honor, the Fourth Amendment; that is, the unreasonable search and seizure including the unreasonable arrest, the tension, intimidation and coercion that was used against this individual by an agent or an arm of the state through the Fourteenth Amendment."
1986.85-1449,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1819.104,1828.693,"Would that not present a factual question, whether or not there was coercion?"
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,1828.693,1832.664,"With regard to the underlying merits, Your Honor, yes."
1986.85-1449,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1850.793,1853.745,Do you want a retrial?
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,1853.745,1854.045,--Yes.
1986.85-1449,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1910.081,1921.555,"Would your case be any different if this were a misdemeanor charge... not this particular alleged action, but suppose it were a misdemeanor?"
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,1921.555,1922.155,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1923.522,1924.291,You would still be here?
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,1924.291,1925.824,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1950.908,1957.062,"Is that a matter of some federal contract law principle, or what?"
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,1984.162,1984.845,"--No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1997.303,2007.178,"You mean, if state law requires two witnesses to such an agreement, we could simply say, you don't need two witnesses?"
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2011.047,2013.88,"--No, Your Honor, no."
1986.85-1449,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2023.438,2027.473,"But Justice O'Connor's question didn't go to this issue, as I understood it."
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2035.828,2036.512,That's correct.
1986.85-1449,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2036.512,2039.53,And what law... you assert that's federal law?
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2039.53,2041.732,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2072.335,2077.989,"Well, now, wait a minute, 1983 doesn't create the federal right."
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2081.274,2082.059,--Yes.
1986.85-1449,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2082.059,2095.134,And it would seen to me that what was at issue below was the validity of a covenant or agreement viewed in terms of state law.
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2113.179,2117.899,"Well, Your Honor, I think it is a direct waiver of constitutional rights."
1986.85-1449,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2155.005,2159.893,You take away all covenants not to sue?
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2159.893,2161.595,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2187.377,2191.013,"Well, that covers an awful lot of covenants not to sue."
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2195.816,2199.684,"It really does not, I don't believe."
1986.85-1449,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2222.317,2223.919,Tell me what's so bad about it.
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2223.919,2225.486,What's so bad about it?
1986.85-1449,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2225.486,2225.919,Yes.
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2230.006,2238.059,"What's so bad about this is that the public interest is being subverted, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2241.297,2250.586,"You mean, the prosecutor is giving up a perfectly good criminal prosecution that he shouldn't give up just in order to protect a public official?"
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2250.586,2251.903,"--That may be, yes."
1986.85-1449,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2251.903,2253.105,"Well, is that what you're talking about?"
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2253.105,2255.571,That is what I'm talking about.
1986.85-1449,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2258.307,2268.698,"Even though if the prosecutor has a good case, he might put your client in jail?"
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2268.698,2271.067,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2301.686,2307.506,"Well, why is that a concern of federal law, to encourage the prosecutor that way?"
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2328.319,2348.4,"The reason I believe, Chief Justice, that it is a matter of federal law is that in addition to the required waiver of 1983 rights there is also an unequal protection--"
1986.85-1449,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2348.4,2354.237,"I'm not questioning, that the ultimate question is to be decided by federal law."
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2375.8,2376.75,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2400.682,2407.069,"Mr. Bauer, I think there is some difference between your position and the position of the Court of Appeals, if I'm not mistaken."
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2432.62,2434.172,"--Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2434.172,2435.039,I see.
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2439.057,2449.865,I don't believe that it is required to go beyond for the purposes of deciding this case and deciding whether this covenant is void as against public policy.
1986.85-1449,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2466.643,2475.397,"See, one can read their decision as just a statutory construction decision, thinking this is necessary to make the remedy, the 1983 remedy, an effective federal remedy."
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2499.947,2501.214,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2501.214,2503.399,"If not, what is it?"
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2503.399,2536.303,"My position is that if the covenant not to sue deprives an individual of federally guaranteed rights to petition a court for redress, to be treated fairly and equally under the law, to have his liberty interests adjudicated by a jury, if that is the ultimate decision or impact of the covenant not to sue, then yes."
1986.85-1449,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2536.303,2538.489,"Well, that's all covenants not to sue."
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2541.274,2542.724,"Within this context, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2542.724,2547.845,"I mean, you don't have a covenant not to sue unless you've given up something."
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2547.845,2549.38,"Within this context, yes."
1986.85-1449,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2549.38,2549.863,Right.
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2552.332,2553.149,Well--
1986.85-1449,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2553.149,2554.832,Is that what you said?
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2554.832,2555.784,--I just want to make sure--
1986.85-1449,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2555.784,2563.287,"Didn't you say that if you sign a covenant not to sue, you don't give up your federal rights?"
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2563.287,2566.139,--Well--
1986.85-1449,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2566.139,2568.608,Yes or no?
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2568.608,2569.96,"--Yes, you do."
1986.85-1449,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2574.428,2576.447,You are forced to give up your federal rights?
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2576.447,2577.364,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2577.364,2581.166,And you can't covenant to give them up?
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2581.166,2587.886,"You shouldn't... yes, you can't be forced by the government to give up those rights, yes."
1986.85-1449,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2587.886,2589.755,"Well, how are you forced to?"
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2589.755,2592.874,"Well, I'm glad you asked that."
1986.85-1449,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2617.739,2619.774,The police?
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2619.774,2620.224,No.
1986.85-1449,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2635.634,2637.819,Do you have to give up plea bargaining?
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2637.819,2638.669,"--No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2638.669,2640.02,What's the difference?
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2640.02,2650.31,"The significant difference, Your Honor, between plea bargaining and this context is that in plea bargaining there is not a confusion of the two systems."
1986.85-1449,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2680.013,2695.774,"Well, the state would argue that here there's a public interest being served as well, that the prosecutor, given his other business, has decided that this case, on reflection, is not worth his resources."
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2718.088,2722.774,"Most of what you've just articulated, Justice, are valid."
1986.85-1449,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2771.322,2777.243,"So, you want him to say, the only way... and he can't even consider that in deciding to go ahead with the prosecution?"
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2777.243,2778.261,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2778.261,2779.245,"He can't have in mind that,"
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2806.078,2807.78,"To dismiss, yes."
1986.85-1449,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2807.78,2813.768,Without bearing in mind that although it's a meritorious case he's going to have to litigate this thing in civil matters?
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2813.768,2814.218,Yes.
1986.85-1449,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2821.688,2828.694,"But the time he's saving in the criminal prosecution, he's losing in having to litigate the civil case."
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2830.528,2835.182,"The civil case, Your Honor... let me back up if I may."
1986.85-1449,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2857.378,2859.213,"I understand, but he denies that there has been any."
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2876.842,2877.309,--No.
1986.85-1449,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2887.732,2892.784,"But the only way to take them into account, and the only way to protect them is to get the release."
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2909.646,2918.502,"--Your Honor, I would respond by saying that there are already safeguards for police, prosecutors, towns."
1986.85-1449,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2929.976,2931.359,I'm worried about his waste of time.
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2952.759,2969.034,"--Your Honor, if only the waste of time is the consideration, then it's our position that that is not a proper prosecutorial decision because that so-called waste of time does not serve the public, does not serve the public."
1986.85-1449,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2969.034,2979.742,"Why shouldn't that be for New Hampshire to decide here, whether they want their prosecutors wasting time or not and whether that sort of thing serves the public interest?"
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,2987.396,2998.471,"Your Honor, I would tend to agree with you that that particular aspect, that issue or sub-issue, does not really cry to this Court for adjudication."
1986.85-1449,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3051.522,3054.557,Suppose a prosecutor comes up and--
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,3054.557,3057.659,"--Your Honor, not if he was innocent."
1986.85-1449,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3064.229,3078.488,"--You want us to put a wall up against all of it by saying, you just can't sign a covenant not to sue, and I don't see any authority under the sun that you have for that."
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,3078.488,3080.505,"Your Honor, I'm not saying that--"
1986.85-1449,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3080.505,3085.559,We've had covenants not to sue since we've had courts.
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,3085.559,3089.444,"--Certainly in the civil context, we have, Your Honor, where one civil--"
1986.85-1449,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3089.444,3104.521,"Well, now we're going to exchange all of that and we're going to make one little narrow exception, that you can covenant not to sue on every statute in the world except 1983."
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,3106.723,3112.794,"--Your Honor, what I'm asking for is not whether an individual may or may not sign a covenant."
1986.85-1449,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3134.409,3140.313,"Well, Mr. Bauer, who initiated the suggestion of dropping--"
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,3140.313,3141.746,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3142.396,3152.787,"--In this case, was it you or your client who initiated the discussion with the city about dropping the 1983 liability?"
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,3152.787,3159.691,"--Your Honor, I did not represent the respondent in the criminal charge below."
1986.85-1449,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3159.691,3166.963,Did the respondent or his then lawyer initiate this covenant?
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,3166.963,3177.986,"To the best of the recollection of the criminal defense attorney, it is his belief that the prosecutor first brought up the subject."
1986.85-1449,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3193.781,3206.588,"Do you concede that in this case, at least, Mr. Rumery and his attorney very much wanted to enter into the agreement and thought it was in their best interest to do so?"
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,3206.588,3215.711,"Your Honor, Mr. Rumery had no other choice and Mr. Rumery's criminal defense attorney had no other choice."
1986.85-1449,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3226.669,3254.002,"Mr. Bauer, what about the situation which I understand is pretty frequent, where a prosecutor is thinking of filing an assault charge against an individual and ultimately it's worked out that the prospective defendant agrees to pay the medical expenses of the party that was injured, and if he does so the whole thing's dropped?"
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,3271.114,3282.671,"Your Honor, if there is a conviction, if there is a conviction or a plea of guilty to a charge with restitution as part of the punishment--"
1986.85-1449,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3282.671,3283.571,"No, that's not the deal."
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,3304.568,3318.995,"--No, Your Honor, because in that hypothetical the individual is not being forced to waive his federal rights to sue, under 1983, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3318.995,3321.328,"We're only talking about money here, aren't we?"
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,3323.547,3326.499,"No, we're not, Your Honor."
1986.85-1449,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3326.499,3331.551,What is he going to get in his 1983 suit besides money?
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,3331.551,3337.955,"Besides money, Your Honor, the public has an interest in that 1983 action."
1986.85-1449,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3362.588,3376.765,"--there can be the most outrageous violation of somebody's Fourth Amendment rights and then a trial at which he is found guilty and there isn't much you can do about the false arrest, is there?"
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,3376.765,3380.967,"--No, there is not, Your Honor... after the finding of guilty, yes, but--"
1986.85-1449,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3380.967,3391.255,The prosecutor can protect the grossest false arrest by going ahead and trying the case and winning it.
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,3391.255,3415.573,"--And winning it, yes, and we submit that the prosecutor... if this Court does not declare such covenants void, that the prosecutors and police will incorporate this type of covenant into their standard operating procedure and thereby prevent... virtually prevent any 1983 action--"
1986.85-1449,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3415.573,3417.239,"Not so, not so."
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,3427.714,3434.718,"--Your Honor, with regard to the District Court, I think that you're referring to the sorting out, to the trial level."
1986.85-1449,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3461.785,3463.054,I understand your position.
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,3476.195,3484.217,"--No, because the voluntary, deliberate and informed standard, Your Honor, only looks to the individual."
1986.85-1449,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3533.816,3553.028,"Mr. Bauer, suppose instead of a covenant the prosecutor said he wanted the defendant to stipulate there was probable cause for the arrest, even though he wasn't prepared to prove that the man was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and presumably in this case there's probable cause if the woman told the police officers what the record suggests."
1986.85-1449,1,18435,charles_p_bauer,,3557.431,3570.256,"Yes, Your Honor, yes, and there is a case on point on that type of matter where a trial court participated in that request for a stipulation as to probable cause."
1986.85-1449,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3591.836,3593.955,"Thank you, Mr. Bauer."
1986.85-1449,2,20898,donald_e_gardner,,3597.49,3597.94,Thank you.
1986.85-1449,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3605.393,3606.511,Not this case.
1986.85-1449,2,20898,donald_e_gardner,,3606.511,3610.83,--Impart a bit of his wisdom in this case also.
1986.85-1449,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3610.83,3611.915,"He may be here, Mr. Gardner."
1986.85-1449,2,20898,donald_e_gardner,,3614.867,3631.376,"He said in Adams, a case that was decided in 1942, Adams versus the United States, that to imprison a man and his privileges... or to say that a man cannot voluntarily waive his constitutional rights is to imprison a man and his privileges and call it the Constitution."
1986.85-1449,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3650.457,3654.076,I don't really believe... that is an exorbitant argument.
1986.85-1449,2,20898,donald_e_gardner,,3672.72,3680.059,"--It certainly suggests, Your Honor, that in the best exercise of your rights you ought to be able to, on occasion, waive them."
1986.85-1449,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3687.797,3689.582,And that's what your opponent's arguing.
1986.85-1449,2,20898,donald_e_gardner,,3689.582,3694.403,"And obviously that is, but in this case we don't have a man who sold himself into slavery."
1986.85-1449,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3711.578,3720.101,"You would solve all these cases by the voluntary and intelligent formula, wouldn't you?"
1986.85-1449,2,20898,donald_e_gardner,,3720.101,3720.534,That's correct.
1986.85-1449,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3720.534,3724.755,And without any regard at all to the prosecutor's conduct?
1986.85-1449,2,20898,donald_e_gardner,,3724.755,3730.242,"Well, if the prosecutor's conduct was coercive, then the release wouldn't be voluntary."
1986.85-1449,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3730.242,3732.542,"Well, when is that?"
1986.85-1449,2,20898,donald_e_gardner,,3732.542,3734.378,In this particular case--
1986.85-1449,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3734.378,3738.932,"Whenever the prosecutor's got a lousy case, that he'd never try in a hundred years?"
1986.85-1449,2,20898,donald_e_gardner,,3738.932,3739.298,--No.
1986.85-1449,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3751.322,3754.69,"Does that mean that your rule would cover every case, you'd say,"
1986.85-1449,2,20898,donald_e_gardner,,3761.028,3761.628,No.
1986.85-1449,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3770.867,3773.585,"Well, like he hasn't got any evidence?"
1986.85-1449,2,20898,donald_e_gardner,,3773.585,3777.02,"--Well, I wouldn't suggest that's good cause, but for reasons other--"
1986.85-1449,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3777.02,3780.055,That's one of the best reasons known to man.
1986.85-1449,2,20898,donald_e_gardner,,3780.055,3785.34,"--Reasons other than guilt or innocence, I would suggest, Your Honor, reasons other than guilt or innocence."
1986.85-1449,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3791.594,3795.065,"Well, what if... well, my time is up."
1986.85-1449,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3796.865,3798.933,"Your time has expired, Mr. Gardner."
