1970.323,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,36.114,"We’ll hear argument next in Number 323, Coolidge against the State of New Hampshire."
1970.323,0,15704,archibald_cox,,38.246,42.169,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.323,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,317.088,320.471,"Were these the same things, the same guns that the police had seen before?"
1970.323,0,15704,archibald_cox,,320.471,329.748,These were the same guns the different police had seen before and there’s no indication that these two men had any information about what had happened before.
1970.323,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,329.748,337.508,Did the wife at this time know that her husband was at least in the company of police and have been for a couple of hours?
1970.323,0,15704,archibald_cox,,337.508,351.772,Yes she did and I thought it would be convenient Mr. Chief Justice if I’m going to argue the question about the Attorney General’s warrant first and I thought it might be convenient if I refrain from stating the facts about this search which --
1970.323,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,351.772,351.872,I know.
1970.323,0,15704,archibald_cox,,351.872,363.04,-- took place chronologically first until I come to what will be the second branch of my argument and then I will address myself to the specific questions that you mentioned.
1970.323,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,434.213,441.061,"Mr. Cox, incidentally, is there a transcript of what took place at that meeting in the AG’s office?"
1970.323,0,15704,archibald_cox,,441.061,447.559,"No, there was no record made of that and none of what was said was under oath."
1970.323,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,506.948,512.326,Does the Attorney General ordinarily have a commission as justice in peace in New Hampshire?
1970.323,0,15704,archibald_cox,,512.326,532.438,"I don’t -- I know that he -- that Mr. Menard did, I suspect that others did, New Hampshire have an extraordinary practice at this time, Chief McGranery testified that they never went out of the police department to get a search warrant, they just had the inspectors and captains, old commissioned justices of the peace, he testified this."
1970.323,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,545.596,551.54,"Mr. Cox, do I understand there is no challenge to Mr. Coolidge’s arrest here?"
1970.323,0,15704,archibald_cox,,551.54,556.776,"I don’t think it makes any difference here, there was a challenge to Mr. Coolidge’s arrest."
1970.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,577.649,585.257,"Both branches of your argument, your entire argument of course in this case depends upon the continuing validity of the exclusionary rule, does it?"
1970.323,0,15704,archibald_cox,,585.257,590.59,"Oh yes, yes, I assume that and hope that I may."
1970.323,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,724.669,733.487,"Well, would it make any difference to your case whether the evidence obtained in this way was weak evidence or strong evidence?"
1970.323,0,15704,archibald_cox,,733.487,747.504,"No, I was simply negating any possibility that the rule, it’s the case decided the same day as Cooper in California, I can’t think of the name of it now, could be applicable here."
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,1920.424,1924.107,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2020.692,2025.022,But why have a search warrant at all then?
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2025.022,2026.35,"The search warrant, the --"
1970.323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2026.35,2027.105,At all.
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2027.105,2041.555,The police officers were very properly under the circumstances seeking a search warrant and I’m simply stating that to deny the substance of what happened here and say that the search warrants were illegally issued under these circumstances would be --
1970.323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2041.555,2049.678,Do you -- do you tell us that the Attorney General at that stage was a neutral?
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2049.678,2050.466,This --
1970.323,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2050.466,2052.63,You say he was neutral in fact I suppose.
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2052.63,2054.891,"I say he was neutral in fact, yes Mr. Chief --"
1970.323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2054.891,2058.639,The fact being what?
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2058.639,2062.436,On the basis of the facts which were presented to them which were as follows.
1970.323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2103.251,2125.24,"I would like to just warn you Mr. Kalinski, when you get through, I’m still going to ask you to explain that after knowing all of that, how did he become neutral and the longer you give me facts, the more difficult, I personally am going to add in finding that he’s neutral since he knows all of this."
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2125.24,2133.548,"No, I don’t think the evidence shows that he knew all of this at that time, this, the purpose of the conference was to acquaint the Attorney General at this point of --"
1970.323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2133.548,2136.016,But did he issued the arrest warrant?
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2136.016,2138.714,"Yes, he issued the arrest warrant and four search warrants."
1970.323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2138.714,2143.848,"That he issued the arrest warrant, did he know more facts after that?"
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2143.848,2147.334,"No, at that time, all the facts had been presented to him, all of some which he --"
1970.323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2147.334,2148.451,To him?
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2148.451,2150.005,"To him, some of which he knew --"
1970.323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2150.005,2161.579,"In this conference room, what was the purpose of that, to present evidence or a search warrant or to sum up just how good a case you got against this man?"
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2161.579,2163.278,For both reasons Mr. Justice Marshall.
1970.323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2163.278,2169.538,"Well, did he participate in whether or not we’ve got a good case against this man?"
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2169.538,2179.699,The testimony of Chief MacGraney was that the conference was called for the purpose of presenting everything that had been -- was relevant to that -- the case at that time.
1970.323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2179.699,2181.962,But that’s what they were discussing weren’t they?
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2181.962,2182.547,Yes and also to --
1970.323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2182.547,2185.883,And the Attorney General was there doing the discussion?
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2185.883,2187.001,"Yes, and also --"
1970.323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2187.001,2197.049,"And then after the discussion, was he neutral at the beginning of the discussion?"
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2197.049,2208.56,"I would say he was neutral throughout the whole thing because at this point, when all of this according to chief MacGraney, when this was which he testified to, and this was presented to him, he did not have all these facts before him."
1970.323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2209.753,2212.083,Wasn’t he the prosecutor at that time?
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2212.083,2223.109,"He was -- under the New Hampshire law, the Attorney General is the chief prosecutor and in that capacity, he has control of any criminal case that particularly the murder case that comes to his attention."
1970.323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2223.109,2229.294,"And when did he -- well, do you agree with me that the prosecutor is not neutral?"
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2230.515,2234.327,I can accept that to a point Mr. Justice Marshall but not --
1970.323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2234.327,2235.455,What’s the point?
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2235.455,2239.223,"The point is that in this case, there was a distinguishing factor."
1970.323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2243.116,2249.807,"But suppose he’d also been a judge under New Hampshire law, could he have tried it?"
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2249.807,2257.005,"In effect he was also a judge, yes to a certain extent, to the extent that he could issue a search warrant lawfully under New Hampshire law."
1970.323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2257.005,2262.22,But could he have been a judge and found him guilty if New Hampshire law was that way?
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2262.37,2263.192,New Hampshire law was not that --
1970.323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2263.192,2272.271,"-- investigated, prosecuted, issued the warrant and convict it just because Massachusetts says that’s the law?"
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2272.271,2281.674,I don’t believe that that would be proper in any state and that was not the law in New Hampshire but it was the law that the justice of the peace could issue a search warrant under proper circumstances.
1970.323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2281.674,2284.697,But it didn’t say the Attorney General could?
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2284.697,2290.094,"It did say that a justice of the peace could do so and in fact, many justice of the peace who are not even --"
1970.323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2290.094,2306.706,"I have one final question, is there anything in the record which says that as of this moment, I 3817, Attorney General of New Hampshire seize, plea and prosecutor and become magistrate?"
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2310.368,2313.719,"I don’t quite follow the questionnaire there is nothing in the record of that nature, no --"
1970.323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2313.719,2317.786,I’m just trying to find out why he changed his head.
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2317.786,2320.064,"When he signed the search warrants and issued them, --"
1970.323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2320.064,2321.861,Changed them.
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2321.861,2324.688,It was perfectly proper for him to do so we state under these circumstances.
1970.323,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2324.688,2326.492,It’s all I want to know.
1970.323,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2326.492,2329.006,Did you say he was a justice of the peace?
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2329.006,2329.898,Yes Mr. Justice Black.
1970.323,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2329.898,2332.592,"How was he a justice of the peace, by what authority?"
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2332.592,2336.572,By the authority of the constitution and laws of the state of New Hampshire.
1970.323,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2336.572,2338.805,What does the constitution provide about it?
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2338.805,2355.666,"He applies for a commission and it’s issued to him by the Governor and the Governor’s counsel and a commission, he has sworn after the commission has issued before to other justices of the peace and the commission constitutes his warrant to act as a justice of the peace and this is --"
1970.323,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2355.666,2359.031,How long has that been in the constitution of New Hampshire?
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2359.031,2361.508,Since the initiation of the constitution as I understand it.
1970.323,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2361.508,2362.505,What date?
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2362.505,2365.591,Back in 1700 something Mr. Justice Black.
1970.323,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2365.591,2373.197,"Since that date, constitution has provided that the Attorney General as a justice of the peace?"
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2373.197,2381.869,"Not the Attorney General, anyone who applies for a commission as a justice of the peace and is issued a warrant by -- a commission rather by the Governor and counsel."
1970.323,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2381.869,2383.784,And he was issued a warrant?
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2383.784,2387.447,"Yes, he was issued a commission."
1970.323,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2387.447,2389.781,What was the sentence in this case?
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2389.781,2392.237,Life imprisonment Mr. Justice White.
1970.323,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2392.237,2400.596,(Inaudible)
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2400.596,2403.123,I’m not sure that it is but the --

1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2412.891,2416.315,The trial justice does the sentencing in a --
1970.323,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2416.315,2419.569,(Inaudible)
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2419.569,2425.92,"In a capital case, it’s up to the jury to recommend capital punishment or not."
1970.323,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2428.525,2429.742,There has been sentence?
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2429.742,2431.605,There has been a sentence of life imprisonment.
1970.323,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2431.605,2432.578,By?
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2432.578,2435.689,By the trial justice.
1970.323,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2435.689,2441.566,"In other words, (Inaudible)"
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2441.566,2446.7,That’s correct Your Honor.
1970.323,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2446.7,2453.427,"Now that you’ve already been in the record, may I ask you if you know about how many justices of the peace are there in New Hampshire?"
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2453.427,2454.694,"Yes, I was going to get to that."
1970.323,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2460.185,2460.734,Right.
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2460.734,2465.459,And this has been the -- incidentally the practices Mr. Cox pointed out.
1970.323,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2485.194,2486.09,About how many are there?
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2487.517,2488.849,"Hundreds, literally hundreds, the commission is a --"
1970.323,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2488.849,2492.462,"I thought thousands, literally thousands, are there?"
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2492.462,2494.393,"I wouldn’t say there are thousands, I would say --"
1970.323,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2494.393,2495.589,Population of the state is about half million?
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2495.589,2497.248,"Population is about 700,000."
1970.323,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2497.248,2498.601,"Yes, has grown greater."
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2498.601,2508.142,"And I can’t really answer your question definite, definite till it say that there are -- maybe thousands but it is a great number."
1970.323,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2508.142,2520.503,I’m familiar only with a little area up there quite closely familiar with that of a few hundred people and I’m sure there are dozens of justice of peace -- justices of the peace among those areas.
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2520.503,2523.86,"Every -- practically, every real estate broker, every --"
1970.323,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2523.86,2524.005,Yes.
1970.323,1,16377,alexander_j_kalinski,,2524.005,2528.155,"-- every accountant, everyone, many offices in which legal, --"
1970.323,2,15704,archibald_cox,,3386.807,3387.338,Thank you.
1970.323,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3387.338,3391.454,The case is submitted.
