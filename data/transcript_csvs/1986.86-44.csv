1986.86-44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.152,"WE will hear arguments next in No. 86-44, Shearson/American Express, Inc., and Mary Ann McNulty versus Eugene McMahon, et al.--"
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,38.453,66.442,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case is whether lower courts can refuse to enforce agreements to arbitrate claims under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and RICO, notwithstanding the clear Congressional directive in the Arbitration Act that agreements to arbitrate shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable."
1986.86-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,286.057,287.322,May I interrupt you there?
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,287.322,288.634,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,288.634,291.68,Who did create the 10(b)(5) private cause of action?
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,291.68,302.831,"The 10(b)(5) private cause of action was judicially implied by the courts, which held in effect that Congress impliedly intended to create an--"
1986.86-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,302.831,305.345,They held that Congress intended such a cause of action?
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,305.345,306.407,"--That's true, Your Honor."
1986.86-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,306.407,311.468,So that although it isn't expressed the source of the cause of action is nevertheless the statute.
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,311.468,316.325,"That is true, Your Honor, but that source is created by judicial implication and was not expressly created."
1986.86-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,316.325,323.385,I though you said the courts interpreted the legislation as indicating that Congress impliedly intended it.
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,323.385,331.194,The action itself is created by judicial implication but the reports by doing that were saying that Congress intended to create--
1986.86-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,331.194,333.178,So what is the ultimate source of the cause of action?
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,333.178,334.63,"--Congressional intent, Your Honor."
1986.86-44,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,347.953,352.091,Why is there a difference between an express and implied cause of action?
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,354.263,372.084,"However, recently in a number of decisions this Court has stated, most recently in Mitsubishi, that in examining whether Congress intended to prohibit a certain statute from the Arbitration Act, you must look to the Congressional intent expressed in that statute or its legislative history."
1986.86-44,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,391.513,396.12,"You are walking a bit of a tightrope walk, aren't you?"
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,396.12,398.542,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1986.86-44,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,398.542,399.573,You are walking a tightrope.
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,399.573,400.605,"We don't believe so, Your Honor."
1986.86-44,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,412.46,417.707,"Well, for a long time after Wilko the lower federal courts went right along with it."
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,421.439,423.454,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-44,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,423.454,424.376,Until we had a dictum.
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,424.376,426.437,In the Byrd case.
1986.86-44,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,426.437,427.234,Yes.
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,427.234,428.078,"That's right, Your Honor."
1986.86-44,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,429.436,430.811,And then they went off in all directions.
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,430.811,443.102,"--Well, it seems from an analysis of those cases in the federal courts, Your Honor, that after the Wilko decision there was an assumption on the part of the courts that the Wilko doctrine applied to 10(b) claims simply because it was a Securities Act claim."
1986.86-44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,511.84,514.525,"We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock, Mr. Krebsbach."
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,539.908,541.391,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.86-44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,572.941,577.189,xxx to overrule it.
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,577.189,580.985,"--Not in a sense to overrule it, Your Honor, but to simply acknowledge--"
1986.86-44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,580.985,582.266,To leave it as a derelict.
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,582.719,583.812,--It is inapplicable today.
1986.86-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,587.733,588.092,I'm sorry--
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,588.092,588.436,--Excuse me.
1986.86-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,588.436,590.841,"--What does that mean, it is inapplicable today, if you don't overrule it?"
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,590.841,603.415,"What we are saying in effect, Your Honor, is that although Wilko may have been correctly decided in 1953, the concerns of the Wilko court are no longer applicable today, so that Wilko's holding should no longer be applicable."
1986.86-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,603.415,603.913,What does that mean?
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,604.96,606.364,"As of today, yes."
1986.86-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,606.364,607.38,All right.
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,607.38,615.362,The SEC was given authorization by Congress in Section 19 of the Exchange Act to supervise arbitration procedures.
1986.86-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,633.229,636.353,"Yes, but what if you have arbitration before some other organization?"
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,641.865,642.865,"No, Your Honor."
1986.86-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,643.428,651.581,"So what if somebody comes in with you know, an arbitration agreement before some unheard of and not necessarily first rate organization?"
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,654.298,662.03,"--In the first instance, Your Honor, to answer your question, in an examination of Congressional intent we do not believe it is proper to get into that question."
1986.86-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,673.869,680.726,"Yes, but in Wilko we said it did, and we said the reason was that we weren't sure that arbitration could preserve the rights."
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,693.986,704.122,"--Certainly, Your Honor, petitioners feel that with respect to SRO arbitration under the SEC's jurisdiction arbitration is certainly proper today and the Wilko court's concerns are alleviated."
1986.86-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,735.625,743.309,"I understand, but the first question whether it is arbitrable at all or not is not the point that you were raising."
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,743.309,744.169,"That is true, Your Honor."
1986.86-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,744.169,750.135,You were raising the point that we should change our view in Wilko because arbitration is now better than it used to be.
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,771.314,778.545,with respect to that particular point we believe that Wilko's concerns about the adequacy of arbitration were improper.
1986.86-44,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,845.941,852.548,What requirements have been placed by the SEC on your arbitration proceedings if they were to go forward?
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,852.548,865.151,--There is an entire Uniform Code of Arbitration which has been enacted after public hearings and approval by the SEC which basically provides all the guidelines and rules under which arbitration is held.
1986.86-44,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,883.456,886.659,And how are the arbitrators selected under those regulations?
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,886.659,896.718,--The arbitrators are selected by panels of arbitrators at the various SROs which are taken from the general public and from the industry and from business and from all walks of life.
1986.86-44,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,915.975,918.427,Does the claimant get to select an arbitrator?
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,918.427,929.549,"The way it is done, Justice O'Connor, is that a number of panelists are picked from the common pool by the arbitration forum itself, by the arbitration department."
1986.86-44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,957.411,961.908,These procedures now enable an arbitration to last as long as a lawsuit?
1986.86-44,0,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,966.751,968.063,"I understand the point you are making, Your Honor."
1986.86-44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1185.6,1187.458,"Thank you, Mr. Krebsbach."
1986.86-44,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1189.395,1209.888,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the Securities and Exchange Commission agrees with petitioners that the arbitration agreement at issue in this case should be enforced."
1986.86-44,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1261.491,1264.193,Are you taking a position on the RICO claims?
1986.86-44,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1264.193,1266.645,"No, the SEC has no position on the RICO claims--"
1986.86-44,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1266.645,1266.88,Why not?
1986.86-44,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1266.88,1274.189,--The SEC has no supervisory or enforcement responsibilities specifically for RICO.
1986.86-44,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1276.157,1276.516,Now--
1986.86-44,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1279.89,1280.359,--That's right.
1986.86-44,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1282.624,1283.264,They have seen the light?
1986.86-44,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1285.732,1287.029,"Well, they have seen this particular light this time."
1986.86-44,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1287.059,1290.291,That was my question also.
1986.86-44,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1290.291,1295.102,"Yes, the SEC took a different position in a Third Circuit case in 1975."
1986.86-44,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1298.975,1301.163,May I just ask one other thing?
1986.86-44,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1306.692,1318.999,"If overruling means that under the current statute which is different from the statute as it existed in 1953, the results should be different, yes, we do think that Wilko should be overruled."
1986.86-44,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1322.685,1322.95,I understand.
1986.86-44,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1324.466,1326.356,"--That's right, the rationale we advance would--"
1986.86-44,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1326.356,1329.823,So both '33 Act and '34 Act claims would be subject to arbitration.
1986.86-44,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1329.823,1330.042,--That's right.
1986.86-44,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1336.633,1337.273,"Substantive, right."
1986.86-44,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1337.273,1337.913,And as long--
1986.86-44,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1337.913,1341.13,"And really you are saying it was incorrectly decided in the first instance, too, I take it--"
1986.86-44,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1341.13,1348.753,"--Well, in 1953 the securities laws were not what they are today."
1986.86-44,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1349.143,1354.251,"--I understand, but the same argument could have been made under the different statutory language then, I think."
1986.86-44,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1354.251,1359.905,--There could have been no argument at the time that the SEC had a clear oversight authority over self-regulating agencies.
1986.86-44,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1359.905,1367.808,"No, I understand, but the substantive argument, the point about only substantive protections of the Act are not waivable."
1986.86-44,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1367.808,1369.619,That's right.
1986.86-44,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1369.619,1371.275,So that would have come to a different conclusion.
1986.86-44,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1371.275,1371.463,That's right.
1986.86-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1378.491,1383.036,You are not really urging an overruling of Wilko entirely.
1986.86-44,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1396.936,1398.967,"That is right, although the--"
1986.86-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1398.967,1400.279,So there would be something left to Wilko.
1986.86-44,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1400.279,1413.727,"--Absolutely, although I believe that the agreement to arbitrate in Wilko itself did give the customer a right to go to an SRO it's just that the authority that the SEC now has over SRO arbitrations did not exist at the time."
1986.86-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1413.727,1414.178,I understand.
1986.86-44,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1424.003,1428.86,"Less in terms of numbers at cases, I am not sure."
1986.86-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1430.501,1439.31,The petitioners' approach as I understand it would eliminate any application of Wilko to 10(b).
1986.86-44,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1445.027,1446.572,--I believe that that is part of it.
1986.86-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1446.572,1462.581,"Yours would leave it applicable to both 12 and 10(b), arguably 10(b), anyway, although we would have to decide the point, I presume, but it would only be applicable to them where you are not using an SRO, right?"
1986.86-44,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1462.581,1463.409,"Yes, that's right."
1986.86-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1463.409,1471.281,"Now, which one of those two would leave more of this litigation in the federal courts?"
1986.86-44,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1471.281,1478.669,I would expect that... I guess I am again not sure of the numbers.
1986.86-44,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1503.439,1516.201,"Has there been a significant increase in claims against people affected by this, members of the exchange since Wilko was decided?"
1986.86-44,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1516.201,1518.715,--I think that there has.
1986.86-44,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1740.22,1740.752,"Thank you, Mr. Taranto."
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,1743.703,1756.198,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Court, I am here representing the respondents in this case, Eugene McMahon, Julia McMahon, and the four pension trusts."
1986.86-44,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1902.076,1902.654,Excuse me.
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,1915.992,1918.899,"--No, Justice Scalia."
1986.86-44,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1924.177,1926.692,"We would say that is okay Sophistication wouldn't make any difference, right?"
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,1926.692,1928.175,That is correct.
1986.86-44,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1928.175,1934.204,"If the parties want to go for sophistication, so if they sign this agreement and they are willing to go for a sophisticated panel, it is all right then."
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,1934.204,1940.951,"Well, I am saying... I am saying that when they signed this agreement they didn't know what they were agreeing to."
1986.86-44,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1951.462,1953.259,That is a different argument.
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,1953.259,1954.446,It is.
1986.86-44,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1994.508,2009.284,"But isn't that inherent in the system of arbitration and Congress surely knew that and understood it when Congress chose to enact the arbitration law, which said we will give effect to contracts to arbitrate?"
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,2041.833,2046.05,I would like to answer that first with your latter premise.
1986.86-44,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2061.495,2069.774,Should we not assume it for the purpose of deciding the effect of the Arbitration Act on the Securities Exchange Act?
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,2069.774,2071.804,--If we assume that it is--
1986.86-44,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2071.804,2072.351,Shouldn't we do it just for that purpose?
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,2072.351,2072.71,--Sure.
1986.86-44,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2103.541,2112.99,"No, but Justice O'Connor's point is that the composition of the arbitration panels in these SROs is not much different from the ordinary arbitration panel."
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,2129.032,2131.077,"True, but we don't have that here, do we, Justice Scalia?"
1986.86-44,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2131.077,2136.091,"But isn't that what Congress had in mind, Justice O'Connor was asking, when they were talking about arbitration?"
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,2138.058,2141.823,"I think the response is yes, Congress did probably have that in mind."
1986.86-44,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2196.911,2209.751,"Well, of course, the Solicitor General makes the argument on behalf of the SEC that the antiwaiver provision extends only to substantive provisions of the Securities Exchange Act."
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,2209.751,2211.079,We disagree.
1986.86-44,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2231.367,2242.536,Is there any legislative history specifically that would guide us on the intention of the antiwaiver provision that has come to your attention?
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,2242.536,2262.167,"I believe we have to look at the Act itself and if we can't find the answer in the Act itself then we have to look at what the legislature has done, and I can run down for you, Justice O'Connor, what has occurred subsequent to the enactment of the '34 Act, and I think we have our answer there."
1986.86-44,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2479.939,2481.064,Is that rule still in effect?
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,2481.064,2483.406,--As far as I know it is still on the books.
1986.86-44,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2483.406,2483.797,It has never been withdrawn?
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,2483.797,2493.638,"Justice Blackmun, the government seems to want to repeal it by filing their amicus brief in this case, but I haven't seen anything other than that."
1986.86-44,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2493.638,2497.416,"Neither have I, and that is why I asked whether it is still outstanding."
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,2497.416,2514.379,Getting back to Rule 15C2-2 for a second--
1986.86-44,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2514.379,2518.096,"Well, you have established that they were either wrong then or they are wrong now."
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,2521.281,2529.95,--They are wrong now because of the purposes behind the federal securities statutes and that is to protect the public customer from abuses in the marketplace.
1986.86-44,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2546.647,2552.801,That really doesn't go to the basis of our decision.
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,2591.972,2602.233,"We don't believe it is, and I started giving the Number One reason, and that is having the industry representative appear on the panel of the SROs."
1986.86-44,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2869.03,2879.074,"Well, that isn't really the basis of our prior holdings, is it, or the Court of Appeals' holding in this case?"
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,2879.074,2883.292,"No, the Court of Appeals did not hold that, Your Honor."
1986.86-44,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2886.914,2887.898,Nor Wilko?
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,2887.898,2892.007,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-44,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2902.439,2908.734,"But don't you think, as has been suggested by some of the questions from the bench, that that really is another question?"
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,2924.806,2936.614,"Your Honor, this Court can put aside this portion of my argument and rule in favor of the Second Circuit's opinion down the line and I would be perfectly happy."
1986.86-44,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2942.268,2945.704,Do you want to spend your 30 minutes arguing about it?
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,2945.704,2950.014,"--No, I didn't mean to do that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.86-44,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3062.39,3066.42,"With the understanding that it is not in the record, any of this."

1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,3076.337,3083.726,"--I believe, Your Honor, that if you would permit us to make a supplemental filing, I would be happy to add it to the--"
1986.86-44,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3083.726,3084.195,It wouldn't be in the record.
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,3084.195,3090.784,--We have made provisions with the clerk of this Court--
1986.86-44,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3090.784,3097.86,"I don't see what you can do to bring before us what was said on 60 Minutes, a television program."
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,3097.86,3104.811,--I would respectfully request that Congressman Dingell's... the import of Congressman Dingell's letter--
1986.86-44,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3104.811,3109.84,"You may make your request to the Chief Justice, but not assume that it is going to be done."
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,3113.011,3115.181,--I am sure you are.
1986.86-44,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3115.181,3133.143,"Mr. Eppenstein, while you are interrupted, may I back up and ask a factual question that has come to mind as a result of Justice Blackmun's question about Rule 15(c)(2), which I guess was promulgated in 1983?"
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,3149.574,3151.182,"I wish that were so, Justice Stevens."
1986.86-44,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3156.743,3167.16,"--Under your reading of that rule, of course, we don't have the whole text of it in front of us, would the agreement that your client signed have been prohibited if it had been executed after 1983?"
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,3167.16,3170.174,"Yes, we believe so."
1986.86-44,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3190.339,3200.194,"And it is your contention that the Commission's position in this case is not merely that they have changed their view, but that the rule they promulgated in '83 probably is an invalid rule."
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,3204.865,3210.284,I think they are fighting an inconsistent position without any justification for doing it.
1986.86-44,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3336.531,3339.264,0 xxx.
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,3339.264,3340.951,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1986.86-44,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3340.951,3344.496,"Volume decrease, or just the percentage?"
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,3345.23,3347.135,The volume decrease.
1986.86-44,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3347.135,3347.495,--Volume.
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,3347.495,3352.898,"Unfortunately, the SIA didn't break out the amount of cases that were just under 10(b)."
1986.86-44,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3358.177,3361.395,"A billion dollars here, a billion dollars there, pretty soon it adds up to real money."
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,3361.395,3361.645,--Yes.
1986.86-44,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3405.454,3409.079,"You mean because they had all that money, an individual could not have said, I won't sign this agreement?"
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,3409.079,3414.498,"The individual, when this agreement was presented to him, had no choice."
1986.86-44,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3414.498,3415.967,"He could have said, I won't sign it."
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,3415.967,3418.216,Because it was common practice at the firms to have this type of agreement.
1986.86-44,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3418.216,3420.48,"Yes, but the fact they had $400 million didn't make them sign that agreement."
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,3428.165,3433.1,I would then say that there is no room for them to go elsewhere.
1986.86-44,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3433.1,3435.521,And some of your clients are not individuals.
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,3435.521,3436.677,That's correct.
1986.86-44,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3448.329,3450.436,"And the individuals who have large claims, you say."
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,3456.482,3458.996,"--No, I wouldn't agree with that."
1986.86-44,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3480.755,3482.629,Can we take judicial notice of that?
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,3483.566,3483.832,"No, Your Honor."
1986.86-44,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3500.496,3512.819,How do you suggest that we identify those statutes that have such a strong public policy behind them that arbitration agreements should not be enforced at all?
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,3512.819,3523.598,"I think, Justice White, you will have to look at the statute and you will have to look at the legislative history and you will have to look at the judicial interpretations, and I submit that over--"
1986.86-44,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3523.598,3525.878,Congress doesn't say anything at all about it.
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,3530.282,3534.28,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1986.86-44,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3534.28,3537.138,"Arbitration is allowable in some of them, and not in others."
1986.86-44,2,42657,theodore_grant_eppenstein,,3537.138,3547.025,"--Yes, I believe so, but I think that the antiwaiver provision in this case governs the fact that they are not to be enforced."
1986.86-44,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3547.025,3549.727,"Thank you, Mr. Eppenstein."
1986.86-44,3,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,3551.664,3554.975,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.86-44,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3576.498,3578.403,"Well, but that law, that rule is still in effect."
1986.86-44,3,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,3579.715,3584.619,"That is true, Your Honor, and I presume that rule will continue to be in effect pending this Court's clarification of the issue."
1986.86-44,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3584.619,3589.851,"You say it doesn't... the language of the rule is correct, it just means something else?"
1986.86-44,3,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,3596.255,3599.144,Under the current interpretation of the law as we--
1986.86-44,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3599.144,3606.641,--Does it says in the rule itself under our present view of the law it would be misleading but if we change our mind it will no longer be misleading?
1986.86-44,3,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,3606.641,3608.11,"--It doesn't say that specifically, Your Honor."
1986.86-44,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3608.11,3609.874,But that is in effect what you think it was meant to say?
1986.86-44,3,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,3609.874,3610.562,That is the essence of it.
1986.86-44,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3610.562,3615.092,"It is not their view of the law that they are talking about, it is the court's view of the law, as I understand the rule."
1986.86-44,3,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,3615.092,3615.264,Exactly.
1986.86-44,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3615.669,3619.104,"What they are saying is that given Wilko, this statement is misleading."
1986.86-44,3,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,3624.072,3624.602,"That is exactly true, Your Honor."
1986.86-44,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3624.602,3628.132,But Wilko thus far has not been changed.
1986.86-44,3,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,3628.132,3629.414,"That is also true, Your Honor."
1986.86-44,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3629.414,3632.584,And therefore the rule is correct as it now stands.
1986.86-44,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3638.254,3639.396,The case is submitted.
