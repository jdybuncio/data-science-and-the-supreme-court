1989.88-1150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.428,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 88-1150, Missouri v. Kalima Jenkins."
1989.88-1150,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,9.457,16.262,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.88-1150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,116.066,134.47,"Mr. Farr, we occasionally run into a situation here where a court of appeals or a state court will enter a judgment nunc pro tunc where the Petitioner has had his time for certiorari expire just so that the person will be able to petition in what they think is a timely manner."
1989.88-1150,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,142.163,147.268,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think there's any reason to treat the order in that particular way for a couple of reasons."
1989.88-1150,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,167.762,168.921,A regular practice?
1989.88-1150,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,168.921,169.813,--I'm sorry?
1989.88-1150,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,169.813,171.432,A regular practice?
1989.88-1150,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,171.432,188.525,"That is what we understand from the clerk's office, that this is a practice that was instituted well before the petition was filed in this case and that the court of appeals does follow, and it is... our understanding is the only reason it was not followed in this case was simply a matter of inadvertence in the clerk's office."
1989.88-1150,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,188.525,192.116,So there are no instances in which that was not done?
1989.88-1150,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,192.116,196.479,"Your Honor, I can't certainly say that I know of no instances in which it was not done."
1989.88-1150,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,207.756,210.658,"The Eighth Circuit has no rule to that effect, does it?"
1989.88-1150,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,210.658,212.579,"--It does not have an express rule to that effect, no."
1989.88-1150,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,212.579,222.556,Was there anything in the petition for rehearing en banc that indicated that it was intended to serve both purposes?
1989.88-1150,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,222.556,223.678,"No, Your Honor, there was not."
1989.88-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,257.548,261.673,The petition... it used the word rehearing.
1989.88-1150,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,261.673,263.503,I'm sorry?
1989.88-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,263.503,265.673,"It used the word rehearing, at least."
1989.88-1150,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,265.673,266.574,"Our particular petition did, yes."
1989.88-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,266.574,267.856,It didn't say just a suggestion.
1989.88-1150,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,267.856,268.457,That's correct.
1989.88-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,268.457,269.856,It said rehearing.
1989.88-1150,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,269.856,271.429,"It used the word rehearing specifically, that's correct."
1989.88-1150,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,271.429,277.213,"Mr. Farr, did you say our clerk's office treats this as a permissible practice?"
1989.88-1150,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,277.213,279.194,Just when... I'm sorry if I wasn't clear.
1989.88-1150,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,1627.246,1637.743,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1150,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1738.869,1753.347,"May I ask right there, supposing at the time the Eighth Circuit initially denied the petition for rehearing en banc, it had said the petition for rehearing and the suggestion for rehearing en banc are both denied, basically what they said in the nunc [inaudible]."
1989.88-1150,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,1756.52,1759.522,"Well, it obviously would be a more difficult case for us."
1989.88-1150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1794.915,1800.928,But surely it's up to the Eighth Circuit what it takes before the Eighth Circuit to file a petition for rehearing.
1989.88-1150,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,1800.928,1802.07,Justice Scalia--
1989.88-1150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1802.07,1814.559,"Could the Eighth Circuit if it wished... indeed, haven't some other circuits done so explicitly, said that when you file a petition for rehearing en banc, it shall be deemed to be a petition for rehearing with suggestion for rehearing en banc?"
1989.88-1150,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,1814.559,1821.923,"--Justice Scalia, we agree that a circuit court can do that and is certainly free to treat the petitions in any way it wishes."
1989.88-1150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1896.953,1897.474,Mr. Snyder--
1989.88-1150,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,1897.474,1898.726,--circuits refer to them as suggestions.
1989.88-1150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1898.726,1902.967,"--Mr. Snyder, it's not only counsel who says that that's wrong but it's the Eighth Circuit."
1989.88-1150,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,1927.293,1928.304,Well--
1989.88-1150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1928.304,1931.965,"You know, I... I'm prepared to do that where... where there is a lot of evidence to that effect, but--"
1989.88-1150,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,1933.827,1947.246,"--Justice Scalia, I do not suggest that; however, I do suggest that, first of all, the failure of the mandate to issue does not, in our view, indicate that the court was treating this as a petition for rehearing."
1989.88-1150,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1963.728,1972.263,Would the circuit court have had the authority during the pendency of this petition to amend the panel opinion?
1989.88-1150,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,1982.001,1982.829,"Justice Kennedy, yes."
1989.88-1150,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2170.562,2181.938,"You say, then, that unless there's a rule like there is in some other circuits, a practice uniformly followed by the circuit but not confided to rule, is not sufficient?"
1989.88-1150,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2181.938,2195.96,"I believe it would not be sufficient, Mr. Chief Justice, particularly because this Court I think is not in a good position to engage in evidentiary hearings or proceedings to try to determine what the practices might be."
1989.88-1150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2310.964,2312.304,"Why use the Constitution, Mr. Snyder?"
1989.88-1150,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2324.733,2330.317,"Justice Scalia, I think... I think that is the... the implication of my position."
1989.88-1150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2361.859,2387.765,"Suppose, Mr. Snyder, there... there are a large number of people who are violating the federal law, a really large number, and the courts' marshals can't possibly stop the violation, and the court says, you know, what I really need is an army and, you know, it tells the executive, the federal executive, this situation is out of control, they're violating federal law, and the executive, for... for whatever reason, declines to use federal troops."
1989.88-1150,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2403.123,2403.753,No.
1989.88-1150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2407.848,2408.258,I'm not talking about inappropriate.
1989.88-1150,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2410.819,2414.102,--I think as a matter of pure power--
1989.88-1150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2414.102,2414.931,It does.
1989.88-1150,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2414.931,2420.557,--the Court is required to find the appropriate constitutional remedy.
1989.88-1150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2438.916,2439.377,"No, I'm just talking about power."
1989.88-1150,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2443.711,2445.381,"--If it is... yes, if it is practicable."
1989.88-1150,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2473.0,2486.568,"--Well... well, notice that... that in the Little Rock incident, the President called out the troops, and I assume the President and Congress are here to assist the... this federal court if it finds that Missouri is in violation of the Constitution and the federal court cannot correct it."
1989.88-1150,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2486.568,2492.192,--I would hope that the... the legislative and executive branches would cooperate with--
1989.88-1150,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2492.192,2496.155,"Well, so then it's not... so then it's not necessarily a case where there's no other remedy."
1989.88-1150,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2496.155,2510.854,"--Well, in this case, turning to whether here there was any other remedy, it is absolutely true that in the courts below there were two possible remedies... two possible approaches to funding this remedy that were considered."
1989.88-1150,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2538.613,2542.665,"Well, it certainly did more than that, at least for one year, did it not?"
1989.88-1150,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2542.665,2543.907,The district court--
1989.88-1150,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2543.907,2546.819,The district court did more than that.
1989.88-1150,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2546.819,2554.612,"--Yes, I agree that the district court, the way it phrased its order, it phrased it as implementing the tax order."
1989.88-1150,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2555.814,2563.278,Has the district court ever implemented that order to increase the property tax levy to $4?
1989.88-1150,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2563.278,2567.542,--The district court order was initially implemented prior to the Eighth Circuit's ruling.
1989.88-1150,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2590.757,2591.188,"Well, for the future."
1989.88-1150,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2597.001,2613.132,"--The levy had been in place prior to the Eighth Circuit's ruling, and the Eighth Circuit did not try to apply its ruling retroactively, keeping in mind that the practical effect of the Eighth Circuit's ruling was to... likely still to allow for a tax."
1989.88-1150,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2613.132,2616.934,"So, the Eighth Circuit did not disapprove what had happened before."
1989.88-1150,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2621.417,2624.329,"Yes, it did leave the levy in place that--"
1989.88-1150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2624.329,2626.571,"Excuse me, I though that they affirmed that."
1989.88-1150,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2630.183,2631.703,"--Yes, Justice White."
1989.88-1150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2631.703,2633.814,And then modified the procedure for the future.
1989.88-1150,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2633.814,2636.018,For the future as of the day of that opinion.
1989.88-1150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2636.018,2640.309,"So, they affirmed, expressly affirmed, that additional levy for those years."
1989.88-1150,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2640.309,2645.134,They affirmed the levy that had been in place up to the date of the Court of Appeals opinion--
1989.88-1150,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3450.32,3451.84,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.88-1150,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3489.824,3490.966,"Well, I'm... you know, I'm not sure."
1989.88-1150,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3511.689,3514.942,"--But Justice Scalia, there's no such absolute certainty in any event."
1989.88-1150,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3612.927,3615.419,"Thank you, Mr. Farr."
