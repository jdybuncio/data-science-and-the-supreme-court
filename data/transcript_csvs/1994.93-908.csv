1994.93-908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.606,"We'll hear argument now in Number 93-908, Charles Reich v. Marcus E. Collins."
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,10.387,14.433,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1994.93-908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,147.832,159.703,"Well, Mr. Henson, in your view, what can a State do to ensure that taxes are paid without running afoul of this coercion, or whatever you want to call it?"
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,159.703,162.404,Without triggering the requirement to provide meaningful--
1994.93-908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,162.404,162.795,Yes.
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,162.795,163.42,--backwardlooking relief?
1994.93-908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,196.5,199.734,"Well, can a State require payment under protest?"
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,199.734,202.186,--I don't think there's any question that McKesson clearly holds that.
1994.93-908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,202.186,204.357,"And payment, rather than just protest."
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,204.357,205.981,"I think that's clear from McKesson, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,215.414,228.549,"Would you agree that if the State's insurance consisted of a lien and interest running on any unpaid balance at something substantially equivalent to market rate, that that would create no problem?"
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,228.549,231.486,"I think that's a closer case, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,234.203,236.547,What about the posting of a bond?
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,236.547,247.823,"By itself, no financial sanctions, no penalty, in that case, Your Honor, I think that's very much like the Chief Justice's payunderprotest hypothetical, basically."
1994.93-908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,247.823,255.633,"Well, when you say no penalty, does that assume that if the taxpayer prevails, he's entitled to reimbursement for the bond premium?"
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,255.633,257.243,Well--
1994.93-908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,257.243,258.742,Suppose he's out the bond premium?
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,258.742,260.789,"--I'm sorry, I didn't hear the question."
1994.93-908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,260.789,265.786,"Suppose the taxpayer has to pay for the cost of the bond premium, and there's no reimbursement in the event he prevails."
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,265.786,273.376,"That, to my ear that sounds like he runs afoul of McKesson."
1994.93-908,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,281.326,281.826,What if--
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,281.826,284.356,That's a real cost that the taxpayer begins to bear there.
1994.93-908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,284.356,285.152,--Yes.
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,287.183,288.463,That's right.
1994.93-908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,288.463,290.854,"--instead of doing that, and that would be okay."
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,293.134,296.57,All right.
1994.93-908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,296.57,296.992,"That would be okay, wouldn't it?"
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,296.992,298.351,"I think you're right, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,303.348,304.583,Let me just ask a little bit about what we have here.
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,316.703,319.545,Ex post facto?
1994.93-908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,319.545,319.904,Yes.
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,319.904,323.012,"I think that would be unconstitutional, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,323.012,324.839,Is that what happened here?
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,324.839,327.495,"Well, it was rep... effectively, yes."
1994.93-908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,342.333,365.058,"Isn't the problem that Georgia supreme court said, no, it doesn't apply to a constitutionally invalid tax, that's what our law is now, that's what our law was then, and we have the same right to take the position, in fact obligation, that everything we say about what the law is, was, is fully retroactive, the same right and obligation that the U.S. courts do?"
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,365.058,379.224,"If... if that was the case, I would agree with Your Honor, except here, both the... the legislative history of the statute clearly established that the purpose of the statute was to provide for refunds of taxes that were later declared unconstitutional."
1994.93-908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,391.656,392.125,"Well, you--"
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,392.125,392.484,So--
1994.93-908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,392.484,394.843,--Do we have to hold that Georgia changed its law?
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,406.743,407.681,"--Precisely, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,407.681,410.164,And... but isn't that the only point you have to make?
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,423.722,424.768,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,427.033,443.042,"Well, is Georgia now, as you understand it, asserting sovereign immunity and just saying, we do not waive our sovereign immunity for backwardlooking relief?"
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,445.884,448.977,"--That does seem to be their latest idea, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,448.977,453.458,What if this suit were in Federal court?
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,461.081,467.798,I think we would have a problem under the Eleventh Amendment with respect to the Department of Revenue as a defendant.
1994.93-908,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,476.513,482.213,But you say that if the suit is in the State's own court it can't assert sovereign immunity.
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,482.213,486.805,"--Well, no, Your Honor, not under the circumstances of this case, and particularly here."
1994.93-908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,507.547,513.169,"Well, this is a pretty Pyrrhic victory, then, for... maybe not for your clients, but certainly for future taxpayers who are treated similarly."
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,524.009,525.18,"No, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,525.18,526.118,I thought you said that.
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,533.084,536.769,"I'm not suggesting for a moment, Your Honor, that the State can close the door."
1994.93-908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,575.441,579.768,"Well, Mr. Henson, what if we decide this point the way you want us to."
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,594.512,597.73,I'm not sure I under--
1994.93-908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,597.73,615.472,"Well, if sovereign immunity is not a defense on the part of the State, even though... which has not waived it for a claim for a tax refund, how about a constitutional claim, or asserted claim for other kinds of injuries, personal injuries, say, at the behest of a State vehicle, or something like that?"
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,618.346,628.201,"--Well, I believe the Court's jurisprudence in the Fourteenth Amendment area is what answers the question for this case."
1994.93-908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,729.896,747.388,"Are you saying that the system that Georgia now has in place... let's say there has been no appearance that there was a refund remedy available, and what Georgia now lists as its remedies is all there is, and it's clear that in this class of cases there's no refund remedy."
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,754.744,767.755,"No, Your Honor, because of the summary remedies and sanctions that the State has established, and they concede in their brief they've established these, and they concede that the purpose of these is to require taxpayers to make payment."
1994.93-908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,778.765,789.199,"Isn't the State saying that if you... if there's been an assessment and you appealed it successfully, you would lose nothing, you would not... there would be no penalty, and the only thing you would lose is the bond premium?"
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,789.199,792.027,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,823.623,828.059,"Incidentally, if that were to happen, what is the mechanism for the taxpayer to get redress."
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,836.65,838.867,"There is none that I'm aware of, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,844.255,850.581,Has there been any administrative practice of paying the money back if it's been seized and the assessment procedure continues?
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,850.581,854.314,"--There's none that I'm aware of, Your Honor, and there's none reflected in the record in this case."
1994.93-908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,854.314,865.59,"Do I understand you correctly that you're not seeking a refund back to 1980, that it's only 3 years back from the first time you made a protest noise, is that correct?"
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,865.59,867.074,"Well, that's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,889.284,891.408,You don't really mean foolishly believed.
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,891.408,891.892,I'm... I'm--
1994.93-908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,891.892,892.455,You're--
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,892.455,893.563,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,895.453,897.795,--You mean reasonably believed.
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,898.608,910.792,"--In short, Georgia, what Georgia really wants here is the discretion to pick and choose when it wants to apply its refund statute."
1994.93-908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,975.734,984.293,"Well, McKesson did not involve a case where the State had not waived its sovereign immunity, did it?"
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,987.041,989.477,"Well, that's an interesting point, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1036.926,1037.708,I have just one question.
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,1037.708,1038.114,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1038.114,1044.861,"Is your argument equally strong if the basis of invalidity is addressed entirely on the statute, rather than the Constitution?"
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,1044.861,1046.096,I'm not--
1994.93-908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1046.096,1053.374,"Well, in Davis, the Court construed section 111, and arguably it may or may not have decided a constitutional question."
1994.93-908,0,19139,carlton_m_henson,,1054.593,1056.012,--I'm not sure that it does.
1994.93-908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1059.902,1065.743,"Very well, Mr. Henson."
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1069.664,1073.522,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1994.93-908,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1100.698,1106.118,"But subject to 12 percent a year and the 25 percent penalty, isn't that correct?"
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1106.118,1111.35,"Georgia does provide for 12 percent annual interest in the event the taxpayer loses, that's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1111.35,1112.99,And a penalty up to 25 percent?
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1112.99,1116.082,There's the possibility of an assertion of a penalty.
1994.93-908,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1116.082,1120.332,"But nobody can tell in advance whether it will be asserted or not, so I mean, it has to be considered."
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1125.641,1132.514,"The way one guards against its imposition, Your Honor, is to assert reasonable arguments only."
1994.93-908,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1136.355,1142.103,On the theory that a State official will not act unreasonably to penalize a taxpayer?
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1142.103,1145.258,"--Well, the question, Your Honor, is whether the taxpayer's position was reasonable."
1994.93-908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1163.376,1171.185,Has it been determined that a misperception of the law is ever reasonable cause?
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1187.272,1187.819,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1187.819,1189.381,That's Georgia law.
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1189.381,1192.567,"I believe it is, Your Honor, and I say that... there are no--"
1994.93-908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1192.567,1193.989,"You believe it, or there are cases to that effect?"
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1193.989,1212.309,"--There are no cases that have interpreted that section, Your Honor, and I submit the reason that's the case is because there simply have been no instances where the Revenue Department has tried to assert that penalty in situations where it was arguable that the taxpayer had a reasonable basis for his argument."
1994.93-908,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1212.309,1218.68,So where is it established that that determination one way or another by the Georgia Commissioner would be reviewable in court?
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1227.505,1234.988,"Well, Your Honor, the particular penalty would have to be assessed by the Revenue Department, and the issuance of the assessment triggers the right to go into court."
1994.93-908,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1238.486,1248.81,And one of the... a reviewable item would be the Commissioner's discretion about whether this was a reasonable action on the taxpayer's part?
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1248.81,1249.31,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1249.31,1259.041,"And you're saying there are cases which the taxpayer has lost on the merits before the Commissioner, but which... in which he did not attempt to impose any penalty?"
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1259.041,1267.459,"I'm not aware of any instance, Your Honor, where the Revenue Department has, in fact, attempted to impose this penalty on someone who has contested their liability."
1994.93-908,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1267.459,1275.017,Is there also a potential criminal penalty in Georgia for nonpayment of taxes when due?
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1275.017,1279.298,There are two criminal statutes to which the petitioner in this case refers.
1994.93-908,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1306.77,1308.817,"Again, there are no cases, I suppose."
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1308.817,1309.02,"No, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1318.812,1332.495,Would a reasonable taxpayer in Georgia in the 1980's have assumed that a post deprivation remedy was available by way of refund for an unconstitutional tax?
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1332.495,1339.522,"We cannot assert, Your Honor, that it would have been unreasonable to have read the refund statute in that way."
1994.93-908,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1367.215,1373.666,Was one of the bases for the supreme court of Georgia's opinion that an injunctive action could have been brought?
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1373.666,1377.399,"It's last opinion in this case, Your Honor?"
1994.93-908,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1377.399,1377.68,Yes.
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1377.68,1387.989,The Georgia supreme court concluded that one of the predeprivation remedies that could have been brought by these taxpayers was an action for declaratory or injunctive relief prior to the time when the taxes were due.
1994.93-908,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1387.989,1403.81,"And the statute on page 20 of the blue brief, Georgia 48-7-84, on its face says no action for the purpose of restraining the assessment shall be maintained in any court."
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1416.274,1432.769,"Your Honor, one thing we would like to note is, until the filing of the brief in this Court, the petitioner had never mentioned that particular code section, had never pointed it out to the parties or to the Georgia supreme court as representing a bar to that particular type of action."
1994.93-908,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1432.769,1436.391,"Well, then, the Georgia supreme court might be wrong in saying there's an injunctive possibility here?"
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1436.391,1437.031,"Oh, no, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1440.75,1442.014,"Well, what about the statute?"
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1442.014,1446.7,"--That particular code section, again, it's a statute that has never been applied or interpreted."
1994.93-908,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1469.94,1480.295,"Well, the question is whether or not this was clear to the taxpayer at the time, and the Georgia supreme court cites, as I recall, a sales tax case, Beam, and this is a statute that applies to income tax."
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1480.295,1498.867,"Well, I believe, Your Honor, that the question in this case, we take... we initially take... we dispute the taxpayer's statement of the standard of clarity that a predeprivation remedy has to provide before it can satisfy a State's due process obligations."
1994.93-908,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1521.919,1524.387,"Well, injunctive action is a remedy, isn't it?"
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1524.387,1529.042,We say it's a predeprivation procedure that the--
1994.93-908,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1529.042,1542.067,Are you saying that the injunctive action that the supreme court of Georgia suggests was available to the plaintiff was clear and certain before that opinion?
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1542.067,1545.878,"--I submit that it was, Your Honor, for several reasons."
1994.93-908,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1602.606,1609.525,"But didn't this petitioner try a declaratory judgment action, and wasn't he thrown out?"
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1609.525,1617.897,"In the Salter case, Your Honor, that was an action that was filed, eventually went to Fulton County Superior Court."
1994.93-908,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1641.59,1645.479,"You say there's no remedy if you overpay, is that--"
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1645.479,1652.82,"Well, Your Honor, the Georgia supreme court has found that the income tax refund statute does not apply to taxes paid under a statute later found unconstitutional."
1994.93-908,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1692.662,1698.083,--But didn't the latest bill that he got include a penalty assessment?
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1703.331,1709.141,He received an assessment notice with respect to the 1988 taxes--
1994.93-908,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1709.141,1709.453,Right.
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1709.453,1713.919,"--which he showed as due on his return as filed, and which he did not pay."
1994.93-908,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1723.697,1726.321,So it's an automatic assessment of a penalty?
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1726.321,1730.695,The computer essentially spit it out that way.
1994.93-908,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1734.348,1735.489,"Well, does your computer follow Georgia law?"
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1739.301,1744.579,"--It's... certainly we hope so, Your Honor, and the point the court is making is this."
1994.93-908,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1774.053,1779.971,"Well, would that have subjected him to criminal penalties, if he omits it from the return?"
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1779.971,1791.904,"Your Honor, if a taxpayer has made full disclosure on his return that he's taking an item out based on a constitutional objection, I don't see how he can be subject to criminal prosecution."
1994.93-908,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1791.904,1794.248,"Well, isn't that exactly what... I thought that's exactly what he did here."
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1804.149,1806.524,"But he... but he's not been criminally prosecuted, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1808.1,1812.41,But I thought you were suggesting that he should have done something other than he did in his return.
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1812.41,1813.395,"--Oh, no."
1994.93-908,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1833.403,1834.075,Are you serious about that?
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1845.554,1864.078,"--Your Honor, this Court dealt with that question in Cheek v. United States, and my reading of Cheek is that the taxpayer in that case, because of his constitutional objections, which were constitutional objections that had been repeatedly rejected by the courts, simply withdrew himself from the tax system."
1994.93-908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1916.729,1928.022,"Mr. Calvert, can I ask you about the refund statute which you say he should have known, or at least shouldn't have been sure provided for refund?"
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1931.144,1931.675,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1931.675,1932.206,"It says,"
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1997.166,2009.489,"Well, Your Honor, there... I submit that there... every day lawyers make their best decisions concerning the interpretation of procedures and the substantive law, and many times they turn out to be wrong."
1994.93-908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2009.489,2016.094,"Illegally assessed and collected from him under the laws of this State, whether paid voluntarily or involuntary."
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2016.094,2023.482,"Your Honor, I believe... I believe what the Georgia supreme court... the way the court arrived at its construction is this."
1994.93-908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2027.449,2028.605,And there was a lot of money owing.
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2028.605,2030.074,"Well, certainly, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2042.834,2046.942,And the word illegally does not cover unconstitutionally.
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2046.942,2048.676,"--Well, at the same time, Your Honor, there were--"
1994.93-908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2048.676,2051.784,You should get less of a remedy for an unconstitutionally assessed tax.
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2051.784,2075.478,"--Well, Your Honor, at the same time, there were many decisions, prior decisions of the Georgia appellate courts which had recognized that a refund statute is in the nature of an action for money had and received, and that the plaintiff coming in under a refund statute bore the burden of showing that the defendant held money which he was not in equity and good conscience entitled to hold."
1994.93-908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2097.97,2102.186,"We took care of that in our Federal constitutional decisions, I had thought."
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2102.186,2114.211,"Well, I submit, Your Honor, that what the Georgia supreme court was doing in its interpretation of the refund statute was drawing upon these prior principles of Georgia law and extending them in construing the statute."
1994.93-908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2114.211,2124.521,"It seems to me that if this is not a snare and a delusion to any taxpayer who had a valid claim, I don't know what would be."
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2142.436,2149.105,"Well, Your Honor, I believe the Court's concern, though, has already been addressed and disposed of in the Brinkerhoff case."
1994.93-908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2225.199,2226.995,Any risk at all.
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2244.317,2250.814,"Your Honor, I don't believe that the Georgia supreme court's reading of the refund statute is that extreme."
1994.93-908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2250.814,2264.042,"I think it is, and is the argument that you're making that no matter how contrary to the words of a statute a supreme court's interpretation is, there is no due process problem so long as it's the first time the court has ever interpreted it?"
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2264.042,2269.618,"Your Honor, I believe... I believe that is the... that is the holding of the Court in the Brinkerhoff case."
1994.93-908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2269.618,2270.321,All right.
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2270.321,2287.252,"Again, I submit that that's not... that does not comport with the facts in this case, but I believe Brinkerhoff settles that if a... that State courts interpret their State procedures and their substantive law, and except in extraordinary circumstances which we believe are not present in this case--"
1994.93-908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2287.252,2288.783,So the answer's no.
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2293.187,2295.453,--I'm not sure which question--
1994.93-908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2295.453,2309.087,"I asked whether it is always the case that so long as it's the first time a supreme court of a State is interpreting a statute, it can interpret it to mean whatever it wants so long as it's the first time it's ever interpreted it."
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2310.352,2311.648,--I believe that's what Brinkerhoff stands for.
1994.93-908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2311.648,2315.49,"All right, but now, most recently you've said, except in extraordinary circumstances."
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2315.49,2330.61,"Well, what I... what I intended to say, Your Honor, is that the Court in Brinkerhoff indicated that except in extraordinary circumstances an interpretation by a State court of particular procedures available to taxpayers is not going to give rise to due process problems."
1994.93-908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2330.61,2336.499,Maybe what it meant by extraordinary circumstances was an interpretation that is so flatly contrary to the language of the statute.
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2341.637,2366.455,"Well, I think there is also one other factor, Your Honor, in Brinkerhoff, which I believe compelled the result in that case, and that is, by virtue of the timing of the Missouri supreme court decisions, this taxpayer was effectively left with never having had an opportunity to contest his liability, and in this particular case there were predeprivation procedures available to the petitioner which he chose not to use."
1994.93-908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2366.455,2372.857,"He chose not to use them because this statute announced to him that he didn't have to use them, that he could always get a refund later."
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2372.857,2375.451,"Well, that was his reading of the refund statute--"
1994.93-908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2375.451,2378.137,Ah... and he shouldn't have read it the way it was written.
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2378.137,2378.824,--And Brinkerhoff--
1994.93-908,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2389.414,2393.006,Isn't there... aren't there two prior controlling decisions?
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2449.982,2450.826,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2515.097,2516.268,I haven't asked.
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2516.268,2518.017,"--If you could repeat it, please."
1994.93-908,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2518.017,2522.828,"Well, suppose that we think they've been getting what you might call colloquially the runaround."
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2594.767,2612.479,"I think, Your Honor, the argument that the tax... that the petitioner in this case has made is that if we lose on the adequacy of our predeprivation procedures, that we are obligated to refund these amounts, and that all other taxpayers, regardless of any statute of limitations, are open."
1994.93-908,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2625.599,2628.755,I thought it was conceded in this case that you could go back only to 1985.
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2628.755,2640.78,"It is in this case, Your Honor, but there are other cases pending in Georgia where that limitation is not being applied, where the petitioners are seeking to collect taxes back beyond 3 years."
1994.93-908,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2711.377,2719.42,"What would be left of the essential holding of McKesson, then, that the State must provide an adequate remedy, if we can say, well, we'll elect to rely on our sovereign immunity?"
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2721.934,2733.04,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, that what... if I understand the question, or what the concern is, is that you could have a constitutional violation with no effective remedy."
1994.93-908,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2757.577,2768.43,"Are you suggesting that in a whole line of cases, including the Brandeis decision in IowaDes Moines National Bank v. Bennett, that there was an initial step that was just skipped over?"
1994.93-908,1,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2786.174,2805.588,"As far as I can tell from the reading of those cases, Your Honor, sovereign immunity did not come up as a direct issue, and again, I believe that the Court has indicated in the McKesson case, in my reading of the oral arguments in that case, a concern that sovereign immunity is very much an issue in the context of a situation like this."
1994.93-908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2806.431,2808.103,"Thank you, Mr. Calvert."
1994.93-908,2,19139,carlton_m_henson,,2810.773,2811.758,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2811.758,2816.177,"Mr. Henson, would you address the question of how far back a taxpayer could go?"
1994.93-908,2,19139,carlton_m_henson,,2816.177,2818.63,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2938.191,2939.908,Do you think the State really has waived it's sovereign immunity?
1994.93-908,2,19139,carlton_m_henson,,2946.36,2952.498,"Your Honor, I don't think the State can come in at this date and talk about sovereign immunity."
1994.93-908,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3002.305,3005.366,"Mr. Henson, these people are all retirees, I suppose."
1994.93-908,2,19139,carlton_m_henson,,3005.366,3006.1,And perhaps--
1994.93-908,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3006.1,3009.537,"As this drags on, many of them are never going to see what they're entitled to, I suppose."
1994.93-908,2,19139,carlton_m_henson,,3009.537,3010.568,"--Many of them already won't, Your Honor."
1994.93-908,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3015.847,3018.392,"Thank you, Mr. Henson."
