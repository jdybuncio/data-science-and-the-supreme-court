1992.91-998,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.706,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 91-998, Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Nader E. Soliman."
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,14.926,18.045,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-998,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,152.214,156.183,"Mr. Jones, what is the standard of review?"
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,161.32,167.724,"There is a legal standard that must be met, which is what I just described, that the home be the most important place of business."
1992.91-998,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,174.414,180.234,Do you think there can be only one principal place of business under the statute?
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,181.801,192.791,"Yes, that is the logical result of the language, and in fact as this Court held in Malat v. Riddell, principal means most important."
1992.91-998,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,194.993,207.218,Under the Fourth Circuit view and test that we're reviewing do you think it leaves it open to find more than one principal place of business?
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,207.218,216.824,"Certainly, as the Court also held in Malat v. Riddell, the word substantial cannot be equated with principal."
1992.91-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,254.83,270.874,"Doesn't the Commissioner... the Commissioner says that he has to determine where the principal place of business is, but you just said that you have to compare what goes on in the various places and how important they are and things like that."
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,279.98,281.013,No.
1992.91-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,295.49,300.393,"I know, but what's the general... they say they apply total circumstances."
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,300.393,301.56,--Facts and circumstances.
1992.91-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,301.56,302.443,Don't you apply that?
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,302.443,303.262,"Yes, sir."
1992.91-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,303.745,306.145,So you do have the same general test.
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,306.145,307.664,--We start out at the same point.
1992.91-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,307.664,308.497,Isn't that right?
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,308.497,309.249,"Yes, sir."
1992.91-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,309.249,310.616,"Well, that's all I wanted to know."
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,314.618,320.438,"No, sir, we don't apply... they... the tax court and the court of appeals applied two tests."
1992.91-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,348.522,354.359,"Well, that's just a misapplication of the same test you used."
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,354.359,364.816,"It's possible to view it that way, Justice White, but actually we think that the tax court resurrected a sub standard, a legal standard that if met satisfies, in their view, the statute."
1992.91-998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,370.637,378.224,"May I ask you, Mr. Jones, do you measure the, do you get your answer solely by looking at the amount of time spent in the various locations?"
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,378.224,390.551,"No, we agree with the basic principle described by Meiers and Weissman and in the proposed regulations, which is that you look to both the time spent and the importance of the activities at each location."
1992.91-998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,390.551,395.419,"Well, in this particular case I guess the doctor had three hospitals he went to--"
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,395.419,395.953,That's correct.
1992.91-998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,395.953,397.955,--and one of them a lot more time was spent than in the office.
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,409.095,410.964,"Well, I have two answers to that."
1992.91-998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,410.964,412.914,"One, it's either yes or no."
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,413.547,415.266,"Well, no, actually--"
1992.91-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,415.266,416.249,You can't give both.
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,417.201,418.051,--Those are my two answers.
1992.91-998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,429.592,431.711,We've got all that in this case.
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,439.562,443.764,"Well, your question is if his work level is spread throughout many areas--"
1992.91-998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,443.764,445.466,He has eight hospitals instead of three.
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,446.066,446.432,--Right.
1992.91-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,453.586,455.186,That isn't a fact finding.
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,456.821,466.144,"--Well, the finding is that he spends, is how much time he spends at various locations and how important those are, and then from those--"
1992.91-998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,466.144,466.977,"Well, we know in this case, Mr. Jones."
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,475.499,485.723,"--Fact finders sometimes don't agree even on the same record, but we think that there are sub standards that the courts can look to that will resolve the ordinary case."
1992.91-998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,485.723,491.294,"Are you really saying in my, the case I give to you, there is no right answer?"
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,492.911,497.198,"Well, a priori I don't think there is necessarily a correct answer, although I--"
1992.91-998,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,497.198,508.772,Is the problem that you have in answering Justice Stevens' question the concession that I believe you made in your brief that there is always a principal place of business?
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,508.772,519.193,"--Well, that was the second answer I was going to give Justice Stevens, which is that this is not a statute in which the Government has to establish where the principal place of business is."
1992.91-998,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,524.848,537.942,"Well, do you concede that there is always a principal place of business or do you argue that in some cases, say in Justice Stevens' hypothetical or a traveling salesman who just goes to 100 different places, that there is no principal place of business at all?"
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,537.942,547.298,Taking the word most important to its logical extreme you would think that in almost every case a fact finder could find a location that was most important.
1992.91-998,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,547.298,549.832,I'm talking about the statute and your position.
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,558.486,568.227,Our position under the statute is that the taxpayer has not established that his home is his principal place of business and that is all that this case requires.
1992.91-998,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,605.484,617.894,"I am correct that in your brief you conceded the proposition that at least in this case there is a principal place of business, is that not correct?"
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,617.894,624.548,"In this case we affirmatively state that the hospital, Suburban Hospital, is his principal place of business, yes, sir."
1992.91-998,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,624.548,628.0,"Well, it seems to me that that's the difficulty of your position."
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,631.535,634.904,"Well, we think that the facts permit no other conclusion."
1992.91-998,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,655.9,656.533,Why was--
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,680.783,693.108,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, I think that the dissent in the tax court and in the court of appeals criticized the majorities for having adopted this test based upon essential need, substantial use."
1992.91-998,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,705.582,711.57,"So you think that the majority in the tax court applied the right test, they just didn't get the right result?"
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,711.57,719.759,"I think they started down that direction but they went a step that was not, that cannot be related to the statute."
1992.91-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,739.22,740.422,You think that's wrong?
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,740.422,741.539,We think that that's wrong.
1992.91-998,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,750.945,760.301,"Well, if you're not going to exclude management activities, which I take it is synonymous with what I think you referred to as ancillary activities a moment ago--"
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,760.301,760.701,Correct.
1992.91-998,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,760.701,771.64,"--then why don't you simply adopt or propose that we adopt a straight time test, wherever the taxpayer spends the greater part of the time will be the principal place."
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,778.476,782.428,"Well, the statute doesn't say the office where the taxpayer spends the most time."
1992.91-998,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,782.812,787.599,"No, but there's nothing in the statute that excludes that as a construction, is there?"
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,787.599,789.582,"--Well, in our view there is."
1992.91-998,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,789.582,789.982,Why?
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,789.982,793.57,The principal place of business requires some reference to what it is he is doing.
1992.91-998,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,793.57,823.922,"Well of course, but you're admitting that, as I understand it, that what you call management activities or the place of management activities may qualify as the principal place of business, and once you do that I don't know why your insistence on some qualitative sense of importance is anything but just injecting a kind of wild card for the fact finder."
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,823.922,826.041,It is not in our view a wild card.
1992.91-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,839.364,842.133,"Well, if it's not a wild card tell us what it is."
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,866.182,878.307,"Justice Scalia, one of the problems with answering a question like that in the abstract is that in different professions the primary, the relationship between the primary and secondary activities is not going to be the same."
1992.91-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,878.307,880.941,Well then at least admit it's a wild card.
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,880.941,884.995,It is a card that has a different value from case to case.
1992.91-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,884.995,886.162,That's what a wild card is.
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,888.531,893.435,"Well, in my view a wild card is whatever you need it to be."
1992.91-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,900.872,904.307,"The Government disagrees, as I recall, with the Drucker case--"
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,904.307,904.724,"--Yes, sir."
1992.91-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,904.724,911.897,--the musician who spent a whole lot of time practicing at home and just a little time conducting the concert.
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,921.085,925.906,"Well, actually Drucker is a good example of the point."
1992.91-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,980.624,981.541,It's an old one.
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,981.541,989.23,Judge van Graphlin used that joke to determine what the proper weighting of the various activities should be.
1992.91-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1011.16,1022.451,"You don't really think, I didn't think... I thought when you started out you said the historical facts are subject to the clearly erroneous but principal place of business is a legal question."
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1025.819,1032.509,If I said that what I meant to say was that there are legal sub standards that guide the fact finder.
1992.91-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1051.553,1055.838,What if you spend the most amount of time doing your least important work?
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1065.48,1066.896,"Well, that's Drucker."
1992.91-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1068.431,1070.281,"Well, what's the answer to that?"
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1070.281,1075.268,"--Well, the answer to that case is that the fact finder has to make the decision in the first instance."
1992.91-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1082.839,1090.011,But you say a fact finder in two different jurisdictions with the same facts could come out differently?
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1097.682,1111.091,"I think our system recognizes that fact finders if they are not clearly erroneous can determine basic facts, and if those basic facts satisfy the legal requirements of the statute then there is no basis for reversal."
1992.91-998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1111.091,1112.257,But when you--
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1125.315,1126.351,That's probably right.
1992.91-998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1126.351,1127.717,That's really what your position is?
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1127.717,1131.752,I would think that a doctor who spent 70 percent of his time in his hospital and 30 percent of his time sending the bills out--
1992.91-998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1131.752,1137.323,I think you would say the same if he spent 90 percent at home and did 10 very valuable and important operations.
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1140.441,1142.477,--I don't have an a priori answer to that.
1992.91-998,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1169.627,1183.202,"Mr. Jones, don't you recognize or won't you agree that what you refer to as a fact finder's determination about relative importance is really a twofold determination?"
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1211.804,1222.179,"Justice Souter, I don't think it's unfair but I don't think it's any more fair than criticizing any other statute that requires fact findings to be made about basic facts."
1992.91-998,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1228.416,1237.153,"And they're making, in your case they're making some law too because they are determining as a matter of law what is important and what is unimportant."
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1246.544,1253.031,--Exactly the same result applies under the diversity jurisdiction statute which also makes reference to principal place of business.
1992.91-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1287.186,1293.441,"That's the standard you propose, where do you spend the most amount of your time doing your most important work?"
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1293.441,1294.974,I don't think that answers every question.
1992.91-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1296.726,1299.362,"Well, that will always be a principal place of business--"
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1299.362,1299.945,--Absolutely.
1992.91-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1299.945,1307.249,"--but you would acknowledge that you can have a principal place of business that does not produce a, that is not the answer to that question?"
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1307.249,1307.915,"Yes, sir."
1992.91-998,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1307.915,1308.165,Okay.
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1315.503,1317.169,"Yes, sir."
1992.91-998,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1317.169,1323.49,And so whatever we decide here is rather narrowly restricted.
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1340.118,1346.022,In the ordinary course it would be deductible under 162 as an ordinary and necessary business expense.
1992.91-998,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1346.022,1347.688,But under different sections of the Code.
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1347.688,1348.488,"Yes, sir."
1992.91-998,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1360.513,1366.851,But my hypothetical assumes no other change in the facts.
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1366.851,1367.351,Correct.
1992.91-998,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1367.351,1373.255,"That's all he does, he spends as much time in the rented office as he did at home."
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1375.372,1375.791,"Yes, sir."
1992.91-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1421.17,1429.859,"Mr. Jones, can we adopt at least, at least some sub rule so that these cases don't have to be litigated forever and ever?"
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1434.044,1436.346,The Commissioner certainly shares that desire.
1992.91-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1436.346,1456.176,"What about a sub rule that ordinarily the principal place of business, ordinarily, even though you don't have to adopt a rigid point of sale rule, that almost always the principal place of business will be where the goods produced are sold or the services performed are rendered?"
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1456.176,1467.467,"That is the focal point test that the tax court applied before this case, and as I said before, we think the problem with that test... and the Commissioner had not proposed it, the tax court developed it on its own."
1992.91-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1467.467,1468.017,I understand.
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1468.017,1471.253,The problem with that test is it ignores management functions.
1992.91-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1473.121,1474.955,But you want to ignore them in most cases.
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1479.859,1482.727,--I don't have an a priori answer to that.
1992.91-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1501.855,1503.205,Well then there's no choice.
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1507.759,1512.044,In that situation his home would probably be his principal place of business.
1992.91-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1512.044,1516.079,No problem in that case.
1992.91-998,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1516.079,1523.483,The point I'd like to make in closing is that deductions are a matter of legislative grace.
1992.91-998,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1545.931,1547.031,"Thank you, Mr. Jones."
1992.91-998,1,21472,david_m_sokolow,,1551.502,1553.602,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1640.358,1652.999,"Mr. Sokolow, what do you think, when 280A was adopted what deductions do you think that ruled out that could have been taken under the old appropriate and helpful test?"
1992.91-998,1,21472,david_m_sokolow,,1652.999,1661.771,"Mr. Chief Justice, it primarily ruled out deductions for employees who were maintaining home offices merely for their personal convenience."
1992.91-998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1670.044,1681.601,You don't think that it ruled out also deductions where the word principal would not readily apply?
1992.91-998,1,21472,david_m_sokolow,,1690.457,1694.509,"Principal does, the word itself connotes some type of comparison."
1992.91-998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1700.329,1701.579,Why not?
1992.91-998,1,21472,david_m_sokolow,,1701.579,1711.62,I think the findings of the Soliman case show that those type of comparisons can't be made in this type of case by the nature of the functions that are performed.
1992.91-998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1711.62,1715.922,Well then what is left of the word principal in the statute?
1992.91-998,1,21472,david_m_sokolow,,1726.13,1741.14,"I believe that the word principal was used because primarily in the case of these employees they were trying to claim that they had two places of business, and only the one at their employer's location was their primary place of business."
1992.91-998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1754.613,1761.933,You don't think the word principal applies to a claim of deduction under this section made by someone who is not an employee?
1992.91-998,1,21472,david_m_sokolow,,1761.933,1771.622,"No, Your Honor, I believe it applies to all taxpayers, independent contractors and employees."
1992.91-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1771.622,1776.574,"What do you think it means then as applied to all these others, what does it mean?"
1992.91-998,1,21472,david_m_sokolow,,1781.811,1788.065,In the context of this statute I think principal place of business has a specific definition.
1992.91-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1801.141,1804.093,Principal place of business means the same thing as place of business?
1992.91-998,1,21472,david_m_sokolow,,1805.609,1808.795,"No, I don't believe it's any place of business."
1992.91-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1810.497,1810.847,Okay.
1992.91-998,1,21472,david_m_sokolow,,1819.019,1828.292,"I affirm that the content, the definition of that is now the new Soliman test, that it's being applied specifically in the context of a home office deduction."
1992.91-998,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1842.216,1849.038,Could there be more than one principal place of business in a given situation?
1992.91-998,1,21472,david_m_sokolow,,1849.038,1850.622,"I don't believe so, no."
1992.91-998,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1850.622,1855.526,Don't you think the Fourth Circuit test leaves open that possibility?
1992.91-998,1,21472,david_m_sokolow,,1855.526,1857.626,"No, I don't."
1992.91-998,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1858.811,1862.513,I would have thought that that's exactly what it did.
1992.91-998,1,21472,david_m_sokolow,,1862.513,1875.821,"--No, I believe... we're looking at whether a home office deduction is allowable, and if we're just looking at which is the location for the home office deduction, principal place of business can only be one location."
1992.91-998,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1875.821,1879.474,What if there's another office that's also used?
1992.91-998,1,21472,david_m_sokolow,,1879.474,1887.545,Under the new Soliman test if that office is used for his business purposes then his home office would not be his principal place of business.
1992.91-998,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1887.545,1890.93,Even though the other office is used less time?
1992.91-998,1,21472,david_m_sokolow,,1890.93,1893.901,That's correct.
1992.91-998,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1906.709,1909.142,May I interrupt you?
1992.91-998,1,21472,david_m_sokolow,,1917.998,1919.1,That's correct.
1992.91-998,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1919.1,1929.622,Supposing that he had just the billing records at home and he had the records that dealt with particular treatment for patients in some office at a hospital that was provided by the hospital.
1992.91-998,1,21472,david_m_sokolow,,1934.942,1943.565,If we assume that the only space he was given in the hospital was to store records as opposed to do the rest of his business then it wouldn't change the facts of this case.
1992.91-998,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1943.565,1950.636,"Well, suppose he had a desk and a chair there and he made some entries on the patient records and so forth but he didn't do his billing from there."
1992.91-998,1,21472,david_m_sokolow,,1953.088,1960.594,"What the court found is that the office has to be available to the taxpayer, and that is determined under all facts and circumstances."
1992.91-998,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1962.01,1974.501,"Well, my facts and circumstances are that he has a desk and a chair in the hospital where he does his, keeps track of who his patients are and where they are, but he does all his billing and credit work and banking and so forth in his home office."
1992.91-998,1,21472,david_m_sokolow,,1982.59,1986.577,If Dr. Soliman could do all his business functions in that office in the hospital--
1992.91-998,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1986.577,1988.894,I have described what he did and I'm asking you what the result is.
1992.91-998,1,21472,david_m_sokolow,,1988.894,1991.796,--I need to differentiate between what he did and what he could do.
1992.91-998,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2002.421,2004.123,Well then let's assume he could not have done that.
1992.91-998,1,21472,david_m_sokolow,,2010.942,2017.68,--Then I believe the essential nature of the rest of those functions would still entitle him to a home office deduction.
1992.91-998,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2017.68,2025.536,I suppose you would have a better case if your client were an internist and saw patients in his home?
1992.91-998,1,21472,david_m_sokolow,,2025.536,2032.606,"If he saw patients in his home, Your Honor, there is a separate section of 280A that would automatically entitle him to the deduction."
1992.91-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2038.444,2050.15,I gather from your response to Justice Stevens that you think the phrase the principal place of business should be understood simply to mean an essential place of business?
1992.91-998,1,21472,david_m_sokolow,,2053.018,2059.257,"An essential place of business is one of the three parts of the Soliman test, so that would be one factor that would have to be considered."
1992.91-998,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2792.998,2800.438,The fact that an office is essential to a business cannot satisfy the requirement that the office be the principal place of business.
1992.91-998,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2835.325,2855.572,"I suppose if this doctor had a lot of things in his car like, you know, a computer and a filing cabinet and things like that he could deduct it, just like as if he rented an office."
1992.91-998,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2855.572,2860.607,That sounds like it may be correct.
1992.91-998,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2898.232,2901.517,You haven't commented on the proposed regulation.
1992.91-998,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2905.635,2911.806,"Justice Stevens, the proposed regulation says exactly what we think is right, but then it says something in addition."
1992.91-998,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2958.001,2960.001,That can be the principal place of business--
1992.91-998,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2960.001,2960.484,--It could be.
1992.91-998,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2960.484,2961.536,--within the meaning of the statute.
1992.91-998,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2961.536,2962.103,That's right.
1992.91-998,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2968.023,2973.194,Does the proposed regulation stay a proposed regulation forever?
1992.91-998,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2975.444,2976.629,It has been proposed for 12 years.
1992.91-998,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2985.084,2986.534,How do you get rid of a proposed regulation?
1992.91-998,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2988.27,2993.424,"--We get rid of it by withdrawing it, and it may be that it will be withdrawn."
1992.91-998,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2999.994,3002.78,So in effect it really isn't a proposed regulation anymore?
1992.91-998,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3002.78,3004.563,--It was a proposed regulation.
1992.91-998,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3004.563,3005.232,It was.
1992.91-998,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3005.232,3006.332,Right.
1992.91-998,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3013.736,3021.074,"Well, and also the definition of principal place of business in the regulation is a little bit different from your position with regard to the statutory language, I think."
1992.91-998,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3021.074,3025.443,It gives a little bit more emphasis to the place where income is generated.
1992.91-998,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3025.443,3029.613,"It's not quite as literal, at least as Justice Scalia would read the statute in his questions."
1992.91-998,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3029.613,3046.559,"I think that there's room under the statute to agree with exactly what the regulation says, but I don't think that the regulation, by emphasizing slightly more where the income is generated, really adds that much to the fundamental inquiry of where is the most important place in the business."
1992.91-998,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3056.863,3057.946,"Thank you, Mr. Jones."
