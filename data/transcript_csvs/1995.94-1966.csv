1995.94-1966,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,73.059,78.253,"Mr. Lowenfield, before you go too much further... I'm sorry."
1995.94-1966,0,29334,john_h_blume,,152.26,155.724,"Yes, Justice Scalia, I think it's clear that does not suffice."
1995.94-1966,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,166.64,167.341,"No, it doesn't."
1995.94-1966,0,29334,john_h_blume,,209.699,215.494,--Because the teaching of Furman is that there has to be something beyond murder.
1995.94-1966,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,215.494,216.715,There was no Court opinion in Furman.
1995.94-1966,0,29334,john_h_blume,,216.715,218.115,That's true.
1995.94-1966,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,234.106,234.616,Right.
1995.94-1966,0,29334,john_h_blume,,238.801,244.664,"But, Justice Scalia, there were numerous statutes which existed like this at the time of Furman, all of which were found to be unconstitutional."
1995.94-1966,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,257.913,262.207,We held in Furman that no statute that then existed in the United States was valid?
1995.94-1966,0,29334,john_h_blume,,262.207,267.9,"--No, but a number of them were reversed and vacated in light of Furman and sent back for--"
1995.94-1966,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1763.932,1772.349,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-1966,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1836.09,1846.358,Was it clear in this case that it was the felony aspect of the homicides committed with premeditation that were the aggravators?
1995.94-1966,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1846.358,1857.525,"--There were three aggravating factors, one of which was the murder... the killing committed in the course of the felony, in the case the robbery."
1995.94-1966,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1857.525,1865.53,"Were they specific in their findings, or did they just say that they were all aggravated under C which is the felony murder--"
1995.94-1966,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1865.53,1874.216,The court martial found all three aggravating factors to be present as... they were required to identify which aggravating factors they relied upon.
1995.94-1966,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1885.151,1909.468,"--Mr. Kneedler, supposing that the President had never promulgated these regulations, but that the military trial court judge had simply instructed, simply perhaps making them up or looking at cases and saying I think we need these, would the defendant have standing to object that they had not been promulgated by either Congress or the President?"
1995.94-1966,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1909.468,1920.665,I think you would have standing to object that there were not pre specified factors and procedures to guide the court martial.
1995.94-1966,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1921.356,1922.988,But they were all beneficial to him.
1995.94-1966,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1922.988,1924.268,--That's correct.
1995.94-1966,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1955.99,1962.662,"Mr. Kneedler, did he narrow... is there a... an intent to kill requirement in section 918?"
1995.94-1966,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1962.662,1967.016,"In paragraph 1, there is."
1995.94-1966,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1973.789,1976.762,Accidental killing would be enough to impose the death penalty under 4?
1995.94-1966,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1976.762,1988.312,"--In the... if... in this... under 118(4), the crime is defined as a killing committed in the course of a felony, including robbery."
