1962.332,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,11.964,"Fenelon Boesche, Administrator, Petitioner, versus Stewart L. Udall, Secretary of the Interior."
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,13.679,18.862,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.332,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,193.924,201.956,(Inaudible)
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,201.956,209.261,"My client has done nothing with the lease obviously, because it's in jeopardy."
1962.332,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,209.295,212.109,Is there any development in there?
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,212.109,236.536,"Whatever development there could be has been halted by the Secretary's administrative cancellation or rather attempted administrative cancellation of the lease because as soon as the Secretary hands down his decision, our client moved to the District Court in an action to prevent the Secretary to cancel."
1962.332,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,236.536,242.866,"That was years before the Secretary entered his final decision, you mentioned the year -- the entire period?"
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,242.866,244.255,Yes.
1962.332,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,274.412,282.192,"Well, would you say this thing has happened before, the proceeding has been brought in the District Court in these terms?"
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,282.192,286.304,"In the District Court, where the land is located?"
1962.332,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,336.62,338.547,You paid rent on it.
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,338.547,339.072,Pardon me?
1962.332,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,339.072,340.413,You paid rent on it.
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,340.413,340.757,Yes.
1962.332,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,345.161,346.508,Do you get that back?
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,351.64,355.409,"If we're wrong in the case, I think we do get the rent back."
1962.332,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,489.412,497.803,(Inaudible) you wouldn't object to that?
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,497.803,499.641,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1962.332,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,607.503,612.461,You're not -- are you arguing your cons -- is your position a constitutional one or statutory?
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,612.461,613.859,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1962.332,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,613.859,615.064,Constitutional?
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,615.064,615.325,Yes.
1962.332,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,617.877,619.634,"Well, due process."
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,619.634,620.392,I think so.
1962.332,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,633.605,636.766,"Well, you got Section 31 first of all, haven't you?"
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,636.766,641.142,"Yes, and if I may proceed in this connection, Your Honor."
1962.332,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,981.829,989.193,When did the Secretary of the Interior first changed his view concerning the -- his rights in this regard?
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,989.193,1015.833,"Well, historically, the Secretary in his reply -- in his brief had an Appendix B and C in which he cites a number of published and unpublished decisions and if you will -- although he claims, although the Secretary claims that his construction of the Act of authority to cancel the lease stems right from the beginning of the Act."
1962.332,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1069.641,1072.05,Permits for what?
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1072.05,1075.695,For -- to go and prospect for oil and gas.
1962.332,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1189.459,1197.679,"What reasons were those earlier cancellations made, cancellation of leases, the 38 and the 47 one?"
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1197.679,1198.912,Yes.
1962.332,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1205.087,1207.199,And what were those made for?
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1207.199,1208.232,What were they made for?
1962.332,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1208.232,1212.826,"Yes, what were the reasons to sign for mineral and oil leases?"
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1212.826,1219.401,"In -- in most cases, in the earliest cases I believe is just a question that the Government had to title to the land at the time."
1962.332,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1219.401,1220.347,The Government had no title?
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1220.347,1225.821,"No, had no title to the -- to the -- to the minerals."
1962.332,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1236.489,1247.473,(Inaudible) is that right?
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1263.078,1271.488,That maybe -- I think in this connection that the crux of the matter is this.
1962.332,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1370.465,1372.064,What were you reading from?
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1372.064,1373.053,I'm sorry?
1962.332,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1373.053,1374.524,What were you reading from?
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1374.524,1377.763,I was reading from Frankfurter's concurring opinion in the Youngstown versus Sawyer.
1962.332,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1377.763,1379.887,I thought you said the Court's opinion.
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1379.887,1380.513,Pardon me?
1962.332,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1380.513,1383.563,I thought you said speaking for the Court?
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1383.563,1386.255,I said in a concurring opinion.
1962.332,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1386.255,1392.977,I misunderstood it.
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1392.977,1420.982,"The decisions of this Court in the Johnson versus Towsley and West versus Standard Oil Company, established a clear cut line of demarcation between the powers of the executive branch on the one hand and those of the judicial branch on the other hand with respect to cancelation and forfeiture of patents and like instruments."
1962.332,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1463.7,1466.985,"Of course title hasn't passed in this case, I don't know if it makes any difference under the statute."
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1466.985,1468.709,Yes.
1962.332,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1472.043,1473.512,"Well, yes."
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1473.512,1483.138,The manager issued a least for a five-year term and gave the lessee an exclusive right for the full enjoyment of this property.
1962.332,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1494.452,1510.119,"Mr. BenEzra, would you describe what happened when the agent of the Department of Interior (Inaudible)"
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1510.119,1520.286,"Yes, this is -- yes, he's fully aware of this and I might say, Your Honors, I dealt with this matter in our reply brief."
1962.332,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1590.261,1616.111,"Suppose the Secretary promulgated a regulation saying that henceforth all leases were to be made conditionally or on a condition subsequent namely that they would have been cancelled and if within period of X days, the Department found that the lease have been improperly issued, would the Secretary have power to do that over the Act?"
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1616.111,1619.772,"I don't think so, Your Honor, for this reason."
1962.332,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1766.938,1779.303,"Mr. BenEzra, I wonder from your contention, could the Secretary ever cancel a lease when a mineral is found there either by administrative or judicial act?"
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1779.303,1781.086,Is this under a patent situation?
1962.332,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1781.086,1784.077,"No, under a lease, suppose there's a lease."
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1807.823,1826.186,"The statute clearly says that the Secretary may cancel the lease only for violation for a lease terms and even with respect to this expressed authority to cancel leases it's limited because if the land is valuable for oil and gas, he has to go into a court."
1962.332,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1826.186,1836.043,"(Inaudible) to the language of the statute, could it mean that it's restricted to the language of the statute in a situation where the value is described?"
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1836.043,1845.355,"Well, it seems to me that this is the -- the statute itself permits the Secretary to cancel leases only in the event that it is not valuable for oil and gas."
1962.332,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1850.09,1859.146,"But looking at the statute, after that, he can go to the court, lest if we know a violation of the terms of the lease?"
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1859.146,1860.588,"I think he can, yes."
1962.332,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1860.588,1863.38,On what statutory language?
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1863.38,1868.568,Under the -- on the -- under the Section 31 of the original statute.
1962.332,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1886.164,1889.234,(Inaudible)
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1889.234,1890.845,"There again, there again."
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1904.162,1913.177,(Inaudible)
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1913.177,1914.998,"I think so, Your Honor."
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1914.998,1925.309,(Inaudible)
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1925.309,1928.851,"Well, I believe that it's -- it's permissible."
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1942.452,1947.253,What were the terms of this lease?
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1947.253,1948.374,Pardon me?
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1948.374,1953.872,"What were the terms of your -- of the federal lease, did you pay so much in a year as the outset of the lease?"
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1953.872,1954.509,"Yes, sir."
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1954.509,1957.147,And then delay rentals --
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1957.147,1957.67,I beg your pardon.
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1957.67,1959.745,Delay rentals or not under the lease?
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1959.745,1959.851,No.
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1964.199,1965.113,"Yes, but what is the rental?"
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1966.069,1966.48,What is it?
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1968.688,1970.041,That's just for the outset?
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1970.041,1970.413,That's right.
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1970.413,1971.208,That's all you have to pay.
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1972.929,1979.313,"No, annual rentals every year."
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1979.313,1988.18,And you're on -- is your only real objection that the rent started on this lease?
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1988.18,1988.227,No.
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1988.227,1992.738,It really had cut down to three years or two years or something in that sense.
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,1992.738,1996.742,This is -- this is part of my objection.
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2014.892,2018.291,And the same is true if he doesn't by judicial proceeding under 31.
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2018.291,2020.403,Except that there is a double aspect of it.
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2024.221,2034.513,"Yes, but even if -- accepting your position that he has no power administrated to cancel the lease, the Secretary would be moved in court."
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2036.67,2037.369,Yes.
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2037.369,2039.564,-- that you would still could --
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2039.564,2040.2,That -- you're right.
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2040.2,2042.409,-- rent back than where if you have a stay.
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2042.409,2053.06,I cannot -- I cannot deny that but here the lessor himself sets up a situation like that in every instance.
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2053.06,2060.324,"Well, you have notice of the -- you have notice of the appeal of Conley and this other fellow to the --"
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2060.324,2060.726,"Yes, sir."
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2060.726,2062.304,-- and he participated there.
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2062.304,2063.428,"Yes, sir."
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2063.428,2068.315,And did you object to the Secretary's jurisdictions beforehand?
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2068.315,2078.415,"Well, all we're saying, Your Honor, is that the statute provides for judicial proceedings in the United States District Court."
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2078.415,2081.042,"Well, you made that point (Inaudible)."
1962.332,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2081.042,2097.447,"Well, Mr. BenEzra, I was wondering if Section 31 is all inclusive and it provides the only means for cancelling a lease and not being through court action."
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2121.876,2136.384,"I would assume, Mr. Chief Justice, that provision in Section 31 which says whenever the lessee fails to comply with any of the provisions of this Act."
1962.332,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2173.9,2203.004,"Well the -- the Solicitor General as I understand it here, does contend that there was a violation of the Act, not on your part but on the part of the Government because a lease of this kind could not be issued to you because you did not claim -- you did not seek to lease also the adjoining land it being under 640 acres."
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2203.004,2206.07,"That -- that is true, Your Honor in this respect."
1962.332,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2267.53,2275.718,Regardless -- regardless of whether he's authorized under the Act to do so or not?
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2275.718,2281.597,What we have in question here is the question of whether or not there has been a violation of the regulation.
1962.332,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2290.197,2303.187,"But your argument -- you have to assume the purpose of your argument because of our limited grant of certiorari that the administrative interpretation, the underlying question is correct?"
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2303.187,2311.34,That is right because the petition limits it and I want to -- I want to say that I regret getting into this question.
1962.332,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2372.743,2374.445,Let's take a more extreme case.
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2374.445,2374.927,Yes.
1962.332,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2374.927,2396.012,"Your position would be, I take it, that if it is prove beyond peradventure that the lessee who walked in and offer to bribe to an underling of the Department of Interior, Department of Land notwithstanding that the Government wanted to cancel that lease and that they would have a legal right to it."
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2402.463,2402.813,I think --
1962.332,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2402.813,2404.928,Isn't that your position?
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2404.928,2409.735,"No, I would still say, I would still say although it sounds terrible."
1962.332,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2412.49,2413.35,That's what I am saying.
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2413.35,2414.227,Yes.
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2443.737,2444.477,Mr. BenEzra --
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2444.477,2444.541,Yes.
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2444.541,2458.497,We do -- I think we do have to consider this case on the assumption or it gets to -- or against the idea that this lease really was beyond the power of the Secretary to issue.
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2458.497,2460.434,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2460.434,2462.198,"Well, your rule --"
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2462.198,2462.351,I would say --
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2462.351,2468.315,-- is simply -- you've just observed that you would -- I thought you would apply this rule right across the board --
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2468.315,2468.349,Yes.
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2468.349,2471.872,"-- once the lease is issued, it doesn't make any difference whether it's beyond his power or not."

1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2472.059,2473.415,You must go into court to cancel.
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2473.415,2474.489,Forgive me.
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2481.814,2488.095,"Well, that it's beyond his power to issue a valid lease on the -- in these circumstances."
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2491.034,2491.244,That's right.
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2491.244,2492.602,That must be your position.
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2492.602,2493.203,That's right.
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2493.203,2500.856,And in this case the issue would be whether this lease was issued beyond -- that this was a lease that was beyond the power of the Secretary to issue.
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2507.964,2509.1,I would say that --
1962.332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2509.1,2512.12,"In a court proceeding or before him, before the Secretary."
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2512.12,2518.499,"If he in fact has issued a lease that was beyond his power to issue, let him go into court and assert that."
1962.332,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2519.017,2523.675,You are urging that he has to go into the court to try that case itself.
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2523.675,2524.317,That's right.
1962.332,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2524.317,2526.127,Whether it is beyond his power?
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2526.127,2527.418,"That's right, Your Honor."
1962.332,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2530.81,2548.954,"Suppose there were two, two people applying for the lease and it was first given to one and he went into possession and was producing and later through some administrative error, the lease was given to the second one."
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2548.954,2551.028,Yes.
1962.332,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2551.028,2562.623,Would you have a right to go into court to have that decided or would the -- or would the Secretary of the Interior have the right to cancel that second lease?
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2562.623,2588.165,"If I -- I would say that the person who has aggrieved and the patent case has point this out and Brown versus Hitchcock states very plainly, Johnson versus Towsley states very plainly, the person aggrieved can go into a court and in an equity procedure, ask the court to have the -- and impress a trust on the person who has received the lease in derogation of his prior rights."
1962.332,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2588.165,2592.835,But you would think even under those circumstances you would have no right to cancel your second lease.
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2592.835,2593.504,That's right.
1962.332,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2593.504,2593.945,Yes.
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2594.14,2594.999,"That's right, Your Honor."
1962.332,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2594.999,2596.315,That's all I was asking.
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2596.315,2603.483,The same problem came up in the patent cases and there were certainly as many patents issued as there are leases issued today.
1962.332,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2615.025,2616.841,Is that what you read us a moment ago?
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2616.841,2617.414,Did I?
1962.332,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2617.414,2617.778,You did.
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2617.778,2619.681,"I did, Your Honor?"
1962.332,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2619.681,2622.051,Yes.
1962.332,0,34165,leon_benezra,,2624.387,2632.963,Thank you very much.
1962.332,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2632.963,2633.778,Mr. Solicitor General.
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2633.778,2637.2,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.332,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2898.772,2900.723,In what period -- in what period of time.
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2900.723,2901.943,In the three-year period.
1962.332,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2901.943,2902.54,Three-year period.
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2902.54,2903.376,"1,100."
1962.332,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2913.073,2916.738,"Were those -- any of those contested, Mr. Solicitor General?"
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2916.738,2921.017,"I don't have the breakdown but I'm sure that some of them were, yes."
1962.332,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2939.7,2948.538,Is this power also exercised in additional events where the Secretary could violate the statute?
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2948.538,2955.043,But of course the statute was enacted at the time mineral leases were set up.
1962.332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3011.751,3014.99,(Inaudible)

1962.332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3035.929,3036.818,The placer claims.
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3036.818,3043.796,These were all placer claims and that was resulting in great ways of the public domain.
1962.332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3043.796,3048.799,(Inaudible)
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3048.799,3055.14,And mineral entries were characteristically cancellable in the Department of Interior.
1962.332,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3056.552,3063.793,"Mr. General, you mentioned leases under the Taylor Grazing Act."
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3063.793,3064.402,Yes.
1962.332,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3064.402,3067.213,And other -- other kinds of leases (Voice Overlap)
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3067.213,3071.097,Of the two that I'm familiar were Taylor Grazing Act and Mineral Leasing.
1962.332,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3071.097,3081.316,Is there any specific statute that gives the right to the Secretary of the Interior to do this under the Taylor Grazing Act or --?
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3081.316,3082.458,"The best of my knowledge, there is not."
1962.332,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3082.458,3083.167,"Or is that, that's done --"
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3083.167,3084.712,I'm informed there is not.
1962.332,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3084.712,3086.055,That's done on the same principle or theories that you're --
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3086.055,3088.535,"That all these cancellations, --"
1962.332,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3088.535,3089.375,-- asserting in.
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3089.375,3106.498,"-- Mr. Chief Justice, the power to cancel any adverse claim against the public land has been recognized for centuries, so long and under the general statutes creating the Department of the Interior."
1962.332,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3183.188,3199.57,"What effect do you give to the first part of Section 31 then which is always been in the statute, as I understand it, that certainly covers a situation where the lease was made in excess of authority which was --"
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3199.57,3218.162,"In a lease issued under the provisions of this Act may be forfeited and canceled by an appropriate proceeding in the United States District Court, whenever the lessee fails to comply with any of the provisions of this Act of the lease or of the general regulations promulgated under the Act."
1962.332,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3280.407,3288.034,With the additive language as you call it was -- that's a separate provision.
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3288.034,3294.194,"But the one I just read is not -- it's what I was describing as the additive language, isn't that the first time here?"
1962.332,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3294.194,3294.562,Yes.
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3303.513,3304.2,"Oh, no."
1962.332,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3311.559,3315.85,I misunderstood you.
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3315.85,3327.582,May I back up a little and get this in context because I think that's part of the reason that's given.
1962.332,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3407.24,3423.879,So as the counsel said that it's late as 1930 and never before the Secretary of the Interior had taken it for granted that the only power that he had was through the courts?
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3423.879,3426.295,May I come to that in chronological sequence?
1962.332,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3426.295,3427.444,In your own time please.
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3427.444,3432.572,I will come to this preferably in mind.
1962.332,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3500.122,3502.209,Where is the general statute in your brief --

1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3506.986,3514.555,43 of our brief.
1962.332,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3587.287,3596.941,"Well, I gather (Inaudible)"
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3596.941,3600.575,"No, no because there are duties put on the lessee in the statute."

1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3601.137,3605.797,"That are not in the, not in the lease but they relate to future performance."
1962.332,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3606.506,3611.948,"Is it necessary there, that it's added entirely -- notwithstanding the --"
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3611.948,3627.277,"I think the question would be open to argument that a lease, the normal rule was that the lessee's nonperformance of obligations unless the lessor was given the power of forfeiture somewhere that it was not existing."
1962.332,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3627.277,3629.511,I thought the regulation they make is the term --
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3629.511,3634.817,Those are regulations that refer to regulations to be issued under the statute.
1962.332,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3763.353,3779.587,"Mr. General in that connection, I presume exclusively implying to what statutory scheme that fraud is (Inaudible)"
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3779.587,3785.675,"Well, I would find it -- I would think that what quite would be -- could be in cause."
1962.332,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3825.647,3826.893,Can I ask you this question?
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3838.506,3839.409,It would.
1962.332,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3844.064,3845.698,Yes (Inaudible)
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3845.698,3858.302,"Now, of course, with these cases, the Secretary does, even if he'd go into court, he would have to take some preliminary step to determine when he would go to court and when he wouldn't go to court."
1962.332,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4253.718,4276.209,(Inaudible)
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4276.209,4284.915,There is nothing in the legislative history that throws as far as I know that throws any light on that.
1962.332,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4453.679,4455.633,Which bill was that?
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4455.633,4458.852,This is the bill that became the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920.
1962.332,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4458.852,4459.524,1920?
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4459.524,4461.432,Yes.
1962.332,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4462.256,4479.156,"General, I like to -- I'd like to have you get to the practicalities of it for just a, just a minute and -- and the way you acquire the interpretation of the Taylor Grazing Act and these other -- these other acts that backbones --"
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4479.156,4501.426,"The point -- the point that I was seeking to develop at the beginning Mr. Chief Justice, was the very large volume of transactions, necessarily undertaking in the local land offices in grabbing applications of various kinds whether under the Taylor Grazing Act or the Mineral Leasing Act."
1962.332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4695.393,4703.593,(Inaudible)
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4703.593,4712.52,"Because the application and therefore the applicant did not conform to the regulations, it was a --"

1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4717.106,4721.352,It didn't apply for the required size.
1962.332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4723.084,4728.718,And therefore occasionally acquired the gas or --
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4728.718,4733.077,I -- I think this could be brought in under those terms.
1962.332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4736.999,4744.112,(Inaudible)
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4744.112,4745.529,"It was the regulation, yes."

1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4765.076,4770.306,"Well, I think it's just a -- to everyone's advantage to get it done and get on with it."

1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4791.623,4792.22,No.
1962.332,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4942.529,4948.374,"Mr. General, it is very unique to say and this would be out of the question."
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4954.845,4971.116,Simply -- simply time and cumbersomeness extends to both parties and of course we would be very greatly concerned about any such decision because it would -- we would wonder doesn't it affect the Taylor Grazing Act?
1962.332,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4980.422,4988.586,"Is that the general concern, (Inaudible) in most similar statute that's built under the Grazing Act."
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4988.586,4994.293,I don't believe -- either I didn't understand the question or misspoke myself in the answer.
1962.332,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4994.293,5002.609,I thought your answer to Mr. Chief Justice when he asked you whether it's comparable (Inaudible)
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5002.609,5005.744,"Well, in that event, I misled the Chief Justice."
1962.332,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5017.505,5019.683,I was misled by that area.
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5034.241,5036.152,I think -- not like this.
1962.332,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5036.264,5037.281,To the Court.
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5037.281,5039.493,"No, not like this, Mr. Justice Black."
1962.332,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5040.713,5054.869,"In that connection, you're time is up but I just -- you said several times that the Secretary has a right to cancel for fraud despite the interrogation."
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5098.157,5106.725,"First, I submit, Your Honor, that there is nothing in the statute that grants the power to cancel for fraud."
1962.332,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5106.725,5108.241,They're going to the courts?
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5108.241,5109.988,It does -- the statute doesn't say anything about it.
1962.332,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5109.988,5113.802,"I understand it doesn't but I'll say, isn't it bold enough to cover that?"
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5113.802,5116.926,"I wouldn't think that the statute designed that as a reason, no."
1962.332,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5116.926,5117.641,What is that?
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5117.641,5118.721,I think not.
1962.332,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5150.756,5162.905,"Well, I would suppose that without statutory, there would be a sort of power to go into the court and the tract of covenant is something (Voice Overlap) for fraud."
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5162.905,5165.919,Well I think -- I think so too.
1962.332,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5166.711,5184.696,"That I find it is hard -- I find it a little difficult to reach a conclusion that you cannot easily find that that shall be submitted to the Secretary of the Interior as an administrative matter to determine these important questions that go to the root of the controversy, is it fraud?"
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5187.464,5197.034,"Well, in using fraud as an illustration and an important one, perhaps I've misled the Court as to the causes of cancellation."
1962.332,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5303.987,5327.207,"We treated that casually with reference to any cancellation, such time in memorial so far as we're concerned, the Courts have tried cases like these that had been reluctant on the part of many people to extend that trial, extend the trial to try controversy just like that, administrative agency because it's more convenient and can be done more seriously."
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5327.207,5348.721,"Mr. Justice Black, if this were -- if this were mining claims, if they were homestead entries, if they were swamp land selection, if they were surveys made by the Department, all these determining who would be the fellow who would get the land and get more rights to this exploration for a century they have been determined in the Department of Interior."
1962.332,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5351.199,5352.02,They didn't have this power?
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5352.02,5354.005,A new power that we are saying.
1962.332,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5354.005,5374.551,"I recall in the opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas wrote, why then there was no act such as this has come in and prescribed ways for the Secretary to cancel which whether limited or not limited, certainly required him to go to the court and cause forfeit."
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5378.797,5384.936,It's quite true that in those cases there were not statutes dealing with the problem of cancellation.
1962.332,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5407.187,5409.338,Could I ask you one question before you sit down?
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5415.553,5418.466,"Unquestionable, unquestionable."
1962.332,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5431.535,5434.651,That's where I answer the point of my question.
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5435.366,5438.293,I think -- well a lot of them will never go to court is the difference.
1962.332,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5450.897,5453.35,"There is more difference, isn't it?"
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5475.644,5483.394,Your Honor's qualification about the difference that is to what is open to the Court is quite right.
1962.332,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5490.765,5499.973,"Mr. General, suppose the development parts of the -- in terms of (Inaudible) were those are business models?"
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5499.973,5507.742,I am told -- I asked this question of the Bureau of Public Lands and I'm told that this problem has never come up.
1962.332,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5563.034,5576.81,"But instead, would there be an action in the Court of Claims (Inaudible)"
1962.332,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5576.81,5592.449,"Well, I would suppose the most -- most likely a source of suit would be not in the Court of Claims but I should think under the Court of Claims Act."
