1987.87-626,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.978,"We will hear argument now in No. 87-626, Michael Sheridan against the United States."
1987.87-626,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,12.549,32.705,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this statutory construction case presents the question of whether Congress intended that the intentional tort exception of the Federal Tort Claims Act would preclude all suits from which the government negligently failed to prevent an employee from committing an intentional tort."
1987.87-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,96.044,98.007,Would that necessarily follow?
1987.87-626,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,123.793,124.754,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1987.87-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,175.626,177.219,You don't disagree with that?
1987.87-626,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,177.219,178.879,Not at all.
1987.87-626,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,217.564,219.875,You are talking about a duty imposed by state law now.
1987.87-626,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,219.875,237.737,"--Absolutely, Your Honor, not a duty which grows out of the employment, out of the fact of employment of the assailant, but simply a duty imposed by state law, or, as in the day care center case, or in our case, by the promulgation of regulations, a duty which the government imposed upon itself."
1987.87-626,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,237.737,245.142,You suggest the promulgation of regulations by the government gives rise to a source of duty independent of state law.
1987.87-626,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,268.067,277.113,The Federal Tort Claims Act would impose duty... would impose liability on the United States if there would be liability in Maryland.
1987.87-626,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,362.649,372.306,"If the Ninth Circuit is completely right, then you really wouldn't be giving full meaning, it seems to me, to 2680(h)."
1987.87-626,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,379.69,398.111,"There would be a distinction between the... if I understand your comment, you are suggesting that 2680(h) is somehow broader than simply for assault."
1987.87-626,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,398.111,406.056,"Well, as I understand it, it's an exception to the liability imposed by the Federal Tort Claims Act."
1987.87-626,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,406.056,406.667,Yes.
1987.87-626,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,406.667,409.66,Which makes the government ordinarily liable for negligence.
1987.87-626,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,409.66,410.901,Yes.
1987.87-626,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,410.901,421.718,"And so if there wouldn't be liability for negligence in the first place in this situation, you wouldn't need 2680(h)."
1987.87-626,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,421.718,422.399,I see.
1987.87-626,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,664.117,676.594,"But if he had been in a private hospital, you clearly... and had done the same things he did, and the people had failed to restrain him, you would have no action against the government, you concede, don't you, even though he is in the service?"
1987.87-626,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,676.594,677.803,Sure.
1987.87-626,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,710.686,712.919,You would have a suit against the hospital but not against--
1987.87-626,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,712.919,745.258,"Exactly, and if you have a suit against the hospital, the primary motivation of the Federal Tort Claims Act, as made clear in the statutory language, was to hold the United States liable in situations where it would be liable if it were a private citizen, so that is something that the government conceded in the court below, that indeed all the facts being the same here, if this were a private individual instead of the government, there would be liability, and that's crucial."
1987.87-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,745.258,751.171,"--But that isn't... that isn't the object of the Act, to the extent it has that exception."
1987.87-626,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,766.892,776.58,"What I submit that (h) intended to do, Your Honor, again was to say, you may have respondeat superior liability for intentional torts in this state."
1987.87-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,788.498,807.338,So you think the only effect of that language is that in all government employment situations the claim for assault by a government employee will now not be based on respondeat superior but a claim of negligent failure to supervise?
1987.87-626,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,807.338,808.359,If such--
1987.87-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,808.359,814.394,"You can bring all of those things whenever there's a government employee, so long as you allege negligent failure to supervise?"
1987.87-626,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,814.394,817.236,--We made two arguments.
1987.87-626,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,838.89,847.265,"Except when they use the term ""arising out of assault"", you are giving it a very, very narrow meaning."
1987.87-626,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,853.901,855.3,"Your Honor, that's correct."
1987.87-626,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,869.54,872.254,"The statute doesn't say, ""arising only out of assault""."
1987.87-626,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,874.213,887.531,"--What the statute says is, ""arising out of assault"", and what arising means, if you look in the dictionary, which is the first place we must look when we are construing these statutes, arising means originate or spring up."
1987.87-626,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,919.751,926.036,"Had there not been an assault, there wouldn't have been any case, would there?"
1987.87-626,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,926.036,927.829,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.87-626,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,932.861,934.281,And that's arising out of.
1987.87-626,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,934.281,936.775,And it is one of the elements--
1987.87-626,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,936.775,938.595,It's arising out of.
1987.87-626,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,938.595,954.437,"--I guess my answer to that is, it's arising out of in the... in the sense that, yes, that is a central... it's an element which is a cause in fact, but my interpretation of arising out of says, don't look at the most immediate act."
1987.87-626,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,957.157,958.777,When he was born?
1987.87-626,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,958.777,978.62,"Well, I'm sure that there are some limitations, Your Honor, but my point would be that we can isolate governmental conduct, which is a cause in fact of this injury, and the first negligent governmental act presumably is where the claim arises."
1987.87-626,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1024.071,1025.102,"Thank you, Mr. Kator."
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1027.274,1028.225,Thank you.
1987.87-626,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1070.083,1073.814,But this isn't an action for an assault.
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1082.779,1102.012,"That's right, and it's also true that without the assault, without the battery there wouldn't be a claim, either, and this Court has said and held in Block v. Neal that where a claim is an... where an action is an essential element of the claim, the claim is part--"
1987.87-626,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1102.012,1102.992,"Did Block hold that, or did Neustadt?"
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1102.992,1106.845,--Block held that in distinguishing Neustadt.
1987.87-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1106.845,1114.412,"What do you do with the escaped mental patient, who assaults someone?"
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1120.243,1128.429,"Well, under Panella, the government is liable, or section... the intentional tort exception doesn't bar that claim."
1987.87-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1128.429,1128.968,Why not?
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1128.968,1131.091,Because the Court--
1987.87-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1131.091,1133.753,Doesn't it arise out of the assault in the same way?
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1133.753,1142.358,"--The Second Circuit in 1954 essentially read the phrase ""committed by a government employee"" into the statute."
1987.87-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1153.445,1155.916,"But at least in terms of your literal argument it is equally inconsistent with it, isn't it?"
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1155.916,1171.427,"Well, that's right, and I will say that if... Mr. Kator points to a number of difficult lines that are to be drawn, all of which I would submit are caused by that gloss on the statute."
1987.87-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1301.412,1308.347,"But the gloss words ""committed by a federal employee"" does kind of remind us of respondeat superior, doesn't it?"
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1308.347,1319.283,"Well, but of course negligent supervision claims arise most frequently for a tort committed by an employee."
1987.87-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1379.053,1386.087,Let me just go back for a second to my mental patient.
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1402.758,1406.11,"Well, that's the hardest case, and that is where the line has to be drawn."
1987.87-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1406.11,1406.78,--Would you give a different result in the two cases?
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1406.78,1409.504,I have two responses to that.
1987.87-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1527.74,1536.787,"But on your intentional, your driver intentionally running over somebody, supposing he does it 20 times and his boss knows it and keeps him on the job."
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1547.643,1548.995,"Well, that would be right."
1987.87-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1548.995,1554.499,You think it's quite clear Congress would not have wanted liability in that extreme situation?
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1569.978,1570.489,Right.
1987.87-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1613.747,1614.826,But there's a proviso.
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1617.84,1618.519,--Excuse me?
1987.87-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1618.519,1624.473,Am I wrong in thinking under the proviso there's a liability under respondeat superior.
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1630.407,1632.58,"Well, within the scope of his employment."
1987.87-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1632.58,1633.279,Right.
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1633.279,1635.171,Or committed a battery within the scope of his employment.
1987.87-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1635.171,1635.901,Correct.
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1635.901,1638.485,It is actually much more difficult to prove that a battery was--
1987.87-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1638.485,1640.615,"But there doesn't have to be any negligent supervision, is what I am trying to say."
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1640.615,1652.322,"--Well, that's right, but the exception waives that as well, and indeed it's the negligent supervision cases that are far the greater number of cases."
1987.87-626,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1656.025,1660.227,Surely you can forgive Justice Stevens for thinking that that maybe was all that it waived.
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1682.212,1697.901,"--Well, one would have thought that Congress would have said something about that, especially when the background seems to me to plainly be one of remedying negligent supervision cases rather than respondeat superior cases."
1987.87-626,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1697.901,1706.907,"On the facts of this case if... his name was Carr, the man that committed the assault?"
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1706.907,1707.618,Yes.
1987.87-626,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1707.618,1710.64,"If he'd have been a law enforcement officer, what result?"
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1710.64,1715.753,"Well, he wasn't."
1987.87-626,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1742.671,1743.682,For negligence?
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1743.682,1758.842,"--Well, liable for the injury caused to the... caused to the petitioners, which, yes, there would still have to be shown to be some negligence somewhere."
1987.87-626,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1758.842,1760.943,But then you are suing for negligence.
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1760.943,1763.985,That's right.
1987.87-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1771.619,1772.45,"You are quite wrong, aren't you?"
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1777.122,1785.119,"--Well, under the basic provision of the Federal Tort Claims Act you have to show a negligent or wrongful act by some government actor."
1987.87-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1785.119,1793.013,"Well, Justice Kennedy is hypothesizing a law enforcement officer who did exactly what the--"
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1793.013,1793.604,I'm sorry.
1987.87-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1794.135,1798.177,--And that would just... all he has to do is prove that's who he was and he shot the guy.
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1798.177,1799.348,I stand corrected.
1987.87-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1886.557,1887.465,"That isn't right, is it?"
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1903.086,1908.73,"--You would have to show it was within the scope of employment, and the dissenting judge below--"
1987.87-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1908.73,1913.412,"Well, he is driving a mail truck or something like that, gets in a fight, in a traffic dispute or something of that kind."
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1916.413,1920.548,"--Well, those cases, the courts are divided on those cases as to whether that is within the scope of employment."
1987.87-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1922.177,1929.874,"Well, but this makes it perfectly clear there will be no liability in that kind of case, even if it is in the scope of employment."
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1929.874,1932.264,"--It does do that, but of course the government might not--"
1987.87-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1932.264,1939.969,And I would submit there must be quite a number of those cases where there really isn't any colorable basis for claiming negligent supervision or negligent employment.
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1941.871,1953.098,"--Well, when a government employee commits a battery, it is always alleged that the employer should have known that."
1987.87-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1953.098,1953.729,"Yes, I know, but they have to prove it."
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1954.859,1963.805,"And the fact that the employee was hired, and did this terrible thing usually goes a long way to proving that he was negligently supervised."
1987.87-626,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2205.503,2225.955,"I thought the... if you are questioning what the basis of the government's responsibility here would be if it wasn't just the employment, I thought what they are contending is the adoption of regulations, which perhaps they didn't have to be adopted, but the government was a volunteer, and of course it's an old tort theory that if you act as a volunteer you'd better do it right."
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2225.955,2246.661,"Well, that's right, and that's our second argument here, that in any event the special duty argument doesn't arise here because contrary to petitioner's... the enactment of a regulation, the regulation in this case anyway doesn't come close to establishing a duty to protect petitioners."
1987.87-626,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2257.347,2262.68,"That all goes for the basis of imposing liability, which is a matter of state law."
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2266.303,2268.554,"Well, that's true."
1987.87-626,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2366.168,2369.651,He didn't have the rifle by assignment.
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2372.704,2376.504,--He kept it in his barracks.
1987.87-626,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2376.504,2377.986,Wasn't that against the rules?
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2377.986,2379.358,It was against the rules.
1987.87-626,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2379.358,2381.669,And couldn't that be negligence?
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2381.669,2385.111,For him it--
1987.87-626,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2385.111,2388.153,Couldn't it be negligent that they allowed him to do it?
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2388.153,2390.204,--Certainly it could be.
1987.87-626,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2390.204,2394.037,"Well, you just say it's not there."
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2394.037,2398.879,It's not negligence per se that that aspect doesn't add anything to the case.
1987.87-626,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2416.631,2424.385,I think the Navy is liable for allowing people to take guns when they are not authorized to take them if they are loaded.
1987.87-626,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2424.385,2431.381,"--He wasn't allowed to have the gun in the barracks, and he did so."
1987.87-626,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2431.381,2432.971,"And if it hadn't been for that, these people wouldn't have been injured."
