1994.94-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.228,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 94-431, James Ryder v. United States."
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,9.517,12.519,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.94-431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,120.571,121.352,May I--
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,128.725,142.816,"Your Honor, our view is that that appointment is not valid, but that question is not before the Court in this case because the decision at issue here was made before the Secretary's memorandum."
1994.94-431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,142.816,152.66,"I understand that, but is it not correct that it was made... was that appointment made before the judgment in this case became final in the sense that all direct review was over?"
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,152.66,163.649,"Well, Justice Stevens, direct review continues, but it was made before the case was decided by the Court of Military Appeals."
1994.94-431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,163.649,173.245,"It's your view, I gather, then, that even if the valid appointment were made 20 minutes after the case was over it would be too late?"
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,173.245,176.487,"Yes, Your Honor, that would be my view."
1994.94-431,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,176.487,182.211,"I'd like to ask you how, under these circumstances, the petitioner was harmed."
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,197.52,208.579,"Justice O'Connor, the... this Court's cases in separation of powers cases have never indicated that a showing of direct harm is necessary."
1994.94-431,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,216.063,227.029,"But you have a very different situation, for example, if it's an Article III court, and a non-Article III judge is participating."
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,241.068,255.919,"--The Freitag decision, also while this Court found the appointments there to be proper, there was a... as it was put there, the decisions of the special trial judges of the tax court would have been invalid had they not been properly appointed."
1994.94-431,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,289.363,302.83,"Well now, at common law, an appointment-related challenge of the kind you're trying to make here as defense to a prosecution would not have been considered justiciable, would it?"
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,311.655,318.06,"Currently, under the very old common law, which viewed the holding of an office as akin to a property right, that's correct."
1994.94-431,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,330.76,347.499,"But that may be, in fact, what's behind the de facto officer doctrine as such, the notion that when raised as the petitioner did here, it just isn't going to produce an overturning of the conviction."
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,347.499,364.07,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that's the question we're deciding here, whether it will, and we're not talking about an overturning of the conviction, basically an overturning of the appeal where the unconstitutionally appointed judges sat."
1994.94-431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,380.672,391.968,"Mr. Lotz, if we're concerned with practicality, then isn't this business about de facto at the middle tier kind of an academic exercise?"
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,405.897,412.352,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, the review at the Court of Military Appeals by no means corrected this."
1994.94-431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,422.159,431.095,"Well, can you tie it into this case and tell me what it was that was reviewed as the second tier that was not reviewed on final review?"
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,431.095,436.447,--The... I can't tell you specifically anything that was not reviewed.
1994.94-431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,437.338,442.922,"It's conceivable that the issues were the same, and if they were, then this is kind of a moot case, isn't it?"
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,442.922,448.837,"--Well, we don't... our position is that it's not moot."
1994.94-431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,468.198,471.019,Were facts challenged at the intermediate stage?
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,483.157,487.162,There was no fact-finding that was critical to the decisions of the issues.
1994.94-431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,487.162,495.487,"So then what Justice Ginsburg says would seem to be correct, that if there are only issues of law, you've simply skipped the middle stage."
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,495.487,505.044,"Well, Your Honor, the statute provides the petitioner with the right to an appeal at the Court of Military Review."
1994.94-431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,518.725,522.847,Let's put it in a context of Article III courts.
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,553.938,568.106,"--Justice Scalia, the... my understanding of the decisions in Glidden and in Freitag indicate that it's... you don't have to show direct harm."
1994.94-431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,568.106,572.129,In Freitag it was in the first instance there was an infirmity.
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,572.129,573.091,That's correct.
1994.94-431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,573.091,577.632,In Glidden it was a question of an Article III judge at the second tier.
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,577.632,579.233,Glidden involved two cases.
1994.94-431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,582.135,589.411,"But think of a case, let's say cases in the circuit, and a question is certified, so it comes right here."
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,608.592,615.116,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, Congress didn't think it was an unnecessary extra and provided for it."
1994.94-431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,624.913,628.617,"Well, there is no constitutional right to two reviews, no less than one, right?"
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,628.617,630.397,"--That's correct, but it's a statutory right."
1994.94-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,636.792,643.126,"Well, Mr. Lotz, did you petition for review by the Court of Military Appeals in this case?"
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,643.126,643.907,We did.
1994.94-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,643.907,644.829,And was it granted?
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,644.829,645.52,It was.
1994.94-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,645.52,653.264,"And what... do they grant on specific issues, or do they review the same things that you argued to the intermediate court?"
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,653.264,655.475,Normally they grant on specific issues.
1994.94-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,657.938,659.168,And what did they do in this case?
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,659.168,666.914,"They reviewed the issues specified by the petitioner, which in essence were the same issues reviewed by the court--"
1994.94-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,666.914,676.208,So you really did get a review by a correctly constituted court of the same issues that you raised in the first tier appellate court.
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,676.208,680.943,--After denial of appropriate review in the Court of Military Review.
1994.94-431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,680.943,691.279,"I suppose you would argue, though, that as is true with us, that the court of last resort is sometimes affected by the caliber of the judging in the intermediate court."
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,697.953,699.714,"I would absolutely agree with that, Justice Stevens."
1994.94-431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,699.714,705.179,"But your remedy would be going back perhaps to the same panel, or what would you remedy be?"
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,705.179,711.911,Remedy would be a review anew in the Court of Military Review by constitutionally appointed judges.
1994.94-431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,711.911,714.642,How about these very same judges who are now constitutionally appointed?
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,714.642,726.081,My position is that they should not review the same case again as they have already given an opinion on the merits of the case.
1994.94-431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,726.081,739.251,"Would it be unlawful for the... after all, they are already familiar with this, and it would be least expensive to have the same judges review what they did now that they have the proper appointment."
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,739.251,743.033,"It's our opinion that that would be unlawful, yes."
1994.94-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,743.033,746.686,Why would it be unlawful?
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,751.791,768.811,"Well, Chief Justice Rehnquist, the... in essence, at the earlier appeal they were not constitutionally appointed judges, and in that capacity they issued a decision expressing their opinion on the merits of the case."
1994.94-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,778.656,781.469,"Well, I certainly don't understand that."
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,785.061,791.966,"On a prejudgment of the merits of the case, Your Honor."
1994.94-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,791.966,816.202,"Well, what if three, say, professors sat on a moot court and the question was presented to them and they decided it for the moot court and then later the exact... they were all appointed to a court of appeals, and later the exact same question comes up in the court of appeals, are they disqualified because they participated in the same thing in a moot court?"
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,816.202,828.939,"No, I don't believe so, Your Honor, but a moot court is by definition an academic exercise, not a real dispute between live parties, so I think that would be a different situation."
1994.94-431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,828.939,840.577,"What about when this Court reverses an appellate panel and it has to go back to that same panel, and maybe there was an alternate ground to end up for the same party?"
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,840.577,856.928,"I believe that there... that may be different in that the... I'm assuming that the appellate panel that's reversed was consti... or composed entirely of constitutionally appointed judges, and their opinion then is expressed only in their judicial capacity."
1994.94-431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,856.928,867.876,"Mr. Lotz, I want to go back to whether there's any harm done in light of the fact that there was a later review anyway which would have been the same review."
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,881.466,884.478,The United States does not always appeal.
1994.94-431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,888.518,889.169,So you can't really tell.
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,891.56,892.552,It might have.
1994.94-431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,892.552,893.573,And the United States might not have appealed.
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,893.573,895.113,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,895.113,898.586,They might also have... or might they.
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,904.55,908.163,It was basically a legal issue regarding evidentiary issues.
1994.94-431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,908.163,911.874,"Still and all, at least there's a chance they would have come out for the defendant and the United States would not have appealed."
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,911.874,912.364,That's correct.
1994.94-431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,913.886,918.058,"I'm sorry, I'm just missing something."
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,934.918,935.519,That's correct.
1994.94-431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,935.519,949.209,"There was an assignment of error that the appellant received a disproportionate sentence because the military judge unduly emphasized the deterrent function of sentencing, and then I didn't find the... I didn't find that referred to."
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,952.221,955.464,"I appreciate your asking that, Justice Breyer."
1994.94-431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,970.952,980.539,Then it seemed to me there was an issue that they decided below in the improperly constituted court that the properly constituted court didn't decide.
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,980.539,981.701,--That's correct.
1994.94-431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,981.701,984.082,So then we probably would have to reach the issue.
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,984.082,989.325,"That's correct, and I apologize for that misstatement."
1994.94-431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1035.755,1055.548,"May I ask this: when you're getting into this distinction between direct review and collateral attack, this, I understand, is on direct review, but is it your position that your client, if he had not raised it during the proceeding but had waited until after the appellate process had run its course and then brought a habeas corpus petition, that relief would have been appropriate?"
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,1055.548,1060.652,"Justice Stevens, I'm... that's not my client."
1994.94-431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1074.39,1084.739,"Well, but I think Teague would no longer be a problem if we decided, and perhaps we'd... it may be in the first case, but somewhere along the line I would assume that the question could be raised."
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,1093.342,1098.566,I think that there may well be a distinction between a case on direct review and collateral review.
1994.94-431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1098.566,1104.961,"Mr. Lotz, before you waste more ammunition on prospectivity, why do we have to worry about prospectivity?"
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,1121.051,1142.625,"Well, Justice Scalia, my reading of Griffith and Beam and Harper, all of those went back to State courts, which by definition are not Article III courts, plus, it would be ironic to say that it's okay for the Court of Military Appeals to issue a purely prospective decision that this Court could not do even when that case comes up here."
1994.94-431,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1142.625,1148.118,--Which we would have to do if we went the other way from yours in this case.
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,1148.118,1149.07,That's correct.
1994.94-431,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1149.07,1149.51,Yes.
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,1149.51,1151.1,The--
1994.94-431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1151.1,1153.932,I don't understand that.
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,1154.352,1154.963,--The--
1994.94-431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1154.963,1156.724,What would we be tied to?
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,1156.724,1181.881,"--In this case, if Petty Officer Ryder had not persuaded the Court of Military Appeals that the appointments of the Court of Military Review judges were unconstitutional, basically that he lost on the legal issue at the Court of Military Appeals but won on that issue at this Court... this is an Article III court that should not issue purely prospective decisions."
1994.94-431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1190.216,1198.501,"I don't know why it... it might be ironic, but I don't know why it would pose any problem from the standpoint of prospectivity juris."
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,1198.501,1211.04,"Well, and as I said earlier, Griffith and Beam and Harper all dealt with State courts, and forbidding them from applying prospective adjudication."
1994.94-431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1212.969,1237.988,"Could you clarify the issue that was raised before this tribunal that you say was improperly composed and therefore has to be redone, precisely what that issue was, and whether it would be appropriate then to say only as to the unreviewed issue does this have to go back to have what would be a first appeal?"
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,1237.988,1275.752,"--The issue that was not granted review at the Court of Military Appeals dealt with a contention that the panel, which is the equivalent of the jury, imposed an unduly severe sentence because of the way the military judge, the military trial judge answered a question and that he may have overemphasized the general deterrent effect of a harsh sentence and led, then... which led the panel to impose that unduly harsh sentence."
1994.94-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1293.713,1298.907,You petitioned the Court of Military Appeals to review that and they declined to?
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,1298.907,1299.868,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1299.868,1307.032,So would it be appropriate to have just that issue--
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,1307.032,1308.534,I--
1994.94-431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1308.534,1310.164,--since the other issues were reviewed?
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,1310.164,1311.596,--I don't believe it would.
1994.94-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1373.089,1378.171,"Yes, but how about the prosecuting arm of the Coast Guard?"
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,1378.171,1386.616,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the Government was on notice of the allegation of this appointments defect."
1994.94-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1397.763,1404.859,But isn't that generally true in a lot of cases where you're talking about reliance interest?
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,1423.662,1433.296,"--When there is reasonable reliance that may be a factor, but that's only really been applied in civil cases anyway."
1994.94-431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1446.126,1469.49,"But you could have cases, it seems to me... you say the Government was on notice, and in a perfect world we all know what the law is, but there are, potentially at least, some very close questions under the Appointments Clause in which the Government might reasonably think that there had been a proper appointment but later on, after years go by, somebody realizes there was a flaw in the procedure, and in the meantime hundreds of cases have been decided."
1994.94-431,0,16433,allen_lotz,,1473.383,1476.136,"There is in some cases, Your Honor."
1994.94-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1560.151,1561.341,"Very well, Mr. Lott."
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1563.103,1569.556,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-431,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1634.47,1651.091,"But in effect you're... I think what you're saying is that there is remedial discretion to give no remedy whatsoever, and therefore I don't see how you draw the distinction between prospectivity of remedy and prospectivity of vindication of right."
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1651.091,1664.638,There... in particular circumstances there can be occasions when a remedy is not appropriate.
1994.94-431,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1774.33,1777.783,"Well, the Court of Military Appeals isn't established under title 28, is it?"
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1777.783,1779.796,"Well, I understand that."
1994.94-431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1800.789,1807.081,"Are you saying that this, even as applied to Article III courts this allows selective prospectivity?"
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1814.998,1820.312,I would not say it renders Harper wrong at all.
1994.94-431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1844.628,1846.678,I don't see how you get that out of that language.
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1852.682,1854.122,One could make that argument.
1994.94-431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1854.122,1855.484,--One would have to make that argument.
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1857.936,1871.235,"Well, what is just under the circumstances can be looked at in a more generalized way than the selective prospectivity way of looking at it."
1994.94-431,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1875.607,1882.171,"One way to do that, for example, would be to recognize a harmless error doctrine as we do."
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1882.171,1884.342,That is correct.
1994.94-431,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1884.342,1898.451,"But it's a very far step from that to say that to sort of deny the old slogan and say yes, irdeed, there can be rights absolutely without remedy, and that seems to me the consequence of your argument."
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1898.451,1943.051,"Well, there may be rights without remedy in a particular circumstance, although there would be remedies in other circumstances, and what I would like to suggest here is that there were six factors, six considerations that were before the Court of Military Appeals and that apply to all nine or ten of the pending cases... this is not a selective matter... that warranted their conclusion that when there was no other defect in the proceedings there was no need to order relief in this case, and I would like--"
1994.94-431,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1943.051,1954.411,"Well, one of the consequences of accepting that argument is that no one, I suppose, no party in interest, will ever have an incentive to challenge a valid appointment in these circumstances."
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1954.411,1994.485,"--Well, that is in our view, Justice Souter, not the consequence, because anyone who raises an additional issue, as the petitioner here did, would have the incentive to also raise the Appointments Clause issue, because if there were another error or defect in the proceedings that required retrial or remand to the Court of Military Review, certainly then the Court of Military Appeals should say any further hearing should be conducted by a tribunal constituted in a--"
1994.94-431,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1994.485,1995.427,"Why should it say that, on your theory?"
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1995.427,1999.017,--Because--
1994.94-431,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1999.017,2002.99,"If they were good enough the first time, why aren't they good enough the second time?"
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2002.99,2012.587,--Because there now has been a definitive ruling by the Court of Military Appeals that this defect had occurred.
1994.94-431,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2015.889,2016.51,But it's a remediless one--
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2031.749,2033.141,--We weren't a party.
1994.94-431,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2037.773,2056.065,"The identical argument was made... well, the statute of limitations, the service of process question there, that was a question of choice of law, and choice of law, that was fully retroactive, but remedy, applying it to this plaintiff, you didn't have to do that, because that was a question of remedy."
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2056.065,2063.949,"--Well, that's a case in which the Government is not taking a position which is pending before the Court."
1994.94-431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2139.119,2144.192,"It seems to me if you rely on that, you're really asking us to decide whether that was a valid cure or not."
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2144.192,2154.52,"--Well, it was an effort to correct the defect that had been found, and to that extent the public interest consideration required--"
1994.94-431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2154.52,2161.032,"Supposing we were... we thought it was a perfectly obvious ineffective effort to correct it, would it still be satisfactory to you?"
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2167.968,2170.091,"--Well, it's a cure for the future."
1994.94-431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2173.18,2173.661,"Well, you say--"
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2174.322,2200.059,"Yes, but there's a very substantial argument that these statutes should be interpreted in conformity with the Appointments Clause rather than in a manner that would not enable the responsible officials to comply with the Appointments Clause while still conducting the proceedings that Congress has authorized."
1994.94-431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2232.1,2235.422,"But again, that seems to me if there were another error you'd reverse for that reason."
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2236.884,2249.362,"We'd reverse for that reason, and any further proceedings would be... they could order it would have to be before a tribunal constituted in accordance with the Appointments Clause."
1994.94-431,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2249.362,2260.299,"Once again, the consequence of taking that as relevant is in effect to say that as long as the improperly appointed people are competent, there's nothing to worry about."
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2264.79,2283.132,"Well, but... but the competence is quite important when you're talking about whether in the absence of other defect there's reason to upset the result of the particular proceeding and redo it."
1994.94-431,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2283.132,2308.481,"Yes, but the... in effect you're saying there just is not an independent value in policing the Appointments Clause by providing the normal incentive for a party like this to raise the issue prospectively, and you're saying that, and implicitly it seems to me you're saying there just is not a value that outweighs the importance of getting a particular issue right on the merits."
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2308.481,2308.669,In light--
1994.94-431,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2308.669,2309.821,"As long as they get it right, who cares?"
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2309.821,2331.144,"--In light of the adequate incentive to raise the issue along with other issues which the defendant will have if for no other reason than because if he persuades an appellate court that there was more than one error, the appellate court is less likely to say that it's satisfied that the cumulative effect of the errors was harmless."
1994.94-431,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2331.144,2357.382,"No, but I would suppose he has even the disincentive on your theory, because if he raises it, as I suppose he ought to do, at the trial level, he has to worry about making all those judges mad, and I suppose that if he knows that he gets nothing independently by raising the Appointments Clause issue, there is in fact an incentive not to raise it."
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2357.382,2380.557,I think we generally have to operate on the assumption that judges will rise above personal reactions to contentions and rule on their legal merits.
1994.94-431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2380.557,2382.34,At least properly appointed judges.
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2382.957,2383.869,Yes.
1994.94-431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2431.811,2437.525,"This argument sounds to me like you'd say you got tried before a judge who happened not to be a lawyer, not to be appointed or anything else."
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2448.911,2451.763,"--With respect, Justice Stevens, I have not yet made my point."
1994.94-431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2451.763,2452.244,I'm sorry.
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2452.744,2453.533,Which is--
1994.94-431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2453.533,2454.384,I'm interested--
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2454.384,2479.733,"--that these two individuals happened both to be persons who had served while on active duty as commissioned officers as judges of Courts of Military Review, so while the analogy is not a perfect one, they are in many respects and important respects similar to judges on senior status."
1994.94-431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2479.733,2483.414,--But the Appointments Clause does not assure quality.
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2495.231,2499.144,We are not contesting whether the Appointments Clause was violated.
1994.94-431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2499.144,2499.495,"--Well, then I don't see what the relevance is."
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2499.495,2504.488,We're talking about an exercise of remedial discretion in the circumstances.
1994.94-431,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2504.488,2513.434,"Well, I don't see why your argument doesn't cut against you on that, because it seems to me what you've shown us is that this would be a defect which it would be very easy to remedy."
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2524.731,2543.494,"The defect has been remedied for future cases, in our view, and we do think that we are going to be able to resist collateral attack on habeas corpus efforts which may be made."
1994.94-431,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2553.919,2557.303,Wouldn't that be easier than have to face habeas later on?
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2557.303,2569.89,"Well, we'll be facing the habeas anyway, unless we prevail in this case, and then the habeas cases would follow a fortiori from it."
1994.94-431,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2623.976,2629.079,"Mr. Wallace, what do you think of the argument about the issues that were reviewed by the court of final instance?"
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2633.493,2638.136,There were issues that the Court of Military Appeals denied review of.
1994.94-431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2655.937,2658.862,Other judges might have come out other ways.
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2658.862,2660.671,"That is correct, but--"
1994.94-431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2660.671,2661.841,Judges sometimes come out different ways--
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2661.841,2662.251,--But--
1994.94-431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2662.251,2662.722,--and on the same question--
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2662.722,2663.082,--But--
1994.94-431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2663.082,2665.374,--so you cannot assure us that this would have come out the same way.
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2665.374,2701.598,"--Of course, but there's a question here, if you don't follow the normal practice of remanding it to the same panel, if you specify that there have to be different judges, which can occur here because the military judges have been rotated, although the same two civilian judges out of the five judges still sit there, you're really giving this particular criminal defendant something that most of the defendants don't have, which is two reviews, and these reviews are more extensive reviews in the military system factually than the--"
1994.94-431,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2701.598,2703.121,Would they have to be--
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2703.121,2703.621,--ordinary court of appeal reviews.
1994.94-431,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2703.621,2706.971,"--Since this is a unique situation, would they have to be?"
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2715.429,2724.595,"Whatever it is, it's something that other defendants don't get, two de novo reevaluations of the evidence."
1994.94-431,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2731.558,2732.299,Mr. Wallace--
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2741.766,2743.776,"It sits in panels of three, which is--"
1994.94-431,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2743.776,2745.188,What's the total membership?
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2745.188,2745.647,--Five.
1994.94-431,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2745.647,2756.055,"So it would be possible, if you decided that the two who had sat previously should not review it, still to get a fully constituted panel."
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2756.055,2769.833,"It would, because the military judge who was on this case has been rotated out of this service, and there are three new military judges on the court, and they... active duty judges, that is, and they could hear the case."
1994.94-431,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2770.844,2782.191,"Now, is it... in the ordinary course of business, would you ordinarily have the three military judges constituting a panel, or would there always be a civilian on the panel?"
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2782.191,2787.144,"It can... the panels rotate, and it can be the three military judges."
1994.94-431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2798.404,2799.281,Is that true of the Coast Guard?
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2802.343,2803.425,--I don't really know.
1994.94-431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2828.551,2829.743,"Mr. Wallace, can I ask you sort of a broader question?"
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2847.674,2859.963,"--Well, we think that the de facto officer doctrine is the backdrop here against which this was a proper exercise of remedial discretion."
1994.94-431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2901.08,2901.748,Well--
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2939.405,2939.815,--I can't say that--
1994.94-431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2939.815,2943.166,"--where it is raised immediately before the officer, before he rules."
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2943.166,2945.73,--I can't say whether we've ever asserted it.
1994.94-431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2946.868,2947.99,Do you know of any case where we've asserted it?
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2947.99,2961.147,"--I don't know of a case where we have, and we're using it only as a backdrop to the exercise, what we believe is the proper exercise of remedial discretion in this case that--"
1994.94-431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2961.147,2966.59,"It seems to me it's critical to your position, then, that the subsequent attempt to cure the defect was valid."
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2978.28,2987.635,"--Well, I would go so far as to say there has to be a substantial basis for believing that the cure was valid."
1994.94-431,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3010.591,3029.373,"Mr. Wallace, before we... it seems to me there's a real risk for this Court in adopting this kind of an approach that you're urging on us, that we look upon the individual case, and before we apply the doctrine that the officer who rules on a case has to be one properly appointed, at least where the challenge is raised immediately."
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3074.833,3083.959,"--Well, I don't say that this case should turn on an assessment by this Court of that kind of question."
1994.94-431,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3124.586,3144.607,"The difficulty that I wanted to ask you about is in... I haven't read the whole Carpenter opinion, but in the part of it in your brief, the reason that they give for not extending it backwards, it says just as the acts of the FEC Commissioners were accorded de facto validity in Buckley v. Valeo, we hold that judicial acts of the chief judge are entitled to de facto validity."
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3153.433,3166.422,I think that it is properly looked at as an exercise of remedial discretion in that use of the Buckley case.
1994.94-431,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3252.879,3262.424,"Mr. Wallace, at least with respect to Buckley v. Valeo, wasn't that just a challenge head-on to the statute with no individual's case on the line?"
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3262.424,3274.052,"--Well, it arose in that context, that is correct, although there had been actions taken of an administrative nature that were not being undone."
1994.94-431,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3275.103,3277.585,But you didn't have somebody in the position of Ryder.
1994.94-431,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3277.585,3294.785,"--That is correct, but even in injunction jurisprudence the Court has said it's error to interfere with action in the future, that it doesn't comply with the statute until the statute has been complied with in cases like Weinberg v. Romero Barcello."
1994.94-431,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3294.785,3296.447,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1994.94-431,2,16433,allen_lotz,,3299.53,3318.652,"Just very briefly, at the risk of repeating what Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg said, this six-factor analysis that Mr. Wallace referred to is not apparent in the Court of Military Appeals decision in Carpenter."
1994.94-431,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3330.308,3333.441,"We could remand to have them apply the six-factor test, I--"
1994.94-431,2,16433,allen_lotz,,3333.441,3354.525,"--Well, that... Justice Scalia, I believe that would generate much more litigation than sending Ryder back to the Court of Military Review, and the Court of Military Appeals specifically considered and rejected the Government's contention in Carpenter that the fact that these individuals were retired military officers somehow improved their position under the Appointments Clause."
1994.94-431,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3355.727,3357.643,"Thank you, Mr. Lotz."
