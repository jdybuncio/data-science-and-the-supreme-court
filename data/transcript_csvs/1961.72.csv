1961.72,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,15.687,"Number 72, David Walter -- Walton Cramp, Jr., Appellant, versus Board of Public Instruction of Orange County, Florida."
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,46.072,50.727,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please this Honorable Court."
1961.72,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,176.914,179.029,How long is this statute been on the books?
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,179.029,181.007,Since 1949 sir.
1961.72,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,181.007,183.502,So it was there when he first became employed as a --
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,183.502,186.905,"Yes, that is correct."
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,337.079,347.019,"You argue the oath in its entirety beyond the power of the state or you emphasize when calling our attention to the oath, a particular clause?"
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,347.019,347.558,I will emphasize --
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,347.558,349.401,Is that --
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,349.401,352.069,I will emphasize three particular clauses of (Voice Overlap) --
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,352.069,364.118,My question is not merely emphasis but do you say that no clause of this oath could stand or some could but it's mixed up with others that couldn't?
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,364.118,375.023,It is conceivable and I do not wish to reach the point necessarily that the first of the clauses that one must not be a communist in order to teach in the public schools.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,384.463,388.95,"Well, the first one is the -- to swear to support the Constitution."
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,389.81,396.694,That of course is -- that is the same oath that I am required to take and I believe that the Justices of this Court are required to take it --
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,396.694,397.037,"Oh, (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,397.037,398.094,-- there's no quarrel about that.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,398.094,412.025,I can conceive of even such an oath that you single out nobody in the community except the particular person or particular class that you might have a basis of proposition or question.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,415.866,424.225,We do not at this point contend that this particular qualification would be unconstitutional.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,424.225,434.723,"The next one, you have indicated that it's beyond the power of the State that I have not -- will not lend my aid, support, advice, counsel, influence, you challenge that?"
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,434.723,436.514,"On at least three grounds, if Your Honor please."
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,436.514,443.206,"And the next one, that I do not believe in the overthrow of the Government of United States or of the State of Florida by force or violence."
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,443.206,445.154,"We challenge that, yes sir."
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,445.154,445.842,You do challenge that.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,445.842,446.995,Yes sir.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,446.995,458.603,"The next one, that I am not a member of an -- any organization or party which believes and/or teaches directly or indirectly the overthrow of the Government of United States or Florida by force, you must challenge that if you did the previous one?"
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,458.603,461.801,We likewise challenge that on additional grounds to all the others.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,461.801,463.213,Alright.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,463.213,463.416,If I --
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,463.416,466.866,I just want to get -- focus my mind to what it is that I'm going to listen to.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,466.866,486.16,"If I may direct my attention to the first of the clauses which Your Honor has indicated we oppose, and that is the question of that clause of the oath which states that I have not lent aid, support, advice, counsel or influence to the Communist Party?"
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,595.282,603.948,May I ask you whether the Communist Party ever appeared on the official voting ballots of Florida?
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,603.948,605.784,Not to my knowledge if Your Honor please.
1961.72,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,611.81,635.025,"How do you jump the hurdle, the necessity of your argument of this part, how do you jump the hurdle if the Supreme Court of Florida said in view of the allegations of the complaint, which you said that he has never given any such aid or he had no standing as a matter of state law to raise a question, why isn't that an adequate statement?"
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,635.025,645.455,"Well, Mr. Justice Harlan, what the State of Florida said was that we had no standing to raise this as a matter of ex post facto."
1961.72,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,680.69,697.299,"Yeah, but the Court, the Florida Court as I read its opinion said, you cannot raise your Constitutional objections to this because you have no standing in light of your allegation with your complaint?"
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,697.299,738.652,"I would respectfully submit that this particular question insofar as there is any merit to it and we do not concede that there is merit to the statement, but that any standing to sue is -- we do have standing to sue because this is a matter of due process that a man who states that he is not a communist and has never lent aid, support or counsel or advice to the Communist Party is nevertheless entitled as an American under the Due Process Clause to refuse to execute an oath which requires that he so state this."
1961.72,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,795.439,802.732,"You argue in effect that this certain state ground is not one that we should recognize as an adequate state ground, that's the substance --"
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,802.732,803.319,That is correct.
1961.72,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,803.319,804.359,-- of your argument.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,804.359,804.912,Yes sir.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,828.131,832.813,But I think you are casting your net too broadly if I may say so.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,887.437,888.056,The --
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,888.056,889.627,That's simply because he is in a class.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,892.518,893.105,No Your Honor.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,905.873,923.507,"But to go to the -- perhaps one ought to hear your objection, if you go to the objection of such a class, the objection namely that they can search way back into his life, I don't know how many years back, that's why I asked you when the Communist Party was established."
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,975.525,1007.244,"Well, we respectfully submit that the mere statement, the mere fact that he has come to this Court as others have not done and have stated what his political beliefs are does not remove him from the protection of the Due Process Clause, Now this Court, I do not believe will take the position that there must be a doubt in the minds of Justices before they will give benefit of the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment to the litigants."
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1007.352,1008.448,But there's nothing (Voice Overlap) --
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1008.448,1009.377,-- had come --
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1009.377,1011.308,Isn't a question of doubt in our minds.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1020.379,1041.013,"Well, we submit that we are hurt because this is a man who should not be required to submit to a qualification which offends the Constitution regardless of whether he himself is a person who is being hurt directly."
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1110.098,1112.371,"I don't accept your starting point, you see."
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1140.12,1152.672,"Except that in this case, if Your Honor please, this man did not sign this affidavit and the statements that he made in his complaint were not regarded by the State of Florida as a substitute for this affidavit."
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1205.375,1207.485,He's not a guarantee of what?
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1207.485,1209.942,That some Court will find --
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1209.942,1211.845,"Now, you're talking so far as I'm concerned (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1211.845,1215.454,That some Court would find that he has done exactly the same thing --
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1215.454,1215.633,"Now, you're talking."
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1215.633,1217.388,-- or has not done exactly the same thing.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1217.388,1217.701,"Now, you talk --"
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1217.701,1227.229,"But this another ground why this particular language, the vagueness and Your Honor of course has dissented in both Garner and in the American Communications Association --"
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1227.229,1228.05,But that's a very different argument --
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1228.05,1228.891,-- on the same ground.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1228.891,1230.909,-- from the one that you thought was conclusive.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1230.909,1234.784,I had not at that point come to that argument Your Honor.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1234.784,1267.863,"What you're saying is that he might sign this oath and he might subject himself to prosecution of perjury and then at least would have to litigate whether what he did not 40 years ago but two years ago could be regarded on the appropriate charge by a judge to a jury as bringing himself within these terms support, advice, counsel and influence to deny that and therefore it's a case of perjury."
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1269.665,1291.029,That is because the language of this particular section is incapable of actual definition and therefore as a matter of due process should not be included among the qualifications for teachers or public employees in Florida or in any other state.
1961.72,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1522.301,1525.05,Aren't you making a pretty broad argument?
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1534.929,1535.289,No sir.
1961.72,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1569.134,1569.898,Evolution.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1569.898,1572.016,-- evolution in a college.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1606.541,1610.19,Are you saying -- are you suggesting it's far a field that --
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1610.19,1610.691,"Yes sir, I -- I --"
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1610.691,1613.843,-- what I want to know -- what arguments imply.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1626.763,1627.864,Yes sir.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1630.937,1631.777,I hope I didn't.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1631.777,1642.641,"-- in Garner [Attempt to Laughter] where you stated that man cannot be asked to swear about something they cannot be expected to know, such a demand is at war with individual integrity."
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1654.844,1663.052,"That means that the State of Florida can't refuse to employ a plumber on its law faculty because he is expected to know about law, is that it?"
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1663.052,1663.763,No sir.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1668.193,1678.445,"In the first -- we'll reject the whole basis on which a medical school is conducted for good or bad reasons, is violating -- the state is violating the First Amendment."
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1679.182,1679.579,I do not --
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1679.579,1683.241,-- you'd get more mileage if you went down with some another argument.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1683.241,1735.977,"Well, we state that in this particular instance, a man's beliefs as to violent overthrow, do not serve as a basis for excluding him from the faculty in a public school system in Florida for two reasons which we have stated; one, because the concepts of belief are beyond the power of the state to inquire into, and secondly, and certainly, and this Court has held on this point that the only type of belief in this area which can serve as some basis for inquiry is a type of belief or advocacy into the overthrow of the Government as an immediate objective rather than as a question of prophecy."
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1735.977,1746.912,"I do not -- I do not understand why on your theory, you do not challenge the requirement of denial to become a member of the Communist Party?"
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1746.912,1759.998,"Because, I believe that this Court has already foreclosed that question."
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1792.097,1795.299,But you are challenging the force and violence part of this oath.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1795.299,1797.656,Not the force and violence part. I challenge the --
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1797.656,1797.925,I thought you're (Voice Overlap) --
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1797.925,1836.43,"-- ability of the State of Florida to require that a man express his beliefs as distinguished from his actions in membership, as distinguished possibly from his advocacy, written statements or oral statements but I maintain that it has always been the concept of our Constitution and of this Court that individual integrity requires that an individual's unspoken, unadvocated, unwritten beliefs are his and belong to him privately and solely."
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1836.43,1845.665,"But did I understand you correctly to say that you challenge the clause that, “I do not believe in the overthrow of the Government of United States by force or violence.”"
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1845.665,1849.639,Yes sir because it states the word ‘believe.'
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1875.195,1889.376,"And so Florida can refrain to appoint somebody to teach civics that it has called in so many institutions who says, “I firmly believe -- I do believe in the overthrow of the Government of United States by force or violence.”"
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1889.376,1889.573,I would say --
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1889.573,1890.037,Is that right?
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1890.037,1899.121,"-- that the minute -- no sir, because as soon as this is stated, it now becomes a matter of record, it is a matter then of advocacy."
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1920.011,1921.968,"Well, I don't understand you quite."
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1950.242,1954.142,That I believe also can be an entirely different matter.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1978.181,1987.849,"You mean -- let's see if I understand, if it -- if a teacher to be hired for civics could be required to sign this, but a teacher of mathematics could not."
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1988.59,1989.315,No sir.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1989.315,1989.653,What is the --
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,1989.653,2011.621,Neither -- neither a teacher -- no teacher and no public employee can be subjected to a state qualification or employment wherein belief is the sole criterion upon which he is to be hired.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2011.621,2025.717,"Well then, I am assuming that they've put him through the ropes as to where he studied and what books he's read and all the rest and also this that you must sign an oath that you do not believe in the overthrow of the Government by force or violence."
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,2027.756,2028.28,No sir.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2028.28,2029.03,That's wrong.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,2029.03,2029.617,That is correct.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2030.043,2032.108,But when is it alright?
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,2033.228,2039.976,"It is, in my opinion, never alright for the state to inquire into the man's beliefs as a condition of his employment."
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2039.976,2042.12,Well then let me ask you again.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,2065.333,2065.976,No sir.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2065.976,2066.181,Alright.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,2066.181,2069.225,Because this involves the man's beliefs.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2069.225,2069.32,Alright.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,2069.32,2079.578,And these beliefs cannot be for -- cannot form the basis of an exclusion from public employment.
1961.72,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2458.162,2459.327,May I ask you a question?
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,2459.327,2459.95,Yes sir.
1961.72,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2459.95,2464.322,I haven't quite understood some of the lines you've drawn.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,2510.556,2512.97,Yes sir.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2557.504,2572.871,Do you think of -- do you think a man's conviction of what he promises to carry out -- about what he promises to carry out has no relation to the reliance one can place upon his capacity to carry out or to be subject to carry out.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,2572.871,2573.941,"Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I have not mentioned --"
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2573.941,2575.155,I thought we've had a great deal of --
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,2575.155,2575.986,I have not mentioned a man's --
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2575.986,2578.154,(Voice Overlap) talk about that to the contrary.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,2598.702,2599.892,No sir.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2605.935,2607.862,You can count on that no matter what?
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,2607.862,2608.146,I feel that --
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2608.146,2609.13,That's ultimately so.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,2609.13,2637.31,-- that the danger to this country and to our institutions of having government inquire into a man's beliefs and stipulating that a man must believe in a particular manner as a condition of employment can lead to far greater danger than the possibility that a man might not do a job even though he has sworn to do it because he doesn't feel within himself that this is the way he would like the system to be.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2652.51,2658.333,There may be a difference of opinion as to what a man's belief regarding the ultimate mysteries of the universe.
1961.72,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2686.649,2688.94,I don't know precisely what the position is?
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2688.94,2698.026,But there are several such things that the appointees by the President should be people who believe in the policy which they're called upon to execute.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,2698.026,2701.234,I do not say that it is not desirable to achieve this.
1961.72,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2725.067,2772.518,"Without getting into this, the soundness or the unsoundness of your position that I was just trying to clarify; as I understand, what you're saying is that the Congress would have passed a law requiring all candidates for Congress or the Senate to swear that they believe in the operation of Government without any special discrimination against any group that that would not be a good requirement and -- but that it would be quite different if they required him to swear that he would not conduct his office in such way as to deprive that."
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,2774.865,2777.897,"That is precisely the line we are drawing, yes sir."
1961.72,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2824.206,2841.967,"I assume you're taking, arguing literally which maybe a wrong way to argue, a statement made by Mr. Justice Roberts in one of the cases, I've forgotten which one, substantially to the effect that a man's beliefs are empowered, but his conduct can be regulated for the good of society."
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,2841.967,2875.123,"Absolutely and I'm also taking up the statements that were made in the Anastaplo to exactly the same effect where this young man as an attorney for example, stated that he would not subscribe to the proposition that he did not believe in the overthrow of the Government by force or violence under certain circumstances that might exist at some long time in the future, but it was quite clear that he believed that these circumstances were not present within our society or our civilization at the present time."
1961.72,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2875.123,2878.763,"Mr. Simon, we'll reduce it to very simple terms."
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,2910.055,2911.162,Yes Your Honor.
1961.72,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2911.162,2939.486,"There -- I point that out because there are a great many people today who are in the news all the time, claiming that the provision for an income tax is the work of communism in this country and he could demand who had that belief could hardly take the kind of an oath that is presented here."
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,2939.486,2939.667,I --
1961.72,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2939.667,2946.792,There are others who believe that the provision allowing women to vote is wrong.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,2968.085,2969.372,I hardly need to add Your Honor.
1961.72,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2981.777,2982.603,Yes.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,2982.603,3005.616,"And it seems to me that there we have persons throughout our state government, sworn to uphold the Constitution and the decisions of this Court interpreting the Constitution who nevertheless do not believe in the decisions of this Court and believe that they are correct or proper or should have been issued in the first instance."
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3005.616,3013.789,"Mr. Simon does a (Inaudible) -- if one takes an oath to support the Constitution, he takes an oath to support the whole Constitution."
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,3013.789,3014.837,Yes Your Honor.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3014.837,3036.051,And one of the important provisions of the Constitution is the mode by which things you don't like in the Constitution can be taken out of the Constitution and the mode in the Constitution which is set forth is that changes must be made in an orderly way and not by force and violence.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,3056.668,3057.734,But you must support it.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3057.874,3070.888,"And therefore, you say a state cannot ask a man to say, “I believe in the Constitution including that provision of it that the things you want to take out, you should take out by reason and votes and not by force,” isn't that right?"
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,3070.888,3081.66,I -- I do not feel that that is anymore consistent than requiring that a man working to amend the Constitution be required to support it during the time that he is amending it.
1961.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3119.182,3120.247,That's a different argument.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,3143.447,3143.661,I assure Your Honor I am --
1961.72,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3143.661,3145.684,I don't understand that you disagree with that.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,3145.684,3146.226,I'm sorry sir.
1961.72,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3146.226,3147.389,I didn't understand if you disagree with that.
1961.72,0,43291,tobias_simon,,3147.389,3147.782,No sir.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,3346.251,3351.374,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3449.224,3450.746,We'll recess now Mr. Wells.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,3461.838,3464.072,May it please the Court.
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3664.47,3672.514,"Mr. Wells, in that -- in that case, what phase of the oath was alleged to be precarious --"
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,3672.514,3674.465,"The lend and aid, support and --"
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3674.465,3675.582,I beg your pardon.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,3675.582,3681.058,"The lending of aid, support and so forth to the Communist Party in the past."
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3681.058,3682.977,What did it allege?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,3682.977,3684.634,What did the indictment allege?
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3684.634,3685.122,Yes.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,3685.122,3701.794,"It merely alleged the fact that he had lent aid, support and so forth but there was no allegation regarding the fact that it was knowingly done or the willfully done it."
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3701.879,3704.398,What facts were alleged?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,3704.398,3705.655,Just the --
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3705.655,3706.175,The conclusions?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,3706.175,3711.416,"The fact of lending aid and support, but nothing with regard to knowledge or willful."
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3711.416,3722.126,"Yes, well, was it just conclusory that -- that he lent his aid and support but -- or did they charge -- charge that he had -- had given some specific support."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,3722.878,3727.663,"My recollection is that it was in general terms, but I have the case here."
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3727.663,3729.123,"Well, its -- if you don't --"
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,3729.123,3731.287,I don't recall exactly but I think it was in general terms.
1961.72,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3731.287,3734.482,The attack on the indictment alone or was it after a conviction?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,3734.482,3736.264,It was attack on the indictment.
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3745.381,3746.626,Mr. Wells.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,3746.626,3746.913,Yes sir.
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3746.913,3749.063,Forgive me for interrupting you.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,3756.452,3756.691,That's --
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3756.691,3767.307,You accept the state court's decision that scienter is to be read into the statute and therefore the statute comes here with that -- with that authoritative interpretation of your court.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,3767.307,3775.222,That's my assumption because I don't read any of his -- either his jurisdictional statement or his brief as raising any question of scienter.
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3775.222,3780.927,I just wonder whether your appeal must be taking your time to answer an argument that is --
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,3780.927,3781.911,It may be that I am Your Honor.
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3781.911,3784.026,Not that it's been abandoned but he just accept (Voice Overlap) --
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,3784.026,3785.702,"And if so, I apologize."
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3795.542,3804.059,But can you apply that rule of scienter to beliefs?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,3804.059,3813.606,I apply it Your Honor that he's -- it's got to be a willfully and knowingly false.
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3973.165,3973.75,Would it --
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3973.75,3974.432,Are you --
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3974.432,3975.641,"Go ahead please, please."
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3975.641,3986.227,Are you going to argue what you call a subsidiary point that in case he is in no position that the stand -- put the standing problem to one side?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,3986.227,3986.971,Yes sir.
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3986.971,4007.654,"And assume it weren't in this case, I understood you to say a minute ago that if that were so, you would also defend -- you would defend the power of Florida that as – (Inaudible) anybody else whom it appoint but assume a teacher, but I have not -- will not lend my aid and support, advice to the Communist Party."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4007.654,4018.766,I would Your Honor on the same theory on which the Hawker case was decided and the same theory on which --
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4018.766,4019.487,In what case?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4019.487,4021.435,The Hawker -- the -- involved in --
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4021.435,4022.461,New York?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4022.461,4026.902,"Yes sir, involving the -- not --"
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4026.902,4028.87,You have to get a license to be a hawker.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4028.87,4065.378,"He practiced in Madison and he had committed an abortion 15 years before the Act was passed and yet it was held to be valid to prevent him from practicing medicine and on the same theory on which the DeVeau case I believe it was, was decided two or three years ago by this Court involving the union officers on the Waterfront in which ex-felons were precluded from being union officers notwithstanding the fact that they had been convicted many years before."
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4117.715,4118.651,Let me ask you this question Mr. Wells.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4118.651,4119.894,Yes sir.
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4119.894,4125.288,I suppose your state university is dependent on state funds for its activities.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4125.288,4127.395,"Largely so, yes sir."
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4127.395,4134.35,"Well, suppose Mr. Simon said there never was a Communist Party on the electoral ticket in Florida."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4134.35,4138.188,I don't recall that definitely but I don't think there was.
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4138.188,4158.866,"Well, suppose the Communist Party of United States in 1924 or 1925 found out that there was a campaign on to increase the appropriations for the University of Florida, to double the appropriations of the previous years, I don't know whether they did it one year or two years."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4160.082,4161.229,Two years Your Honor.
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4161.229,4181.5,"Suppose there was up a referendum to issue bonds to double the appropriations to the University of Florida, and suppose the Communist Party had sent in its most vocal leaders to support such an amendment and made a lot of noise in support of it."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4216.507,4229.854,I felt that Your Honor that that would come within it for the reason that I don't think parallelism of action would -- I think it would --
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4229.854,4230.407,Well it doesn't --
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4230.407,4232.888,-- be an aid to the Communist Party.
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4232.888,4242.213,"Well, when you say you doubted it, I -- am I -- is it fair to imply that it would raise a question and a conscientious lawyer could argue that's an aid?"
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4242.213,4244.514,"Well, it's hard to --"
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4244.514,4264.517,"At all events, it isn't like the Hawker case or the DeVeau case where the Court had before it the consequences that a state may be allowed to draw from a criminal conviction and the relation of such a criminal conviction to a subsequent position of responsibility."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4264.517,4269.044,You don't have the element of a conviction.
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4270.557,4287.364,"But it only meant words like aid or support, for instance, support if a distinguished member of the University of Florida is on the same platform under the auspicious of the Communist Party sponsoring increased appropriations for the university."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4296.583,4305.433,"Well, of course it's -- it's hard to say what a -- a man would be left out of (Inaudible) on various things --"
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4305.433,4306.322,But (Voice Overlap) --
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4306.322,4309.43,-- but I don't believe that would be a reasonable (Inaudible) --
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4309.43,4309.833,But if --
1961.72,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4309.833,4319.622,"If you had -- if he had six of them or eight of them or ten of them of the same quality, you wouldn't hesitate to take your case on that -- on parallelism, would you?"
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4319.622,4338.981,"I don't believe that unless there was a direct element of aiding and supporting in connection with a -- contributing toward the subversive aims, I don't believe that that could reasonably come within it."
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4338.981,4341.237,But Mr. -- Mr. Wells.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4341.237,4341.589,Yes sir.
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4341.589,4360.899,"The trouble is in your -- in your fair mind and conscientious way, you have a like to say you don't believe it, but the difficulties that I had and why, it has simply been -- what was it, Updegraff and Wieman or the other way around or was it a conscientious man taking an oath wouldn't know what he was taking an oath to."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4396.145,4414.718,"Well, of course it's possible Your Honor but there are many matters that come up in connection with laws and indefiniteness where arguments can be made one way or the other and yet the laws can be held to be of sufficient depth."
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4414.718,4415.023,Yes.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4418.995,4421.122,But the element of scienter is in there Your Honor.
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4421.122,4422.519,"Yes I know, with knowledge."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4424.235,4424.833,But does he -- and does --
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4424.833,4426.465,Yes but I was on that platform (Voice Overlap) --
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4426.465,4433.704,"Well, unless he intends to aid the Communist Party as such."
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4435.849,4459.232,"Well, I think from personal experience, I was once a chairman at a meeting in Boston way back, and the purpose of the meeting was to urge the Government of United States to recognize the soviet country, the present regime in Russia long before we did."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4516.525,4551.643,"Well, I realize that a contention can be made that the -- that there's too much of an indebtedness in that Your Honor but I -- when you have the scienter as a factor in it, I don't believe that that is sufficient that the oath should be declared unconstitutional on the basis of indebtedness."
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4551.643,4564.456,"It wasn't your -- it wouldn't -- doesn't it make a difference how -- how needed this is, how essential this is to protect the interest that you have a right to protect from my point of view."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4599.896,4611.21,"Well, in that case though, the knowledge was held not to be a factor under the Oklahoma statute by the -- by the Oklahoma Court."
1961.72,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4616.634,4617.17,It had no --
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4617.17,4618.333,-- differences in the statute.
1961.72,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4618.333,4623.574,You haven't -- maybe you have but I have -- I haven't been able to follow.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4657.211,4666.769,I don't believe that those purposes could come within the purport of the activeness to Justice Douglas.
1961.72,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4666.769,4669.43,Tell me again just why.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4669.43,4675.352,On account of the fact that the subversive character --
1961.72,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4675.352,4679.971,"But the statute says by aid, support, advice, counsel or influence to the."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4679.971,4680.335,Well --
1961.72,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4680.335,4681.824,-- Communist Party which may have --
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4681.824,4689.467,That -- that is construed by the Court to have reference to the subversive character.
1961.72,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4689.467,4692.331,Where is that precisely?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4692.331,4698.342,It is on page 13 of the record Your Honor.
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4698.342,4730.463,"Suppose they knew that the Communist Party intended to be subversive, had full knowledge of it, he attended a meeting such as Mr. Justice Frankfurter mentioned where they talked about various things where this man was the chairman of the meeting or made a speech like De Jonge in Oregon, would you say that the fact that he knew about it would take away from him the protection of the First Amendment of the freedom to be there?"
1961.72,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4730.463,4740.763,Where -- where his advocacy or belief or what not promotes a wholly lawful phase of a subversive organizations' activities.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4740.763,4747.034,I think it would depend Your Honor on the motive.
1961.72,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4763.23,4782.14,"Well, the De Jonge, the man, De Jonge undoubtedly knew about the full scope of the purpose of the party but he was held immune there because the purpose of the meeting it had -- which he attended was to aid strikers or to give relief to picket lines or something in that category that was wholly lawful."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4782.14,4785.579,"Well, I think that that would be that same distinction here Your Honor."
1961.72,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4785.579,4789.625,But I don't find it in the case of the report that you -- record that you refer to --
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4789.625,4789.809,Well it --
1961.72,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4789.809,4798.947,-- because there it says whether he has been or is or has been innocently and knowingly aligned with a subversive.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4816.914,4831.085,I don't think he would unless his motive was to advance the cause of the party as distinguished from an advancing the cause that the party was also seeking to advance.
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4831.085,4837.416,Well suppose a speaker had preceded him who advocated the Communist Party in its aims.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4842.053,4864.016,"Well, I don't see how unless in other words, unless the -- what he did was done for the purpose of advancing the Communist Party as distinguished from advancing the cause there that the Communist Party was also seeking to advance at the time."
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4864.135,4880.387,"You mean if he had talked on something that was purposely lawful, advocated the cause that many people before (Inaudible) that the jury could convict him if they thought from the evidence of a speaker preceding him had advocated the Communist Party."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4880.387,4881.008,I don't think that that would be --
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4881.008,4886.857,He too wanted -- he too wanted to aid the Communist Party looking to his motives.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4886.857,4889.869,I don't think that that would be sufficient Your Honor.
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4889.869,4891.604,That -- then you wouldn't look to his motives.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4891.604,4896.738,I think you look to his motives but I think you'd have to have more than that to establish his motives.
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4896.738,4913.55,"Mr. Wells, my narrow point is this that if you were defending this man in the hypothesis put, I'm confident if you let me say so that you get them all but you might not, you might not."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,4952.826,4972.133,"Well, I can understand the point that Your Honor is putting and raising and realize that it's a point that has to be faced in the case, but I don't believe that it should be fatal to the -- to the statute."
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4972.133,5006.738,"If you have -- it shouldn't be fatal to the statute if you can give a really strong weighty counter consideration why this is the way that a reasonable legislature must deal with the problem with which it has a right to deal with, namely, that puts no time limit, refuses voguish words which is susceptible of ambiguous construction etcetera, etcetera."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5006.738,5027.677,"Of course, I realize Your Honor that the alternatives are to be taken into account to a brief but I think also that the legislature is not bound to consider the best possible alternative."
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5027.677,5029.251,I'm with you on that.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5029.251,5047.368,And that if this has a reasonable connection with a purpose which they have a right to achieve that it is something that they could have adopted.
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5122.891,5125.782,"That's much more definite than this, isn't it Mr. Wells?"
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5125.782,5126.038,"Well, it --"
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5126.038,5134.404,Whether a man has been a member of a party -- there isn't much room for a debate about that.
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5142.41,5142.944,Counsel.
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5142.944,5144.258,-- counsel.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5156.418,5180.573,"Well, they are words of breadth but I think the words like counsel and advice that they have had a long history of having been used in connection with accessories, words of that kind, accessory before it, in fact on crime and things of that kind and I think all that needs to be taken into account in determining in the meaning to be attached to it as to whether the --"
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5180.573,5186.811,"They made an influence on ethnic -- aren't words of ours, are they, influence?"
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5186.811,5196.932,"Well, influence is sometimes used in connection as influence in an act in connection with accessory before the fact but advice and counsel are more."
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5196.932,5199.759,"Mr. Dale Carnegie uses them in a different sense, doesn't he?"
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5199.759,5201.212,I believe it does Your Honor.
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5201.212,5202.456,"Mr. Wells, may I ask you this --"
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5202.456,5202.592,Yes sir.
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5202.592,5204.141,-- this question?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5216.78,5218.139,Yes sir.
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5218.139,5234.167,Does that lead you to the conclusion that no redress can be given to an admittedly loyal American citizen just because he asserts his loyalty.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5242.702,5255.871,I don't know that the question can be answered strictly that we -- Your Honor.
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5255.871,5258.828,"Well, we've got the two extremes, two poles and --"
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5258.828,5284.136,"Well, I take it for instance as applied specifically to the past, I think it's quite definite that the -- a party cannot raise a question for someone else on a constitutional question."
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5284.136,5285.796,That wasn't the question I asked you.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5308.492,5316.904,"If they are -- to a loyal American, if his rights -- if his constitutional rights have been invaded then there certainly is redress."
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5316.904,5320.947,Regardless of whether he claims to be loyal or not.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5320.947,5324.886,That's as to whether if his constitutional rights have been invaded.
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5324.886,5325.19,That's right.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5325.19,5331.541,But the -- I think the -- it does affect whether his constitutional rights has been invaded.
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5338.324,5338.557,In other words --
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5338.557,5339.778,-- whether his constitutional rights have been invaded.
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5339.778,5340.934,"Well, I'll put it this way."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5369.528,5374.043,"Well, that would depend on whether there is an invasion of his constitutional rights."
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5378.146,5381.724,"Well, tell me this then."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5400.35,5434.149,"Well, a communist or a person who has lent aid or support to the Communist Party years ago and has reformed then he would be entitled to raise a question as to whether that was a bill of attainder or ex post facto law as to whether how that -- it would be answered, it would be a different question but he would be entitled to raise that question as to whether there was passed to him a bill of attainder or ex post facto law."
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5456.409,5467.565,"Yes, but suppose a man -- a man like Justice Frankfurter was talking about, a man who had supported certain causes that the Communist Party supports."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5539.47,5551.963,"Oh, I think he would -- he would have the right to raise the question as to whether his constitutional rights had been invaded by the unconstitutionally vague statute as -- but I don't believe --"
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5551.963,5553.813,Where could he -- when -- where could he raise it?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5555.953,5560.487,I think he could raise it in advance although I do think --
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5560.487,5563.479,Do you have procedure for that in Florida?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5563.479,5570.404,"Well, I think -- I think he could raise it in a type of procedures that is raised – that's invoked here."
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5617.537,5619.227,But suppose the man was in this position.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5655.551,5679.097,"Well, that gets to the question as to whether it is fatally indefinite and with the scienter in there, I don't think it is fatally in depth because you've got to show a lack of bona fides in connection with it and I don't think that there -- in order to show that it was false and I don't think that that could ever be shown."
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5679.097,5709.869,Was there anything in -- in -- in the statute or in the decisions of your Florida Supreme Court which hold that the -- that the cooperation and the -- and the counseling and assistance and so forth that is contemplated by this oath must be as to those facets of the Communist Party that have to do with overthrowing our government?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5709.869,5721.074,I don't -- I think that the statement by the Court in this decision substantially holds that Your Honor.
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5721.074,5723.371,Where?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5723.371,5724.633,In the statements.
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5724.633,5725.415,What does it say?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5727.047,5729.009,At the bottom of page 13 of the record.
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5729.009,5729.858,Of the record.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5729.858,5730.166,Yes.
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5730.166,5730.606,Yes.
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5730.606,5732.902,May I ask you to get there from my mind about this.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5732.902,5734.736,Yes sir.
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5734.736,5747.527,Is it your argument that no man can raise this who is not affected by it and no man can be affected by it unless he's been guilty of the things which it prohibits?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5747.527,5749.322,Not exactly Your Honor.
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5749.529,5761.105,"But it is your idea that in order to challenge it, he must show -- he comes within the class who have either been a communist, is a communist who has advised, aided and abetted communists."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5761.105,5769.543,It is my position that where he shows that he has not --
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5769.543,5771.969,Suppose he hadn't shown he has not?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5784.659,5790.322,"Well, I think that that would be a more questionable --"
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5790.322,5791.637,More questionable?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5812.881,5818.402,"Well, I think it's necessary that he show that he come within the class Your Honor."
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5818.402,5818.498,Suppose he (Voice Overlap) --
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5818.498,5820.337,However -- but -- certainly if he (Voice Overlap) --
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5820.337,5820.553,Suppose he didn't come (Voice Overlap) --
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5820.553,5821.967,-- he doesn't come within the class --
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5821.967,5824.625,"Suppose he just comes and says, “I'm not going to answer this."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5833.029,5833.599,Well --
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5833.599,5835.583,Would he have standing?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5835.583,5837.577,I doubt that he would but of this situation that he --
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5837.577,5854.987,"In other words, he decided to come in -- when he's got to come in and do as I -- your argument, as I understand it, is to come in first and either admit that he is a communist or has done these things under which -- under which circumstances, he would have standing to challenge."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5854.987,5859.371,I think it depends on which standing the question what it would be brought.
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5859.371,5861.12,Standing the question of this Act.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5861.12,5878.977,"Well, I think he has standing in the question of the act on certain basis of it without regard to that, but I don't think he's got standing to contend that it is an ex post facto law or bill of attainder."
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5878.977,5880.878,"Why not, what's the difference?"
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5880.878,5887.834,On account of the fact that it cannot be an ex post facto or bill of attainder unless it adversely affects him.
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5887.834,5896.423,"Well, is that the only one you claim that he doesn't have standing to raise here?"
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5896.423,5905.681,"Well, I think that it's affected seriously where he -- on the -- in the question of vagueness."
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5905.681,5908.404,Do you think he doesn't have the right to raise that?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5908.404,5923.668,"I doubt that he has the right to raise the question of vagueness where he comes in and swears to the facts that he says, the oath is too vague with regard to."
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5923.668,5927.097,"Well, I don't quite get what a man would have the right to challenge."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5944.385,5945.734,"No sir, no sir."
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5947.034,5952.29,"But he doesn't have to admit he comes within the class that covers, does he, so far as his conduct is concerned?"
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5952.29,5954.418,"I don't think he does, generally speaking, no."
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5955.252,5961.551,"Do you think he does under communist act but not generally, is that it?"
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5961.551,5961.894,No sir.
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5968.847,5977.59,"Mr. Wells, there is a difference, isn't there between a man coming in to court and say, “I'm asked to sign a document."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,5998.38,5999.523,"Well, that was the --"
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5999.523,6000.339,I'm not saying that this is a good situation --
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6000.339,6001.512,-- the point I was trying to make Your Honor.
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6001.512,6004.166,-- I don't think it is but there is a difference.
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6004.166,6011.276,"I -- I was just going to ask you if you don't think that's happened here, do you?"
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6017.477,6032.994,"I think he has to in large measure Your Honor where he says, “I have not lent aid, support and so forth to the Communist Party."
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6054.304,6074.01,"Mr. Wells, isn't the truth of the matter just as interpreting what this really means, I haven't -- I don't live inside of the mind or the threat or with the constraints but he's trying, quite understandably, he's trying to ride through horses which is a feat that's not too impossible."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6089.881,6094.026,"Well, to -- I think in large measure Your Honor that is right."
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6094.183,6109.248,"Suppose he has -- suppose he has, how does he know that the state must -- that he hasn't done would not be disapproved by a group of informers or group of other people, how could you know?"
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6109.248,6110.857,"Well, of course that gets to --"
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6110.857,6112.532,That's the vice of (Inaudible) --
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6112.532,6134.771,That gets to the question of whether it is fatally indefinite and if the statute is fatally indefinite then I don't question that the statute is invalid but that gets back to the question as to whether it is fatally indefinite.
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6134.771,6144.741,"When you say fatally indefinite, I think if I may say so you're conjoining two very different things."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6184.368,6191.49,I realize that there is that possibility Your Honor.
1961.72,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6212.569,6213.303,Mr. Wells.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6213.303,6216.179,Yes sir.
1961.72,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6216.179,6220.903,This is the heart of the case for me here.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6241.816,6243.183,I believe it is Your Honor.
1961.72,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6250.629,6270.027,"Whether he could -- whether he is able by reason of his past conduct to make the affidavit or he is not able, is that ever a relevant averment in a complaint in the case like this?"
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6297.308,6299.091,I don't know.
1961.72,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,6302.941,6332.74,"I thought your position was that it might be relevant on the question of the state rule that says that you cannot come in and raise a constitutional claim if this appears in the face of your complaint, the -- if you don't claim here, that'd be personal injury -- personally injured by the claim if it's -- if by the statute if it's enforced against you and all you want is a general declaration of rights under the law."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6334.962,6337.992,I think that that is -- is what enforced.
1961.72,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6337.992,6355.52,"Well, isn't that quite another thing even if these averments of the kind made by here by this petitioner in paragraph 6 on page 2 of this record are irrelevant and are not necessary."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6381.699,6381.91,I think that --
1961.72,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6381.91,6386.681,That's a different question isn't it?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6386.681,6394.459,I would have thought it was at least to the clause and relief question Your Honor.
1961.72,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6394.459,6429.95,"Well, even if such an averment could never be relevant yet one might voluntarily by allegations like those in paragraph 6 of this complaint, show that he could not be injured by them and say, “I can make” as he says he can make this very affidavit and therefore reduced his complaint to a mere request upon the Court to render to him an advisory opinion."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6429.95,6432.847,"Well, I -- I think that's -- I think that's correct Your Honor."
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6437.807,6453.785,"Suppose it is true that a person has no standing to sue in the Florida Court, do you think he's having a standing to raise this constitutional question in any way?"
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6453.785,6453.815,I think the --
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6453.815,6456.179,And so where would it be but the federal courts.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6456.179,6488.215,I think the Florida rule on that is that has been referred to as a state rule is similar to a rule that this Court has announced as to the necessity of a person injured in -- a necessity of a person being injured in order to get a decision on the constitutional question.
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6488.215,6497.238,But that's -- that's arguing the merits of the rule not what I understood Justice Harlan to be talking about that this is a Florida rule.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6497.238,6502.205,"Well, if -- if that is --"
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6502.205,6506.444,What about Mooney and Holohan that Florida won't let him raise?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6506.444,6507.065,I beg your pardon.
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6507.065,6513.593,What about the rule in Mooney and Holohan that Florida will not let him raise this constitutional question?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6513.593,6515.272,You mean as to --
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6515.272,6517.628,The right to raise it in the federal court.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6517.628,6519.939,"Well, it's entirely possible that there might be the right."
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6520.671,6543.457,Is it your idea that your Florida rule is intended to be played that whether the federal rule required to be not -- this man shall not be allowed to raise this constitutional question in the Florida Court under the circumstances here?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6543.457,6568.497,I think so far as this case is concerned Your Honor that if the -- if the Florida Court has announced a rule which is a sufficient rule of state law to decide this case then as to whether there's any other redress I think would be a question for another case.
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6568.497,6581.848,"Well, are you arguing that it's still the Florida rule or that you're following the federal court to say it has no chance to -- suppose you're wrong on the federal rule --"
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6581.848,6582.681,"Well, I'm saying --"
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6582.681,6586.738,-- do you still say that Florida will deny him relief?
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6586.738,6596.816,I feel like Your Honor that the Florida rule is sufficient to deny him relief.
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6596.816,6597.636,In Florida.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6597.636,6598.429,In Florida.
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6607.57,6621.351,But that would result in -- meaning that the man can have his constitutional right violated with no possible remedy in the federal or state court.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6625.209,6626.39,"Well, I don't --"
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6626.39,6626.421,I thought --
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6626.421,6629.13,I'm not familiar with those two decisions that the --
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6629.13,6647.947,Mooney versus Holohan where the question was whether California has failed to give a remedy where there was a charge that the man had been convicted on perjurious evidence knowing that the evidence was -- the state knowing it was fault.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6648.867,6651.203,I remember something out of the case now Your Honor.
1961.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6652.933,6656.18,And this Court held that it would not have -- as I recall it.
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6673.265,6673.912,Mr. Wells.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6673.912,6675.471,Yes sir.
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6675.471,6681.006,The -- I think I've been talking a little bit at large as to what the complaint says and what the courts held.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6681.006,6684.668,Yes sir.
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6684.668,6702.55,"To be sure, paragraph 7, the complaint says, the plaintiff is a loyal American and does not decline to execute (Inaudible) oath of fear of the penalty provided by law of false oath."
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6859.357,6863.448,"Oh, did Your Honor read from the bottom of page 18 and top of page 19?"
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6863.448,6865.293,That's what I've been reading from.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6865.293,6866.311,I didn't --
1961.72,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6866.311,6872.249,That's just what I've been reading from Mr. Wells and that's all I find.
1961.72,1,33645,j_r_wells,,6891.854,6903.877,"Well, I see that my time is nearly up and I'll just briefly refer to the clause of the oath."
1961.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7052.708,7056.83,Mr. Simon.
1961.72,2,43291,tobias_simon,,7056.83,7078.549,"The Court will note from the brief that this action was brought in Orange County, Florida pursuant to the provisions of Florida statute 87.01 which under Florida law permits an individual who is in doubt as to his status and his rights under a Florida statute to bring an action for declaratory relief."
1961.72,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,7187.155,7188.97,May I ask you Mr. Simon.
1961.72,2,43291,tobias_simon,,7204.051,7212.775,It is not surplusage according to the Florida Supreme Court with regard to the questions of ex post facto and bill of attainder.
1961.72,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7293.945,7312.987,"Mr. Simon before you sit down, in view of the breadth of your argument remain, I would like to ask you namely that no belief can constitutionally be inquired as to anybody who seeks office under the United States or state government, is that right?"
1961.72,2,43291,tobias_simon,,7312.987,7317.099,"Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I do not feel that my argument has to reach that point."
1961.72,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7324.377,7329.769,Let me -- let me put a case that is in regard to the President.
1961.72,2,43291,tobias_simon,,7357.947,7361.65,I have not represented the TVA nor the (Voice Overlap) of the Act and I would --
1961.72,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7361.65,7366.419,I know but our argument either -- argument either have relevance or they don't have relevance.
1961.72,2,43291,tobias_simon,,7366.419,7366.612,And --
1961.72,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7366.612,7389.55,And the lawyer says that a government can't ask its appointees whether they have a belief in the Constitution of the United States and its entirety or a belief in an Act under which they're supposed to act or belief in the law and the members of the law faculty then I have a right to put you a concrete case in order to test your argument.
1961.72,2,43291,tobias_simon,,7389.55,7411.06,My answer to that sir is that that particular provision in my opinion and based upon what I understand to be the decisions of this Court is that the federal government nor the government of Florida can reach into a man's mind and require it to be divulged as the condition of any governmental favor or employment.
1961.72,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7411.06,7414.031,So that that's an unconstitutional provision in the TVA.
1961.72,2,43291,tobias_simon,,7414.031,7415.44,"It was so here sir, yes sir."
1961.72,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7415.44,7416.384,Alright.
1961.72,2,43291,tobias_simon,,7416.384,7441.687,Thank you Your Honor.
