1956.162,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,11.778,"Number 162, Shirley Kremen, Samuel Irving Coleman and Sidney Steinberg, Petitioners versus United States of America."
1956.162,0,37174,norman_leonard,,12.927,17.137,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1956.162,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,322.255,328.942,Is that one item in your case that the evidence was not admissible as to all?
1956.162,0,37174,norman_leonard,,328.942,348.438,"Yes, Your Honor and it is particularly significant on the question of the search and seizure because as I understand the Government's position, it seeks to segregate some of this evidence and says that these petitioners were here before the court today may not complain if evidence that was illegally obtained from somebody else was received."
1956.162,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,349.638,350.958,I don't follow that.
1956.162,0,37174,norman_leonard,,350.958,351.244,Well --
1956.162,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,351.244,363.123,I want to know whether evidence which the court allowed in as to all defendants is made by your claim that it should have been restrictively --
1956.162,0,37174,norman_leonard,,363.123,363.862,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.162,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,363.862,364.688,All right.
1956.162,0,37174,norman_leonard,,367.396,368.149,Well perhaps --
1956.162,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,368.149,371.594,-- invalidates what was otherwise admissible.
1956.162,0,37174,norman_leonard,,372.476,372.568,Yes.
1956.162,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,372.568,373.313,-- search and seizure.
1956.162,0,37174,norman_leonard,,375.784,383.079,"I appreciate that Your Honor, perhaps it will become clearer or I'll try to make them clear as the argument develops."
1956.162,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,404.275,410.124,"Perhaps if you'll state what -- without arguing of course, what the claims are that you're making?"
1956.162,0,37174,norman_leonard,,415.561,421.365,"I -- well, Your Honor, yes, I was going to outline the background of the case and then come to the questions presented by the writ."
1956.162,1,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,3130.415,3132.791,May it please the Court.
1956.162,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3244.396,3245.189,Which one was that?
1956.162,1,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,3246.634,3248.117,"That's petitioner Kremen, Your Honor."
1956.162,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3248.117,3251.444,Kremen.
1956.162,1,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,3251.444,3265.367,The evidence showed that petitioner Steinberg identified himself to the owner of the cabin as Mr. Newberg and he referred to Mrs. Kremen as his sister.
1956.162,2,37174,norman_leonard,,4615.769,4618.312,"I was going to -- I think the record reflects it, Your Honor."
1956.162,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4626.494,4642.305,Let's suppose we oath to be able to assume gentlemen that the Government -- that the Government really had proved that they stipulated in some way to abandon their motion that the Government would show it to us and then ask us to infer.
1956.162,3,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,4658.578,4659.261,"Well, would --"
1956.162,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4659.261,4666.653,It's difficult for me to believe or understand that a hearing was held on the same day that a motion was filed.
1956.162,3,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,4679.651,4679.892,"No, sir."
1956.162,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4681.996,4682.626,Very well.
1956.162,3,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,4728.246,4728.408,"Yes, sir."
1956.162,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4728.408,4741.211,And so the rule provide on the basis of what this Court decided that the motion must be made in due time so that that can be disposed of before you get to the trial in order that the trial should not be interrupted.
1956.162,3,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,4741.211,4742.233,That's right sir.
1956.162,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4742.233,4753.492,And that's what evidently happened here because unless I'm contrary wise informed when the motion was renewed as it has to be renewed at the trial when the Government makes offer.
1956.162,3,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,4773.278,4777.266,I -- I think it normally would happen in that way.
1956.162,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4777.266,4780.656,One of you will get now to the reasonableness of the search.
1956.162,3,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,4780.656,4781.882,"Yes, sir."
1956.162,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4784.035,4784.464,"Yes, of course."
1956.162,3,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,4784.464,4795.537,"-- to the three cases, three additional cases which I like to call for the attention of the Court and which I asked the clerk to furnished copies to you."
1956.162,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4795.537,4796.377,"Yes, we have them."
1956.162,4,37174,norman_leonard,,4797.775,4799.726,Yes.
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,4801.997,4816.759,"Now, on the question of the validity of the search, the arrests involved in the case is our contention, all were valid arrests."
1956.162,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4941.52,4951.879,When did they gather this quasi of (Inaudible) for the purpose of making the raid as it was said?
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,4951.879,4960.637,I believe some fiver or six agents were at the cabin at 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning of the arrest.
1956.162,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4970.275,4976.001,Arrangement before these five or six were there early in the morning?
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,4976.001,4983.296,"No, by -- apparently, by arrangements made through communication by walkie-talkie during the course of the morning."
1956.162,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4983.296,4983.789,Yes.
1956.162,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4983.789,4990.35,"Well, how far away were the agents who joined the five or six already at the cabin?"
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,4990.35,5003.097,I believe the record shows that they left San Francisco that morning which is some hundred miles I believe from Twain Harte.
1956.162,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5003.097,5010.459,And do I understand Stockton where the Commissioner has his quarters was about 50 miles away?
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5010.459,5013.091,"About 60, yes, sir."
1956.162,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5022.434,5022.739,Well was --
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5022.739,5023.337,-- so --
1956.162,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5023.337,5032.798,-- do we -- do we understand that these agents coming from San Francisco were on route before the positive identification was made?
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5032.798,5035.209,I think that that -- that is so.
1956.162,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5250.968,5254.413,What could be the fruits or the tools of this crime?
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5254.413,5272.452,"The tools of this crime I think as the evidence here amply demonstrates and I think as reasonable to suspect, to suppose is false identification in each."
1956.162,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5379.088,5389.645,"Well, would you say that all of the items listed here is taken all into one or the other of the categories you've given them?"
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5389.645,5401.077,"Well, I think in describing the tools of harboring offenses, it's difficult to draw a line."
1956.162,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5412.285,5412.827,Wash rags.
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5412.827,5413.59,-- were tools.
1956.162,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5414.181,5415.331,Wash rags?
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5415.331,5416.169,Wash rags and things of that --
1956.162,5,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5416.169,5420.084,They both -- concert D major.
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5420.084,5422.042,Sir?
1956.162,5,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5422.042,5423.307,Beethoven's concert.
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5423.307,5424.826,The -- the records?
1956.162,5,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5424.826,5427.122,In D major.
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5427.122,5434.036,"Well, I think that certainly it is essential to harboring someone, to provide necessities of life."
1956.162,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5434.036,5439.711,What about the folders of 40 finest restaurants in San Francisco Bay area?
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5439.711,5440.933,"What was that sir, I didn't --"
1956.162,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5440.933,5447.647,Folders of 40 finest restaurants in San Francisco Bay area.
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5447.647,5453.11,"No, sir I -- we -- we don't make the contention, we don't make the contention."
1956.162,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5470.979,5485.979,"And you already suggested what -- that the house itself is a tool so that if you could quickly put it on wheels, you could have cut that off in order to put in evidence that the lowliness of the spot which this was found and the doctrines of inaccessibility et cetera."
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5486.634,5486.779,We -- we --
1956.162,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5486.779,5488.647,-- convening to be ironic that's -- that's your argument --
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5488.647,5489.083,Well --
1956.162,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5489.083,5489.599,-- isn't it?
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5489.599,5500.767,"Well, I -- I do not mean to suggest that we attempt to justify the seizure of all this material on a basis of the material all being tools of the offense."
1956.162,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5511.075,5515.211,"Therefore, you take all and then select what is useful, is that it?"
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5515.211,5516.141,"No, sir."
1956.162,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5520.983,5545.439,"Can we just start on the first page please on Exhibit A, that's your list of these things, just go down the list for a little ways and tell us -- tell us what ones those things are -- are -- were appropriately seized because of the reason you have given?"
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5582.172,5591.186,"I -- I think as tools of the crime that none of the items that Your Honor has just read, we don't claim that they were taken as tools to crime."
1956.162,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5591.186,5594.331,"Well, how far do you have to get down until you find something?"
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5594.331,5594.342,I think --
1956.162,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5594.342,5599.342,Look over that list and give me the first -- first things you think are material.
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5608.418,5613.176,If I -- if I might summarize what I think were properly taken as tools of the crime here.
1956.162,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5613.176,5613.627,Yes.
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5613.627,5635.719,"I would say the matters that were offered in evidence, the false Social Security cards, driver's licenses, matters of that kind, things which is established or tended to -- were meant to establish a separate identity of the people who were being harbored and who were doing the harbor."
1956.162,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5723.033,5728.552,Did the Government have any obligation to safeguard any?
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5728.552,5736.498,"Well, I think that possibly there would be -- I -- I don't think there's an obligation to safeguard it Your Honor."
1956.162,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5736.498,5736.965,Do they usually do that?
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5736.965,5738.091,But there was --
1956.162,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5738.091,5741.894,Do they usually do that?
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5741.894,5743.081,Safeguard material?
1956.162,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5743.081,5767.291,"In this way, did you ever -- did you ever know of any other case in your law enforcement work where they arrested somebody for a bailable offense where they moved them out of their whole home, bag and baggage, every single thing that was in it so that if they got out on in bail within an hour or two, they'd have nothing to come back to except an empty house."
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5769.366,5769.397,I do not.
1956.162,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5769.397,5771.914,"-- your experience, neither do I."
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5771.914,5781.538,"But I -- on the other hand, Your Honor don't know of any case where the circumstances as presented here were present."
1956.162,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5781.538,5784.054,What circumstances?
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5784.054,5784.097,The --
1956.162,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5784.097,5786.693,They change that rule?
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5786.693,5799.006,"Well I think this Court has -- has stated time and time again that each case must -- must depend, must be decided when you're considering the reasonableness of the search and the reasonableness to seizure."
1956.162,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5799.07,5799.153,(Voice Overlap)
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5799.153,5801.526,-- depend on his own peculiar facts and circumstances.
1956.162,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5801.526,5801.905,Yes.
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5850.953,5877.822,"Well -- may I say this, Your Honor that a question of the reasonableness of the search depends on the nature of the offense, the circumstances under which the arrests were made and whether as an incident to that arrest, it was proper to go through this house and to search for the fruits -- for the tools of the crime."
1956.162,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5897.998,5898.623,Not some but --
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5898.623,5900.516,-- perhaps we're not subject to the seizure.
1956.162,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5900.516,5904.127,Not some but everything they had to live with.
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,5907.865,5920.961,"Well I think it depends on whether or not there was any malice here, any other disregard shown by the officers."
1956.162,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5966.436,5992.594,"Mr. Maroney, I think the line of argument that you're now making really from my point of view gets to the bottom of this problem of unreasonable search and seizure, namely, we talk about reason, unreason as though we examine whether from the point of view of conscientious, high-minded, if you will, law enforcing officers."
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6077.164,6088.85,"Well, if Your Honor please, I think this Court in the Harris case ruled that whether it was a valid arrest, the place can be searched for the tools of the crime."
1956.162,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6109.277,6110.121,-- Mr. Maroney.
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6128.623,6140.073,"On the basis of searching for false identification cards, things of that sort."
1956.162,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6140.073,6147.5,"Well do you think -- do you think that the commissioner would have issued a warrant which authorize the taking of all their clothes, all their food?"
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6147.5,6148.005,"No, sir."
1956.162,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6148.005,6152.879,Even their toothbrushes and all the other things?
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6152.879,6153.205,"No, sir."
1956.162,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6156.856,6161.53,And that's -- so that's the logic of this thing that you can do more without a warrant than with a warrant?
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6161.53,6168.75,"No sir, the logic I think is this that -- that -- we come first to the question, was the search reason --"
1956.162,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6168.75,6169.101,It doesn't follow --
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6169.101,6169.557,Now could they --
1956.162,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6169.557,6172.925,-- even if that is true that you concede what you've searched.
1956.162,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6193.575,6201.381,"I would like to, if you would argue on a little different basis on what you have."
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6232.877,6233.107,"No, sir."
1956.162,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6235.147,6246.962,"Well, do you think if it is an unreasonable seizure, do you think our cases require that they have to (Inaudible)."
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6246.972,6247.695,All the evidence --
1956.162,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6247.695,6261.287,"Are you arguing -- are you arguing that even though it is wholly unreasonable seizure, that you can pick out certain parts of it and offer them because it would have been reasonable had you limited it to that."
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6261.535,6262.256,I think that --
1956.162,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6262.256,6264.234,-- what is your argument on that?
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6264.234,6278.368,"I think this that it -- if it was reasonable on the first instance to go through this property, to look at, to examine, to take what was a tool of the crime or the fruit of the crime."
1956.162,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6282.752,6283.112,On -- on --
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6283.112,6283.816,-- should not --
1956.162,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6283.816,6295.443,"To make it an unreasonable seizure -- what do you say if it has to be concluded that it was a wholly unreasonable seizure as I may say it seems to me, it's no answer to that charge."
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6295.443,6299.337,When you say wholly you mean -- you mean the material that was taken in addition to --
1956.162,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6299.337,6309.483,All -- all these things that stripped the house of the toothpaste and the toothbrushes and everything on that and the clothes.
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6318.689,6319.379,"Yes, sir."
1956.162,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6319.379,6320.576,You do?
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6326.684,6340.064,"Well, I know of no case and I don't think this Court has ever ruled on a case where certain material was seized."
1956.162,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6350.068,6358.471,But I -- you stated that certain -- certain items were taken which made it a wholly unreasonable search and seizure.
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6358.471,6358.967,Which made it --
1956.162,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6358.967,6364.579,Are you -- are you depending this as being a reasonable seizure?
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6364.579,6367.177,I -- I (Voice Overlap) being a reasonable search.
1956.162,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6383.516,6386.275,You mean safeguarding a toothpaste?
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6386.275,6389.338,Safeguarding all of their properties here.
1956.162,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6401.259,6404.045,Were you afraid they couldn't take care of it?
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6416.663,6423.726,I think it's -- it's reasonable and when considered in the light of the purpose for which it was done.
1956.162,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6434.975,6439.025,"Well, therefore, we do not agree with you on that (Inaudible)"
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6466.089,6468.762,"I -- I -- as I say, Your Honor I can't give you a case."
1956.162,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6503.966,6514.836,"Suppose the search warrant -- suppose there had been a search warrant, but to get down the -- I think your argument which authorized the taking of everyone of these items that you took."
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6539.585,6539.775,I -- I think --
1956.162,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6539.775,6543.305,-- on our cases?
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6543.305,6551.176,I think so with respect to the material that was properly the subject of the search warrant and properly seized there under.
1956.162,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6551.176,6555.03,Have you any cases that you rely on to that?
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6555.437,6555.914,"No, sir."
1956.162,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6580.051,6580.455,The case --
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6580.455,6581.473,-- that -- that is searched.
1956.162,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6581.473,6583.163,The case I put to you is not dead.
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6612.488,6615.122,"I -- I would think not, that way."
1956.162,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6616.03,6623.293,"In other words, you couldn't do it if you had a search warrant which was invalid which you say you could do it here without a search warrant."
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6623.293,6631.211,"Because -- because here, I think under the cases of this Court Harris, Rabinowitz, the search was reasonable."
1956.162,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6647.804,6662.078,"What you're saying is that -- in the cases that have been here, the Court hasn't drawn a distinction in its decision between seizure and search once they found that the search was lawful, it followed that seizure was all right."
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6665.321,6666.521,I think so.
1956.162,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6666.521,6667.077,In other words --
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6667.077,6667.271,But I --
1956.162,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6667.271,6673.252,"(Inaudible) is not been made in the case that had been disposed of here, as far as I know."
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6673.252,6674.616,This distinction?
1956.162,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6674.616,6675.198,Yes.
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6675.198,6677.003,I -- I don't think it has been made.
1956.162,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6677.003,6687.007,I don't mean to say (Inaudible) but I mean it has been assumed perhaps on the fact that the case -- that the search was lawful as though the seizure was all right.
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6689.95,6696.763,"I -- I think so, but I think that all those cases of course are distinguishable on the facts that are presented by this case by -- by --"
1956.162,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6696.763,6705.788,I think they are in those cases.
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6705.788,6708.386,I see that my time was just about up and --
1956.162,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6708.386,6709.626,May I ask you one question --
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6709.626,6710.028,"Yes, sir."
1956.162,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6710.028,6715.138,"-- about, which I am wholly ignorant you surely know."
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6743.725,6745.84,"I don't know of any such provision, Your Honor."
1956.162,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6745.84,6749.505,Padlocking in this prohibition cases is a special statutory thing?
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6749.505,6750.425,Right.
1956.162,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6750.425,6751.53,There is no such.
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6751.53,6751.562,I know --
1956.162,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6751.562,6752.486,A counterfeiting place.
1956.162,5,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,6766.375,6774.215,It maybe a provision to that on those special statutes such as -- from the (Inaudible) and things of that sort.
1956.162,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6774.215,6775.457,Mr. Leonard.
1956.162,6,37174,norman_leonard,,6775.457,6785.619,"If the Court please, I think perhaps I should first try to clear up this matter of those motions to suppress and what happened to them."
1956.162,6,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6875.45,6876.335,Where is that?
1956.162,6,37174,norman_leonard,,6876.335,6878.879,Page 164.
1956.162,6,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,6921.785,6925.481,(Inaudible) that they are denied.
1956.162,6,37174,norman_leonard,,6925.481,6934.922,"That appears on page 73, the Court made the minute actually there, Mr. Justice Burton under the date of April 13th, further hearing on motions to suppress evidence, et cetera."
1956.162,6,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6941.214,6943.004,"Is that -- the clerk does that, doesn't he?"
1956.162,6,37174,norman_leonard,,6943.004,6943.78,Excuse me sir?
1956.162,6,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6943.78,6944.965,That's a clerk entry is it not?
1956.162,6,37174,norman_leonard,,6944.965,6946.19,"Yes, Your Honor, certainly."
1956.162,6,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6946.19,6946.492,All right.
1956.162,6,37174,norman_leonard,,6946.492,6949.07,I suppose that Judge Goodman tells the clerk.
1956.162,6,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6967.63,6971.722,"The other way around Mr. Leonard, it appears that they were made in the midst of the trial."
1956.162,6,37174,norman_leonard,,6971.722,6972.641,Exactly.
