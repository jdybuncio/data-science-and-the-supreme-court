2018.17-1184,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.08,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-1184, Biestek versus Berryhill. Mr. Bhabha."
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,7.08,22.12,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a vocational expert testifies about the existence of a specific number of jobs in a specific location at a specific time, that testimony can only be based on statistical data-driven sources."
2018.17-1184,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,59.0,75.44,"The counsel for the claimant asked for the source material but then didn't engage in any cross-examination of -- of the witness, of the expert witness."
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,75.44,83.8,"Your Honor, as a factual matter, after being denied the material, he did engage in some cross-examination that appears in the record."
2018.17-1184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,143.28,150.16,"Well, what I don't understand about your argument is how it connects with the substantial evidence question."
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,192.16,201.04,"Of course, Your Honor. So I think we have two answers to that question. First and foremost, we are not asking for the document-on-demand procedural rule that the government characterizes us."
2018.17-1184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,222.92,229.24,"Well, I know you're not saying that, but you have a quantum of evidence; it's substantial or it's not substantial."
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,238.48,263.16,"Your Honor, I think it flows from the basic intuition that when you question an expert about data, if the expert cannot then back up their testimony, that creates doubt. And although I don't think it's an exact match, I think a useful analogy are the adverse inference cases, which this Court has recognized when a party or a witness says I am presenting evidence to the court, but there is better evidence somewhere else that substantiates what I am saying --"
2018.17-1184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,263.16,264.52,"Well, I -- I see that argument."
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,282.72,284.68,It was the ALJ.
2018.17-1184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,299.6,326.72,"Yeah, I -- I see that. But, when the -- the expert says this is my opinion, and you say produce the underlying evidence, and the expert doesn't say no, I'm not going to do that, I won't do that, somebody -- the -- the judge intervenes and says no, that's not required, why does that create doubt about the validity of the expert's testimony? The expert hasn't refused to produce that evidence."
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,328.6,330.24,"So, Your Honor, if I can just clarify."
2018.17-1184,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,360.28,362.6,But here's the thing I don't understand.
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,409.28,410.6,"Your -- I understand your point, Your Honor --"
2018.17-1184,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,410.6,410.84,Okay.
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,410.84,413.96,"-- but, with respect, I -- I disagree with it, and for two reasons."
2018.17-1184,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,413.96,416.4,"Well, I'm not -- I'm asking a question."
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,433.28,450.32,"So, Your Honor, I have a practical answer to your question and a legal answer, and I'd like to give both if I might. As a practical matter, vocational expert testimony has been widely criticized in the courts of appeals, with courts noting that the methodology is at times preposterous, leading to numbers that are likely fabrications."
2018.17-1184,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,489.92,497.8,But what you're telling me is that the expert should -- they should have gone into it in this case because it was really rotten.
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,549.68,566.52,"I understand your problem, Justice Breyer, and let me see if I can address it. The government itself, I would note, as a policy matter tells experts you should be prepared to explain, cite, and furnish the sources upon which you rely. In the handbook that the Social Security Administration gives to experts, it says that five times."
2018.17-1184,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,566.52,567.68,That was after --
2018.17-1184,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,567.68,568.6,"Well, there --"
2018.17-1184,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,568.6,569.64,-- that was after this case.
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,569.64,571.0,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2018.17-1184,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,571.76,572.28,All right.
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,639.64,640.44,Not --
2018.17-1184,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,640.44,641.04,-- to get us to --
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,641.04,662.24,"-- not exactly, Justice Sotomayor, if I can be very clear on the rule that the Seventh Circuit has held and that we are arguing for in this Court. In this context, when an expert is providing statistical data and then cites to statistical sources they rely upon, and say these are the sources, and these are not public sources, this expert relied on two sources, one of which was private."
2018.17-1184,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,679.0,679.52,All right.
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,738.8,740.2,"Your Honor, I think --"
2018.17-1184,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,740.2,751.44,"I'm giving you the best case for them, because the better case for you is for her to say: Well, I've never really placed anyone with that -- with those conditions."
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,767.0,768.04,"That's right, Your Honor."
2018.17-1184,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,768.04,772.24,"All right, the potential extremes we have."
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,782.64,791.24,"So, Your Honor, if I can answer your question in two ways. First, I think ours is the easier case because, here, the expert didn't say it was my experience."
2018.17-1184,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,858.12,866.24,"But I think you're missing the point, which is you wouldn't have needed the surveys to make the argument you just made."
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,896.0,909.6,"I understand your question, Your Honor. I think initially I will just say as a factual matter, and I think the record bears this out, as soon as my client's or claimant's representative asked for the surveys, the ALJ made clear she wasn't going to give them."
2018.17-1184,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,942.64,970.32,"Well, one way -- one way to be -- to look at the publicly available data, right, and there was no questioning about that, was there? I mean, to the extent the Bureau of Labor Statistics information shows, you say, 8,000 jobs in southwestern Michigan, if that's where it was, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows a different number, why did you choose eight? In other words, there -- there were fields, I'm not saying there are ample fields, but there are fields for fertile cross-examination that weren't explored, I think."
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,970.32,974.96,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think it is certainly a different case if an expert only relies on public data."
2018.17-1184,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1050.88,1061.76,"Well, that's a good -- it strikes me that that's a good argument to have made before the ALJ, at which point the ALJ may have said, well, I see that now, and you should have access to the private data and you can just redact it."
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,1063.84,1074.4,"Well, Your Honor, the one thing that was done -- I agree, that wasn't laid out to the ALJ. What was laid out the first time that we asked for the data and were refused, immediately, counsel said: Look, it's a substantial evidence standard."
2018.17-1184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1161.76,1198.64,"But your reliance on that case raises the interesting question, a question I think is interesting, which is whether there would be any basis for limiting the rule that you're asking us to adopt to the specific situation here, which you have stressed where it's testimony, it's statistical testimony by a vocational expert in a Social Security disability hearing. Why wouldn't the rule that you're asking us to adopt apply whenever there is the question if a determination by an agency is supported by substantial evidence?"
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,1198.64,1266.32,"Well, Your Honor, I think, for sure, the term ""substantial evidence"" is one that applies throughout administrative law, but what this Court has made clear in a number of cases is that, of course, substantial evidence looks at the record and, thus, inherent in the question -- in the answer as to what ""substantial evidence"" means is, what is the question that the agency is trying to address? In a situation like this, where you're talking about specific numbers that the agency is relying on as the sole basis to deny my client benefits for the applicable period, there, I think, when the expert points to data sources that she has modified in order to come up with these numbers, there, substantial evidence requires more. But, in other situations, Your Honor, for example, qualitative testimony, even testimony such as these are the kind of jobs in my experience I believe somebody with these sorts of limitations can do, i.e., the first part of what vocational experts testify, I think that's entirely different. But I do think, in this situation, it would be very normal when an administrative agency comes up with specific numbers and bases a determination on specific numerical conclusions, it is the norm to then make the agency or make the expert show their work. I --"
2018.17-1184,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1266.32,1270.72,Why wouldn't your argument be the same if there had been no request at all?
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,1270.72,1280.08,"Your Honor, certainly, we would win if the -- if the rule was that vocational experts have to give over their testimony regardless of a request or not, we would win."
2018.17-1184,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1280.08,1283.72,"I -- I'm just asking, why is that part of your proposed rule?"
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,1283.72,1290.56,"Your Honor, no court of appeals has ever held that there is a requirement, but I think -- I'm sympathetic to the rationale behind that rule, but I think --"
2018.17-1184,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1290.56,1297.2,It seems to me that your rationale suggests that the on-demand part of your test is irrelevant.
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,1297.2,1299.32,"Your Honor, I don't think it's irrelevant."
2018.17-1184,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1340.32,1344.04,"Yeah, I guess I just -- I'm just not getting it because either it's enough or it's not enough."
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,1350.24,1351.6,"Well, Your Honor, I think --"
2018.17-1184,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1351.6,1357.84,Unless the demand part of the test is something about have you forfeited the right to complain about it.
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,1357.84,1365.2,"Well, Your Honor, the Seventh Circuit and the Ninth Circuit, which has also applied a similar standard, have talked about this in terms of forfeiture or waiver."
2018.17-1184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1435.36,1449.08,"Can you draw an adverse inference against the expert if the expert sincerely believes, perhaps mistakenly, but sincerely believes that what is requested is confidential?"
2018.17-1184,0,63064,ishan_bhabha,,1449.08,1499.52,"Your Honor, I think the adverse inference case law, again, it's not directly controlling here, for sure, but I think you can use the same intuition from those cases, because there's a very easy method, which, again, the government doesn't dispute here, to redact that information and provide only the crucial information. And I think the reason, again, particularly in this context of vocational experts, why this data is so important and why the failure to provide it is so practically harmful, in addition, we think, to being in conflict with the substantial evidence standard, is because these experts are bringing together very old definitions of jobs with entirely different taxonomy of job numbers, putting the numbers together and coming up with a result, and then, in certain circumstances, reducing that result further based on further hypotheticals posed by the ALJ. So it is a data-intensive process. The vocational expert identified as much in her testimony."
2018.17-1184,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1517.36,1522.4,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang."
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1522.4,1535.8,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to address two general subjects: First, how Social Security hearings work and how vocational experts decide whether there are significant numbers of relevant jobs in the national economy."
2018.17-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1575.76,1592.2,Then doesn't that solve this case? Because your agency now has in its handbook that every expert has to come prepared to cite the sources that they relied upon and to produce the materials.
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1602.04,1619.4,"The Vocational Expert Handbook that -- that we're talking about, the informal guidance, really is referring to vocational resource materials that they use. There are -- and not individual case client files. And if I can explain, there's two levels of analysis that a vocational expert goes --"
2018.17-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1619.4,1621.44,Do you want to show me where in the handbook --
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1621.44,1622.12,I think --
2018.17-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1622.12,1624.64,-- that's said so I know -- so I can follow you?
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1624.64,1625.64,The citation --
2018.17-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1625.64,1626.28,The source.
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1626.28,1628.44,-- is in -- in our brief in opp.
2018.17-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1654.88,1657.64,So they are picking numbers from the air?
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1657.64,1658.96,"No, I wouldn't say from the air."
2018.17-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1667.32,1672.8,Aren't they given the -- the file before they come to testify --
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1672.8,1673.0,No.
2018.17-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1673.0,1674.28,-- on the individual claimant?
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1674.28,1675.24,No.
2018.17-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1692.36,1696.08,"You're worrying me that this is, in fact, what all of the critics are saying."
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1696.08,1696.76,If -- if you can --
2018.17-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1696.76,1700.48,That these are numbers pulled out of a hat as a person sits there.
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1700.48,1702.52,"If I can explain, there are two levels."
2018.17-1184,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1799.36,1818.52,"Can you -- can you explain, what is the confidentiality here? She says she relies on the Bureau of Labor Statistics and her own independent research. What is your own independent research? I can't tell you because that would -- that's part of client files."
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1818.52,1830.72,I think it would help to look at page 118 and 119a of the petition appendix because that's the actual testimony. The first time this comes up in the -- is in the context of where the expert got her number -- her on-task percentage.
2018.17-1184,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1854.12,1863.2,But what are -- what are -- what are the -- what are the people? I -- I don't have a grasp on whose confidentiality is at stake.
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1863.2,1865.36,These are individuals that have disabilities.
2018.17-1184,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1886.76,1894.76,"Well, without the data, how is somebody to cross-examine her on that and how is the ALJ to verify that conclusion?"
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1894.76,1898.28,"Well, you cross-examine by simply asking basic questions."
2018.17-1184,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1971.8,1997.88,"Can we go back to what you said, you would dismiss the -- the handbook, but I think this is an accurate quote from it: At all hearings, you, the vocational expert, should be prepared to cite, explain, and furnish any sources you rely on to support your testimony."
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1997.88,2000.4,I -- I -- that is probably an exact quote.
2018.17-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2031.24,2031.72,Mr. Yang --
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2031.72,2042.84,"-- we think the only reasonable way to read this is we're talking about the upper order, the first order of things, BLS data, Dictionary of Occupational Data, that kind of stuff can be reasonably be expected to be brought."
2018.17-1184,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2044.8,2049.08,"So -- so ""any"" doesn't mean any?"
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2049.08,2051.92,"Like some agency pronouncements, they're not --"
2018.17-1184,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2051.92,2055.48,"We shouldn't defer to the agency's handbook on ""any"" in this case?"
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2055.48,2059.88,"Well, the non-guidance -- the non-binding guidance is written for non-lawyers."
2018.17-1184,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2062.04,2064.12,"It's written for the -- for the experts, right?"
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2064.12,2065.04,It's written for the experts.
2018.17-1184,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2070.12,2070.64,Can I ask a --
2018.17-1184,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2070.64,2070.64,Well --
2018.17-1184,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2070.64,2070.8,-- different --
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2070.8,2072.48,-- there's no way you can bring all your files.
2018.17-1184,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2072.48,2074.6,-- just a slightly different line of questioning.
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2106.16,2110.04,"If that were all that's standing alone, that may well be true."
2018.17-1184,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2110.04,2110.36,Okay.
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2110.76,2111.92,But -- but I wouldn't -- I wouldn't --
2018.17-1184,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2111.92,2113.16,-- so -- so can we just be --
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2113.16,2115.76,"-- I wouldn't concede that, though, because it depends on the entire record."
2018.17-1184,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2116.4,2128.0,"Yeah, sure it does. But I -- my hypothetical is that that's the key point, and on that key point, the only piece of evidence is an expert who says I have secret data."
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2130.44,2132.32,Likely reverse.
2018.17-1184,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2141.64,2141.92,Fine.
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2141.92,2142.6,The adjudicator --
2018.17-1184,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2142.6,2142.88,Fine.
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2144.0,2144.52,"But -- no, but --"

2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2145.68,2147.16,"Well, no, I actually not --"
2018.17-1184,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2147.16,2154.8,"If the district court said I'm not going to make the expert turn over his secret evidence, we'd still reverse because no rational jury could find."
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2154.8,2156.2,"Actually, I'm not sure that's right."
2018.17-1184,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2165.6,2166.64,Not a process problem.
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2166.64,2167.4,-- to contest it.
2018.17-1184,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2167.4,2169.08,Not a process problem.
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2171.56,2188.96,"But, if this -- if this is a qualified expert, there's no contest on the qualifications, the expert testifies to a fact, now there may be additional things that undermine that, but there's otherwise no other evidence, no evidence that contradicts the expert, I think that's a tough -- a tough call, because --"
2018.17-1184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2188.96,2193.8,"How does that work? I mean, I -- I actually don't know in a district judge."
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2252.64,2253.08,No.
2018.17-1184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2253.08,2258.76,"Well, then why would it be reversible error here if the vocational expert says exactly the same thing?"
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2258.76,2258.96,The --
2018.17-1184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2258.96,2260.4,You're going to say it isn't.
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2261.04,2288.6,"No, the one thing that I'm holding out is -- is this standard looks to the whole record, and there are things that could -- evidence that can be admitted into the record that can undermine the bottom line conclusion. So if, for instance -- and there are cases like this -- the vocational expert gives a bottom line number and then there's cross-examination and this -- the vocational expert cannot answer in any credible way how the expert came about doing this. Well, you know, I'm a vocational expert."
2018.17-1184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2299.68,2300.6,"Well, but no matter how --"
2018.17-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2300.6,2302.48,"Mr. Yang, it's really -- I'm sorry."
2018.17-1184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2302.48,2307.52,"-- no matter how much of an expert a person is, what you've basically said is -- is trust me."
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2318.16,2328.64,"There -- there are two points that I think are important. One, there are many issues in a Social Security hearing, just like in other cases. This is one of them."
2018.17-1184,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2346.36,2363.0,"But there was -- here, there was -- you said it was -- the expert didn't say no, but the expert -- the question to the expert was: Can you provide those surveys? No, they're confidential."
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2363.0,2363.92,The --
2018.17-1184,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2363.92,2369.52,"Then -- so the expert said no, and then the ALJ backs her up."
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2369.52,2373.64,"I'm not seeing that in the record, Justice Ginsburg."
2018.17-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2393.24,2393.68,Does it matter who --
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2393.68,2394.6,So it's not -- there is --
2018.17-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2394.6,2419.48,"Mr. Yang, you seem to, in answering Justice Gorsuch, believe that because the ALJ was the one who said, I'm not going to order that, that that somehow elevates the prior answer into being reliable? I mean, no expert is the judge in a case, correct? The judge has to accept the testimony."
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2419.48,2420.36,"Right, but just --"
2018.17-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2420.36,2431.08,All right? So how can an ALJ accept testimony for which it's blocked an answer about how the expert came to their conclusion?
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2431.08,2432.68,The question --
2018.17-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2432.68,2434.16,That -- that's his basic argument --
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2434.16,2434.64,The question --
2018.17-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2434.64,2444.48,-- which is this testimony is unreliable because I was blocked from being able to show a basis --
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2444.48,2447.04,I -- I understand that process argument.
2018.17-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2453.84,2454.0,No.
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2454.0,2455.32,-- what actually comes into evidence.
2018.17-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2455.32,2460.24,I could get on the stand and say anything I want.
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2474.6,2485.52,"But, here, the ALJ, which is an impartial ALJ -- or, excuse me, an impartial expert, who's been -- whose qualifications are determined and not objected to, there's no reason to think that she's --"
2018.17-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2485.52,2499.64,"Well, that's -- that's fascinating because there was a whole exchange at the beginning of this hearing where the ALJ asked the attorney to stipulate to the expertise of the expert, and the attorney refused to do so."
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2499.64,2500.72,Because the attorney thought --
2018.17-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2500.72,2502.12,And he said because --
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2502.12,2511.8,"They thought that that meant they could not dispute anything the expert said, which the judge says no, no, no, and the attorney then clarifies, well, I don't object to the testimony then."
2018.17-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2513.32,2523.44,But not to the expertise and certainly not to the fact that the expertise matches the disabilities at issue in this case.
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2523.44,2533.04,"Well, let -- let me step back a second, and I think this might help a little. There's a -- a good reason why counsel doesn't probe numbers like this."
2018.17-1184,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2570.0,2584.48,"Well, why is there, Mr. Yang, such variance in the numbers that these experts give? I mean, Mr. Bhabha says that when talking about nut sorters -- and I guess I want to know why everybody talks about nut sorters too. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1184,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2584.48,2589.36,"But it varies from 260 to 470,000."
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2589.36,2589.8,Right.
2018.17-1184,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2589.8,2595.96,"And that's a huge variance, and it makes you think where is that coming from and what are to -- what are we to do --"
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2595.96,2597.0,I totally understand.
2018.17-1184,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2597.0,2597.36,-- when somebody --
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2597.36,2598.4,Yes.
2018.17-1184,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2598.4,2599.8,-- says one of these numbers?
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2599.8,2601.6,I totally understand your point.
2018.17-1184,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2691.48,2694.56,So you're saying they're all ask -- answering different questions?
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2694.56,2695.56,Different questions.
2018.17-1184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2712.84,2723.2,"Well, you usually -- when you're having someone testify to data and numbers, the way you cross-examine is to ask what she relied on and then see if that testimony lines up."
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2723.2,2723.56,Yes.
2018.17-1184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2724.32,2728.28,"Well, yes. But, here, she said, I -- I can't give you the data on which I relied."
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2728.28,2739.4,"Well, no, this is -- I'll give you a few questions I think would have clarified this case considerably. The -- with respect to the job numbers, the -- the expert testified that she relied on BLS numbers."
2018.17-1184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2758.92,2760.28,"Well, they can redact the names, right?"
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2760.28,2762.12,They -- they could redact the names.
2018.17-1184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2788.04,2788.16,Okay.
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2789.56,2790.96,"Well, then you can probe further."
2018.17-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2820.92,2832.52,Doesn't that shift the burden? Isn't it your burden to prove that those jobs exist? Why is it their burden to show the basis for your expert's opinion?
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2832.52,2832.96,It's their --
2018.17-1184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2832.96,2837.52,"It's me getting up there and just saying this is the number, believe me."
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2837.52,2841.64,"This is a public right, and claimants bear the burden of proving disability."
2018.17-1184,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2928.44,2970.56,"Well, but if it's the key -- if it's the key fact in dispute -- and it really is in all these cases, right? I mean, that's why you have a vocational expert, is how many jobs are there going to be that this person can -- could do. If it's the key thing in dispute, and the expert has said I -- I want to keep my evidence on which I'm relying secret, it's not, as in Justice Breyer's example, saying I'm basing it on my experience over 30 years in the industry, and then you could maybe ask about that, and you could have your own expert with 30 years in the industry could opine on that. And, in fact, the Federal Rules of Evidence, of course, treat that kind of expert very differently than an expert who relies on data, as this one did. This one says, I've got secret data. All right? And it's the key question in the case."
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2982.72,2985.44,There -- there -- there's two questions.
2018.17-1184,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2993.08,2993.12,Yeah.
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2993.12,2995.24,-- permissibly infer. There's a second question --
2018.17-1184,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2995.24,2998.76,"Why wouldn't that be a compelling inference? I understand it's an analogy, but we're not -- we're not --"
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2998.76,3020.76,"Well, but it's meaningful when you're talking about review of a jury verdict or review here under substantial evidence where you have to find no reasonable adjudicator would have gone -- concluded that. So it's a -- it's a very different inquiry. Having bracketed that, I will admit there are some answers that can undermine a bottom line response. Now we can quibble about where -- you know, how far down that road you have to go to --"
2018.17-1184,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3020.76,3022.24,But you'd agree that -- okay.
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3033.8,3034.36,Certainly.
2018.17-1184,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3034.36,3034.52,All right.
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3034.52,3035.32,I think that's right.
2018.17-1184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3042.72,3042.96,Would you object --
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3042.96,3043.8,There's no follow-up.
2018.17-1184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3043.8,3044.36,Would you -- would you --
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3044.36,3046.92,There was questioning but not on the relevant issues.
2018.17-1184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3046.92,3050.32,"Would you object, because, obviously, there's some kind of a problem."
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3093.24,3093.6,I --
2018.17-1184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3093.6,3097.12,"I mean, is there anything wrong with doing that? Could that help solve the problem?"
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3097.12,3105.52,"I think it would depend on how that's written, but I would like to just focus on, if it is contested, significantly with cross-examination, which is not in this case --"
2018.17-1184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3105.52,3106.04,Uh-huh.
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3106.04,3113.6,"-- then I would be very hesitant, though, to require things like personal confidential files that's going to require significant delays in the process."
2018.17-1184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3113.6,3114.52,"No, you wouldn't have to do that."
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3126.72,3147.92,"Well, there -- there are cases -- there are cases, I think, that -- that highlight exactly what you're talking about, where there's cross-examination -- and we cite, again, at least one or two of these in our brief -- where the -- the -- the -- on review, this -- like, you know, their -- this cross-examination so undermined the basic predicate of -- or the basic testimony that it can no longer be substantial evidence. We're not quibbling with that."
2018.17-1184,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3218.52,3220.08,How? How would it substantially impair?
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3220.08,3224.04,"Remember, these cases are -- hearings are tightly packed."
2018.17-1184,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3227.52,3230.92,I don't understand that as how that's going to substantially impair.
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3230.92,3238.24,"Oh, the -- the reason is because you're not going to be able to predict in advance what documents might be relevant beyond the high-level documents that we're talking about."
2018.17-1184,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3255.68,3260.08,What -- what is -- what is the experience in the Seventh Circuit that -- that has --
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3260.08,3265.72,We don't have much meaningful experience in the Seventh Circuit because the Seventh Circuit hasn't adopted the rule that Petitioners purport to it.
2018.17-1184,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3271.8,3272.76,How -- how is the government --
2018.17-1184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3272.76,3273.16,Is the requirement --
2018.17-1184,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3273.16,3274.2,"Oh, sorry."
2018.17-1184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3274.2,3277.92,Is the new -- are the new requirements in the handbook going to slow things up?
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3277.92,3281.72,"No, because we don't understand that to mean bring all your personal files."
2018.17-1184,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3291.88,3299.68,Is the government's argument that its failure to provide timely hearings should be an excuse not to comply with other requirements?
2018.17-1184,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3299.68,3300.6,Not -- not at all.

2018.17-1184,2,63064,ishan_bhabha,,3330.24,3356.16,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd just like to respond to three things the government said. First and foremost, the government's lawyer represented that the Vocational Expert's Handbook simply requires them to bring public information they might perhaps rely on. I'm sorry, but if you look at page 3 of the handbook, it explicitly says at all hearings, you should be prepared to cite, explain, and furnish any sources that you rely on to support your testimony."
2018.17-1184,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3356.56,3363.32,"Well, what if I think, Mr. Bhabha, you're right about that, but, instead, it's just, well, that's the best practices rule."
2018.17-1184,2,63064,ishan_bhabha,,3367.44,3380.92,"I agree with you, Justice Kagan, but what I take from the government's own handbook is two things. Firstly, their administrability arguments are inconsistent with the policy the Social Security Administration itself is telling vocational experts."

2018.17-1184,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3536.64,3541.4,The government says you're asking for more than the Seventh Circuit position.
