1990.89-5867,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,22.085,"We'll hear argument now on No. 89-5867, Shirley W. Irwin against the Veteran's Administration."
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,34.624,37.196,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-5867,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,138.223,162.228,"Well, Mr. Ker, now... excuse me, let me get my microphone on... it seems to me that the Court in a number of cases has adopted a rule of strict construction where the Government itself has given up its sovereign immunity and permitted suit against itself."
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,172.765,173.746,I did not cite Dalm.
1990.89-5867,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,173.746,189.263,--But again it relied on the sovereign immunity principle to construe a statute worded like this one as not providing equitable tolling relief.
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,191.985,193.027,"Thank you, Justice O'Connor."
1990.89-5867,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,265.994,266.675,"But, Mr. Ker--"
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,266.675,267.055,--Yes.
1990.89-5867,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,267.055,277.491,--I thought in Bowen the Court said there was language by which Congress had expressed its clear intention to allow tolling in some cases.
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,286.377,291.002,"Yes, Your Honor, but the provision in Bowen was similar to this one by the use of the word may."
1990.89-5867,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,299.357,320.971,"Well, maybe the Court hasn't been entirely consistent in its cases, but I do suggest that when you look at cases like Mottaz and Soriano and the case last term, U.S. v. Dalm, they just aren't consistent with your theory."
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,327.835,328.696,"Thank you, Justice O'Connor."
1990.89-5867,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,341.515,343.185,Mr. Kerr.
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,343.185,344.306,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-5867,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,344.306,349.028,"The Library of Congress v. Shaw, do you cite that in your brief?"
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,349.028,350.961,"I did not, but the Government did."
1990.89-5867,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,350.961,362.819,"But that was a case dealing with title VII as I recall, and nonetheless the Court said that when you're dealing with the Government, you don't necessarily draw the same inferences from language as you do in a law that affects only private litigants."
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,362.819,363.959,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-5867,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,377.299,382.691,"Well, that question in that case was whether they'd waived it and the Court said they haven't by general language."
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,392.348,403.145,"However, Your Honor, in... again, I submit that Shaw is distinguishable upon that fact because in Shaw the issue was whether or not the interest upon attorneys' fees had been waived."
1990.89-5867,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,437.737,444.351,"On the other hand, we said in Soriano... and I don't even think Bowen... I don't even think Bowen mentioned Soriano."
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,466.625,470.578,"--In all likelihood, that is correct, Mr. Justice Scalia."
1990.89-5867,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,485.959,498.668,"Are we going to decide this question on the basis of how important we think the particular policy of the statute is, and if we like the policy of that statute, we allow a tolling and if we don't like the policy, we don't."
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,499.879,500.25,"--No, sir."
1990.89-5867,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,534.661,536.041,You really think it's a big difference.
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,553.623,560.288,"Mr. Justice Scalia, I would say that probably the distinction is... is fine in that area, but--"
1990.89-5867,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,560.288,561.249,--It sure is.
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,565.982,566.542,"--Well, I--"
1990.89-5867,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,566.542,570.656,--get some sold line of jurisprudence that the lower courts can follow in all of these areas?
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,570.656,572.256,"--Absolutely, Your Honor, and the--"
1990.89-5867,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,572.256,575.928,So we should choose between Soriano and Bowen [inaudible].
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,575.928,588.157,"--Yes, sir, and the circuits are... while they are divided I think the majority of the circuits support the petitioner's argument here that it is subject to equitable tolling, and I might add one other thing, too."
1990.89-5867,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,887.701,890.263,"Do you have a page citation for that, Mr. Ker?"
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,891.124,892.836,"Yes, Your Honor, but I did not write it in my notes."
1990.89-5867,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,893.315,893.666,--Okay.
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,894.988,896.077,"Yes, sir, I certainly will."
1990.89-5867,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,901.341,904.541,479.
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,904.541,906.274,"--Thank you, Your... I was just going to say 479."
1990.89-5867,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,986.927,991.349,"Excuse me, I... I'm not sure this is the right... I don't think this is the right terminology."
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1014.995,1031.215,"--Well, Mr. Justice Scalia, in this case notice was received at my office at a time when I had departed the country for the Republic of Korea, and the court applied the constructive notice standard to say that receipt at my office was... was--"
1990.89-5867,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1031.215,1031.507,xxx.
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1035.757,1046.056,"--Well, what's unusual about that, Mr. Justice... Mr. Chief Justice, is that that... that step actually is a double constructive notice."
1990.89-5867,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1049.857,1052.238,"Well, I practiced law for 16 years--"
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1052.238,1052.829,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-5867,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1052.829,1065.427,"--and it was certainly always my assumption, and I think most of my clients assumed, that when a notice of an opinion or decision came to my office as a lawyer it was... came to me as of that time and it came to the client as of that time."
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1065.427,1068.339,"Yes, sir, but the cases have held."
1990.89-5867,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1069.04,1069.819,What specific cases?
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1069.819,1071.682,"--Well, the cases I had cited in my brief."
1990.89-5867,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1071.682,1072.703,Cases from this Court?
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1072.703,1073.462,"No, sir."
1990.89-5867,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1101.241,1110.948,Said that a lawyer could leave his office for 3 months and no effect would be given to the receipt of a no... a decision in that office until the lawyer returned?
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1110.948,1112.518,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the--"
1990.89-5867,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1112.518,1114.341,Is... is that the import of those cases?
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1114.341,1115.78,"--I believe that's correct, yes, sir."
1990.89-5867,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1154.576,1157.738,When did your client receive actual notice in this case?
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1157.738,1158.81,April... April the 7th.
1990.89-5867,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1247.589,1250.127,That question isn't whether it's unduly burdensome on the EEOC.
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1252.32,1261.537,"--Yes, sir, and I would... in addition to the statute which talks in terms of the complainant himself so does the regulations by the EEOC."
1990.89-5867,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1378.442,1391.381,Don't you think under our system generally that when somebody has an attorney representing them we... we traditionally think that notice furnished the attorney is notice to the litigant?
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1391.381,1394.614,"Thank you, Justice O'Connor."
1990.89-5867,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1451.382,1467.862,"Are you relying in... are you saying that whenever any statute or rule says nothing more specific than the phrase ""receipt of notice"" that we should interpret that to mean always that there has to be personal receipt and service upon an agent and not--"
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1467.862,1468.753,Not in every situation.
1990.89-5867,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1469.344,1470.786,"--Well, why... why is this different?"
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1470.786,1478.9,"Because the statute and the regulations both state the terms ""claimant"" or ""applicant"", and ""you"", speaking to the--"
1990.89-5867,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1478.9,1480.681,Where is that?
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1485.544,1486.044,"--Yes, sir."
1990.89-5867,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1488.355,1498.462,"And you say whenever a statute says receipt of notice by someone, we should interpret that to mean that that person has to receive it personally and it's not enough to give it to his attorney?"
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1498.462,1503.855,I can't think of a situation outside of title VII--
1990.89-5867,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1503.855,1504.286,"Do you think you can live with that, really?"
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1504.286,1505.926,"--but under title VII, yes, sir."
1990.89-5867,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1505.926,1507.178,I'm not talking about title VII.
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1519.326,1524.289,"Yes, sir, the plain language of that would be that the claimant receive actual notice, yes, sir."
1990.89-5867,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1524.289,1531.835,"xxx here, at least you could say that service on his attorney isn't enough."
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1535.816,1544.562,"Well, I believe that under the private employee situation that has been held to be the case."
1990.89-5867,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1555.611,1559.071,Why does it have to mean actual notice by the claimant?
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1575.292,1579.395,"--I'm sorry, Mr. Justice White, I didn't understand your question."
1990.89-5867,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1582.676,1592.183,"Well, you say that it would never be possible to have... to give notice to the claimant unless he actually receives it."
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1592.183,1592.824,"No, sir."
1990.89-5867,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1592.824,1594.684,"Well, you've just been saying it all the time."
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1594.684,1597.466,"Well, I also stated that we would--"
1990.89-5867,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1597.466,1599.068,"Haven't you been saying that, actual notice to the claimant?"
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1599.068,1605.774,--Actual notice or if there is a designation by the claimant to the EEOC that actual notice be given to--
1990.89-5867,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1605.774,1606.783,He gives no designation.
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1620.603,1623.104,"--There is case law, Your Honor, to--"
1990.89-5867,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1623.104,1623.945,What about it?
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1623.945,1631.55,"--There is case law to assert that if, say, for instance he moves and doesn't give notice of... to the EEOC."
1990.89-5867,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1634.251,1636.074,"Well, so it isn't actual notice, is it?"
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1636.074,1637.834,"Yes, sir, I believe that it is actual."
1990.89-5867,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1637.834,1639.975,"You mean, actual constructive notice."
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1639.975,1640.746,"No, sir."
1990.89-5867,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1640.746,1645.729,"Excuse me, is a registered letter a notice?"
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1645.729,1646.65,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1990.89-5867,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1646.65,1648.991,A registered letter notice?
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1648.991,1654.374,"A registered letter signed by the claimant would be actual notice, yes, sir."
1990.89-5867,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1654.374,1657.305,"Well, then you don't read actual notice."
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1657.305,1663.039,"If it's signed by the claimant, then that is actual notice to the claimant."
1990.89-5867,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1663.039,1669.023,"Well, I always thought actual notice was you tell him, not by mail."
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1669.023,1670.825,"Well, the regulations provide--"
1990.89-5867,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1670.825,1672.697,xxx notice by mail.
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1672.697,1678.981,"--Yes, sir, the regulations of the EEOC provide for certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and that would be actual notice."
1990.89-5867,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1678.981,1680.262,And that's what you mean by actual notice?
1990.89-5867,0,31283,jon_t_ker,,1680.262,1680.421,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-5867,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1683.533,1684.995,"Thank you, Mr. Ker."
1990.89-5867,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1686.825,1692.239,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-5867,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1743.763,1751.328,"Mr. Roberts, what do you make of our cases which seem to go really in different directions."
1990.89-5867,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1774.774,1777.025,"--Your Honor, I don't think the cases are inconsistent."
1990.89-5867,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.055,1827.619,"Briefly, briefly."
1990.89-5867,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1836.045,1837.144,--Well--
1990.89-5867,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1837.144,1839.317,"And rightly so, because way does that cut?"
1990.89-5867,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1868.214,1870.395,"--No, I think that would be a non sequitur."

1990.89-5867,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3479.601,3482.024,--Is that the EEOC regulation you're reading?
1990.89-5867,2,31283,jon_t_ker,,3482.024,3484.025,"--29 C.F.R., Your Honor."

1990.89-5867,2,31283,jon_t_ker,,3492.299,3496.37,"No, sir, and the claimant as a courtesy to the attorney."
1990.89-5867,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3500.774,3505.586,"It's standard in the law that if you give it to my agent, you give it to me."
1990.89-5867,2,31283,jon_t_ker,,3510.681,3521.378,"I also submit, Mr. Justice Scalia, that in this situation you don't look at the exact facts of this particular case and interpreting the provision, you look at what is applicable to all claimants."
