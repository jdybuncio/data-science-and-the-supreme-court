1983.83-490,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,68.752,"Mr. Franks, I think you may proceed when you are ready."
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,68.752,72.0,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.83-490,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,130.166,140.02,"Mr. Franks, would you help us interpret what the holding of the district court is now?"
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,140.02,140.707,There are--
1983.83-490,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,140.707,158.106,"It... it seems to have held... the second district court opinion seemed to hold a new statute unconstitutional; and you agree that that much of the holding is in error, and I guess the other side does, too."
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,158.106,159.435,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1983.83-490,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,159.435,172.538,Was anything left of its original finding that the older statute was unconstitutional because of the failure to provide a prompt post-termination hearing?
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,172.538,173.599,"No, Justice O'Connor."
1983.83-490,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,187.796,192.624,"Well, and you think there was nothing left of the original district court holding in that regard?"
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,192.624,193.997,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1983.83-490,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,193.997,196.995,And so all we have is the holding on the new statute--
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,196.995,198.762,That is--
1983.83-490,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,198.762,206.834,"--And... and a finding that the employers failed to follow their own regulation requiring a speedy investigation, is that right?"
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,206.834,210.633,--I... I don't know that I would call it a speedy investigation.
1983.83-490,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,212.554,212.976,All right.
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,212.976,213.834,On complete investigation.
1983.83-490,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,213.834,214.286,Yeah.
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,214.286,216.474,"In fact, yes, that's correct."
1983.83-490,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,227.201,229.497,"Your... your... your opponent agrees, does he not--"
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,229.497,230.106,"Yes, sir."
1983.83-490,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,230.106,237.039,--That that part of the judgment which declared the 1981 statute unconstitutional should be vacated.
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,237.039,237.866,"Yes, sir."
1983.83-490,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,240.022,241.43,So what is there left for us?
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,251.455,259.11,"--Well, the... the concession by the Appellee was not made, Justice Rehnquist, until the brief on the merits was filed."
1983.83-490,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,312.494,314.319,With respect to a judgment for damages.
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,314.319,316.726,With respect to a judgment for damages.
1983.83-490,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,319.053,319.911,Which is outstanding.
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,319.911,321.787,"--Which is still outstanding, yes, sir."
1983.83-490,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,488.109,492.262,"Mr. Franks, are you taking the position there was no violation of a constitutional right?"
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,492.262,493.296,"--Yes, sir, that's right."
1983.83-490,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,496.075,499.745,You didn't raise that question in your jurisdictional provision.
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,499.745,520.674,"--Well, we... we submit that, Your Honor, that it comes part and parcel with the good faith... qualified good faith immunity that is addressed in our jurisdictional brief; that the court found that the law regarding the pre-termination of due process was not clearly established at the time."
1983.83-490,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,520.674,525.236,"Well, but you're arguing that even as of today's law there was no violation, as I understand it."
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,525.236,527.685,I would say under the facts of this case that's correct.
1983.83-490,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,601.125,601.783,"Mr. Franks, let me ask you another question."
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,606.233,608.982,--I would say that the--
1983.83-490,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,608.982,611.107,The law is exactly the same today as it was then?
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,611.107,634.613,"--The Fifth Circuit's adoption of the... of the standard in Weisbrod where they held that the individual is entitled to notice and that he is entitled to respond to the notice of... of disciplinary action has been clearly established since the facts, the operative facts were developed in this case."
1983.83-490,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,634.613,639.078,"But you argue there was not a violation of the law as construed in Weisbrod, or do you?"
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,639.971,640.361,"Oh, no."
1983.83-490,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,642.467,647.763,"--I understand it came later, but would you say if that had come out before that there would have been a constitutional violation?"
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,647.763,665.458,"--Well, I'd say that the... there was no violation of... of his constitutional rights at any time as it regards his notice that he could be terminated for his failure to terminate his second job, whether he challenges the wisdom--"
1983.83-490,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,665.458,669.19,"In other words, you'd win even if Weisbrod had been decided before this all happened."
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,669.19,669.943,"--Yes, sir."
1983.83-490,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,669.943,675.062,"Well, what's your view as to the correctness of the Weisbrod decision under this Court's precedents?"
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,675.062,687.327,"Well, we believe that the... it adopts or looks to Arnett v. Johnson as... as the guidance for the type of hearing."
1983.83-490,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,706.91,711.083,You... you concede or agree that Weisbrod is a correct statement of--
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,711.083,711.582,"Yes, sir."
1983.83-490,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,988.189,1007.086,"--Mr. Franks, do you think the district court used the violation of state regulations by the state official as an element of the violation of constitutional rights finding, or simply as a denial of good faith immunity?"
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,1007.086,1011.773,--I think that he looked at it purely as a denial of good faith immunity.
1983.83-490,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1046.163,1050.051,"Well, then, what is left to base the damage award on?"
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,1050.051,1064.515,"--We would argue... urge that there is nothing to base the damage on under the law that was announced in Harlow, and I see no need to retreat from--"
1983.83-490,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1064.515,1070.231,What... what did the settlement agreement that the Appellee entered into say?
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,1070.231,1085.567,"--The settlement agreement was reached in his state career service proceeding whereby he was challenging the termination, and he was ordered reinstated with partial back pay."
1983.83-490,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1089.58,1093.55,Did it mention the Section 1983 claims or the basis for them?
1983.83-490,0,35790,mitchell_d_franks,,1093.55,1094.205,--No.
1983.83-490,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1107.667,1112.01,Mr. Wilkins.
1983.83-490,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1112.01,1114.635,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.83-490,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1320.72,1335.514,"Counsel, would it be... would you make the same argument if the administrative regulation were perfectly clear, so that you could objectively say we don't have the problems we have in a subjective analysis or totality of the facts on summary judgment?"
1983.83-490,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1335.514,1340.339,"Yes, we would, Justice Stevens, for one important question... for one important reason."
1983.83-490,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1499.368,1502.617,"Of course, that's true of even clearly constitutional rules."
1983.83-490,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1502.617,1503.397,Exactly.
1983.83-490,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1539.725,1546.503,"Well, would you ever deny qualified immunity in the 1983 based on clearly established state law?"
1983.83-490,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1546.503,1549.533,"Well, we don't think that that would be appropriate."
1983.83-490,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1551.611,1552.126,Ever.
1983.83-490,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1552.126,1553.876,--We don't think that would be appropriate ever.
1983.83-490,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1553.876,1556.032,That... that is what happened in this case.
1983.83-490,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1556.032,1557.686,That is what happened in this case.
1983.83-490,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1557.686,1560.732,So you don't need to make the argument he just made.
1983.83-490,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1560.732,1568.168,"No, we don't, but we're making the argument because when it comes up in the federal context, of course we're not going to be talking about state law."
1983.83-490,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1625.955,1633.98,Mr. Rogow.
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1633.98,1637.15,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.83-490,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1772.144,1776.457,"Mr. Rogow, how do we reach that question?"
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1797.245,1805.739,"Justice O'Connor, first, the statutory question here, whether the statutes are constitutional or not, are not an issue in this case."
1983.83-490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1819.079,1820.639,Under the federal Constitution.
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1820.639,1822.779,"--Under the federal Constitution, yes, Justice White."
1983.83-490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1822.779,1823.89,But not under some state law.
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1823.89,1825.637,"Absolutely not, Justice White."
1983.83-490,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1900.262,1910.412,"But the district... the district court really didn't rely on this line of reasoning, did it, because if it had relied on this line of reasoning, I would think it wouldn't gotten into the violation of a state regulation."
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1910.412,1930.685,"--It... when Weisbrod came out, five days later the district court then amended its original judgment and said well, Weisbrod says that the law wasn't clearly established, although Weisbrod really says very little, if anything, about that, and Weisbrod does not pay any attention to what all the due process development had been."
1983.83-490,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1942.26,1952.114,"So you're... you're really arguing here for an alternative basis of upholding the judgment, not on the reasoning most recently advanced by the district court?"
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1952.114,1953.459,--That's right.
1983.83-490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1967.814,1974.247,"Well, the other side of that coin, I take it, is that you don't defend his... his amended opinion."
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1974.247,1977.106,"Oh, yes, I can reach that, too, and defend that also."
1983.83-490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1981.228,1986.523,"Well, why don't you just... just... I take it you feel some uneasiness about defending his--"
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1986.523,1988.305,"Not at all, but I'd like to--"
1983.83-490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1988.305,1993.488,"--Well, why would you start about... on... why would you start out arguing an alternative ground?"
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1993.488,2000.987,"--Well, the alternative ground, of course, is the ground... if the law is clearly established, then Harlow presents no issue at all in the case."
1983.83-490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2000.987,2005.467,"Well, I know, but the law he said was clearly established he ultimately said was state law."
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2005.467,2006.501,"No, sir."
1983.83-490,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2041.798,2043.483,What was that language... what was that language you just quoted?
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2045.406,2049.856,--70A and 71A of the jurisdictional statement appendix.
1983.83-490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2126.574,2128.84,"Yes, but the district judge finally said that"
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2152.283,2158.889,--The combination of General Order 43 and the constitutional right of due process.
1983.83-490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2158.889,2162.75,"Well, that isn't what 67... I don't understand."
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2170.557,2171.103,That's right.
1983.83-490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2173.18,2181.974,That was his ultimate... his ultimate holding was that qualified immunity is denied because there was a... a clearly established state law.
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2181.974,2184.458,--And due process was violated.
1983.83-490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2184.458,2186.662,"And you don't define... you don't defend that part of it, do you?"
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2186.662,2187.161,No.
1983.83-490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2212.164,2215.947,"Of course, what we're reviewing here is a judgment of the court of appeals."
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2215.947,2219.07,Which per curiam affirmed the decision below.
1983.83-490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2219.07,2219.475,Right.
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2226.597,2227.27,Yes.
1983.83-490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2227.27,2241.887,"Now, if we... if that is not defensible, it seems to me the proper recourse would be to remand to the court of appeals and disabuse them of their... of an erroneous view of the law."
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2241.887,2246.199,"Well, I... the alternative ground, which is clear from this record and easily--"
1983.83-490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2246.199,2247.763,"Well, we'll let them decide that."
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2247.763,2267.018,"--That the case... the case has had a long history already, and since the law was so clearly established, it seems to us there is no problem in this Court taking the original judgment that the district court found and saying he was right in that original judgment, and that supports the decision of the court of appeals."
1983.83-490,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2376.396,2383.391,Did Harlow... did Harlow limit itself to the immunity of officers performing discretionary functions?
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2383.391,2385.096,--It certainly did in its language.
1983.83-490,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2387.314,2389.502,In... in its statement of the rule did it?
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2389.502,2390.734,--When... yes.
1983.83-490,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2491.533,2499.827,What... what is your argument here as to why this particular defendant was exercising a nondiscretionary function?
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2499.827,2513.32,"--Because defendant Beach under the regulation had to, once informed of a violation of... of a departmental order, had to order a complete investigation which will include a statement from the defendant."
1983.83-490,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2527.362,2543.074,"So you say that if a person's function is claimed to be nondiscretionary, it is open to argument by the, plaintiff in a case like this, that a state regulation made the duty mandatory."
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2548.509,2549.772,"Yes, yes."
1983.83-490,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2551.098,2552.786,I doubt that Harlow ever intended that.
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2552.786,2561.576,"--Harlow focused on discretionary/nondiscretionary, which must have some content, and here we're dealing with mandatory language."
1983.83-490,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2565.063,2574.931,"Yeah, but then the next case you're going to get is one where the language isn't that clear, and you'll be arguing in the 1983 action well, it doesn't really appear mandatory, but it's open to that construction."
1983.83-490,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2579.806,2599.955,"Well, I... we're dealing here with... with one step... I like to take them one step at a time... and I think that when you're dealing with a regulation that parallels the constitutional right... and that's exactly what this regulation does; in fact, it looks like it was passed to enact really the meaning of Thurston v. Dekle."
