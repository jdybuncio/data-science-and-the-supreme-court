2011.11-5683,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.689,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-5683, Dorsey v. United States, and 11-5721, Hill v. United States."
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,10.739,14.158,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2011.11-5683,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,56.753,57.186,Excuse me.
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,79.166,86.938,"--No, it is not, but the standard from this Court, Justice Scalia, is fair implication, and it has been ever since Great -- the Great Northern case."
2011.11-5683,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,103.115,107.351,"Of course, the statute itself says ""express"", right?"
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,108.751,109.887,That is correct.
2011.11-5683,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,109.887,113.339,"So we're pretty far removed from the language of the statute, I guess."
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,113.339,119.159,"But, again, ever since 1908, that's a standard that this Court has not accepted."
2011.11-5683,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,126.83,127.496,"Oh, and I understand that."
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,144.273,150.695,"The answer is no, I don't believe that Congress felt that that was the standard."
2011.11-5683,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,167.621,169.157,"Well, on your statement that the--"
2011.11-5683,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,169.157,170.873,It--
2011.11-5683,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,170.873,176.561,"--one Congress cannot bind a later Congress, do you mean we're not supposed to look at 109?"
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,178.763,181.131,"--Oh, absolutely, the Court is, Your Honor."
2011.11-5683,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,183.1,188.285,So then -- so then the fact that 109 is on the books is relevant.
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,193.755,204.246,"--Yes, 109 is relevant, but it's the standard to be employed in determining whether or not there's a fair implication of what the later Congress meant."
2011.11-5683,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,204.246,206.23,"I'm really troubled by ""fair implication""--"
2011.11-5683,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,206.23,207.115,--You're right that if you're right--
2011.11-5683,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,207.115,207.615,Justice Scalia.
2011.11-5683,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,207.615,215.888,"--How many -- how many cases do you have that say ""fair implication"" as opposed to quite a few that say ""clear and unquestionable implication""?"
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,218.84,220.84,Fair implication from Marrero--
2011.11-5683,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,220.84,222.975,"From a footnote in Marrero, right?"
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,222.975,223.792,--Correct.
2011.11-5683,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,223.792,224.244,Yes.
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,225.36,226.877,Marcello.
2011.11-5683,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,226.877,227.945,Marcello?
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,254.513,258.298,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.11-5683,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,264.785,266.154,"Well, that's a different question."
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,273.89,281.33,--Marrero primarily was based on the fact that there was a specific provision for nonretroactivity.
2011.11-5683,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,291.119,296.423,"So it did not find 109 overcome by fair implication, right?"
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,296.423,297.156,--Correct.
2011.11-5683,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,297.156,299.708,"So it's entirely dictum, right?"
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,301.494,306.446,"No, I believe it is an alternative holding, because the primary holding in--"
2011.11-5683,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,306.446,307.231,I thought it was the other way.
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,309.281,310.849,--I'm sorry.
2011.11-5683,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.849,317.753,"I thought you said the holding was that section 109 governed, that it had not been repealed."
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,317.753,324.942,"109 was the alternative holding, saying that 109 would also preclude the retroactivity provision."
2011.11-5683,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,324.942,325.975,Exactly.
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,347.373,352.759,"I don't agree, Your Honor."
2011.11-5683,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,352.759,353.226,All right.
2011.11-5683,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,353.226,360.865,"--So that's true of all of the cases that you -- the cases -- you pointed to two or three that use ""fair implication""."
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,375.392,382.112,"In Marrero, the primary holding was based on the fact that there was a specific provision for nonretroactivity."
2011.11-5683,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,382.112,392.669,"But in none of the cases that used the fair implication language did the Court say: And, therefore, the old statute no longer governs."
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,392.669,394.919,Correct.
2011.11-5683,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,394.919,405.727,So you're relying on a standard that this Court did -- must have considered appropriate because it deviated from the words of the statute.
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,411.065,431.961,"Well, in application, when the Court applied this in Marcello, when they were weighing the language of the Administrative Procedure Act as opposed to the language of the Immigration and Nationality Act, I think the Court made clear, as it went through the statute there, that there was a fair implication."
2011.11-5683,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,448.238,450.821,But that was not true of the 109 cases.
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,461.629,464.348,Directly?
2011.11-5683,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,465.398,467.95,Do you think that--
2011.11-5683,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,467.95,468.85,What do--
2011.11-5683,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,468.85,478.34,"--Do you think that if we stick to the language of the statute, if we are, indeed, looking for an express provision, do you agree that there isn't any here?"
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,478.34,494.933,"We agree there is no express provision, but obviously, we also contend that going back to the proposition that an earlier Congress cannot bind the later, that that standard has been rejected even though argued by my colleague to my left."
2011.11-5683,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,497.385,498.587,"Oh, I'm not sure he's arguing that."
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,512.062,534.427,"--When you look at the language of section 8, when Congress has mandated the Sentencing Commission to use their emergency authority to achieve consistency with other guideline provisions and applicable law, it makes clear that Congress meant this needs to take effect as soon as possible."
2011.11-5683,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,555.755,590.495,"--Well, there might be a few, but there -- but assume that you're drafting this legislation and you want it to apply only to defendants who commit an offense after the enactment of the Fair Sentencing Act, but you also want to do everything that you reasonably can to make sure that when the very first one of those defendants comes up for sentencing, there will be new sentencing guidelines in effect that are geared to the new lower mandatory minimums rather than the old sentencing guidelines in effect."
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,600.766,602.552,--No.
2011.11-5683,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,602.552,603.502,No?
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,603.502,605.17,Because of the--
2011.11-5683,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,605.17,619.264,You would say take your time and it doesn't matter if a few -- a few defendants who are -- who commit the offense after the enactment of the Fair Sentencing Act come up and they are -- they're subjected to the old soon-to-be-obsolete sentencing guidelines?
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,619.264,620.297,--No.
2011.11-5683,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,643.979,646.664,Are we just supposed to assume that Congress knows that?
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,657.187,660.389,"I think we do, Chief Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.11-5683,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,668.411,668.961,"Well, right."
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,692.693,707.12,"On just the point of the immediacy placed on by Congress, I think that would take away from the fair implication that Congress meant that it -- the law should be go -- or the law should be effective on the date of the President's signature."
2011.11-5683,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,707.12,740.293,"Why do you pick the date that the Fair Sentencing Act went into effect, if it -- if what -- if the guidelines are a 90-day period, that the Commission came out with its new guidelines on November 1st, and some time after August 3, which was when the Sentencing Act -- so on -- on your theory, why isn't the right date the date that the Sentencing Guidelines went into effect?"
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,740.293,754.701,"The correct date is the August 3rd date, Your Honor, because of the intent of Congress made known through the implication of the language taken in the legal context of the Sentencing Reform Act."
2011.11-5683,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,771.395,772.178,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.11-5683,0,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,772.178,772.847,Thank you.
2011.11-5683,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,772.847,779.751,Mr. Dreeben.
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,779.751,782.47,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-5683,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,794.694,797.463,Do you think it's a clear and unmistakable implication--
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,797.463,798.346,First of all--
2011.11-5683,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,798.346,801.665,--if we are going to argue about the language?
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,801.665,804.2,"--I do, Justice Sotomayor."
2011.11-5683,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,813.055,815.591,"Well, generally the word ""express"" incorporates ""clear""."
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,815.591,822.161,"--There is no dispute here, I don't think, that there is a -- a lack of an express statement in the Act."
2011.11-5683,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,822.645,824.713,So that -- why doesn't that defeat your case?
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,824.713,835.755,"--Well, as Justice Scalia explained in his concurring opinion in Lockhart v. United States, one Congress cannot impose standards of how another Congress is to enact legislation."
2011.11-5683,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,844.193,845.843,"Well, so then we -- we ignore The Dictionary Act?"
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,845.843,848.145,"--No, of course not, Justice Kennedy."
2011.11-5683,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,848.561,849.645,And can we ignore 109?
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,849.645,850.511,--No.
2011.11-5683,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,865.571,868.689,"Well, why doesn't it -- why doesn't that bring us right back to what 109 says?"
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,868.689,880.664,"--This Court has made clear in not only the section 109 cases, but I think, as my colleague mentioned in Marcello v. Bonds, that there are no magical passwords that Congress has to use to explain itself."
2011.11-5683,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,923.038,925.424,"Exactly, and I think we would come out that way."
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,943.701,944.987,"--I agree with that, Justice Scalia."
2011.11-5683,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,944.987,948.022,"--As Justice Alito was suggesting, it has some effect."
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,948.022,949.122,"No, I -- I don't disagree with that."
2011.11-5683,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,949.122,951.141,So it -- it's not comparable to -- to what you've just said.
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,951.141,960.663,"Well, I think it is because there is a piece of the -- that -- that section that I would like to draw the Court's attention to, because I think that it critically explains what the Sentencing Commission was supposed to do."
2011.11-5683,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1005.359,1006.109,That's fine.
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1020.368,1020.818,But--
2011.11-5683,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1020.818,1025.355,"There may not be many of them, but it does not -- it does not deprive that language of all meaning."
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1025.355,1030.676,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I want to put this in the structural context of the Sentencing Reform Act."
2011.11-5683,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1066.349,1067.282,"Well, no, you are begging the question."
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1087.18,1095.618,"But that would mean, Justice Scalia, that the guidelines would not be conformed to applicable law for the defendants who are sentenced after the FSA."
2011.11-5683,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1108.426,1110.461,So why -- why 90 days?
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1126.805,1144.266,"Well, it was a little bit more complex than that, because what -- what the FSA did was two things: it lowered of the mandatory minimums by increasing the crack thresholds, and it targeted role in the offense of the defendant for increased sentencing and mitigating factors for decreased sentencing."
2011.11-5683,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1166.18,1168.648,"Yes, but how -- how many are we talking about?"
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1175.587,1177.32,Not necessarily.
2011.11-5683,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1177.32,1179.272,--I know not necessarily.
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1182.224,1187.295,"Well, roughly speaking, there has been historically been about 5,000 crack offenders a year."
2011.11-5683,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1189.045,1198.567,"And how -- how long historically, roughly, if you know, does it take from the time the person's caught till the time he's sentenced, when he pleads guilty?"
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1198.567,1207.875,"--We put in the brief the figures from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which indicate that the median figure is around 11 months, but--"
2011.11-5683,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1207.875,1208.609,11 months?
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1208.609,1209.042,--Yes.
2011.11-5683,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1209.042,1212.327,But how many of -- you see what I'm trying to get at.
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1241.596,1243.679,"I'm reluctant to guess, Justice Breyer."
2011.11-5683,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1243.679,1243.962,About?
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1249.15,1250.05,"Well, let me put it this way, Justice Breyer--"
2011.11-5683,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1250.05,1250.452,All right--
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1250.452,1263.342,"--I think that there -- there will probably be thousands of crack defendants who will be sentenced under the old mandatory minimums that Congress repealed because they were perceived as being racially disparate and unfair, and--"
2011.11-5683,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1263.342,1265.109,"--Now, isn't it obviously what I'm trying to get at?"
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1265.109,1265.625,--Well--
2011.11-5683,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1265.625,1266.509,You -- you see what I'm trying to get at?
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1266.942,1269.077,--I don't think that Congress balanced numerically--
2011.11-5683,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1269.077,1279.75,"--No, no, but you are saying it would be absurd to think that this section 8 has to do only with prior -- the pre-enactment offenses."
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1290.657,1294.359,"--I'm not making an absurdity argument, Justice Breyer."
2011.11-5683,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1298.33,1298.58,Yes.

2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1485.883,1496.523,"Well, first of all Justice Alito, what that bill would have done is postpone the effective date for 180 days so that there could be synchronicity between the guidelines and the new mandatory minimums."

2011.11-5683,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1594.132,1595.082,Congress didn't insert that--
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1595.082,1595.734,It was--
2011.11-5683,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1595.734,1596.834,--when it made this amendment.
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1604.121,1624.951,"--No, I'm saying that the background principle that our legislators are familiar with the law surely applies to sentencing law; and Congress understood that once the new guidelines were in effect, which it wanted to happen as soon as practicable, they would be applied to all defendants in the system based on time of -- of sentencing, not time of offense."
2011.11-5683,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1654.487,1672.801,"Mr. Dreeben, almost any law that repeals a prior penalty is doing so because the legislature determines that that prior penalty is unjust in some way, because why do you eliminate a penalty unless you think it is necessary to do so and that it is injust or unjust in some way?"

2011.11-5683,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1689.661,1689.894,Certainly.
2011.11-5683,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1689.894,1700.034,"Justice Sotomayor, what's unique about this context is that there's a confluence between the way that the guidelines treated crack and the way that the statutes treated crack."
2011.11-5683,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1731.589,1732.755,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.11-5683,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1737.243,1744.48,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-5683,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1757.455,1793.061,"Mr. Estrada, what's so difficult for a legal doctrine to say that when Congress has made a finding that a law has a discriminatory impact -- because I always thought that when discrimination was at issue, that we should do as speedy a remedy as we could, because it is one of the most fundamental tenets of our Constitution, as has been repeatedly emphasized in case after case, that our laws should be -- should be enforced in a race-neutral way."
2011.11-5683,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1805.638,1814.409,--Because I think it would be wrong to assume that the passage of the Act reflects Congress's concession of intentional discrimination.

2011.11-5683,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1832.788,1833.671,Absolutely.
2011.11-5683,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1833.671,1839.275,I don't think there is any other law that had as much conversation about its racial implications than this one.

2011.11-5683,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1899.361,1900.08,"Well, but this--"
2011.11-5683,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1900.08,1922.994,"Mr. Estrada, I mean, that's true, that it took Congress a long time to decide to do this, and the question is, once having decided to do this, what did it decide to do; and whether it would make sense, once having decided to do this, to have the guidelines be the new guidelines, but the mandatory minimums be the old mandatory minimums."
2011.11-5683,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1945.342,1946.877,No.
2011.11-5683,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1976.563,1983.634,But you have to draw a line someplace and that's inevitable that some people are going to fall on one side.

2011.11-5683,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2098.925,2107.365,"But Congress did say: Sentencing Commission, you conform your new guidelines to applicable law."
2011.11-5683,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2133.349,2144.49,"--Justice Ginsburg, I am prepared to admit for purposes of this case, and I think it's probably the right answer, that Congress intended that the guidelines had to line up with the penalties of the FSA."

2011.11-5683,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2221.99,2222.973,--A--
2011.11-5683,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2222.973,2224.358,Or changed the guide--
2011.11-5683,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2224.358,2225.325,--Changed some of them.
2011.11-5683,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2225.325,2227.144,"--Changed it, Lowered the amounts."
2011.11-5683,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2227.144,2230.596,"Some of them may drop from 10 to 5, for example, as one of the -- as one of the particulars."
2011.11-5683,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2230.596,2231.212,Exactly.
2011.11-5683,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2253.878,2255.678,That's correct on both counts.
2011.11-5683,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2255.678,2257.997,So it would have benefited these defendants no matter what.

2011.11-5683,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2276.558,2277.41,--But look.
2011.11-5683,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2343.102,2344.502,But that begs the question--
2011.11-5683,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2344.502,2362.647,"But the problem I started with, with you, which is if we know that this new Congress has already determined that those -- that mandatory minimum is discriminatory in the way that it had been constructed, what would be the purpose of delaying implementation?"
2011.11-5683,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2362.647,2377.424,"If Congress had made that finding, Justice Sotomayor, I would fully expect them as a citizen to cut the sentences of everybody who is already serving the sentence irrespective of finality."

2011.11-5683,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2434.779,2435.712,--Right.

2011.11-5683,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2472.237,2473.287,Suppose you are wrong about that.
2011.11-5683,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2481.01,2484.128,I think it would be a radical understanding.
2011.11-5683,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2484.128,2484.495,No.
2011.11-5683,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2496.536,2497.703,Justice Breyer--

2011.11-5683,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2530.991,2531.526,--Okay.
2011.11-5683,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2531.526,2533.843,"Now, do we have any analogies?"

2011.11-5683,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2673.468,2673.635,Okay.

2011.11-5683,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2830.97,2835.407,"So that uniformity doesn't quite answer it, unless I misunderstood."

2011.11-5683,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3197.543,3201.894,"--For -- for purposes of the mandatory minimum, but not for the sentences in between."
2011.11-5683,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3201.894,3212.952,But defendant -- I don't know that I know of one guideline scheme that changes whatever Congress has statutorily required.
2011.11-5683,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3212.952,3227.129,"I just gave you two examples: The LSD guideline that was at issue in Neal and the crack guideline that was not at issue, but was discussed in connection with the statutory interpretation in -- in DePierre."
2011.11-5683,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3247.023,3247.708,"No, no."
2011.11-5683,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3261.45,3261.716,--Except for?
2011.11-5683,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3262.218,3280.847,"Everyone but the cliffhangers, because, as Justice Breyer pointed out, those people who were subject to the old guideline at a higher rate above the minimum now have the benefit of a lower rate, and so they're going to get sentenced to a lower amount because they are not bound by the mandatory minimum."
2011.11-5683,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3280.847,3284.731,"But there are -- there are two alternative worlds under the FSA, Justice Sotomayor."
2011.11-5683,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3367.452,3387.133,"Well, along those lines, could I -- could I ask you this question, which is intended to explore the -- the issue whether the argument about bringing the guidelines into consistency with applicable law doesn't assume the -- the answer that is -- that one attempts to get from it."
2011.11-5683,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3420.72,3421.539,--Correct.
2011.11-5683,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3463.481,3465.516,"But could I understand what you are saying, Mr. Estrada?"
2011.11-5683,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3484.495,3505.474,"Justice Kagan, it is not happening in that manner, because the guidelines, every book of the guidelines, I believe since 1987, which is the first one, has had, like, 5G1.1, which says these are the guidelines, but 5G tells you if a mandatory minimum applies, for whatever reason, you apply that and that becomes the mandatory sentence."
2011.11-5683,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3555.674,3556.943,"Thank you, Mr. Estrada."
2011.11-5683,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3556.943,3557.676,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.11-5683,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3557.676,3559.276,"Mr. Eberhardt, you have 3 minutes."
2011.11-5683,3,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,3559.276,3563.513,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-5683,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3600.103,3606.524,"Of course, you could say that about any statute that runs afoul of -- of section 109."
2011.11-5683,3,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,3626.27,3636.043,"It can be, but, as Justice Sotomayor recognizes, there has never been a situation such as this basically in the history of criminal law and criminal law sentencing in our--"
2011.11-5683,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3636.043,3637.745,I'd imagine you would find disagreement with that.
2011.11-5683,3,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,3655.856,3659.926,"--Congress ultimately felt that they did, yes."
2011.11-5683,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3659.926,3664.295,And did they change those non-mandatory part when they wrote new ones?
2011.11-5683,3,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,3664.295,3669.032,The guidelines changed in different respects with regard to different amounts.
2011.11-5683,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3670.032,3670.449,I'll look it up.
2011.11-5683,3,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,3670.782,3701.587,"--I suggest the Court -- we admit that 109 has to be considered in the case, but I think to find what was really meant by Congress, after the Court looks to section 109, the Court does have to look to the 3553 sentence, or 3553 section, that makes it very plainly clear, ever since the Sentencing Reform Act, that the date of sentencing clearly is the important date, as opposed to the date of the commission of the crime."
2011.11-5683,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3701.587,3709.074,"All those arguments have nothing to do with the provision about the Sentencing Commission is supposed to act quickly or any of that, right?"
2011.11-5683,3,41267,stephen_e_eberhardt,,3721.315,3731.272,"But it goes hand-in-hand with the mandate from the Sentencing Commission to put the new guidelines in place as soon as practical, as well as provisions of section 10."
2011.11-5683,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3733.006,3733.808,"Thank you, Mr. Eberhardt."
