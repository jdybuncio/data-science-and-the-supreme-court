1964.98,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,1.372,Very well.
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,31.982,35.774,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.98,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,207.702,221.619,"Mr. Friedman, did it mean it is something underlying and that is a sense of the Congress that the Board in decision-making prior to that time is following a practice which the Congress did not approved?"
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,221.619,236.184,"I -- I think that's right Mr. Justice and as I will develop, we think the legislative history shows that despite this limitation nevertheless the Congress did recognized that the Board could select small units if they were appropriate under the standard criteria."
1964.98,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,473.33,478.845,We'll recess.
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,480.967,483.955,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,520.903,526.331,There are eight district offices in the State of Rhode Island?
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,526.331,530.883,Eight district offices plus one or two what are known as the detachable offices.
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,537.908,543.14,And Rhode Island is a pretty small state of (Voice Overlap)
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,543.14,545.496,"Geographically, yes sir."
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,545.496,548.75,How -- how far a product of Woon -- this is Woonsocket?
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,548.75,552.949,"This is Woonsocket, and the next closest office is at Pawtucket 12 miles away."
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,552.949,553.785,12 miles away.
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,553.785,566.795,And if I may -- may say right here and now Mr. Justice Stewart that as we see this case the basic issue isn't where the all eight of the offices in Rhode Island could've been combined into an appropriate unit.
1964.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,577.392,582.062,But what precisely reflected in what the factory is determined.
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,582.062,583.928,"Yes, our --"
1964.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,583.928,586.07,Including only one office.
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,586.07,586.968,That -- that is correct --
1964.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,586.968,588.794,And the next office is 12 miles away?
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,588.794,594.371,Is 12 miles away but if I may put it -- if -- if I may refine still further Mr. Justice.
1964.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,612.703,615.328,"Well, that maybe thought if you only have Rhode Island to look at."
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,619.159,621.575,I'm -- I'm sorry I don't understand your question.
1964.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,621.575,628.637,"Well, you've got to look at what the Board did in this case, don't you, in connection with what is then another case?"
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,628.637,629.633,"Well, yes Mr. Justice and --"
1964.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,629.633,631.745,"Because they do it in the first time, this place has ever come out?"
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,631.745,643.736,"No, and -- and as I shall attempt to show what we think what the Board has done and the Board's decisions in all of these cases are fully consistent with a rationale that does not give controlling effect to the extent of union organization."
1964.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,643.736,647.427,You mean any particular case is always consistent with the (Voice Overlap)
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,647.427,648.0,"Well, I --"
1964.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,648.0,652.454,"-- a lot of them was the -- there was a lot of factors, but how about the whole bunch of cases together?"
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,652.454,656.628,"Well, we think we have to look at each particular case because what the Board does is --"
1964.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,656.628,658.027,All by itself?
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,658.027,671.135,"Well, you certainly can see what the Board has done in other cases but I suggest Mr. Justice that everyone of these cases is fully justifiable, on a rationale that does not show that the Board has again controlling wide to the extent of all the cases."
1964.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,671.135,675.854,What about all of the cases together though you still haven't answer my question?
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,675.854,681.877,"Well, I -- I think you -- you have to look -- you can't look at all the cases together in other words because --"
1964.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,681.877,686.388,"Yes, but you can look at every case on its own merit in connection with all of the other cases (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,686.388,686.778,"Yes, but --"
1964.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,686.778,690.019,-- and you have to consider the other cases when you are considering one case.
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,690.019,691.438,"Yes, we -- we have no quarrel."
1964.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,695.113,696.008,-- I'm glad you are.
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,696.008,698.102,That they all consistent we think.
1964.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,702.769,708.329,But you don't want us to stop at looking at the result in each of the other cases?
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,708.329,708.584,"Well, we -- we have no --"
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,708.584,710.159,There's no issue with the other cases.
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,722.425,722.738,"Well, I've missed in it."
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,722.738,725.031,Because in that organization --
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,725.031,725.254,Well --
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,725.254,727.319,In the (Inaudible) rather large in each of the other states.
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,727.319,734.617,"The extent of an organization did play a part and we think the statute does not, but let me -- if I may Mr. Justice --"
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,734.617,742.285,"And then while you're doing it give us one of these cases, this other cases where you've ever bearing in this organization --"
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,742.285,743.27,"Well, in every --"
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,743.27,745.164,In the narrower or broader case?
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,745.164,752.257,In everyone of these cases the unit which the Board selected was the unit for which the union petition.
1964.98,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,765.281,783.696,"Mr. Friedman, before you you've given as to does -- does the only development of the facts of this case the footnote on page 15 (a) of the record, footnote 2, is that all that the Board said about the particular facts and certain standard in this case?"
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,783.696,787.232,"Yes, that's all it said but that they -- they referred --"
1964.98,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,787.232,788.267,First to another case --
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,788.267,791.683,To the Metropolitan Life Insurance case which is a Wilmington case.
1964.98,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1288.447,1302.281,"Well, Mr. Friedman, do I remember correctly the fact in recordings the Board used to find the single district offices inappropriate but would come to the sustain them on the extent of organization doctrine?"
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1302.281,1316.134,"Well, I -- I think back in the 40's the Board did not find a single district inappropriate, it didn't have to get that far because as the statute was then being interpreted it looked only to the extent of organization."
1964.98,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1316.134,1317.929,Then there was this change?
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1317.929,1349.112,Then in 1944 in another case involving the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company the Board said that it was changing its rule so that organization of insurance companies was proceeding very nicely and rapidly toward a statewide basis and in these circumstances the Board concluded that it would not deny employees of insurance companies the effectuation of their rights under the statute to make them wait until there have been organization on a statewide basis.
1964.98,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1363.326,1363.94,61 (Voice Overlap)?
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1363.94,1365.248,Until 61 and then it shifted.
1964.98,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1373.3,1380.006,"Now, recently has the Board ever turn the union down on this unit that is organized in the insurance bill?"
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1380.006,1385.634,"No, it has not Mr. Justice and I -- let me explain why that has been."
1964.98,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1427.596,1438.565,"What was the basis for that case which said that the district office in the City of Iowa, and the office as far as North Dakota and Sioux Fall, South Dakota?"
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1438.565,1441.086,"Well, those are two detached offices."
1964.98,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1454.12,1455.114,As an administrative (Voice Overlap)
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1455.114,1456.041,As in administrative (Voice Overlap)
1964.98,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1456.041,1457.161,Sort of a satellite?
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1457.161,1457.538,That's right.
1964.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1466.54,1472.106,Does the district offices -- where we have any autonomy in labor matters?
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1472.106,1475.571,"No, it -- it has -- it has no autonomy in labor matters."
1964.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1487.215,1493.605,(Voice Overlap) whether the unit was statewide for the district or --?
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1493.605,1494.389,That's correct.
1964.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1507.576,1508.203,That's right.
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1508.203,1508.967,Because they say that the adminis --
1964.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1508.967,1510.087,It has to be companywide.
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1513.422,1520.109,"Companywide or at least the territorial, the big territorial district because the say that's the administrative unit by which the company has."
1964.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1520.109,1521.726,The regions or whatever they are?
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1521.726,1528.063,"The region, in this case five states that that would -- that would seem to be under their theory the minimum size of the unit."
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1652.34,1661.163,"Well, the real question is whether or not the Board let the extent of organization be the determining factor, the controlling factor --"
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1661.163,1674.282,In the Board's -- in the Board's decision and as the Third Circuit has pointed out Mr. Justice Stewart in upholding the Board's decision in the Wilmington case the fact that this was the controlling consideration in the union's decision.
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1679.765,1680.846,And that is the question?
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1680.846,1681.796,That is the question.
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1697.507,1708.275,"Well Mr. Friedman, you say the Board has decided that this is -- that the single offices inherently, inherently inappropriate unit."
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1714.704,1716.471,"Well, they -- Mr. Justice the Board --"
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1716.471,1717.836,"It didn't in this case, did they?"
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1717.836,1721.02,They didn't in this case but they did in the Wilmington case.
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1721.02,1734.821,"Well, that means -- that means that just inherently this way no matter what state it's located in, no matter what district office that's in -- that is involved with a particular case just inherently a (Voice Overlap)"
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1734.821,1735.122,"Well, not -- it's not an (Voice Overlap)"
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1735.122,1736.953,So it's a big unit?
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1736.953,1740.604,"Perhaps, inherently is an unfortunate word in this context to --"
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1740.604,1771.975,"Oh, If it -- if it isn't an adequate word then I would think that in any particular case especially in view of the series of cases that Board has had that -- that the Board ought to explain why the difference between this case in some other case where a multimember multidistrict unit has been -- has been proved or why in this case the district office 12 miles away shouldn't be included in the unit?"
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1771.975,1772.901,"Well, --"
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1772.901,1775.532,"Other than that, I mean it inherently doesn't carry that kind of phrase."
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1775.532,1782.339,"Well, if -- if I may answer, I -- I think that three part to your question Mr. Justice may I -- I may try to answer it separately."
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1810.933,1814.583,I think if you -- do you think that means everywhere now?
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1814.583,1815.249,That's right.
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1836.48,1862.073,"Well, tell me that if a -- say that you've got a -- you've got a case where this -- they -- they go through this routine and say that a single office, a single district office is the appropriate units inherently this way and in the next case I guess the unions organized two offices and so they say well so as a -- so was our -- the two district units, the -- that's appropriate too."
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1865.542,1867.522,"Well, no Mr. Justice."
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1867.783,1870.304,"Well, different names of the district offices --"
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1870.304,1870.454,The two dist --
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1870.454,1871.3,There are different states --
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1871.3,1877.04,The two districts would have to have something more than the fact that the union had organized them.
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1877.31,1880.643,"Did anyone ever explained what that is, other than inherently?"
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1880.643,1882.436,"Yes, it's a geographic coherence."
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1886.144,1890.117,I think inherent is coherent?
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1890.117,1901.028,"Let's assume there are ten offices in the District of Columbia, they are scattered all around and the union first organizes a single district office in the upper northwest."
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1914.35,1917.576,"Even though in Chicago, you had them 127 miles apart."
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1917.576,1920.184,"Well, it weren't quite that far but again Mr. Justice they were about 30 --"
1964.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1920.184,1920.892,"Well, how far was it?"
1964.98,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1920.892,1927.122,-- 33 miles from the upper -- from the suburbs to the center of town.
1964.98,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1939.564,1940.573,Mr. Zorn.
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,1940.573,1945.334,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2099.475,2104.201,But I suppose you could win all your other cases and lose this one --
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,2104.201,2104.944,I don't think so.
1964.98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2104.944,2106.357,Even on your argument?
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,2106.357,2107.917,I don't think so because I will come in a moment --
1964.98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2107.917,2110.036,"Well, there are some units that's --"
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,2110.036,2110.208,Yes.
1964.98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2110.208,2112.684,There are some units that appropriated.
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,2112.684,2116.672,"May I come to that in a moment, because this administrative entity --"
1964.98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2116.672,2118.159,Because that's this case?
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,2118.159,2121.79,"That's this case but this case has another factor in it, Your Honor."
1964.98,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2405.85,2417.635,"Well, Mr. Zorn you're going to tell us as I take that in the course of your argument as to what in your view accepting the Board to establish criterion would be the appropriate unit?"
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,2417.635,2419.967,I'll be glad to answer that question now Mr. Justice Goldberg --
1964.98,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2419.967,2421.794,Do you think that every time that is --
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,2421.794,2425.926,Our -- our problem here of course is not that problem.
1964.98,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2478.753,2484.378,"But state -- but state regulation has nothing to do with industrial relations in this area, does it?"
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,2484.378,2514.052,"Well, if the Board had adopted a criterion of the method of regulation of an industry it might have been a fair criterion, I don't know but beyond that Mr. Justice Goldberg I think another criteria in which it might well apply to the state unit and applies in this case is that there has been both in this industry and there has been in this company successful history of collective bargaining on a state by state basis and history of bargaining as you well know of course is a factor of some importance."
1964.98,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2544.104,2550.7,What is the territorial unit that in the Metropolitan situation would deem appropriate?
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,2550.7,2560.405,It would -- that the territory of unit which would apply in this particular case in New England would be the territory which includes all of the states in New England.
1964.98,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2560.405,2563.389,How many officers?
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,2563.389,2589.015,"I -- without looking at the record I can't tell you how many officers, but as a matter of fact Your Honor this Board didn't have to meet the company's contention in this case because in all the other -- in many of the other cases it was applying a Metropolitan area concept based on this geographic appearance theory and all of the officers in Rhode Island were located within the Metropolitan Providence area."
1964.98,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2633.234,2647.273,Now supposed (Inaudible)?
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,2647.273,2654.924,"It never has until this started with the Quaker City case in 1961, I think December 1961."
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3087.08,3093.248,You came up to the factor to the last minute and you only discussed it in about a minute.
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3101.101,3103.468,I understand the statute --
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3103.468,3104.537,To say?
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3104.537,3123.438,"To say that in determining any unit, the Board shall not give, I'm paraphrasing Your Honor, but I think this is appropriate, shall not give the union's extent organization or the extent to which the employees have been organized controlling weight in any unit determinations."
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3123.438,3129.65,Suppose it gives it some weight then what is the standard (Voice Overlap) like to be?
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3162.654,3165.942,"It is 95, yes --"
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3165.942,3183.81,-- decide in each case in all of it this is not this -- the supreme criterion which they have to follow in order to assure its employees the fullest freedom in exercising rights guaranteed by the Act.
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3186.697,3189.162,"No, the supreme test on this case, if I may disagree --"
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3189.162,3195.11,I'm talking about isn't that the supreme test that Congress set out so far as the Board's power within --
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3195.11,3197.484,"The effectuation of self organization, yes."
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3197.484,3204.456,"To assure to employees the fullest freedom in exercising their rights, all the rights guaranteed by the Act?"
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3204.456,3205.689,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Black."
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3205.689,3207.027,In effect to the employee?
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3207.027,3207.806,That's correct sir.
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3207.806,3218.417,"Well, how can they make a definite decision and say that we always going to consider this is it without regard to -- to anything else?"
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3223.439,3234.114,"Well, but that general purpose was limited by the enactment of 9 (c) (5) to stop the Board from doing (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3234.114,3244.493,What 9 (c) (5) says in determining whether the union is appropriate for the purposes specified the extent to which the employees have organized shall not be controlling.
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3244.493,3245.53,"That's clear, I think."
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3245.53,3246.254,That's right?
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3246.254,3246.93,That's clearly right.
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3246.93,3249.2,But does that say it shall not be given any weight?
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3249.2,3251.067,"No, I have not made that argument."
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3251.067,3262.544,"It must be given weight then after all how you ever going to get one -- any one case, I have listen to you carefully because I -- I might not have at all hear later in this case."
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3313.086,3315.561,I'm sorry I've failed but may I summarize it to answer your question?
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3315.561,3316.803,Yes.
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3338.18,3338.843,May I try?
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3338.843,3342.081,Yes.
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3342.081,3347.686,We have not said that the extent of organization is entitled to no weight whatsoever.
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3357.729,3359.713,You say as I understand if you permit?
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3359.713,3360.021,Yes sir.
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3360.021,3364.964,You said that the Board didn't say that and they never would say that (Voice Overlap) I agree with you for that.
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3372.162,3373.686,And the proof consists of two separate bases.
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3373.686,3376.4,It has to be solely on that?
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3376.4,3380.571,But the proof consists of two pieces and we meet the Government ahead on.
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3391.061,3391.873,Why should it?
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3391.873,3397.308,"This is what this Court has decided many times, Your Honor, unless they want to change, its fine."
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3400.485,3401.006,In another case?
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3401.006,3407.84,-- makes the decision shall be tested on the basis of the reasons asserted by the agency.
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3464.166,3494.823,"Now, what bothers me about is maybe it's altogether wrong that I was looking to it, when you say the Board having established the criteria is that to stay right within it but what bothers me about that is it is very much like this broad power that's given to them, it' is very much like the power of a jury to decide in some nebulous and it is nebulous, broad standards like what's good for the person or what was negative."
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3502.662,3504.546,"Well, I -- I don't say, don't misunderstand me (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3504.546,3507.735,"-- the Board has the power, I doubt if the Board has the power either."
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3507.735,3533.721,"I don't say sir that the Board has no authority ever to change a policy of a rule but I do say that with the existence of Section 9 (c) (5) if it when it does that, that that change of policy should be carefully scrutinized to determine what its purpose was and I say further that in this case, the Board has found what it has said in this case and that is that mistakenly or otherwise."
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3538.911,3543.003,I fully understand your argument (Voice Overlap) if it's shown --
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3543.003,3543.704,Yes sir.
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3543.704,3554.472,It if shown that they did you had controlling consideration under this which you said there should not have violated the law and we should say so.
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3572.446,3587.494,"You can disregard my comment entirely, Mr. Justice Black, and I think you would come out with the same result because all you need to do is look at the visible results of what the Board has done in these cases to arrive at your own conclusion of what it did."
1964.98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3587.797,3618.396,"Mr. Zorn I supposed that (Voice Overlap) and if your position is that if you did have a case, two cases, which had absolutely similar circumstances other than the extent of organization that the Board couldn't come out with different results with the two -- in the two circumstances which means -- let's assume that there were two district offices in the north end of Rhode Island and two district offices in the south end."
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3664.479,3665.4,"No, I would not."
1964.98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3665.4,3668.661,"Well then, you would say that Board could come out with different results in those positions?"
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3668.661,3680.774,"I would -- I would answer you two ways, I would say first of all, you would first have to determine because you see I haven't made this argument here because I think it's unnecessary."
1964.98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3714.701,3738.848,"Well, the trouble is that the Board where there's great mistake, but in other cases or not does not deal -- it has not dealt with the case as a single office that it's concluded to single office and it's an appropriate unit and that -- and apparently it intends to hold that and whatever you might say about the other cases what about this one?"
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3738.848,3738.956,"Well, I'd say --"
1964.98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3738.956,3739.85,How about this one what if it says that --
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3739.85,3741.442,Yes.
1964.98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3741.442,3745.206,-- and it says I think these are -- this is an appropriate unit.
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3745.206,3766.035,"No, but I say further that there was in this case a request by the company for inclusion of the other seven offices in Metropolitan Providence and I say that since that was rejected you can't decide this case alone on whether this administrative entity inherent theory is a proper test or not."
1964.98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3768.506,3772.114,That the citywide base -- that the statewide basis isn't good?
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3772.114,3783.4,Whether the Board was consistent and rejecting offices in the Metropolitan area of Providence much closer to get than offices was taken by in another city.
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3785.363,3809.684,(Inaudible) but it doesn't seems to -- Congress doesn't seems to authorize the Board to consider this case on the basis of what's best for the company but only on issuing an order which assures the employees to call this freedom.
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3812.764,3815.458,You're entirely right Mr. Justice Black in thinking that (Voice Overlap) --
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3815.458,3816.732,It's rather on unusual.
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3816.732,3820.972,-- of the organization of employees is one of the basic policies they had but that we don't argue.
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3820.972,3825.45,But as far as the assurance to the employees not to the company?
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3825.45,3839.317,"Well, the Act is not -- but the Board has frequently over the years following the statutory purpose, when it has found a company request to be proper and the union request to be improper granted a company (Voice Overlap)."
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3839.317,3840.844,"Well, I think this is (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3840.844,3844.579,"It should be -- it's that's their way to apply, they should apply it seems to me."
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3844.579,3846.529,But it can in any basis.
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3847.792,3848.578,Of course it can and that has to be --
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3848.578,3854.08,But it can base it on what's for them is convenient to the company rather than what's best to assure their employees for them not to strike?
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3854.08,3858.208,It's not really -- not really a matter of convenience Mr. Justice Black.
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3876.379,3883.574,"But the test of the statute is, the only test what's best for the employees in aiding them to organize."
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3883.574,3885.014,Not quite because on test statute --
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3885.014,3886.092,What I'm trying to get to say and what Voice Overlap).
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3886.092,3892.352,The test of the statute is a further test and that is what will best effectuate collective bargaining.
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3892.352,3898.063,"Well what if it say, where does it make the test with reference to this, maybe it does, I'm not (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3898.063,3899.452,"It does, Your Honor."
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3899.452,3900.225,Does that make it --
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3900.225,3919.075,That is quite another factor and what the Congress was interested when this Act was passed was in not merely in giving employees freedom of organization and collective bargaining but it was also interested in preserving industrial piece in eliminating industrial strike.
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3919.075,3926.653,I agree to that but I'm talking about with reference to this particular provision which is especially written.
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3936.92,3937.328,What do you mean?
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3937.328,3949.67,"I'm not talking about the general purpose of the Act, I'm -- by familiarity with it is why I was surprise to find that it is written this way when on -- when we inspect."
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3949.67,3966.559,"Well, it does have in it when I thought it had obviously and that is that the assurance of full freedom is also coupled with the fact that these rights a full freedom are granted for the purposes of collective bargaining."
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3966.559,3966.733,Okay.
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,3966.733,3980.695,"And the Board in every case makes a finding that whatever unit it decides is appropriate for collective bargaining and my only thought on your question is simply this, that the Board has a right and a duty."
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4002.306,4005.138,"You read section, the section this way?"
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,4005.138,4012.125,I not only read the section this way but I read -- in over the years I have made many -- many of the decisions and that's what the Court has said.
1964.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4012.125,4013.751,All with reference to this section?
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,4013.751,4014.753,Yes.
1964.98,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4030.472,4037.38,The Board doesn't criticize the evidence (Inaudible) are going to determine.
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,4065.802,4066.632,Right.
1964.98,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4066.632,4070.074,And that's carried on to purposes that they have set.
1964.98,1,18185,burton_a_zorn,,4115.689,4121.734,You -- you put that so much better than I did and that was the basis of the decision below as well.
