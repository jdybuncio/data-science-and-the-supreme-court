1972.71-692,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,36.33,"We'll hear arguments next in number 71-692, Illinois against Somerville."
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,39.58,44.128,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-692,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,156.743,159.769,Let me back up now to the day of the trial.
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,179.063,192.311,"Yes Your Honor, under Illinois law no offense was ever charged, the defendant have never was placed in jeopardy, and the state was free to resubmit the matter to any grand jury."
1972.71-692,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,192.311,203.366,"How is he more in jeopardy after the jury is picked under that kind of an indictment, the defective indictment, than he was before?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,203.366,231.646,"I don't believe he is in any more jeopardy, dependent upon whether the court attaches emphasis to the cause of the attachment, but in terms of the double jeopardy principles, I understand that he is no more in jeopardy after the selection of the jury than he has before under these circumstances."
1972.71-692,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,231.646,237.852,And he was in no jeopardy before under the defective indictment?
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,237.852,266.212,"He was in no jeopardy and under the traditional and the classic rule, he was in no jeopardy afterwards, bearing in mind that the classic rule for attaching a jeopardy is only when a defendant is placed on trial before a jury or a judge, in the event of a bench trial, on a regularly charged indictment."
1972.71-692,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,291.274,297.583,"Well, are you seeking the ruling here that's based on the jurisdictional nature of the indictment?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,297.583,299.095,"No, Your Honor."
1972.71-692,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,359.34,366.464,"The trial had been going on for three days and the defect was discovered, your position would be the same?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,366.464,388.543,"Our position would be the same, insofar as the manifest necessity doctrine, that is that the Court which still have to have declared the mistrial, then the question may then arise as to whether or not on some other theory, such as an estoppel theory, the state should be allowed to re-prosecute them."
1972.71-692,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,438.701,459.092,"If Illinois, hereafter, simply lets the trial go forward and finish, and leaves it up to the defendant to raise the jurisdictional question, then what you have lost is simply the waste of time, just waste of some time and effort?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,459.092,465.288,"Well, not entirely Your Honor because Illinois --"
1972.71-692,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,465.288,476.559,"Well, really if he was convicted in that trail and then he appealed, and the case was reversed there could be new trial?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,476.559,478.231,That's correct Your Honor.
1972.71-692,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,478.231,481.784,"But if he was acquitted, you could not?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,481.784,509.552,"You could not but we -- the acquittal, I think, interjects a different element into the case, and that goes back to the -- I think, the inception of the rule, which is the principle of autrefois acquit of -- what we consider here is the fact that all that the law is concerned about, or concerned with, as a resolution of the issues of the case, the merits of the case."
1972.71-692,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,523.647,526.798,"Exactly right, exactly right, so you couldn't (Inaudible)?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,526.798,529.812,"No Your Honor, and I think that's better."
1972.71-692,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,529.812,544.782,"So you are really arguing here whether or not the state should -- whether the state should be permitted to terminate the trial and not waste its time when a sufficiently, serious defect of the proceedings arises which would almost guarantee reversal?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,544.782,545.96,That's correct Your Honor.
1972.71-692,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,566.799,572.005,"Whatever box the State found itself in, it created it itself?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,572.005,575.375,There is no question that the error is attributable to the prosecuting --
1972.71-692,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,575.375,596.789,"So you're saying here -- are you -- is your general proposition that where there is a defect in the trial that would guarantee reversal or almost guarantee reversal, arises out of the State's negligence, a mistrial can always be declared?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,596.789,604.633,"Where an irreversible error has occurred, in the course of the proceedings --"
1972.71-692,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,604.633,608.472,And it's the state's negligence -- and it's rooted in the state's negligence.
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,608.472,674.675,"And it's rooted in the state's negligence unless there is something in the record that would indicate that the assertion, unless there were substantial prejudice to the defendant or unless there was some indication in the record that the assertion of the defect was interjected for the purpose of avoiding an acquittal then under those circumstances, we're submitting that that doesn't cast to a double jeopardy because what were -- what would happen in that case if the trial were aborted, it would proceed to a termination and the best that we can hope for is -- well, there could be an acquittal, but under -- in the facts of this case, of course, on the retrial there was a conviction and there is no indication here that the subsequent trial headed was in any way different from the initial proceedings or that the state gained any advantage in the course of the subsequent trial."
1972.71-692,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,705.663,710.711,"But if it's a jurisdictional defect, how can jeopardy attach?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,724.559,728.44,"Well, that's what we assert as the traditional view and we --"
1972.71-692,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,728.44,733.303,But that traditional view doesn't relate to defective indictments.
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,743.123,745.661,No Your Honor.
1972.71-692,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,823.654,832.679,"Well, the logical conclusion of that is that even if he were tried and acquitted, there would be no double jeopardy?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,832.679,834.614,"Well, no I don't think so."
1972.71-692,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,836.054,841.526,"But, you said there was that because -- you said because there is no jurisdiction, there is no jeopardy?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,841.526,855.081,"I say that, but I think I am allowed to make this one qualification and that is, what is the purpose of jurisdiction?"
1972.71-692,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,951.053,960.639,"On that basis then if the judge said to the defendant by the way the indictment is defective, do you want a mistrial?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,967.863,972.521,"No, I don't, because he could not waive that."
1972.71-692,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,981.12,986.246,"What if he said that, you know let's go ahead and he was acquitted?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,986.246,991.066,"He said, let's go ahead and he was acquitted."
1972.71-692,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1024.848,1029.665,"Let me suggest hypothetical, it may seem a little extreme to you."
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1058.292,1059.62,"No, Your Honor."
1972.71-692,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1059.62,1060.824,"A complete malady, is it?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1060.824,1068.117,"Yes sir, it's a complete malady and I think that perhaps this really points out the --"
1972.71-692,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1068.117,1072.207,"Let's take it one step further, an acquittal results?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1072.207,1073.224,That's again it's a --
1972.71-692,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1073.224,1074.074,A malady.
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1074.074,1075.418,-- malady.
1972.71-692,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1088.712,1092.764,"Let's take the next step, could he be tried again by a real judge?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1092.764,1094.755,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-692,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1094.755,1099.76,"Now, here we have a non-indictment instead of a non-judge, haven't we?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1099.76,1102.252,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-692,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1102.252,1109.21,"The distinction is difficult for me to grasp, but perhaps you can enlighten me?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1109.21,1114.856,I am not sure that whether or not there is a distinction.
1972.71-692,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1167.099,1186.662,"And yet, you do concede that in this case, by contrast to your answer to the Chief Justice’s question, respecting a non-judge that in this case, since there had been a verdict of acquittal, the state would have been barred from trying this person again?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1186.662,1188.59,"Yes, but not on --"
1972.71-692,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1188.59,1202.981,"So, there is a difference apparently in the two cases, in the cases between the case of acquittal on a non indictment and a trail by a non judge?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1202.981,1224.67,"I have to concede that I do believe there is a difference because there is -- in that instance, the parties place the repliance on -- reliance on the apparent authority of the court."
1972.71-692,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1264.794,1265.196,In one case it is.
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1265.196,1267.446,There is a distinction between two cases.
1972.71-692,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1267.446,1272.517,A properly constituted court with subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction that --
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1272.517,1273.089,That’s correct.
1972.71-692,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1273.089,1277.405,-- it is a proper constituted court and you know I suppose there is no court at all.
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1277.405,1279.498,That's correct.
1972.71-692,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1279.498,1288.273,"Is your point really like for the lack of a better word, you say there has to be a valid acquittal?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1288.273,1289.945,"No, I don't think so."
1972.71-692,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1290.108,1297.232,But it has to be acquittal of -- it could be an acquittal of a court without jurisdiction you wouldn't buy that?
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1297.232,1297.905,In the one case --
1972.71-692,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1297.905,1300.055,"Doesn't it -- I would say, you could."
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1300.055,1335.818,"If the court has the appearance of judicial authority and if there is a defect in the mechanism by which that court exercises its judicial authority, then in that instance, if the case proceeds to a verdict and there is an acquittal, then the question remains, what is the purpose of the double jeopardy rule."
1972.71-692,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1433.091,1435.685,Can you back up just a minute?
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1441.402,1442.983,That's Illinois law.
1972.71-692,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1461.421,1481.599,"Mr. Gildea, suppose instead of a non judge, a spurious judge, you had a situation where the judge was a genuine judge and you had a valid indictment, but someone just forgot to administer the oath of office to the jurors and he went on with the trial."
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1481.599,1481.826,"Well, there again --"
1972.71-692,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1481.826,1483.679,That was a valid trial?
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1483.679,1488.968,I think so Your Honor and perhaps this is bringing up the point that I should have made before.
1972.71-692,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1556.525,1571.735,"Mr. Gildea, under Illinois law had the trial in the first indictment proceeded and resulted in a judgment of conviction, could that have been collaterally attacked in Illinois courts and the prisoner released?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1571.735,1593.638,"Very definitely, and an illustration of that is the case that we have put in our brief, People ex rel. Ledford versus Brantley was a case for pointing to charge the defendant with burglary and under Illinois law to pass to the offense of burglary you have to show ownership of the property burgled in someone other than the defendant."
1972.71-692,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1635.951,1645.26,"Mr Gildea, in -- just getting back to the distinction you are doing between the non judge and the non indictment cases."
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1682.1,1690.38,"Well, I think first of all, Green, if I am not mistaken involved the case that went to verdict and the defendant was --"
1972.71-692,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1690.38,1700.406,"Well, I thought the hypothetical given you were both, cases that went to verdict about the non judge and the non indictment case?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1700.406,1701.758,I was coming to this Your Honor.
1972.71-692,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1721.214,1725.569,"Well, here you have the same offense, not a different one."
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1732.57,1733.302,Yes Your Honor but I think --
1972.71-692,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1733.302,1736.978,So in the non judge case that the Chief suggested to you?
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1736.978,1760.825,"But the question is, what is understood by the language of the court and I take that the language is to be construed in reference to not only the Green case, but all other double jeopardy cases from at least in this country from United States versus Perez up to the present time and --"
1972.71-692,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1760.825,1765.254,"Well, I thought that was the thrust of the principle and that's what the guarantee means?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1765.254,1793.533,"Well, what I understand by that is, what the principle is aimed at, is the recognition of the fact that the prosecution has within its power and resource, within its resources the power to repetitiously or successively re-prosecute a defendant on a criminal charge."
1972.71-692,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1794.143,1807.034,"And isn't that what in both the non judge and the non indictment cases, the prosecution was involved in both of them. The prosecution represented the state and it repeated the second time."
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1807.034,1807.456,That's true.
1972.71-692,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1807.456,1808.941,The identical prosecution?
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1808.941,1831.393,"But doesn't the same thing happen when a case is -- proceeds to a hung jury and the jury is discharged, doesn't the same thing happen when the case proceeds to a conviction and because of error interjected in the record by the prosecution, the case is reversed and remanded."
1972.71-692,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1835.895,1840.521,"Well, that's because, of course, the convicted defendant has himself taken the appeal."
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1841.408,1841.789,He's taken the appeal.
1972.71-692,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1841.789,1848.68,"That's been the theory, that's been the theory upon which he has not been permitted to assert double jeopardy if he is successful on appeal."
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1850.934,1861.834,"Isn't that putting him in the horns of dilemma though in order to exercise his right to challenge the propriety of his conviction, he has to forgo his double jeopardy, right?"
1972.71-692,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1862.397,1870.03,No he hasn't on is what the court is held that where he is the appellant and the successful and he has no double jeopardy claim.
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1870.03,1871.347,He hasn't but --
1972.71-692,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1871.347,1877.729,"But that's not what we -- not what we held in Downum and Jorn and other cases, where this principle has been involved?"
1972.71-692,0,22326,e_james_gildea,,1877.729,1902.706,"But I think the principle, what the principle is aimed at is the fact -- is the abuse of the prosecutor's authority and what I have envision to be the abuse of the prosecutor's authority is the ability on the part of the prosecutor to attempt to avoid an acquittal by successive prosecutions."
1972.71-692,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1957.717,1961.31,"Very well, Mr. Gildea."
1972.71-692,1,38555,ronald_p_alwin,,1967.798,1970.791,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1972.71-692,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2193.346,2197.516,Do you have the citation on the Ewell case?
1972.71-692,1,38555,ronald_p_alwin,,2197.516,2221.098,"Yes, I do Your Honor."
1972.71-692,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2221.967,2222.462,"Right, thank you."
1972.71-692,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2222.462,2224.118,"I take it, it's not cited in your brief?"
1972.71-692,1,38555,ronald_p_alwin,,2224.118,2235.753,"It's not cited in brief; it is cited by the way in the petition for certiorari filed in the previous case, when this case was up here before."
1972.71-692,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2236.931,2238.579,"Alright, thank you."
1972.71-692,1,38555,ronald_p_alwin,,2238.579,2246.804,The second point I would like to make here was that we have the first point that this defect was not caused by the defendant.
1972.71-692,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2391.363,2403.909,"If there was no jurisdiction in the court at that time under this indictment, do you think there was jeopardy and when that jury was sworn and took its place in the box?"
1972.71-692,1,38555,ronald_p_alwin,,2403.909,2407.054,"Yes Your Honor, in the constitutional sense, I do."
1972.71-692,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2431.921,2434.922,"Really, that's what the Ball case does stand for, doesn't it?"
1972.71-692,1,38555,ronald_p_alwin,,2434.922,2436.563,"I believe so, yes."
1972.71-692,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2544.17,2560.219,"Well, are you saying that if everyone in the proceeding had been careless and not noted this defect, then he might have been in prison for several years?"
1972.71-692,1,38555,ronald_p_alwin,,2560.219,2564.172,"Yes, I think he would have been, he could have been."
1972.71-692,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2730.452,2749.989,"Mr. Alwin, doesn't the Illinois law will carry some safeguards against this type of abuse, if under an invalid indictment, the defendant can, not only get his conviction reversed on appeal also his state doesn't bring it up with the trial, but actually get collaterally released after judgments become final?"
1972.71-692,1,38555,ronald_p_alwin,,2763.463,2766.706,"Well, I think yes, there is Your Honor."
1972.71-692,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2789.367,2793.608,Even though he knows it's subject to a collateral attack?
1972.71-692,1,38555,ronald_p_alwin,,2793.608,2795.335,"Yes, I think so."
1972.71-692,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2813.09,2814.939,"Well, of course, it is."
1972.71-692,1,38555,ronald_p_alwin,,2847.208,2850.139,They certainly are different situations.
1972.71-692,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2870.665,2885.75,"Well, wasn't there an element of potentiality of abuse, if I can call it that on the other side also, your case might be scheduled for trial on Wednesday and on Monday you will see the defect in the indictment."
1972.71-692,1,38555,ronald_p_alwin,,2905.159,2915.303,"Well, if it were to come to the defendant's attention, I would think that he would be estopped from later raising it if he chooses in to go ahead with the trial."
1972.71-692,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2915.303,2926.967,"Under Illinois law, could -- this trial had been suspended and the grand jury return a new indictment?"
1972.71-692,1,38555,ronald_p_alwin,,2935.852,2937.9,I don't believe so Your Honor.
1972.71-692,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2938.922,2942.949,"In other words say, they are impaneled on one indictment and they have to be tried on that or nothing?"
1972.71-692,1,38555,ronald_p_alwin,,2942.949,2948.737,"Yes, that is my understanding."
1972.71-692,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3054.896,3056.161,Thank you Mr. Alwin.
