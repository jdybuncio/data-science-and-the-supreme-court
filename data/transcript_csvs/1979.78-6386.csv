1979.78-6386,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.89,"We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 78-6386, Rummel v. Estelle, the Director of Texas Department of Corrections."
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,23.735,26.976,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-6386,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,111.574,117.891,"Is there any question, Mr. Atlas, about the validity of the any of the three convictions?"
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,117.891,119.374,"No, Your Honor, there is no such question."
1979.78-6386,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,127.827,129.157,So for present purposes --
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,129.157,133.248,"For present purposes, this is the only issue before the Court, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1979.78-6386,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,133.248,137.715,"If these were three bank robbery convictions, would you be here?"
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,137.715,139.161,"No, Your Honor, I would not be here."
1979.78-6386,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,139.161,150.759,So you are casting your entire case on the nature of the offense which the State of Texas through its legislature has declared to be a felony?
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,150.759,151.783,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-6386,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,179.714,183.485,"I take it, too, that -- well, I will put it to you as a question."
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,195.223,200.694,"Your Honor, that is clearly the most difficult analytical problem in this case, and my answer is not a perfect one."
1979.78-6386,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,236.605,242.848,"And if these were street robberies, at the point of a gun, in exactly the same amounts, what would be your position?"
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,242.848,246.743,"Your Honor, my position would be very different and I would not be before this Court."
1979.78-6386,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,274.574,292.959,Where in the Constitution or cases of this Court do you find the distinction between money taken by violence or crimes committed accompanied by violence and perhaps very significant white collar fraud that didn't involve a bit of violence?
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,292.959,296.253,"Your Honor, first let me clarify my point a bit."
1979.78-6386,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,380.062,382.687,How about embezzlement?
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,382.687,387.605,Embezzlement again gives me somewhat more trouble than the normal petty check offense.
1979.78-6386,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,387.605,392.834,"Why should it, you just drew the line, and embezzlement certainly falls on the nonviolent side."
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,392.834,408.428,"Yes, Your Honor, but, Mr. Justice White, embezzlement cases we think generally probably have much more of an indication of professional criminality, and we would argue that if we are dealing with professional criminals, someone who forges three $100,000 checks --"
1979.78-6386,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,408.428,410.361,How about tax evasion?
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,410.361,413.979,"Tax evasion, I think Al Capone is perhaps a perfect example."
1979.78-6386,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,416.651,418.307,What about three times?
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,418.307,419.956,"Three times, absolutely if you could ever find someone."
1979.78-6386,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,419.956,421.074,Absolutely what?
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,421.074,424.435,Absolutely the Court ought not to consider an Eighth Amendment claim under those circumstances.
1979.78-6386,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,424.435,426.771,"Why, it is completely nonviolent?"
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,426.771,440.918,"Yes, Your Honor, but it represents an interest in which the state has a peculiarly strong interest in preserving the integrity of the tax process and we feel it is probably entitled to receive special treatment by the court."
1979.78-6386,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,452.82,468.405,"Well, what about just a compulsive con man who just goes around conning people out of money, with false schemes, especially children and old ladies, there are a lot of those around, you know?"
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,468.405,476.842,"Your Honor, if we were dealing with a statute that mandated a life sentence upon conviction of a sufficient number of offenses to entitle --"
1979.78-6386,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,476.842,478.859,Let's just take three.
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,478.859,493.172,"Yes, Your Honor, I think the state under those circumstances would not be entitled to make the irrebuttable presumption that someone is a lifetime con man and deem him beyond redemption, justifying the mandatory life sentence subject only to the parole board's unfettered discretion."
1979.78-6386,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,493.172,500.788,"Then it turns on the number in effect, if it were seven rather than three, the case should come out differently?"
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,500.788,506.761,"Your Honor, I think if the statute mandated life after seven, I would have a very difficult problem arguing the state's conclusion --"
1979.78-6386,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,506.761,508.525,What about four?
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,508.525,510.837,By far the most difficult line drawing question here.
1979.78-6386,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,513.2,514.501,"Well, you are though."
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,514.501,519.076,"I can only tell this Court that wherever that line is drawn, it ought not be at three."
1979.78-6386,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,519.076,522.648,But there is no question that the line is drawn in your case?
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,522.648,523.616,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1979.78-6386,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,610.788,613.544,Isn't that up to the state to do?
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,613.544,614.27,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-6386,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,614.726,617.511,Maybe Texas will come around to that point of view.
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,617.511,622.3,"Your Honor, 123 years is long enough for Texas to come around to that point of view."
1979.78-6386,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,622.3,625.225,But they have the examples in the other states.
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,633.177,643.405,"Your Honor, the Attorney General's office has provided us with charts that according to the Attorney General's office suggest that Texas is more liberal in its good time credit."
1979.78-6386,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,763.619,779.238,"Do you mean this Court or any other reviewing court should not take judicial notice of the tiny, tiny percentage of life sentences that are in fact served as life sentences?"
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,779.238,790.996,"Your Honor, the Court is entitled to take judicial notice of that matter, but in terms of the weight that the Court ought to give that, we think the weight ought to be practically nil because there is no right to it."
1979.78-6386,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,804.499,814.005,I take it then that you are just suggesting we disregard the Fifth Circuit's judgment as what the likelihood is?
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,814.005,815.883,"Your Honor, I would not suggest that the Court --"
1979.78-6386,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,815.883,831.939,"Well, the Fifth Circuit knows more about local law and practice than we do and decided that the chances were so high that he would get out that we should take it into consideration, and you think if it were 100 percent chance we should."
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,831.939,832.755,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-6386,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,836.359,838.35,"Exactly, but now --"
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,838.35,840.868,-- and I have no difficulty with the Court --
1979.78-6386,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,840.868,843.036,-- you keep emphasizing the discretion.
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,855.168,858.223,"No, Your Honor, it is not true that it is a very narrow realm of discretion."
1979.78-6386,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,858.223,863.006,"Well, the way it operates, it almost always operates in favor of the prisoner."
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,863.006,889.092,"Your Honor, if a governor comes into office who chooses to cut back drastically on the number of paroles granted among those recommended by the parole board, then even though the parole board is exercising what you have characterized, Mr. Justice White, as very narrow discretion, the governor and the parole board itself, if it changes its mind or the members change composition is entitled to exercise complete unlimited discretion."
1979.78-6386,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,911.482,934.965,"Mr. Atlas, there are some states, if I am not mistaken, California is one, where the sentence after conviction for almost any felony is an indeterminate sentence, and how long the convict will actually serve is in the discretion of -- I think in California it is called the adult authority, but the parole board."
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,934.965,937.812,"Yes, Your Honor, but there is an absolute --"
1979.78-6386,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,937.812,939.247,"There are maxima, I suppose."
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,939.247,943.958,"Yes, Your Honor, there are maximum, and at some point the prisoner is entitled to absolute release."
1979.78-6386,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,943.958,946.71,"Well, is that true in every state?"
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,946.71,964.227,"Yes, Your Honor, we have demonstrated in charts, the 204 pages -- my apologies for the length -- that we submitted to this Court, that in every state except the three I mentioned, plus Texas, the discretion, either the judge or jury has discretion in sentencing with an absolute boundary beyond which they cannot go."
1979.78-6386,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,964.227,965.665,"No, no, I'm not talking about the judge or jury."
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,970.264,971.0,After he is incarcerated --
1979.78-6386,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,971.0,976.784,"-- the administration of the parole board or, as is called in California, the adult authority is very great, is it not?"
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,976.784,989.251,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, in every state there is a certain amount of discretion for a certain amount of time, but at some point the prisoner is entitled to absolute release when the offenses are the same type of offenses with which we are dealing in this case."
1979.78-6386,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,996.289,998.539,Will serve the life term.
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,998.539,1000.094,But in cases in every other state --
1979.78-6386,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1000.094,1002.125,Even after a single conviction --
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,1002.125,1002.956,Even after a single conviction --
1979.78-6386,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1002.956,1004.476,-- a felony involving violence he may serve --
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,1004.476,1006.943,"That's correct, Your Honor, absolutely."
1979.78-6386,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1011.137,1016.349,"Well, these are based in the eyes of Texas, were at the time of conviction felonies."
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,1016.349,1017.793,"Yes, Your Honor, no question."
1979.78-6386,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1017.793,1019.372,They were not petty offenses.
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,1019.372,1022.046,"Your Honor, they are petty offenses we feel in a constitutional sense."
1979.78-6386,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1026.948,1037.662,"But didn't you say, I thought you said that if they had been offenses committed at gunpoint they would not be petty even though the amounts were precisely the same as involved here."
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,1037.662,1038.965,"That's right, Your Honor."
1979.78-6386,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1039.752,1042.145,How much does the amount have to do with it?
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,1042.145,1051.653,"The amount has to do with it only to the extent that it demonstrates that we are dealing with the pettiest type of offender, not an organized criminal, not a member of any organized gang."
1979.78-6386,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1057.956,1086.621,"Well, Mr. Atlas, isn't the state entitled to impose a much severer penalty even though the facts are exactly as you state, because its judgment is that after three of these type of offenses the person is one who is simply unable to conform his conduct to social norms in a way -- the basic rationale for a recidivist statute."
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,1086.621,1088.905,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that is absolutely right."
1979.78-6386,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1193.847,1204.45,"Now, you have referred in the brief and to some extent in your argument to the death penalty cases, where the proportionality concept was introduced."
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,1224.74,1226.869,"Mr. Chief Justice Burger, you are absolutely right."
1979.78-6386,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1236.239,1239.821,"You are dealing with one parking ticket or three parking tickets here, are we?"
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,1239.821,1241.821,"Even three parking tickets, Your Honor."
1979.78-6386,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1241.821,1243.798,We are not dealing with them in this case.
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,1243.798,1244.656,"No, Your Honor, absolutely not."
1979.78-6386,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1244.656,1246.622,So we haven't taken that step.
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,1246.622,1250.612,"No, but theoretically they could under the rationale that the state has suggested."
1979.78-6386,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1260.077,1262.077,"The Williams case had to do with proportionality, didn't it?"
1979.78-6386,0,40951,scott_j_atlas,,1262.077,1271.361,"Yes, Your Honor, it did and that was a non-death case, a falsification of government documents, although there was no proof of -- and the statute did not require proof of any fraud."
1979.78-6386,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1293.429,1298.259,Mr. Becker.
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1298.259,1301.778,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-6386,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1486.485,1493.725,"Mr. Becker, you could make exactly the same argument about the Coker case, couldn't you?"
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1493.725,1494.817,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-6386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1520.23,1530.949,"General Becker, the Court of Appeals, as I remember the opinion, started with the assumption that the length of sentence could be sufficient to violate the Eighth Amendment even in a non-death case."
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1534.124,1534.335,Your Honor --
1979.78-6386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1534.335,1537.964,"So your distinction, of course, doesn't stand up."
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1537.964,1542.532,"Well, of course, that is the most difficult question I think that can be asked and I --"
1979.78-6386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1542.532,1546.819,I would be interested in your answer.
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1546.819,1589.125,"The concept of proportionality even in death penalty cases, although it has never been applied in a case, in a criminal case to invalidate a sentence solely because of its length, I can envision in my mind a state legislature so recklessly bent on some course of misconduct and so totally unaware of principles established in modern day civilized society that it might enact some statute so utterly devoid of any rational justification that the sentence upon that statute could be excessive solely for length alone and proportionality for that reason applied."
1979.78-6386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1589.125,1597.923,"On the other side of the coin, in death cases is it appropriate for this Court to consider the probability that the sentence will actually be inflicted?"
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1608.249,1617.218,"Your Honor, I think not or certainly it would bother me to think about that because once again of the irrevocable nature."
1979.78-6386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1617.218,1627.289,"Even if we assume that in 90 percent of the death cases either the governor will commute the sentence or it will be set aside for one reason or another, we should not take that into account in that context?"
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1627.289,1630.149,"Yes, sir, the problem is what happens with the other 10 percent."
1979.78-6386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1631.182,1634.298,What if this man is one of the 10 percent who doesn't get an early parole?
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1634.298,1634.572,All right.
1979.78-6386,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1714.794,1717.075,"General Becker, help me a little."
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1724.645,1726.914,"The sentence that we have given is life, Your Honor."
1979.78-6386,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1726.914,1730.361,"Well, what is the sense of sentencing them to life if he is not going to serve life?"
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1730.361,1739.304,"Your Honor, the Texas approach to this problem has been very different from that of some other states and we thought that we were taking a more modern approach."
1979.78-6386,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1759.835,1763.187,What is so bad about Mr. Rummel?

1979.78-6386,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1779.86,1782.367,There is a total of four.
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1782.367,1784.576,"No, Your Honor, it is not a total of four."
1979.78-6386,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1788.699,1792.812,"Well, are you going to give him time for the crimes he wasn't convicted of?"
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1792.812,1797.945,"Your Honor, we are giving him time because of what he has shown himself to be."
1979.78-6386,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1805.555,1809.141,Why not sentence him to death while you are at it?
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1809.141,1811.269,"Well, Your Honor --"
1979.78-6386,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1811.269,1812.826,That would remove him.
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1812.826,1819.819,"Your Honor, it must be said that the State of Texas is faced with a very difficult problem here."
1979.78-6386,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1831.461,1836.802,But one way would be to give him some training in jail.
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1839.684,1841.116,"Which Texas does, yes, sir."
1979.78-6386,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1841.116,1842.51,To a great extent?
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1842.51,1844.86,To an extent which Texas does.
1979.78-6386,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1844.86,1847.258,"Do you want to use the word ""great""?"
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1847.258,1848.67,As far as the rehabilitation and the programs of the Texas Department of Corrections --
1979.78-6386,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1848.67,1851.228,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1851.228,1854.3,"-- from my own knowledge, they are at least as good as those elsewhere, we think they are."
1979.78-6386,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1854.3,1857.857,Can you get anybody else to join you in that?
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1857.857,1862.515,"I don't know, Your Honor, but there is a case in Houston, the Rouise case, which is litigating that very matter."
1979.78-6386,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1981.881,2006.998,"Mr. Becker, I got the impression from reading both the dissenting opinion and the prevailing opinion of the Court of Appeals en banc and from both you and your opponent's brief that you chose to make ""real world"" arguments when it suited your purpose and kind of abandon them when they didn't."
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2010.691,2010.824,Yes.
1979.78-6386,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2010.824,2021.661,And your argument is in effect a real world one that he doesn't really stand to serve that if you take the percentages into account.
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2021.661,2024.493,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-6386,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2071.137,2075.382,And couldn't all of that have been revoked by now?
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2075.382,2077.705,"Yes, sir, and it may all be revoked tomorrow, yes."
1979.78-6386,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2085.411,2088.878,Is it possible that the decision was influenced by the pendency of this case?
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2088.878,2092.601,"No, Your Honor, it is not."
1979.78-6386,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2166.36,2169.757,Can the resentencing in that situation be for a misdemeanor?
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2169.757,2171.039,"Yes, sir, it can."
1979.78-6386,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2171.084,2172.373,How about a traffic violation?
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2172.373,2176.395,"Yes, sir, it can be for any violation of the law, no matter how trivial."
1979.78-6386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2294.643,2324.795,"Mr. Becker, on the question of getting into the sentence review business at all -- of course, I agree with you, if you view the case as one of a ten or twelve year sentence, it is quite different than if you just view it in terms of the legal rights and the lifetime -- what would your view be if you did not have this kind of parole provision or if as a matter of law we decided we would just have to look at the sentence cold and not in the real world, as Justice Rehnquist puts it, would you say it would be up to us to review a life sentence without the possibility of parole for this kind of group of offenses?"
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2324.795,2325.885,"Well, Your Honor, in our --"
1979.78-6386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2325.885,2328.018,And get the federal court to --
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2328.018,2334.078,"In our particular case, we don't feel that that would come up because the status as an habitual offender we think is a different one."
1979.78-6386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2342.949,2350.95,"If you did apply proportionality, if the sentence here were properly viewed as a life sentence rather than one of ten or twelve years, would you agree that that would be excessive?"
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2350.95,2352.196,"In this particular case, Your Honor?"
1979.78-6386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2352.196,2352.525,Yes.
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2352.525,2353.588,Absolutely not.
1979.78-6386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.173,2361.9,You don't really rely then on the -- you don't have to rely in your view on the probability of parole as part of your defense statutory scheme?
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2361.9,2362.601,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-6386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2364.365,2366.834,There are basically two different theories.
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2366.834,2375.967,"Well, if -- absolutely -- if the man had been sentenced for stealing $230 worth of merchandise on three different occasions, viewed in that way, that would be one case."
1979.78-6386,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2384.304,2401.543,"Nonetheless, I take it you don't equate the term ""punishment"" as used in the Eighth Amendment with the normal context of the word ""sentence"" independent of parole possibilities?"
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2401.543,2403.243,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, I don't --"
1979.78-6386,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2403.243,2411.381,"Well, the Eight Amendment forbids cruel and unusual punishment, as we all know."
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2430.513,2458.279,"We think that long sentences, even very long sentences, if it is the expressed societal judgment of the state for various crimes, that that is entitled to the deference in federal court, and if might be that a sentence could be so unusual and so bizarre and so unsupported by logic that it could be possible that that would fall within the punishment of cruel and unusual punishment clause or the meaning of that word, but ordinarily that it would not, and clearly this is such a case where it does not."
1979.78-6386,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2479.103,2485.838,"He went on to say, as I remember it, that as long as there is a rational for the sentencing scheme, that passes the Eight Amendment standard."
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2487.203,2508.438,"Well, I do agree with that test, Your Honor, I don't think -- I think that the purpose underlying purpose of the statute -- now, actually the -- you know, the petitioner makes the point that you can always make a rational basis explanation for any punishment, even death for a minor offense as a rational basis in the sense that it will prevent recurrence of that offense again."
1979.78-6386,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2514.037,2515.947,How do you measure civilized thought?
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2519.961,2525.77,I look at what the legislature has done and the apparent purposes for which they have done it.
1979.78-6386,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2539.214,2549.381,"But if we are looking at the real world, General Becker, would it really matter if they said each of these are a misdemeanor but nevertheless we shall apply our habitual offender statute to three misdemeanor convictions of this kind?"
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2549.381,2549.521,Well --
1979.78-6386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2549.521,2551.649,Would that be equally valid?
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2551.649,2552.579,"Well, it is --"
1979.78-6386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.579,2555.043,"I don't think the label of felony can be determinative, can it?"
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2555.043,2558.263,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe that the label felony is determinative, no."
1979.78-6386,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2644.103,2674.692,"Mr. Becker, you spoke earlier and just repeated now that there is nothing automatic about this recidivist statute, that it depends first of all upon the discretion of the prosecuting attorney whether or not to ask for an indictment under it, and I suppose that is his absolute and uncontrolled discretion, principle discretion, that is there is no statutory criteria to guide him, right?"
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2674.692,2675.866,That is correct.
1979.78-6386,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2676.365,2689.327,"Then you said that it also depends upon the discretion of the grand jury, that even if he asks for such an indictment, the grand jury must decide that this is a proper case in which to return one."
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2692.543,2694.777,"No, Your Honor, not from the legislature."
1979.78-6386,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2694.777,2695.939,From anybody?
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2695.939,2696.044,Well --
1979.78-6386,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2696.044,2697.807,How about the prosecutor?
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2697.807,2700.494,From their own consciences is their guidance.
1979.78-6386,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2700.494,2704.467,"It is uncontrolled, uncontrollable and standardless discretion, is that it?"
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2704.467,2705.311,There are no formal guidelines.
1979.78-6386,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2705.311,2707.374,And they are of course unappealable.
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2707.374,2709.38,That is correct.
1979.78-6386,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2709.38,2718.424,One would think the grand jury would be inclined to indict when they are shown all of the necessary elements of Texas recidivism statutes --
1979.78-6386,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2718.424,2721.265,They have only the prosecutor and no defense counsel in front of them.
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2721.265,2723.777,"Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-6386,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2746.421,2749.428,"That is, the next time they run thou won't be elected."
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2749.428,2759.203,"No, Your Honor, that is ultimately but even judicially he cannot make a decision of that sort on an impermissible basis, a racial basis --"
1979.78-6386,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2759.203,2761.89,"Well, what is an impermissible basis under the statute?"
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2761.89,2768.093,"Well, under the statute -- I am talking about existing case law, prior case law of this Court, Your Honor, and Texas courts, not under the statute."
1979.78-6386,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2791.005,2792.466,And the grand jury the same?
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2792.466,2794.438,"And the grand-jury the same, yes."
1979.78-6386,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3002.95,3010.335,"General Becker, just to refresh my recollection about the Texas procedure, doesn't the statute require that the prior offenses be identified in the indictment?"
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,3010.335,3011.533,"It does, Your Honor."
1979.78-6386,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3011.533,3018.735,Then how would it have been proper during the trial itself to introduce evidence of offenses not described in the indictment?
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,3018.735,3021.053,There is no requirement --
1979.78-6386,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3021.053,3028.295,"If the judge doesn't have any discretion, once you proved what you did prove he has an automatic duty to impose the life sentence."
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,3028.295,3035.428,"Quite so, but there is still nothing in Texas law to prevent the introduction of other offenses and his other criminal record."
1979.78-6386,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3061.973,3066.555,"The material that you are talking about, was that before the court?"
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,3066.555,3066.809,It was --
1979.78-6386,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3066.809,3067.733,"It was not, was it?"
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,3067.733,3068.582,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-6386,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3068.582,3070.408,"Well, what are you arguing it here for?"
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,3070.408,3071.244,"Well, it was --"
1979.78-6386,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3071.244,3073.181,What right do you have to argue it here?
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,3073.181,3083.122,"Your Honor, all I argue here is that the court is entitled to presume or that there may well have been other circumstances that were never shown."
1979.78-6386,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3083.122,3084.188,Where do you get that?
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,3090.243,3091.144,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-6386,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3094.44,3095.973,What do you want us to presume?
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,3095.973,3114.094,"I am asking that the Court, as Judge Borman did in the Fourth Circuit in his dissent, note from their experience that it is possible that there were other things known to the prosecutor, that because a statute says A and B are all that is required, that there may be other things and that we would be able to show the other things."
1979.78-6386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3117.506,3127.321,"General Becker, just to refresh my recollection, Judge Clark's initial panel opinion, wasn't the relief that he granted that you vacate the mandatory sentence and send it back for resentencing?"
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,3127.321,3128.22,I believe so.
1979.78-6386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3128.22,3134.761,"On resentencing hearing, would it not have been open to the state to put in whatever would be relevant for resentencing, including these additional convictions?"
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,3134.761,3134.918,Well --
1979.78-6386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3134.918,3137.149,Aren't you already protected on this?
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,3137.149,3138.611,"I don't know, Your Honor."
1979.78-6386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3146.24,3149.948,Normally in a sentencing hearing in Texas you can put in all sorts of prior convictions.
1979.78-6386,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,3149.948,3150.956,"Yes, that's right."
1979.78-6386,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3153.853,3156.751,"Mr. Atlas, do you have anything further?"
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3156.751,3159.026,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court --"
1979.78-6386,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3159.026,3165.753,"Mr. Atlas, could I ask if we agree with you, what should be our disposition of this case?"
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3165.753,3170.793,"Your Honor, the proper disposition of the case we think is to order Rummel's immediate release."
1979.78-6386,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3179.662,3180.007,Not to --
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3180.007,3183.796,-- to the District Court to find what Texas law properly would allow.
1979.78-6386,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3183.796,3189.107,You mean the state shouldn't be ordered just to resentence?
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3189.107,3196.044,"Your Honor, under Texas law as it happens we think Rummel is entitled to a completely new trial and for various coincidences we think he is entitled to relief."
1979.78-6386,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3196.044,3197.735,Let's assume that weren't true.
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3200.456,3204.009,"Yes, Your Honor, we would argue in that instance that the state would not --"
1979.78-6386,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3204.009,3209.951,"What should we say -- should we just say resentence, this is too much?"
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3219.742,3226.49,"Your Honor, it is possible that the state could enhance under the two-time offender statute of Texas and give Mr. Rummel an automatic ten-year sentence which he has already served."
1979.78-6386,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3226.49,3228.942,"Well, what about a three-timer?"
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3228.942,3232.356,"Your Honor, a three-time is only permitted under Texas to be given a life sentence."
1979.78-6386,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3256.208,3264.295,You suggest that even if the Court in its wisdom thought that 30 years would be a good sentence in this case --
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3264.295,3264.986,Your Honor --
1979.78-6386,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3264.986,3269.124,-- that Texas couldn't under its law impose 30 years?
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3269.124,3270.732,"Your Honor, under its current law it could not."
1979.78-6386,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3291.61,3296.505,You don't think Texas could be ordered to treat him as though he had a 30-year sentence?
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3296.505,3300.138,"No, Your Honor, we think not because that would be judicial legislation I think."
1979.78-6386,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3301.022,3305.023,"Well, what kind of a standard do you think we ought to have --"
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3305.023,3306.22,"Your Honor, the standard ought to be --"
1979.78-6386,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3306.22,3309.185,"You suggest some kinds of nonviolent crimes would be quite all right, and yet --"
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3309.185,3314.774,"Your Honor, the standard ought to be -- and I think the Court could enact a fairly narrow standard if it chose --"
1979.78-6386,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3314.774,3316.196,Enact?
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3316.196,3320.31,"Pardon me, I misspoke and as badly as I have ever done."
1979.78-6386,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3336.162,3345.46,So you say our standard should be violent crimes generally but there are some other strong social interests.
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3345.46,3346.226,"Yes, Your Honor, I think --"
1979.78-6386,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3346.226,3352.274,And we should go on just on an ad hoc basis from then on to decide what is a strong social interest?
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3352.274,3356.34,"Your Honor, fortunately from all the research we have done, we found almost no cases where the Court would ever have a case that --"
1979.78-6386,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3356.34,3363.845,"Well, could you help us by suggesting some -- how do we identify one of those when we run into one?"
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3363.845,3368.149,"Your Honor, fortunately this Court has never had one nor has any other court that has ever dealt with the problem."
1979.78-6386,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3421.681,3436.742,"You do agree, Mr. Atlas, that the term ""punishment"" in the Eighth Amendment means more than just sentence, that parole possibilities under certain circumstances can be taken into consideration?"
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3436.742,3460.462,"Your Honor, at this point I cannot conceive of a circumstance under which I would support the principle that parole consideration ought to be received unless there is some statutory entitlement, using this Court's language, that would give Mr. Rummel some constitutionally protected rights to be allowed to challenge the parole board's denial of parole on whatever basis if the actual sentence that he served exceeded whatever would be a reasonable one."
1979.78-6386,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3460.462,3465.607,So you say cruel and unusual punishment means cruel and unusual sentence?
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3465.607,3466.915,"Among other things, Your Honor."
1979.78-6386,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3472.983,3491.514,"Well, maybe a life sentence for somebody who behaved himself in the penitentiary and showed every sign of rehabilitation and adjustment as a good citizen for these offenses might be cruel and unusual punishment, whereas a sentence of ten to twelve years upon such a person might not be."
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3491.514,3502.689,"Your Honor, if a life sentence is unconstitutional for three petty offenses, it is unconstitutional for three petty offenses and a surly attitude."
1979.78-6386,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3502.689,3507.725,"I understand that is your submission, but I would think that would be not an open and shut question."
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3507.725,3517.879,"Your Honor, if the legislature had sentenced Mr. Rummel to the thumb screws but it provided that they bring him down if he behaved while on the rack, we think this Court would not approve the sentence."
1979.78-6386,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3575.359,3576.942,"Well, how do we know that as a factor?"
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3579.391,3585.665,"Your Honor, the state legislature in 1856 did not say that three petty property offenses ought to bring a life sentence."
1979.78-6386,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3590.462,3591.126,Right.
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3591.126,3603.416,"But we think there is only so -- in any constitutional decision, this Court is being asked in some sense to pass on the constitutionality and indirectly on the wisdom of the state in passing such a statute."
1979.78-6386,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3605.204,3607.169,Not to pass on the wisdom of any state statute --
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3607.169,3613.926,"No, Your Honor, but only to the extent that a statute exceeds the constitutional limits, and when it does the statute cannot stand."
1979.78-6386,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3624.373,3639.862,"Well, I suppose you would -- if the prosecutor here had simply put in the indictment six or seven crimes, even though petty crimes, if there were that many, you wouldn't be here?"
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3639.862,3642.027,"Yes, Your Honor, because the statute says --"
1979.78-6386,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3642.027,3643.357,"Yes, would you be here or not?"
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3643.357,3648.032,"Yes, sir, I would be here, Your Honor, because the statute says three felonies, automatic life."
1979.78-6386,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3652.068,3653.396,Seven are --
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3653.396,3657.457,"Yes, Your Honor, but the state says three, any others are irrelevant."
1979.78-6386,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3672.797,3683.399,"I will put it to you this way Suppose the Judges in the Texas courts construed the law differently than you do, the Texas law, that you may put seven in the indictment."
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3683.399,3684.963,"Yes, Your Honor?"
1979.78-6386,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3684.963,3687.089,"Then if there is a conviction, would you be here then?"
1979.78-6386,2,40951,scott_j_atlas,,3687.089,3701.157,"Your Honor, if the statute mandated life sentence upon seven, I would probably not be here because I would lose and we cannot forget that under these circumstances, after all of the criteria have been discussed, we are talking about a human being who was given a life sentence for three petty offenses."
1979.78-6386,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3701.157,3701.857,"Thank you, gentlemen."
