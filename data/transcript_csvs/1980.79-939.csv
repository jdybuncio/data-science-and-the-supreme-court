1980.79-939,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.17,We'll near arguments next in Delaware State College v. Ricks.
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,58.52,61.389,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-939,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,95.812,102.032,"Mr. Rodriguez, perhaps at the outset you could clarify something that's confused me."
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,116.958,118.577,Yes.
1980.79-939,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,126.147,127.433,"On the hypothesis said it was 180 days, didn't it?"
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,127.433,127.783,--Yes.
1980.79-939,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,127.783,131.551,"Now the Government comes in here and says, well, it's 300 days."
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,131.551,143.692,"Their contention is that there was a state filing on April 11 of 1975 by Mr. Ricks with the state agency, the state Department of Labor."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,178.866,180.567,So it wasn't a timely state filing?
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,180.567,181.95,It was not a timely state filing.
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,181.95,186.119,So it depends upon whether there was a state filing.
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,194.375,195.577,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1980.79-939,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,200.962,211.02,"Well, don't we generally have a rule that amicus curiae can't inject a new issue into the case that has not been argued by the parties in the lower courts?"
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,211.02,213.622,"I think that is the ruling of this Court, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,213.622,215.172,Is that a rule of this Court?
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,215.172,217.407,That was not raised in the District Court or in the 3rd Circuit.
1980.79-939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,217.407,218.657,What about plain error?
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,218.657,230.298,"That could be very true and that's the reason I'm glad it was brought up here, Mr. Justice White, because if it was plain error, then, very obviously, you must rule on it."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,246.724,249.359,Could it be plain error?
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,249.359,251.478,The Government amicus does think it makes a difference.
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,254.413,269.273,"--Mr. Justice Stewart, the District Court decided that the date that triggered the statute of limitations was June 26, 1974, the date of the terminal letter to Mr. Ricks."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,310.433,317.938,"And you also have the 1981 claim here, which isn't governed at all by that, is it?"
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,317.938,318.188,Yes.
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,324.223,324.389,In the District Court.
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,325.823,326.573,--Yes.
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,329.775,330.541,Right.
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,330.541,354.906,"The District Court chose the June 26, 1974 date, and that was the date that Mr. Ricks was notified that he would receive a terminal contract, and dismissed both actions under Title VII and also 1981 as being time-barred."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,364.412,367.131,Is Mr. Ricks a United States citizen or not?
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,367.131,368.233,Is not.
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,461.343,477.603,"I was... both the briefs of the parties and the amicus briefs kind of talk about this as an all-or-nothing situation, but it really depends, doesn't it, upon what the complaint is, what the complaint is?"
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,505.02,509.84,"--Mr. Justice Stewart, I don't believe that's a holding."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,514.478,515.428,How do you read this complaint?
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,523.416,530.587,"Dr. Ricks alleged two, really two basic reasons: denial of tenure and termination."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,530.587,541.711,"Well, then, insofar as he alleged that he was terminated by reason of his national origin, then the question is, when was he terminated, isn't it?"
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,541.711,542.861,"Yes, that's correct."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,542.861,549.901,"And if he alleges that he was denied tenure on account of his national origin, then the question is, when was he denied tenure?"
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,549.901,551.367,Those two or--
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,551.367,554.786,"And if he claims that he was denied a promotion, when was he denied the promotion?"
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,562.625,566.51,--Let me discuss the facts of our particular case.
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,587.84,588.359,Which he did.
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,588.359,589.076,Which he did.
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,593.228,594.18,That was the end of the line.
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,594.18,599.065,"--he was out of work, and... but he did not have to accept that, that was up to him."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,599.065,599.882,I understand that.
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,599.882,609.605,"But what my argument is, that the termination of his services is not the alleged unlawful act, the denial of tenure is."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,609.605,610.772,But isn't that the question?
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,614.441,617.193,Yes; very... sure.
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,617.193,625.799,"Whether it was a denial of hiring or a denial of transfer, a denial of promotion, in this case a denial of tenure, and/or maybe of firing."
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,629.769,649.314,"But the decision here, among other things, flies straight in the face of the decision in the Evans case, because in that case you had a stewardess who was denied... their policy at that time was, an airline stewardess could not be married."
1980.79-939,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,697.997,701.282,Doesn't he also allege that it was continuing up till the time he was let go?
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,701.282,0.0,"--Yes, he does, Mr. Justice Marshall, but--"
1980.79-939,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,704.167,0.0,It was continuing.
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,706.6,712.404,"--Well, Evans... Evans, she left... very true--"
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,712.404,714.189,She couldn't have been persecuted when she wasn't there.
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,714.189,731.334,"--The point I would like to make, Mr. Justice Marshall, that as far as continuing is concerned, Dr. Ricks does not say that our tenure policy, to which he was subjected, is unconstitutional or discriminatory toward him."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,772.144,776.846,"Well, it does have significance if the basic claim is that he was fired by reason of his national origin."
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,782.083,782.767,Yes.
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,782.767,784.535,The first two questions.
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,784.535,796.677,"Under the faculty policy which he was subject to, when he was denied tenure on March 13, 1974, by the Board of Trustees, that was a final act."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,796.677,804.865,"Well, if his claim of alleged discrimination is that he was denied tenure, then the question becomes, when was he denied tenure?"
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,804.865,806.999,"Yes, he was denied tenure--"
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,806.999,808.817,And the statute of limitations begins to run from then.
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,808.817,811.702,"--Very true, Justice Stewart."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,811.702,823.577,"If his claim is that he was wrongfully discharged, then the question is, was he discharged, when, and if you'd answer those two questions, then the statute of limitations begins to run from the time he was discharged."
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,823.577,825.196,Our argument there--
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,825.196,828.481,"So one must look to the complaint in every case, isn't that true?"
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,828.481,834.985,--I don't think so under the 3rd Circuit opinion because it's an overall opinion.
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,862.802,868.206,"Well, there can be violations of Title VII by somebody who never leaves the employment."
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,871.325,873.443,That's our very point.
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,873.443,876.295,And there could be violations of Title VII by somebody who never becomes an employee.
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,883.283,889.019,"Well, I think the 3rd Circuit has put out a general rule and that's our argument and I think that's wrong."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,889.019,890.721,And that's what some of these amicus briefs seem to have come in for.
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,890.721,893.506,And I think EEOC does say that.
1980.79-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,905.164,911.485,"Mr. Rodriguez, following up on Justice Stewart's suggestion, it depends a little bit on the way the complaint is written."
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,930.279,937.183,"No, that's very true, Mr. Justice Stevens, but he took--"
1980.79-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,937.183,944.356,"So wouldn't his damage claim have been premature if he'd brought suit before, while they still had him on the payroll?"
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,944.356,951.777,--I don't think so because his rights were terminated once the Board of Trustees denied tenure to him.
1980.79-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,955.914,960.883,"But then he could have sued for an injunction, I suppose, a grant retenure, but he couldn't have recovered any money, could he?"
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,960.883,966.02,"Well, I think he could have gone in at that time and sued for a damage claim because--"
1980.79-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,966.02,970.59,"Say he sued and 30 days later the case came on for trial, he wouldn't go to judgment, would he?"
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,973.458,981.731,"--No, his contract... see, he was unemployed as of June 30, 1974, had he not decided to take the terminal contract."
1980.79-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,989.735,990.368,"Well, yes."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,995.706,1000.443,But he knew that that terminal contract was only for one year.
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1000.443,1003.978,"--Yes, he knew that that was... June 30, 1975, he was done work."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1003.978,1009.215,"If he had... knew it too, that would have been admitted or conceded or stipulated in any action for damages."
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1014.183,1019.237,"Mr. Justice Stewart, the problem that you brought up is a problem we're concerned with."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1042.52,1045.889,"Well, do you suppose the Court of Appeals possibly meant that?"
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1045.889,1047.122,That's the reading.
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1055.51,1070.337,"If the alleged discriminatory act is a failure to promote, based upon somebody's race, sex, or national origin, then that's the act, and it becomes important to determine, first, did that act occur?"
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1084.447,1090.517,"--No, I certainly agree, but I don't think that's the holding of the 3rd Circuit."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1105.843,1107.212,And how about a failure to hire?
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1114.949,1119.52,"Well, that would not activate the Ricks decision, because there was no employment."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1133.362,1144.485,"Well, that is the date when the statute starts to run if the alleged discrimination occurred at the time of the firing, if he allegedly was fired because he or she, the plaintiff--"
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1144.485,1146.004,"Yes, there can be no doubt about it."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1146.004,1151.324,--of a certain sex or a certain race or a certain ethnic origin.
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1158.495,1165.918,"Another example, Mr. Justice, I'd like to bring out is the denial of seniority."
1980.79-939,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1215.414,1224.337,"Mr. Rodriguez, procedurally this case was dismissed by and not tried by the District Court, was it not?"
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1224.337,1225.289,Under Rule 12(b)(6).
1980.79-939,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1225.289,1225.889,Yes.
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1230.007,1230.807,--That is correct.
1980.79-939,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1230.807,1244.934,Do you think that the complaint stated a claim both for denial of a contract to teach and tenure?
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1244.934,1251.687,The complaint originally listed six counts.
1980.79-939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1298.401,1308.357,"You mean there would have been, in his mind, there would have been a violation even if tenure was legally denied?"
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1308.357,1320.767,"--No, I think not, Mr. Justice White, because he thought that tenure was legally denied; then that automatically led to termination."
1980.79-939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1320.767,1322.451,So there's not two separate violations?
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1322.451,1323.469,No.
1980.79-939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1327.355,1328.571,"Well, did he say there were two?"
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1328.571,1332.408,He said that Dr. Ricks said there were two.
1980.79-939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1364.194,1371.799,But when were his appeal rights exhausted on the tenure decision?
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1371.799,1372.983,On the tenure decision?
1980.79-939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1374.835,1376.185,September?
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1376.185,1382.239,"--He filed suit September 9, 1977, so it would have been September 9, 1974."
1980.79-939,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1411.758,1415.645,Was there a timely filing with the state agency here?
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1415.645,1419.847,"It depends, Justice Rehnquist, on what you call timely filing."
1980.79-939,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1628.517,1636.623,"Isn't it possible that even though the 3rd Circuit was wrong in laying down a general rule, the plaintiff might prevail on this particular case?"
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1636.623,1641.925,"No, I don't think so, Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1677.348,1709.319,"Well, if the claim can be read as one that the plaintiff was unlawfully terminated from his employment by reason of his national origin, then he might prevail, because the statute of limitations would then begin to run at the time he was terminated from his employment, and if he can show that the reason he was terminated was because of his national origin, then he might prevail under Title VII, quite apart from 1981."
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1709.319,1717.259,"Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, our argument there is that he was terminated once tenure was denied because he--"
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1717.259,1724.765,"No, I thought your argument was that the only discriminatory act fairly alleged is a failure to give him tenure?"
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1724.765,1734.703,"--Yes, that's very true, but under the policy, once he was denied tenure for the second time, he was automatically offered a terminal contract."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1738.322,1758.419,"Yes, but as I say, his claim is... and if he can prevail on it... that he was terminated by reason of his national origin, then he might win, although Judge Higginbotham of the 3rd Circuit says that his claim was that he was denied tenure."
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1772.496,1776.047,"We disagree with that, very respectfully."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1776.047,1778.649,"Well, you disagree with that characterization of the claim--"
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1778.649,1779.149,Yes.
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1779.149,1791.223,"--but if the claim can be fairly so characterized, then he, as my brother Rehnquist suggested in his question, he might prevail for a reason other than the broad reasoning of Judge Higginbotham for the 3rd Circuit."
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1791.223,1792.007,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1809.252,1810.852,"Well, that would be the merits of the claim."
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1810.852,1810.935,--Yes.
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1813.468,1821.541,"Yes, but if his claim is that he was wrongfully terminated by reason of his national origin, then the merits would be whether or not that was correct."
1980.79-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1821.541,1825.712,Doesn't that beg the question?
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1838.419,1839.635,I think it does.
1980.79-939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1839.635,1841.704,"I think that that would just beg the question, when you phrase it that way."
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1841.704,1842.787,"I think it does, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1980.79-939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1842.787,1860.516,"If a tenure decision doesn't automatically result in termination, didn't the one year contract even more clearly indicate that he was terminated at the end of that year?"
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1860.516,1865.819,"The denial of tenure, Mr. Justice White, does result in termination."
1980.79-939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1874.508,1877.21,But what about the one year contract that was then given him?
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1877.21,1878.743,That was entirely discretionary.
1980.79-939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1880.162,1887.316,"I know that was discretionary but would it be... if that was the discriminatory act, would it be untimely, would the filing be untimely?"
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1887.316,1890.034,"--The denial of tenure, Mr. Justice White?"
1980.79-939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1890.034,1892.053,"No, the issuance of the one year contract."
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1892.053,1892.57,No.
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1896.105,1897.822,It wasn't discretionary on the part of the college?
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1897.822,1898.124,"No, it was not."
1980.79-939,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1898.124,1899.24,The college had to offer it?
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1899.24,1900.24,They had to offer that.
1980.79-939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1900.24,1905.943,But what if that were determined to be the discriminatory act?
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1908.812,1909.412,No.
1980.79-939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1919.12,1928.909,"He chose to accept it but it was also, it certainly was unequivocally indicated then that he was terminated at the end of that year?"
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1928.909,1929.976,No question about it.
1980.79-939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1936.499,1938.365,Even if he didn't know when tenure was terminated?
1980.79-939,0,37275,nicholas_h_rodriguez,,1938.365,1950.139,"He grieved tenure but I say, under the ruling of Electrical Employees, the grievance procedure does not toll the statute under Title VII."

1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,1962.714,1964.964,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1980.79-939,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1984.043,1988.245,"It's a little hard to... maybe it is a fair reading, is it?"
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,1990.114,1991.531,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you."
1980.79-939,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1991.531,1999.153,"I find the complaint a little hard to read either your way or any other way, frankly, so maybe it was a very fair reading."
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,1999.153,2005.041,"Well, the complaint was framed with a multiplicity of issues, and sometimes that creates problems that one couldn't foresee until hindsight."
1980.79-939,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2035.826,2046.368,Does he claim that the discharge was discriminatory for any other reason than that the tenure denial was discriminatory?
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2046.368,2049.003,That remains to be proved.
1980.79-939,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2075.803,2078.255,Even though they too had been denied tenure?
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2078.255,2080.855,Even though they too had been denied tenure.
1980.79-939,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2082.188,2085.307,Did the Court of Appeals read the complaint as you have outlined it?
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2085.307,2102.434,"The Court of Appeals focused on the process of, focused on his discharge and said it occurred on the last day that he worked, and said that what he was complaining about overall was the process which resulted in that, and said that that was a continuing, ongoing process."
1980.79-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2124.448,2131.038,"Well, a lot of this is, or most of it is irrelevant, if you are correct on this 300-day submission."
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2131.038,2131.504,That's correct.
1980.79-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2131.504,2140.91,And you as well as an amicus support that and so as a respondent you are urging this in support of the decision below?
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2140.91,2141.643,That's correct.
1980.79-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2146.98,2147.68,I understand that.
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2147.68,2148.213,--All right.
1980.79-939,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2192.009,2199.598,Do you think that Mohasco included an untimely filing with the state commission too?
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2199.598,2200.715,I believe it did.
1980.79-939,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2366.073,2369.708,Then you have something in your brief about his being punched in the nose.
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2369.708,2374.011,There are some allegations of events that occurred after the--
1980.79-939,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2374.011,2376.797,"But those events really don't have anything to do with Title VII, do they?"
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2380.682,2392.057,"--Those specific events, yes, except insofar as the person who allegedly engaged in that conduct subsequently evaluated him in that last year of the contract."
1980.79-939,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2392.057,0.0,"Well, that might be evidentiary but it's not itself a substantive cause of action under Title VII."
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2396.592,0.0,That's correct.
1980.79-939,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2401.71,2407.698,"Miss Harris, before you go on, could we come back to the complaint for a minute or two?"
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2422.957,2432.015,The charge of discrimination filed by Dr. Ricks before the EEOC and which is a part of this record alleges a discriminatory discharge from his employment.
1980.79-939,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2432.015,2437.817,I appreciate that the complaint is long and perhaps not as clear as it might be.
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2447.358,2454.595,"Paragraph 48, Justice Powell, I believe, is the paragraph that does that... paragraph 48."
1980.79-939,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2454.595,2456.062,It says he was discharged.
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2456.062,2470.787,"The count two of the complaint says that all the allegations numbered 1 through... however many of them are... I think 48 is the last one, are alleged to be discriminatory and in violation of Section 1981."
1980.79-939,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2475.025,2480.912,"Apart from that, there's no specific averment of discriminatory discharge?"
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2480.912,2483.797,That said that... some allegations separate and apart from the tenure?
1980.79-939,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2483.797,2484.431,Yes.
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2497.957,2504.195,"I think a fair reading of the complaint is that most of the allegations do go to tenure; yes, that's correct."
1980.79-939,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2512.633,2516.335,Would respondent have remained on the faculty without tenure?
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2516.335,2525.608,"That's a question that would remain to be proved, and it is a question at this point."
1980.79-939,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2570.319,2571.169,It was a one year contract?
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2571.169,2572.002,"--Yes, it was."
1980.79-939,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2572.002,2575.787,And there was no offer of a second one year contract?
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2575.787,2577.589,That is correct.
1980.79-939,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2582.308,2587.279,"I thought there was a single one year contract, at the end?"
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2587.279,2587.562,No.
1980.79-939,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2589.297,2590.731,"Well, of course at the end there was."
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2590.731,2591.431,--That's correct.
1980.79-939,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2594.784,2599.402,But I thought after the second denial of tenure there was a single one year contract?
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2599.402,2600.036,That's correct.
1980.79-939,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2601.771,2606.406,"Well, that really is the difference between tenure and a series of one year contracts, isn't it?"
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2621.685,2623.818,"Yes, Justice Rehnquist, that's my understanding of the practice."
1980.79-939,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2623.818,2626.987,"I suppose a nontenured teacher, though, could have a five-year contract?"
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2626.987,2628.672,I suppose so.
1980.79-939,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2633.64,2633.824,"As an instructor or an assistant professor, or whatever."
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2633.824,2635.326,--That's probably true.
1980.79-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2635.326,2645.365,"What is the evidence in this case, or what supports the suggestion or the assertion that the final contract that he was given was a terminal one year contract?"
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2645.365,2646.634,That's been the way--
1980.79-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2646.634,2647.717,Is that what the contract said?
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2647.717,2649.017,"--No, it did not say that."
1980.79-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2652.87,2655.239,What is the basis for saying it was a terminal contract?
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2655.239,2669.063,"Because under the regulations of the College... Mr. Rodriguez is correct... upon that denial of tenure he was to be afforded a terminal contract, and that was deemed to be the terminal contract."
1980.79-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2669.063,2674.717,So that would mean that he would not be working for the university after the end of that terminal contract?
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2674.717,2675.986,"Well, I think that--"
1980.79-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2675.986,2677.703,"I mean, otherwise it isn't terminal?"
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2677.703,2680.705,--That's correct.
1980.79-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2688.211,2689.511,What does terminal mean?
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2689.511,2694.614,"--That's what it ordinarily means but I would say, Justice White, that the--"
1980.79-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2694.614,2707.438,"Doesn't it suggest that although in other circumstances you might have had another one year contract issued to you after this one, you won't be issued another one after this one?"
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2707.438,2719.48,"--Well, what the notice, the June 26 notice that preceded the issuance of the terminal contract said was that, we're issuing you this contract to comply with the AAUP regulations."
1980.79-939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2734.172,2740.409,"Well, not if they... the only condition on the letter was if the Board of Trustees granted him tenure."
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2740.409,2741.178,That's correct.
1980.79-939,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2743.428,2762.342,"Is this in your view just a traditional method of giving the faculty member a year's time to find new employment, and a year's notice, in effect, that at the end of the year there would be no more employment at this institution?"
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2763.842,2766.961,"The issuance of a terminal contract, Mr. Chief Justice?"
1980.79-939,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2771.03,2788.159,"Is it fundamentally any different from ordinary workers in industry that might get 15-day or 30-day notice that their employment is terminated, but they have the employment during that 15 or 30-day period?"
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2792.878,2796.563,"It may be, depending on why the notice was given."
1980.79-939,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2796.563,2807.304,"Well, if it's either a layoff or for cause, whatever, is that not the function of it, to give the person a turnaround time?"
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2807.304,2808.823,To find other employment?
1980.79-939,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2809.74,2819.861,"Now, in your view, the statute of limitations is not tolled until the end of the notice period rather than the beginning of the notice period."
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2821.13,2821.63,Yes.
1980.79-939,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2826.784,2831.402,Not the point of termination of the contractual relationship?
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2831.402,2832.552,That's correct.
1980.79-939,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2833.354,2854.267,"Getting back to Justice Powell's question, it seems to be clear, at least in the first sentence of Judge Higginbotham's opinion for the Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit that that court considered your complaint to allege a discriminatory denial of tenure."
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2863.64,2863.806,That's correct.
1980.79-939,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2863.806,2874.846,"Then he goes on, the opinion goes on at some length to talk about the whole history and then ending up with the termination, and then holding, as we know it held, as to when the statute of limitations began."
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2874.846,2876.781,That's correct.
1980.79-939,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2876.781,2884.903,But the question is still whether it was 180 days or 300-day statute.
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2884.903,2887.755,That question does remain.
1980.79-939,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2887.755,2892.207,And the Court of Appeals assumed it was 180 days?
1980.79-939,1,36008,miss_judith_e_harris,,2892.207,2893.159,That's right.
