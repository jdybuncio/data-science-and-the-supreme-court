1983.82-5466,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.145,We'll hear arguments next in Welsh against Wisconsin.
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,68.796,73.019,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-5466,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,117.629,118.327,You said at night.
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,119.619,127.284,The officer reportedly heard the call at 8:49 p.m. There was some dispute as to how long it took the officer to get to the house.
1983.82-5466,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,201.533,219.635,"When you said at the outset that this was truly an exigent circumstances case, did you mean that the exigent circumstance is the need of the officers to apprehend this gentleman while he might still be subject to a breathalyzer test or observation?"
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,219.635,236.885,"The officers justified, Mr. Chief Justice, the entry into the home as required by the need to obtain a blood-alcohol test, Officer Daley said, within two hours of the event to be proved."
1983.82-5466,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,236.885,238.668,In other words to preserve evidence.
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,238.668,249.505,"This was to preserve... As Officer Daley said, yes, to preserve evidence of intoxication he felt he had to enter the home under those circumstances."
1983.82-5466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,329.329,332.98,Did the Circuit Court make any finding as to whether it had been consent?
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,332.98,338.596,--The Circuit Court explicitly said we do not examine the question of consent.
1983.82-5466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,355.296,359.397,The Supreme Court of Wisconsin likewise did not pass on the issue of consent?
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,359.397,367.314,The Supreme Court of Wisconsin likewise said that the exigent circumstances doctrine justified excusing the warrant and consent requirement.
1983.82-5466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,382.822,384.915,Did the officer know the man?
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,384.915,402.576,The officer testified that he had remembered the name from an incident that happened he said a week or two before... Actually it probably was somewhat earlier than that... in which he said he had arrested Mr. Welsh in an alcohol-related disturbance.
1983.82-5466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,411.512,414.637,He did not know that he drove the car?
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,414.637,418.658,"He obviously was highly suspicious, of course, sure."
1983.82-5466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,418.658,419.6,I beg your pardon?
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,419.6,425.192,"He was highly suspicious that the car had been driven by the owner, and the owner, of course, is the Defendant in this case."
1983.82-5466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,426.482,429.894,You mean that every car on the street is driven by the owner?
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,429.894,430.545,"Oh, no."
1983.82-5466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,430.545,432.626,What--
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,432.626,435.258,The officer was suspicious.
1983.82-5466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,462.481,465.323,--The law must be different in your state.
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,481.552,483.973,"--That is unquestionably the common law, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1983.82-5466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,483.973,486.975,My question is what is the law in Wisconsin?
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,486.975,487.797,I regret--
1983.82-5466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,487.797,494.291,Does the policeman on a story that somebody tells him have a right to go and lock up a man?
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,496.042,506.669,--The Wisconsin law apparently from the Wisconsin Supreme Court's opinion does not require that there be an in-presence offense in order to arrest for a misdemeanor.
1983.82-5466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,514.003,516.705,Does the law say he could break the door down?
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,516.705,518.097,"--Absolutely not, sir."
1983.82-5466,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,531.344,554.229,"Mr. Baldwin, would you say that is true if the officer had personally observed your client behind the wheel and doing erratic driving and had observed all of the circumstances and had had to chase him to the house in an effort to apprehend him?"
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,559.324,565.658,"The answer I give to that, Justice O'Connor is no as long as it is a minor offense."
1983.82-5466,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,588.392,596.187,Do you think it should make a difference from state to state as to how the state chooses to classify an offense?
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,607.864,613.718,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, I believe it does for two reasons, and I think they are illustrated by the law of Wisconsin."
1983.82-5466,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,656.477,671.337,"Well, it makes it very difficult, does it not, for an officer in a jurisdiction where it would be a misdemeanor if there had been no prior conviction but it would be a felony if there had and the officer does not know that and he does not know whether he has to stop at the door or not?"
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,677.08,686.666,"It is a difficult line, but it is a difficult line because the legislature of Wisconsin has drafted its driving while intoxicated statutes in that particular way."
1983.82-5466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,686.666,708.11,"Mr. Baldwin, I think the offense in Schmerber v. California was also a misdemeanor and yet the court there said that exigent circumstances existed for taking the sum from him by blood."
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,708.11,710.363,"Justice Rehnquist, you are absolutely correct."
1983.82-5466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,725.48,727.162,So could it here.
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,727.162,728.204,So could it here?
1983.82-5466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,728.204,730.895,"Yes, if he had known that he had a prior arrest."
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,730.895,742.583,"If he had known there had been a prior arrest, then I would have to rely on the exigent circumstances doctrine and I could not make this assertion that the exigent circumstances doctrine should not apply to an arrest for a minor offense."
1983.82-5466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,742.583,747.054,"Mr. Baldwin, could I ask you what were you complaining about when you appealed?"
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,755.169,756.792,That is the--
1983.82-5466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,756.792,768.029,Is that not... So that the end result that you wanted to attain in the state courts was that the driver's license would be restored.
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,768.029,770.21,"--That is correct, sir."
1983.82-5466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,770.21,774.864,Is the revocation procedure not a civil proceeding?
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,774.864,777.706,It is most certainly a civil proceeding.
1983.82-5466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,777.706,781.479,"Well, have we ever applied the exclusionary rule to a civil proceeding?"
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,781.479,785.471,"This Court does not have to apply the exclusionary rule, Mr. Justice White."
1983.82-5466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,785.471,790.613,You want to say that the Fourth Amendment barred the use of this evidence?
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,790.613,793.955,"The Fourth Amendment, Justice White--"
1983.82-5466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,793.955,807.825,You want to say that this refusal and taking him down to the station was a fruit of an illegal entry and that is what your argument is.
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,814.788,821.213,"--If I might correct, I think, Justice White, the problem is created by the law of Wisconsin."
1983.82-5466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,829.378,830.209,--I agree with you.
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,830.209,831.25,There must be an arrest.
1983.82-5466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,831.25,834.233,"I agree with you, but nevertheless it is a civil proceeding."
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,834.233,839.035,The State of Wisconsin viewed this as a criminal-type proceeding.
1983.82-5466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,841.857,845.089,I know but that cannot control the application of the Fourth Amendment.
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,854.536,859.007,"--The State of Wisconsin applied Fourth Amendment standards, Mr. Justice White--"
1983.82-5466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,859.007,866.734,"I know they did, but the result is right."
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,866.734,870.227,"--Well, there is a link proceeding here."
1983.82-5466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,874.929,880.132,You are not challenging... Were you convicted for it?
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,880.132,881.084,Subsequently.
1983.82-5466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,882.175,883.585,"Yes, but you are not challenging the criminal proceeding."
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,883.585,885.107,Not at this point.
1983.82-5466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,885.107,894.36,Whatever evidence was seized or not has not tainted or otherwise affected the criminal proceeding.
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,894.36,896.212,"The Fourth Amendment, Mr. Justice White,--"
1983.82-5466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,896.212,898.603,You are solely objecting to the cancelling your driver's license.
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,898.603,901.235,"--Well, this Court has recognized that that is a serious interest."
1983.82-5466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,910.792,913.163,"I agree with you, but we are talking about the exclusionary rule."
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,913.163,927.125,"Mr. Justice White, the exclusionary rule is not invoked here for two reasons, first, because Wisconsin law does not permit the breathalyzer or the blood-alcohol test to commit evidence unless there has been an arrest."
1983.82-5466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,933.209,934.097,But you are up here on Fourth Amendment grounds.
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,947.999,958.614,"It seems to me, Justice Rehnquist, that the issue here is the reasonableness of an arrest which is not a question of necessarily the introduction of the evidence."
1983.82-5466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,960.204,963.777,You are not interested in that in the abstract are you?
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,968.642,971.724,The suppression rule was simply a product of the law of Wisconsin.
1983.82-5466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,976.066,992.067,But that is an abstract proposition under the ruling of the Wisconsin Supreme Court because you say that the Wisconsin Supreme Court may have misinterpreted the Fourth Amendment law of arrest apparently but nonetheless ruled against you.
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,1010.707,1020.034,"Well, the Wisconsin Supreme Court has construed an arrest as lawful under Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment standards."
1983.82-5466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1028.389,1032.843,But you have to be here because of something that is done about the criteria not because of what it said about it.
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,1032.843,1046.942,"Well, the consequence, of course, of the lawful arrest was the loss of driving privileges and, of course, incidentally the introduction into evidence of the officer's testimony of what he saw in the bedroom in the criminal case which, of course, was force."
1983.82-5466,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1115.016,1127.305,"Since you are speculating there, counsel, do you exclude the possibility that if not apprehended he might go out and drive his car immediately?"
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,1127.305,1130.147,"Well, his car was half a mile away, of course."
1983.82-5466,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1130.147,1139.764,He might decide that after getting a couple of aspirins and some coffee to go out and get the car and bring it home where it would be safe.
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,1139.764,1142.816,"If he was sober, of course, that would be perfectly permissible."
1983.82-5466,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1143.304,1145.628,"He might not be, but he might think he was."
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,1147.368,1158.033,"--There are several alternatives that would have been less stringent than simply entering the house without establishing consent, one of which of course is to keep your eye on the car, iron boots or what have you."
1983.82-5466,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1213.972,1217.024,I am not sure how you have distinguished Schmerber.
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,1217.024,1218.133,"Well, excuse me."
1983.82-5466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1240.928,1249.065,Why should it make any difference that the offense in fact might have been prosecuted as a higher level offense than it was?
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,1254.218,1259.752,"I think what the arresting officer knew, I submit, is important in establishing grounds for the arrest."
1983.82-5466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1301.549,1304.17,Schmerber is certainly against you on that point.
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,1307.383,1323.502,--He was arrested where the police had a right to be at the hospital two hours after the event under conditions where he might have received medical treatment or have been out of the custody of the police for a long period of time.
1983.82-5466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1329.456,1333.259,--I did not think you thought that exigencies made any difference in misdemeanor cases.
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,1333.259,1335.21,--If the underlying arrest--
1983.82-5466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1335.21,1337.042,Real ones make a difference?
1983.82-5466,0,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,1337.042,1339.416,"--That is my fallback position, Justice White."
1983.82-5466,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1513.359,1517.982,Mr. Kleinmaier.
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1517.982,1520.692,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-5466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1613.214,1615.908,"Mr. Kleinmaier, may I ask you a question?"
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1627.045,1628.297,That is what I understand.
1983.82-5466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1628.297,1632.419,If that were true was his license automatically revoked as a result of that conviction?
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1632.419,1637.861,I do not know what happened or what the judgment was.
1983.82-5466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1645.975,1646.846,I see.
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1646.846,1652.159,"I assume that any penalty imposed in that case would have been stayed pending the appeal, but that I do not know."
1983.82-5466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1652.159,1658.905,I take it then he was convicted in the criminal case without the state using the evidence of the refusal to take the test.
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1658.905,1661.857,I do not know what evidence was used.
1983.82-5466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1661.857,1666.699,Because I wondered in reading this record really how badly you needed this evidence.
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1680.559,1694.879,"Well, I think evidence of a breathalyzer or a blood test would have been a much better and much stronger case obviously than the evidence from Mr. Jablonic who observed him only for a couple minutes."
1983.82-5466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1694.879,1696.799,That is not the only evidence you have.
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1698.973,1700.131,Yes.
1983.82-5466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1700.131,1701.423,He smelled his breath.
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1701.423,1703.374,Well--
1983.82-5466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1703.374,1704.914,It is a matter of... Go ahead.
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1704.914,1715.782,--As the first argument pointed out there is some discrepancy as to what Mr. Jablonic saw.
1983.82-5466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1720.445,1722.097,He did not testify did he?
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1722.097,1724.929,At this hearing... Well--
1983.82-5466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1724.929,1727.981,Presumably he was available as a witness at the main trial.
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1727.981,1728.9,"--Yes, he did testify."
1983.82-5466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1750.084,1751.206,"Well, that is this proceeding."
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1751.206,1752.586,That is this proceeding now.
1983.82-5466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1763.293,1779.003,Do I correctly understand that if the arrest was unlawful whether for state reasons or federal reasons that as a matter of state law the refusal to take the test could not have been put into evidence if the arrest was unlawful?
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1779.003,1795.646,In this proceeding where it is to revoke his license the police officer is not entitled to order him or request a breathalyzer unless he has first legally arrested him.
1983.82-5466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1808.162,1816.907,So you agree that the Wisconsin Supreme Court was required to decide the federal constitutional question in order to dispose of the case?
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1816.907,1818.659,I would like to be able to take the other position--
1983.82-5466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1818.659,1820.489,But it would not be sound.
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1820.489,1821.12,--I do not believe so.
1983.82-5466,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1834.649,1854.894,Before you go into the exigent circumstances is the inception of the concept of the exigent circumstances affected by the observations of the seriousness of his driving condition?
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1870.613,1871.574,--Yes.
1983.82-5466,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1871.574,1881.602,What impact does that have on the whole picture of exigent circumstances?
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1881.602,1912.012,"I think that would indicate that at least Mr. Jablonic was concerned that this person was quite intoxicated and that if he had returned to his car, stayed in his car and tried to drive it some more and gone back on the highway that in his condition there may have been an accident especially since Mr. Jablonic said he had seen the Petitioner go down the wrong lane, the left lane, and coming head on towards another car and at that point was able to veer off the left before an accident."
1983.82-5466,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1941.062,1949.426,The statement in your record is because I realized they would probably kill somebody and I immediately did thus and so.
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1949.426,1951.78,"That was Mr. Jablonic's testimony, yes."
1983.82-5466,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1963.587,1969.341,Is that evidence available for a license cancellation proceeding?
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1969.341,1985.671,"--Well, Mr. Welsh's... Yes, in that his license could be suspended either through the reasonableness hearing for refusing the breathalyzer or as a result of his conviction for drunk driving."
1983.82-5466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1985.671,2001.872,Just so I am clear on it I take it here the license was suspended because of the refusal of Mr. Welsh to take the breathalyzer or the blood alcohol.
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2001.872,2002.981,"In this proceeding here, yes."
1983.82-5466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2002.981,2011.707,He asserted that his refusal was reasonable because the arrest was unlawful.
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2011.707,2014.221,"Yes, because--"
1983.82-5466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2014.221,2023.956,Under Wisconsin law if the arrest is unlawful is that treated as a reason for refusing to take the test?
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2023.956,2037.583,"--Well, the trial judges accepted that and the officer is not entitled to even request him to take a breathalyzer until he has arrested him in a valid arrest so that is a requirement before even asking for the breathalyzer."
1983.82-5466,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2037.583,2056.917,When the officer was at the door does the record show that he was aware of Mr. Jablonic's statement in detail that he was afraid the driver was going to kill somebody or was he just responding to the telephone warning that the lady had given?
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2056.917,2063.072,"No, Mr. Jablonic had stopped his car to block Mr. Welsh from moving his."
1983.82-5466,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2186.444,2188.104,Is a first offense a crime?
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2188.104,2189.827,In Wisconsin no.
1983.82-5466,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2192.698,2197.58,Does it suggest that your legislature may have created this problem?
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2197.58,2200.933,"Well, yes."
1983.82-5466,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2282.285,2285.647,The only trouble with your argument is that your court does not agree with you.
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2290.442,2293.033,I do not understand how they do not agree.
1983.82-5466,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2293.033,2299.826,"Well, I mean your court did not agree with what you just said in this case."
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2299.826,2309.603,"Well, in this case they said that the officers had probable cause to believe that the offense had been committed, and on the basis of that probable cause they were authorized to make the arrest."
1983.82-5466,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2317.797,2319.68,I could not get it out of that opinion.
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2323.982,2341.053,"--Well, the issue presented to the Wisconsin Supreme Court was whether there were exigent circumstances and whether there was probable cause, and they found probable cause and exigent circumstances and with those two they made the arrest in the context of this case."
1983.82-5466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2404.705,2407.146,It is not just giving them a break by not calling it a felony.
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2412.88,2413.962,That is correct.
1983.82-5466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2418.394,2428.732,But is it not true that the penalty that the state legislature seeks to impose is one of the ways we determine how important the state interest in the matter is?
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2428.732,2429.631,That is correct.
1983.82-5466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2433.915,2435.047,The procedure for arrest.
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2435.047,2438.388,--Or enforcement of the laws.
1983.82-5466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2451.366,2460.162,There are not other categories of misdemeanors that are so treated in Wisconsin for arrest purposes?
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2460.162,2469.248,"No, all crimes in Wisconsin whether it be misdemeanors or arrests or felonies are subject to arrest on probable cause."
1983.82-5466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2477.622,2491.911,In your mind is there a right of an officer to follow any misdemeanor offender into a home to make an arrest regardless of the nature of the misdemeanor?
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2491.911,2497.986,"--Well, he would have to have exigent circumstances to go with the probable cause."
1983.82-5466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2505.252,2517.751,"Well, he had probable cause to believe someone has committed a misdemeanor offense and that the person is getting away and going into his home to avoid arrest."
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2519.68,2534.781,--I think he has to under the normal exigent circumstances it would require more than just think he is going into his house to avoid the arrest at that point.
1983.82-5466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2536.05,2540.024,Does our Santana case not answer that in the affirmative?
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2540.024,2546.269,"--Yes, if the officer saw the offense being committed and merely followed a hot pursuit theory."
1983.82-5466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2574.345,2584.313,Or if it were shooting birds out of season and he thought that they were going to be eaten in the next hour and a half they could go in and--
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2584.313,2589.956,I think under that qualification it is a reasonable probability that it is going to occur.
1983.82-5466,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2594.571,2602.805,"--General, in Wisconsin is a police officer entitled to shoot a misdemeanor who is trying to run?"
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2602.805,2606.886,I just do not know the answer to that question.
1983.82-5466,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2608.699,2610.161,You said it was all the same.
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2610.161,2611.941,"--Well, as far as arrest authorities."
1983.82-5466,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2613.461,2616.093,"Oh, this is limited to arrest."
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2616.093,2620.787,--To arrest in the context of probable cause.
1983.82-5466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2710.605,2728.466,"What if you had a building code violation and the police had the same degree of reliable evidence they had here but they were afraid the man was about to fix it, could they break into the house to arrest him before he fixed it because that would void the evidence?"
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2728.466,2734.431,"Again, under the cases on exigent circumstances it is more than just speculation or fear by the police."
1983.82-5466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2736.952,2741.676,Say they had fairly reliable evidence that that was about to happen as they did here.
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2745.068,2752.743,--Building code violations I think are somewhat different in that usually you enforce the building code to cure the violation.
1983.82-5466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2757.765,2764.229,"Well, of course, one might argue that keeping this man in bed might have been the best way to avoid the danger you are talking about."
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2764.229,2766.681,"However, when the police entered they did not know he was in bed."
1983.82-5466,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2766.681,2777.88,"Well, anyway I gather that your position is that exigent circumstances satisfied sufficiently where there was possibility of disappearance of the alcohol."
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2777.88,2778.629,That is correct.
1983.82-5466,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2778.629,2782.723,You do not think you have to rely on anything more than that do you?
1983.82-5466,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2782.723,2783.962,Basically no.
1983.82-5466,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2804.525,2807.497,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Baldwin."
1983.82-5466,2,24946,gordon_b_baldwin,,2807.497,2818.026,I would like to answer Justice Steven's question insofar as I have been informed by the principle counsel for Mr. Welsh.
1983.82-5466,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2940.866,2941.407,"Thank you, gentlemen."
