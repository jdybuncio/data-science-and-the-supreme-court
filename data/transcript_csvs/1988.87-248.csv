1988.87-248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 87-248, Georgia Brower v. The County of Inyo."
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,11.51,15.781,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-248,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,152.801,163.117,"Mr. Gilmore, even if we were to agree with you that the complaint alleged facts sufficient to allege a seizure, that isn't the end of the matter, is it?"
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,163.117,165.749,"Not by a long shot, Justice O'Connor."
1988.87-248,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,170.303,172.423,Right.
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,172.423,173.295,This past summer--
1988.87-248,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,173.295,183.81,"Mr. Gilmore, you... you said a minute ago that... that the freedom... the individual's freedom has to have been restrained in some way."
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,201.823,203.884,--Of the suspect or the hostages?
1988.87-248,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,203.884,205.135,"Of, of the suspect."
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,205.135,213.36,"Yes, I believe it would be, Justice Scalla, because the Court in the Mendenhall case has said that we look to the conduct of the police officers."
1988.87-248,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,235.034,236.474,He's certainly free to leave the house.
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,251.505,255.349,It is if we follow Mendenhall to its logical conclusion.
1988.87-248,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,257.348,258.46,It doesn't seem like a seizure to me.
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,258.46,265.046,"--Well, I, I would suggest, Justice Scalla, that in keeping with my response to Justice O'Connor, that it is a seizure."
1988.87-248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,292.133,296.194,"Mr. Gilmore, when do you think the seizure took place in this case?"
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,296.194,310.122,"Justice Stevens, I believe the seizure took place at the very instant that the pursuit began long before we ever got 20 miles down the road--"
1988.87-248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,310.122,311.685,Do you think it was unreasonable at that point?
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,311.685,318.559,--I cannot say in all honesty if it was reasonable or unreasonable simply because we are the very--
1988.87-248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,318.559,324.354,"It the police officer thinks he's... the driver is driving away in a stolen car, it's certainly not unreasonable to pursue him, is it?"
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,324.354,325.924,--Absolutely not in a general sense.
1988.87-248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,325.924,330.616,"So, then it was not unreasonable at its inception, if that is the time when the seizure took place."
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,330.616,333.27,If that was the circumstances within which this case--
1988.87-248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,333.27,335.14,"I asked you when, when it took place."
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,339.254,343.686,"--I have nothing to indicate to the Court that it was unreasonable at that moment, again concentrating--"
1988.87-248,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,343.686,348.648,When does it become unreasonable for the police to follow someone in these circumstances?
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,352.14,353.422,"--Well, Justice O'Connor--"
1988.87-248,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,353.422,358.445,Is there ever an obligation that the police have to stop following someone in these circumstances?
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,358.445,366.88,"--I think that there is, and I believe that there is because, as the Court has indicated in the Chesternut case, we must consider all of the circumstances."
1988.87-248,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,374.837,382.832,"Well, don't you think that creates a very perverse incentive for people to try to take evasive action from the police in their automobiles?"
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,382.832,390.124,"--It may well, but I believe that we have to consider again the purpose for which the pursuit is taking place."
1988.87-248,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,402.323,414.682,"Well, this is more than that because when this person takes to the roads on a two-lane road at high speed trying to evade police action, the person puts a lot of other people at risk, doesn't he?"
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,414.682,417.464,"--Generally speaking, yes, Justice O'Connor, that person does."
1988.87-248,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,417.464,420.496,"And yet, you think the police have to break off the pursuit?"
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,420.496,421.397,Not necessarily.
1988.87-248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,437.225,440.798,It was dismissed purely on the single issue of seizure.
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,440.798,441.89,--That is correct.
1988.87-248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,441.89,446.422,"And that no, no one, though ever got to the question reasonableness."
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,446.422,451.126,The specific issue of reasonableness was not addressed by the district court.
1988.87-248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,455.899,461.612,And did the... did the... did the courts below specifically deal with the chase?
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,461.612,472.608,I believe the Ninth Circuit dealt with it certainly not... perhaps it was not addressed with as much energy or as--
1988.87-248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,472.608,475.51,Did you argue that the chase amounted to a seizure?
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,475.51,479.123,"--In and of itself, no."
1988.87-248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,479.123,480.325,That's what I thought.
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,480.325,480.866,It was--
1988.87-248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,480.866,489.471,Why do we have to get into whether the chase amounted to a seizure here if we were to determine that the existence of the roadblock resulted in a seizure?
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,489.471,500.578,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that the reason that it's important is to fully develop and utilize the case of Mendell... Mendenhalll and the test that has been given to us."
1988.87-248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,524.163,533.581,"Yes, but if you're wrong on the Mendenhall case, you could nonetheless prevail on the idea of that the, the forcing the guy into the roadblock was a... was a seizure."
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,536.181,537.361,"Yes, It would."
1988.87-248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,537.361,544.037,"And there... as I read the petition for certiorari, the question... there is no question as to reasonableness presented."
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,547.469,550.24,The issue of the seizure is most predominant.
1988.87-248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,582.481,584.094,Why is that so?
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,584.094,584.344,It can be--
1988.87-248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,584.344,584.634,I don't--
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,600.423,608.349,"--Well, it was my understanding of Chesternut, Mr. Justice, that we are to look at all of the circumstances, and the complaints as well as the decision of the Ninth--"
1988.87-248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,608.349,615.553,"Well, you're entitled to look at them all, but if the roadblock is enough all by itself just on the issue of seizure, why make your case harder than you have to?"
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,615.553,618.485,--It may appear--
1988.87-248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,618.485,621.116,Do you still contend the roadblock amounted to a seizure?
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,621.116,622.879,"--Very definitely, yes, sir."
1988.87-248,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,622.879,623.888,Can we talk about the roadblock?
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,651.026,651.717,"Yes, I--"
1988.87-248,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,651.717,652.899,Isn't it like a false arrest?
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,655.87,657.881,"--Well, I believe that it... it is still a seizure."
1988.87-248,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,668.538,670.501,"Well... well, then can we pursue that just one minute?"
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,680.366,685.42,--No.
1988.87-248,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,690.703,693.284,There's an intentional component to the element of seizure.
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,693.284,706.093,"--Perhaps intentional, but I do not believe intentional in the sense that we decided in the Daniels and the other cases of the individuals who were prisoners and there was an excessive use of force alleged against them."
1988.87-248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,728.757,735.463,But if the... I suppose you could say that the officers put the roadblock up there to stop him.
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,743.147,744.309,"They did, and--"
1988.87-248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,744.309,745.709,And on purpose.
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,745.709,747.03,--And on purpose.
1988.87-248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,769.127,778.48,"Well, if all we're talking about here is the question of seizure, you will still have to persuade someone somewhere that it was an unreasonable seizure in order... in order to prevail."
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,789.009,789.83,That is correct.
1988.87-248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,794.973,800.506,"Well, getting back to the beginning, was there pursuit... to starting of the pursuit with seizure?"
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,800.506,805.239,"I believe under Mendenhall, Justice Marshall, it definitely is."
1988.87-248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,805.239,810.734,Would that apply if the police had a broken down Ford and the criminal had a Bugatti?
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,810.734,812.775,Yes.
1988.87-248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,812.775,813.887,That still would be a--
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,813.887,823.119,As long as the officer in his broken-down vehicle in some way manifested to that individual... to a reasonable individual that he was not at liberty to leave.
1988.87-248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,829.334,834.847,"--But you insist on putting the pursuit in this case, the starting of the pursuit."
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,839.261,840.042,--Well--
1988.87-248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,840.042,841.823,--about the roadblock.
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,841.823,844.665,--The test that we must apply--
1988.87-248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,844.665,845.636,They're two different animals.
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,845.636,846.646,--No.
1988.87-248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,849.51,851.871,"Well, the pursuit moves and the roadblock doesn't."
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,854.252,855.093,--But they're all conduct of the police officers.
1988.87-248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,855.093,856.583,Isn't that the difference?
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,856.583,861.915,"There is a difference, but they were all put into force or into play by the police officers."
1988.87-248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,861.915,863.137,And that made it a seizure.
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,863.137,864.487,That made it a seizure.
1988.87-248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,867.409,877.326,"If the roadblock was on the opposite side of town and the pursuit started on this side, the pursuit would be a procedure."
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,877.326,879.499,"Absolutely, and I think I can explain that if I might."
1988.87-248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,879.499,880.448,I doubt it.
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,880.888,882.571,Let me give it a try.
1988.87-248,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,960.351,961.292,"It's just a couple of sentences, though."
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,971.349,975.431,I personally am still troubled with the skidding police car.
1988.87-248,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,975.431,975.981,"Yes, me too."
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,975.981,993.042,The skidding police car... I... I believe that I would have to concede if the officer simply negligently skidded across the road and there was an automobile accident... and this must happen thousands of times... that I would have a lot of difficulty arguing--
1988.87-248,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,993.042,994.143,Let's assume I think you need intent.
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,1016.778,1017.469,"--Well, two things."
1988.87-248,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1022.741,1023.683,To use that road.
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,1023.683,1025.543,To use that road or to go where he wishes--
1988.87-248,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1025.543,1026.214,And that's a seizure.
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,1026.705,1027.296,--That's a--
1988.87-248,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1027.296,1028.145,--Any roadblock is a seizure?
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,1028.145,1035.691,--Any roadblock is a seizure if the police communicate reasonably that that individual is not simply free to totally ignore it.
1988.87-248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1046.868,1053.002,"So, a roadblock by itself does not amount to a seizure if... if you've got some alternate route to go."
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,1056.935,1058.708,Here again I must fall back on the Mendenhall.
1988.87-248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1069.965,1072.216,Is it a seizure of everybody that comes down the road?
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,1072.216,1078.739,"--Under Mendenhall, yes, probably reasonable."
1988.87-248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1078.739,1085.034,"Well, your argument is certainly much stronger, it seems to me, when you combine the pursuit and the roadblock."
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,1091.108,1093.61,If the--
1988.87-248,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1093.61,1094.501,I think that's right.
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,1106.409,1106.95,--No.
1988.87-248,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1122.147,1152.99,"Mr. Gilmore, if the person pursued in this case by the police had drawn a gun on the officer and threatened to shoot him and then took off, do you think that on... on those facts that a summary judgment could be granted for the police?"
1988.87-248,0,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,1152.99,1161.504,"If I understand the Justice's question, I'm being asked if under those circumstances it would be reasonable for the officer to--"
1988.87-248,1,38103,philip_w_mcdowell,,1398.439,1401.491,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1988.87-248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1437.575,1440.217,Why didn't... why didn't you address it directly in your brief?
1988.87-248,1,38103,philip_w_mcdowell,,1442.789,1443.189,--No.
1988.87-248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1462.923,1466.173,--Is there any question in this case of why they put the truck up?
1988.87-248,1,38103,philip_w_mcdowell,,1466.173,1466.995,--As a--
1988.87-248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1466.995,1470.878,"I mean, it may... it may not amount to a seizure, but it was certain... whatever it was, it was intentional."
1988.87-248,1,38103,philip_w_mcdowell,,1470.878,1478.883,"--It was intentional to have him stop, but... but not by a... intentional... intentional to have someone stop, you can put on a red light, turn the switch."
1988.87-248,2,39373,robert_gene_gilmore,,2324.569,2328.652,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-248,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2409.135,2421.761,"But, counsel, Mendenhall says we adhere to the view that a person is seized only when, by means of physical force or a show of authority, his freedom of movement is restrained."
