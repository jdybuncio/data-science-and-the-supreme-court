2007.06-1646,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.935,"We'll hear argument first today in Case 06-1646, United States v. Rodriguez."
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,8.013,31.191,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Armed Career Criminal Act is one of the Federal Government's most important tools for incapacitating serial offenders who commit serious crimes, and, like other Federal recidivism statutes, the ACCA defines the prior offenses that trigger its application based partly upon the maximum terms of imprisonment for those offenses."
2007.06-1646,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,68.238,76.892,"Mr. Shanmugam, what is the government's position as to a person who is not a repeat offender?"
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,94.057,105.004,"That is because, Justice Scalia, we believe that the text of the ACCA naturally accommodates the possibility that there may be alternative maximum terms of imprisonment for a given offense."
2007.06-1646,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,135.977,144.207,You're adding something to the elements of the crime and in all of our cases in this field we look to the elements of the crime.
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,144.207,146.097,"--Well, to be sure, Justice--"
2007.06-1646,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,146.097,157.186,"And as far as the elements are concerned, the maximum sentence for those elements you say is the sentence that would be imposed upon a repeat offender."
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,157.186,162.809,"--To be sure, Justice Scalia, the ACCA speaks of the maximum term of imprisonment for the offense."
2007.06-1646,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,182.849,192.922,You seem to... you seem to flinch from the natural consequences of your position in not looking at the maximum for a particular offender.
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,204.011,208.072,"I don't that we're flinching from those consequences, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-1646,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,218.085,226.08,"How is that different from your position here, where it is the fact that the individual is a recidivist that causes you to look to a different maximum?"
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,226.08,239.731,"--It is because, Mr. Chief Justice, that we believe that the language of the statute can be susceptible to the interpretation that there can be alternative maximum terms of imprisonment for broad categories of offenders, such as recidivists and non-recidivists."
2007.06-1646,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,240.996,249.118,"So that's the reason you sort of pull back from a more aggressive reading, because it's not as broad a category?"
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,249.118,254.241,"--Well, it would lead to harsh results for first-time offenders and we certainly think that Congress--"
2007.06-1646,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,254.241,264.847,"Well, but only if they're subject... only if they have some characteristic that had caused the State legislature to give the higher maximum, such as being the ringleader or some other enhancement."
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,264.847,265.66,"--Well, that's correct."
2007.06-1646,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,282.886,289.524,"Are there any statutes which talk about offender as opposed to ""offense"" in this area, do you know?"
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,289.524,297.646,"--Well, I think probably the closest analog in the criminal code, Justice Kennedy, would be the statute that was at issue in RLC."
2007.06-1646,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,321.495,333.476,"Well, there was also the statute involved in the LaBonte case, where... where the statute said the Sentencing Commission"
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,349.859,350.156,Yes.
2007.06-1646,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,350.156,354.967,And that did focus on the... on the nature of the defendant and not on the element of the crime.
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,354.967,361.339,It focused on categories of offenders and there Congress's concern was obviously with career offenders.
2007.06-1646,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,398.246,402.4,"So it would be easy, of course, if recidivism were an element of the crime--"
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,402.4,406.055,"Well, it would be easier to accept that if a State--"
2007.06-1646,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,406.055,411.615,--for a crime which includes the act plus the recidivism?
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,411.615,424.86,"--If a State, Justice Scalia were to essentially define a new crime of drug trafficking by a recidivist, then to be sure by definition the maximum sentence for that offense would be the maximum to which repeat offenders were subject."
2007.06-1646,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,472.122,491.708,"In light of Apprendi and the later cases, do you think it's feasible any longer to draw a distinction between, between statutes that make recidivism an element of the offense and statutes that originally conceived of recidivism as a sentencing factor but now provide for that to be proven to a jury?"
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,491.708,514.683,"--One of the virtues of our approach, Justice Alito, is that the answer is in some sense the same whether a legislature defines drug trafficking by a recidivist as a distinct offense or whether recidivism is simply a sentencing factor that gives rise to an alternative maximum term of imprisonment for the underlying offense of drug trafficking."
2007.06-1646,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,557.074,564.665,"Mr. Shanmugam, I didn't understand what you said about Congress's intent with regard to the guidelines when it passed ACCA."
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,577.224,578.924,"Yes, that's correct."
2007.06-1646,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,620.83,626.593,Does it matter what was the sentence actually imposed in the State court?
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,652.27,667.451,"Our position, Justice Ginsburg, is that it would count because the relevant inquiry is whether the offender was potentially eligible for an enhanced maximum sentence as a repeat offender as a substantive matter."
2007.06-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,698.049,706.139,I take it... supposing there's a dispute between the prosecutor and the defendant as to whether in fact he was a recidivist or not.
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,714.589,724.601,"Well, if there were such a dispute, certainly we believe, first of all, that ACCA courts would be perfectly competent to resolve those disputes."
2007.06-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,727.802,735.846,"Shouldn't the mere existence of a dispute be enough, because then at least he's potentially subject to being treated as a recidivist."
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,735.846,757.791,"--Well, our view, Justice Stevens, is that once the government comes forward, for example, with a judgment of conviction that indicates that the defendant was subject to a 10-year maximum, it would then be incumbent on the defendant to come forward with evidence suggesting that that was erroneous to the extent that a defendant would be permitted to collaterally challenge that prior sentence at all."
2007.06-1646,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,833.775,857.454,"Mr. Shanmugam, I take it that your response to Justice Ginsburg's question would basically be your response to the argument that the other side makes, that on your theory a State misdemeanor can be treated for purposes of the act as... or a conviction for a State misdemeanor can, with the recidivism enhancement, be treated as a felony?"
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,857.454,858.202,Yes.
2007.06-1646,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,915.741,932.094,"But if they continue to use just the State terminology such that they continue to use the word ""misdemeanor"" with respect to an offense, which with the enhancement carries more than a one-year penalty, then the two-year provision, the two-year threshold provision, kicks in?"
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,932.094,941.168,"That's absolutely correct, Justice Souter, and I believe that that was actually the fact pattern that was presented in the ACCA case that this Court heard earlier this term, Logan."
2007.06-1646,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,941.168,941.528,Yes.
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,941.528,954.726,"And in a footnote in its opinion, the Court noted this very peculiarity of how ACCA operates and how you need to have a two-year maximum rather than a one-year maximum if the State still treats the offense as a misdemeanor."
2007.06-1646,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,954.726,976.795,Do all States treat first convictions from other States... do they all count for recidivism qualification if the prior offense was committed and the conviction was in another State?
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,976.795,994.912,"States do have somewhat different rules, Justice Ginsburg, as Respondent correctly points out, though I would note that many of the sort of factual and legal issues that would arise under those different rules arise outside the drug-trafficking context."
2007.06-1646,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1092.326,1094.295,"Surely not, Mr. Shanmugam."
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1105.118,1114.536,"--Well, that might be true as a numerical matter, though, you know, I suspect that there are probably more recidivist offenders than one might think."
2007.06-1646,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1132.139,1137.386,"Well, I know, but you began your discussion by saying we had to choose one maximum."
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1147.788,1151.068,"--Well, with respect, Mr. Chief Justice, I would disagree."
2007.06-1646,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1162.891,1166.953,But you don't accept that approach when we're talking about enhancements under State guidelines.
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1176.761,1181.541,"--That's correct, and that's because of the statute's reference to the offense and not the offender."
2007.06-1646,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1227.053,1238.268,"Mr. Shanmugam, would you explain to me again why... why you treat the enhancement in a State guideline system differently?"
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1238.268,1239.689,It is--
2007.06-1646,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1239.689,1248.857,It seems to me that if you get an enhancement as a ringleader it's the same thing as if you get an enhancement because you're a recidivist.
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1249.826,1276.268,"--The difference, Justice Scalia, is that the statute does speak of maximum terms of imprisonment for the offense and not the offender, and, while we certainly believe that the language of the statute with its reference to ""a maximum term of imprisonment"" can naturally accommodate the possibility of alternative maximums for broad tiers of offenders such as recidivists and nonrecidivists, we really don't believe that it can accommodate the possibility of individualized maximums for every offender."
2007.06-1646,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1276.268,1278.235,"You don't think ""ringleader"" is a broad tier."
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1278.235,1295.167,"Well, in a sentencing guidelines system where being a ringleader may be the basis for an enhancement, as it is in the Federal system, the fact remains that an enhancement under a guidelines system is merely one of many factors that ultimately determine the offender's guideline sentence."
2007.06-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1304.882,1307.959,How would you treat an enhancement--
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1307.959,1316.129,"Well, we believe that such an enhancement could be subject to our alternative maximums approach as well, to the extent that the standard was--"
2007.06-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1316.129,1318.175,--So it's not just recidivist and non-recidivist.
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1320.814,1333.59,"--Well, if a statute is as a formal matter structured in such a way as to create broad tiers of punishment for categories of offenders, then certainly that would seem to be an alternative maximum term of imprisonment."
2007.06-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1336.839,1338.245,You're depending upon the guidelines.
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1338.245,1338.651,Right.
2007.06-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1360.502,1363.89,"Well, I understand, but my point is I don't think your proposal just has two categories."
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1369.466,1371.731,"And the relevant question, Justice Stevens--"
2007.06-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1371.731,1374.09,It's not just recidivist versus nonrecidivist.
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1374.09,1393.052,"--This case does not present that issue; and, in light of the history and practice of imposing heightened penalties on recidivists, an essentially universal practice as far as we're aware in the drug-trafficking context, we certainly don't believe that the Court has to address that issue."
2007.06-1646,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1412.684,1415.449,"Well, some of them have simply said, we're going to let the jury decide."
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1425.429,1426.678,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1646,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1464.819,1471.676,"It seems to me your argument might be slightly better if the statutory term was ""authorized"", not ""prescribed""."
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1485.2,1503.413,"I suppose that may be true, Justice Kennedy, though again the statute spoke about the maximum term of imprisonment for the offense, which I think presupposes, at least to some extent, that the maximum may be higher than the maximum to which a particular offender is subject."
2007.06-1646,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1554.893,1556.516,May I ask you one question before you sit down?
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1594.657,1604.699,"Justice Souter, an enhanced penalty for repeat offenders is every bit as much a penalty for the offense as the lower penalty for first-time offenders."
2007.06-1646,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1604.699,1605.012,"Well, that's the question in the case."
2007.06-1646,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1605.012,1613.18,"Well, and that is a question that this Court has answered in a variety of different contexts dating back almost a hundred years to Graham v. West Virginia."
2007.06-1646,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1637.687,1638.233,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1646.871,1653.978,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are a number of serious problems with the government's theory in this case, and I'll start with this one."
2007.06-1646,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1681.155,1694.415,"Suppose the State has two statutes: Possession of drugs, maximum penalty five years; possession of drugs by a convicted felon, maximum... convicted drug felon, maximum penalty ten years."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1702.131,1714.188,"--Well, if that latter provision includes as an element of the offense that recidivism, that could be a different situation than we have here, because the statutory language of ACCA, as Mr. Shanmugam said, focuses on ""offense""."
2007.06-1646,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1721.919,1722.904,"Well, it could be or it would be?"
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1722.904,1727.995,"--I think that's a difficult question, Your Honor, which is not the question here."
2007.06-1646,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1740.099,1750.234,"Well, if the maximum penalty there would be ten years, then what if in this case the recidivist element had been submitted to a jury and found by a jury."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1752.016,1765.339,"I would suggest, again, it depends upon what the element defined by the State legislature is in creating the offense, because that follows from the ACCA term of the offense, the punishment prescribed by law for the offense."
2007.06-1646,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1769.634,1770.852,Why should the label matter?
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1788.128,1796.436,"--Well, I think in the post-Blakely context one could say something that has to be proven to a jury is in fact an element of the offense."
2007.06-1646,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1817.865,1828.408,"Well, going back to what you first said, suppose with your own children: I told you half an hour ago not to interrupt your sister when she is doing her homework."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1841.356,1844.292,"It is a familiar example, Your Honor."
2007.06-1646,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1849.244,1857.928,"Well, if it's absolutely right I don't see why we hold Congress to some kind of weird... not weird, but more picky standard than we do with our own children."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1857.928,1864.269,"But the reason for that, Your Honor, in this context is the language that Congress chose."
2007.06-1646,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1873.296,1875.936,Because their behavior is worse.
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1875.936,1882.121,"--Well, but I think there is a distinction between whether the offense itself is a more serious offense."
2007.06-1646,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1900.644,1906.625,It's not a more serious offense when she does it the second time; it's just a more culpable offender.
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1906.625,1908.063,--That is precisely right.
2007.06-1646,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1908.063,1910.031,That isn't what I tell my child.
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1911.031,1914.405,"Well, I can't disagree with that, Your Honor."
2007.06-1646,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1916.56,1930.867,"Well, does the word ""offense""... I haven't come across it, but does the word ""offense"" have some kind of special technical meaning that doesn't just mean the behavior which calls into play all kinds of circumstances?"
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1930.867,1940.285,"--Well, I think the Court has... has repeatedly recognized the distinction suggested by Justice Scalia's latest question, which is that there is a difference between the offense and the offender."
2007.06-1646,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1969.539,1981.581,"Isn't it pertinent, Mr. Rothfeld, that in trying to decide whether a maximum term of imprisonment encompasses recidivists, we're dealing with a statute that itself is directed to recidivism."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1999.167,2003.478,"Well, I think not, Your Honor, because ACCA is a particular kind of recidivism statute."
2007.06-1646,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2055.581,2068.108,"Well, but it just seems to me that if you have Congress addressing what they regarded as a very serious problem of recidivism, they would think that that's a problem that should be taken into account in determining what maximum sentences you're subject to under State law."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2068.108,2069.496,"Well, they could have done that."
2007.06-1646,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2093.301,2106.343,"But it did use the language ""a maximum term"", not ""the maximum term"", which would support the government's view that the statute contemplates more than one maximum."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2106.343,2111.825,"With respect, Your Honor, I would suggest that's one of the government's odder arguments."
2007.06-1646,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2146.968,2147.593,"Counsel, you--"
2007.06-1646,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2147.593,2150.357,What about the defendant's own understanding?
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2163.291,2170.523,"I think that there are two things to say about that, Your Honor."
2007.06-1646,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2265.376,2277.777,"The government is correct, though, that when a recidivist is sentenced he is being punished for the crime, not for his recidivism."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2295.551,2297.659,"Well, there is no doubt about that."
2007.06-1646,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2333.285,2334.925,That's the part I'm not getting.
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2368.896,2369.583,Well--
2007.06-1646,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2369.583,2376.752,You're saying because... because fewer people are likely to get the 10-year sentence than get the five-year sentence?
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2376.752,2377.83,"--No, no, absolutely not, Your Honor."
2007.06-1646,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2377.83,2381.937,What is... what is the distinguishing... how do you get out of it?
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2384.686,2389.309,I look at it from the perspective that I think Congress looked at it when it wrote the statutory language here.
2007.06-1646,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2438.617,2449.035,"I guess what you're saying is that if it's a victimless crime, that the second offense is no more injurious to the State than the first was."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2477.492,2484.755,"--Well, there is no question that recidivism is regarded as... as, you know, a bad thing for a variety of reasons."
2007.06-1646,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2502.202,2506.902,"--Well, we know it was focusing on the particular problem of recidivism."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2509.931,2510.541,But--
2007.06-1646,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2510.541,2522.208,"And I think, following up on Justice Kennedy's question, that you would assume that this Congress thought that recidivists presented particular problems that were different from the one particular offense."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2522.208,2539.17,"--It is that recidivism statute, but it is... again it's a particular kind of recidivism statute different in character from the three-strikes kind of statute, different in character from the... the drug recidivism statute in Washington State, which is... which is to be a player."
2007.06-1646,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2603.957,2609.407,"Well, but the flip side of that hypothetical is somebody selling a ton of marijuana."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2618.591,2635.646,"--Well, if... if the crime in which the individual engaged, selling a ton of marijuana, is going to be punished by ten years, in virtually every jurisdiction... I would suggest in every jurisdiction... therefore it's going to be a serious drug offense within the meaning of ACCA and it's going to trigger ACCA as a predicate."
2007.06-1646,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2635.646,2641.581,"Of course, the recidivist doesn't necessarily be a recidivist because he committed the same crime three times."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2651.453,2653.311,"No, that's absolutely... absolutely correct."
2007.06-1646,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2653.311,2668.274,"Mr. Rothfeld, apropos of your answers to Justice... first to Justice Scalia and Justice Breyer... you said that when the... when the recidivist is being sentenced he is being sentenced for the offense of the... of the drug crime."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2693.655,2694.123,"Well, I--"
2007.06-1646,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2694.123,2697.746,--each one of which is necessary for the... for the ultimate sentence itself?
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2697.746,2706.899,"--Well, I... I think that that's right and it is reflective of something that... discussing earlier with Justice Breyer."
2007.06-1646,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2755.176,2758.738,"Well, I'm not sure the offense is the same."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2761.971,2763.83,"Well, I--"
2007.06-1646,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2763.83,2771.952,"It affects the tone of the community, the number of law enforcement officers we have to have, the cost of reincarceration, rehabilitation, etcetera."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2771.952,2776.888,"--Well, I think... again, I don't disagree with any of that, as to the consequence of a repeat offense."
2007.06-1646,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2789.569,2790.569,But that's what I'm addressing.
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2792.319,2793.49,"Well, I--"
2007.06-1646,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2793.49,2794.397,The offense in and of itself.
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2794.397,2803.391,"--I think it's... it's instructive to look at the statute in the LaBonte case which was... which discussed during Mr. Shanmugam's argument, in which--"
2007.06-1646,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2803.391,2809.592,"Then for double jeopardy purposes you must look at the second offense as the offense, not the offender."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2813.654,2813.811,--No.
2007.06-1646,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2826.681,2842.158,"Counsel, if you were representing a... a defendant who has two prior convictions for something that has a sentence of 8 years, and on the third one he is subject to a sentence of 15 years; and your initial meeting, the first thing he wants to know is what's the maximum that I'm facing?"
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2845.516,2849.921,"--Well, I would say that because you are a recidivist the maximum you are facing is 15 years."
2007.06-1646,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2877.459,2886.595,"Mr. Rothfeld, let's assume we get into conference and we are having exactly the same discussion that's been going on for 40 minutes there."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2893.341,2900.761,"Well, I... I would suggest that this Court need go no further at that point, because the rule of lenity would dictate ruling for us."
2007.06-1646,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2902.244,2904.15,But you don't have to win this argument?
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2904.15,2905.712,--We do not.
2007.06-1646,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2944.446,2959.424,"Counsel, the Government of course responds to your rule of lenity argument by saying it loses a lot of its force when we are talking about how... the degree of sentencing rather than whether conduct is subject to a criminal sanction in the first place."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2959.424,2961.985,"--They do say that, Your Honor, and I think that's simply not so."
2007.06-1646,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2977.949,2992.677,"But someone who is, you know, we are trying to decide whether he is subject to 20 years in jail or 30 years in jail, invoking the rule of lenity is a little bit... it's not the same as somebody who comes in and says I didn't know this was a crime at all, because it's so vaguely written."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2992.677,3003.578,"--I think the Court has said consistently that one of the elements supporting the rule of lenity is the idea that somebody's liberty is going to be taken away, that Congress should have spoken, to some degree--"
2007.06-1646,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3003.578,3008.217,"Well, we know... we know that someone's liberty is going to be taken away in a case like this; it's just a question of for how long."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3008.217,3010.559,"--Well, but... but it's a profound difference."
2007.06-1646,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3034.707,3038.486,"I think we have applied the rule of lenity to sentencing in the past, haven't we?"
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3038.486,3039.486,--Absolutely.
2007.06-1646,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3047.216,3062.398,"It is... it is a fundamental verbal embarrassment for your argument that you would say in a particular case that the maximum to which someone is subject is say, 5 years, and that person is in fact sentenced to 15 years."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3066.303,3068.787,"--Well, I... I am not embarrassed by that, Your Honor."
2007.06-1646,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3081.126,3093.528,"No, but I thought your position was that the... the defendant is not, this defendant is not subject to a maximum of 5 years, but gets 10."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3107.6,3109.146,I--
2007.06-1646,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3109.146,3119.766,"In other words, you can... throughout your argument you make, I think properly, the offense/offender distinction, and isn't that the answer to the conundrum?"
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3119.766,3121.016,--That... that is exactly right.
2007.06-1646,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3132.388,3140.026,"The offense never... the offense also disregards offender characteristics, or only those offender characteristics that are not elements of the offense?"
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3140.026,3141.744,"--Well again, that's... that's where we started, Justice Alito."
2007.06-1646,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3141.744,3144.444,I'm still not sure what the line is there.
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3144.444,3156.736,"I... I think if it is an element of the offense then you would be convicted of an offense which carried in its weight recidivism, and so I would say yes, in that circumstance that would be a different situation than what we have here."
2007.06-1646,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3156.736,3161.156,It all depends whether it's labelled an element of the offense by the State legislature?
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3161.156,3170.169,"Well, I think that whether it actually is an element of the offence... I mean, in this case there is no question; everyone agrees it's not in the offense; the Government concedes that it's not an element to the offense."
2007.06-1646,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3170.169,3176.775,"So it's bank robbery... bank robbery, force or threat of force guidelines."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3201.609,3208.247,"Well, I'm glad you bring up the guidelines, Your Honor, because I think that that is an element that we haven't discussed at some length."
2007.06-1646,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3215.416,3222.226,"Or what he actually faced... that, I agree with you, that won't work because of the guidelines, if they were mandatory."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3232.627,3234.611,"--Aha, but it's not the definition of the offense."
2007.06-1646,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3237.267,3239.203,"No, I'm back to the same question then."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3240.328,3246.809,--I... I guess there are two points here... the first on the question of the guidelines.
2007.06-1646,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3270.564,3273.938,You see that my question is going in the exact opposite way.
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3295.072,3301.335,"Well, the way... the way we resolve that, Justice Breyer, is what was suggested by Justice Souter's question."
2007.06-1646,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3432.469,3437.187,"Well, no, I thought their argument was you look at broad categories rather than individual characteristics."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3439.623,3446.854,"Well, I think, in terms of discussion of the Guidelines, they suggest that what matters is whether it is an element of the offense."
2007.06-1646,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3454.758,3455.461,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.06-1646,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3455.461,3455.507,Thank you.
2007.06-1646,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3455.507,3459.396,"Mr. Shanmugam, you have three minutes remaining."
2007.06-1646,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3459.396,3460.88,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-1646,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3551.296,3557.2,"That's good or bad, depending upon whether... whether your interpretation of the statute is right or the other side's."
2007.06-1646,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3557.2,3557.45,--Well--
2007.06-1646,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3557.45,3560.214,It's good to put more people in jail?
2007.06-1646,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3563.76,3577.661,"--I mean only to highlight the practical significance of this issue, Justice Scalia, and again, certainly in enacting a statute that itself deals with the problem of recidivism, we believe that Congress would not have wanted to be insensitive to an offender's past recidivism."
2007.06-1646,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3623.236,3625.623,"Thank you, Mr. Shanmugam."
