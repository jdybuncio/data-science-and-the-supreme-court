2018.17-8995,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.115,8.04500005,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 17-8995, Mont versus United States. Ms. Malone."
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,8.04500005,18.115,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress uses plain, ordinary words in a statute, the words should be read accordingly."
2018.17-8995,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,59.775,64.815,"Well, of course, you got the ben -- you got the benefit of that period in the actual sentence of conviction."
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,69.825,71.71,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-8995,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,84.835,88.55499995,It was treated as if it were part of the sentence?
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,88.55499995,105.27,"In Ohio, what happens when a defendant is sentenced is that the state judge is required to apportion pretrial or official detention towards the credit of the sentence."
2018.17-8995,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,127.35,127.62,If you -- if --
2018.17-8995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,127.62,137.16,"I thought the purposes of pretrial detention were for security issues, were protecting the community from the danger the defendant may pose, correct?"
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,137.16,138.2,That's correct.
2018.17-8995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,138.2,150.09499995,And so I'm assuming your argument is that that period of safety is not a period for conviction; the credit is just a credit; it's not the purpose for the detention?
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,150.09499995,186.07,"Yes, Your Honor, that is exactly the point because, when a person is in official detention, they are being held because they are seen as either a flight risk or a risk to the danger of the community. When a person is imprisoned, on the other hand, the purpose of imprisonment, as it is embodied in Section 33 -- 3553, it says that the four reasons for imprisonment is punishment, retribution, rehabilitation, and incapacitation."
2018.17-8995,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,186.07,186.95,"Well, suppose that --"
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,186.95,187.83,Those are the reasons --
2018.17-8995,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,187.83,188.47,I'm sorry.
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,189.17,189.91,I'm sorry.
2018.17-8995,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,197.46,225.265,"If we look at -- suppose somebody is sentenced to five years in prison and has been in -- in detention for one year, and the judge says I'm sentencing you to five years in prison, but I'm giving you credit for the year in which you were detained prior to trial. Isn't that person imprisoned during that -- that first year?"
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,225.265,227.095,"No, Your Honor."
2018.17-8995,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,244.86,251.79,"Well, suppose the statute said that, upon conviction of this offense, the defendant shall be sentenced to five years imprisonment."
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,270.845,271.855,No.
2018.17-8995,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,311.6,316.38,What are -- what are the cred -- and what would you say the granting of that period was in connection with?
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,316.38,318.87,The granting --
2018.17-8995,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,318.87,320.38,"I mean, that's the language of the statute."
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,329.625,339.355,"He is given credit for the period, but the -- the credit is to the term of imprisonment, not to his official detention."
2018.17-8995,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,339.355,347.83,"But it's the term of imprisonment in connection with the conviction? It's got to be in connection with the conviction, or it wouldn't be -- nothing to credit it to."
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,347.83,348.975,That is correct.
2018.17-8995,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,399.43,402.485,The person is in prison.
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,428.3,435.46,"This is -- this is what I am trying to say, Justice Ginsburg."
2018.17-8995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,474.265,479.805,"He was imprisoned for detention purposes, safety, not for his conviction?"
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,479.805,481.115,That is correct.
2018.17-8995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,481.115,484.01,"So you're back to ""is imprisoned""?"
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,484.01,485.23,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2018.17-8995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,485.23,490.7,And the -- my colleagues are saying there are two textual clues here.
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,550.045,556.07,"If there is a tie, then my reading of the statute --"
2018.17-8995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,556.07,557.06,I didn't say there was.
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,559.63500005,606.69,"Assuming there's a tie, my reading of the statute is that you cannot separate imprisonment with conviction, and the connecting phrase, ""in connection with,"" is a -- is a -- is a broad phrase, but the limiting terms are imprisoned, and it says ""is imprisoned,"" which is important, because that connotes present tense. That connotes something that's happening right at the moment that you're looking to see -- if you take a snapshot of the time that you're determining whether or not supervised release is tolled, then that snapshot is the -- is the imprisonment that is contemplated by the statute."
2018.17-8995,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,606.69,610.06,"Now that's true, and that's -- it raises a very interesting question."
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,670.75,673.61,"Yes, Your Honor, I do understand what you're saying."
2018.17-8995,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,730.4,731.23,But the government --
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,731.23,732.215,So there's a lot --
2018.17-8995,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,732.215,733.63,I'm sorry to interrupt.
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,733.63,753.12,"There's a lot of uncertainty involved, because, in any given moment -- and this is why it's important to take that snapshot approach -- because, at any given moment, a person may, indeed, not be detained. There's no guarantee that a person remains in -- in official detention."
2018.17-8995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,778.79,779.24,They do have --
2018.17-8995,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,779.24,779.83,But the government --
2018.17-8995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,779.83,781.76,"-- a remedy, though, that district court judge."
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,783.375,784.86,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2018.17-8995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,792.3,814.63,"That is something that favors you, the fact that, under the government's reading, if someone is later released or the charges are dismissed, there is no tolling. So that if the charges are dismissed at the end of this detention and no credit is given, then there's no tolling."
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,821.265,822.37,That is correct.
2018.17-8995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,822.37,824.46,That doesn't make much sense.
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,835.56,838.015,"Well, that is the point, Your Honor."
2018.17-8995,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,838.015,843.67,"Well, but it would still -- that's because there's no conviction that it can be in connection to, right?"
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,843.67,844.99,That is correct.
2018.17-8995,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,847.375,849.765,"No, that -- that doesn't help you?"
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,849.765,864.42,"No -- but, yes, actually, under our -- under our reading of the word ""conviction"" under 3624(e), it does help, because a conviction has to include a -- a final judgment."
2018.17-8995,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,864.42,868.59,"Why? I mean, it doesn't say judgment of conviction."
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,868.59,868.95,It just --
2018.17-8995,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,868.95,903.50499995,"And quite often, after the prisoner or offender issues a guilty plea, he says I'm guilty, and a jury may find him guilty, and sentencing may not take place for months, and, when it finally does, then the judgment will enter. Now why isn't his being in jail, once he's pleaded guilty or once the jury has convicted him, why is that not in connection with a conviction?"
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,903.50499995,919.03,It is not a connection -- in connection with a conviction as the term is used in 3624(e) because 3624(e) deals with convictions that have final sentences.
2018.17-8995,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,919.03,954.74000005,"The government -- the government says that we should look at the difference between the phrase ""in connection with"" and the word ""after,"" which Congress could have used, that we should draw some textual significance from that, and that that fits in with the larger purpose that Congress likely had in mind of not allowing double counting of time you've spent physically in prison, as Justice Ginsburg says, as counting as supervised release. So why shouldn't we draw some significance from the use -- what's not used, which is the word ""after""?"
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,954.74000005,998.96,"Justice Kavanaugh, the reason why you would not use the word ""after"" is because, when you have a conviction, and a conviction meaning a final judgment, then, if you use the word ""after,"" you still have a -- you still have a period where the person was held in official detention prior to the -- prior to the entry of the judgment. And the statute has been interpreted in 3624 as requiring a conviction that also includes a judgment."
2018.17-8995,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,998.96,1001.68,Where -- where is that? It doesn't say it in the language.
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,1001.88,1002.59,It does not say that.
2018.17-8995,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1002.59,1004.785,-- so where -- where do you get that from?
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,1004.785,1010.13,"I have -- I get the word ""conviction"" means a final judgment and --"
2018.17-8995,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1010.13,1011.37,I know that's what you think.
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,1017.32,1039.99,"No, it doesn't say it. However, using Section 3624(e) and, indeed, most of the sections under Chapter 229 of -- of Title -- of Title 18, that title is -- is -- is placed there to govern imprisonment. It governs sentences."
2018.17-8995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1072.04,1077.94,"Was this argument raised below, this part of the argument?"
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,1077.94,1105.995,"This part of the argument was raised below, but it was not addressed by the -- by the Sixth Circuit. The statutory -- getting back to the conviction -- in Lott versus United States, and this is in 1961, and Lott defined ""conviction"" as requiring a judgment."
2018.17-8995,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1141.64,1173.055,"What do you do with a situation that happens commonly in district court, and, in fact, there are some statutes, I believe -- I could be wrong -- that require mandatory detention after a guilty plea or a jury finding? So someone can be out and the jury -- there are some judges who do this routinely. The minute that you're convicted, they basically do a new bail hearing and put most people in."
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,1181.84,1198.475,"Your Honor, under 3143 of the Bail Reform Act, that particular section deals with official detention after a plea or -- or a judgment of conviction with respect to a jury verdict."
2018.17-8995,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1226.07,1228.54,That's also true after a judgment of conviction enters.
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,1231.555,1247.4,"That is true, Your Honor, but that is a much more difficult hurdle for a defendant to -- to overcome, because you basically have to prove that your case would be overturned. That's the standard."
2018.17-8995,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1422.74,1424.02,"Well, it is a little different."
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,1428.465,1429.995,That's correct.
2018.17-8995,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1429.995,1446.49,"So, I mean, I understand your point, but it does -- it does seem to me that the -- the imprisonment changes the obligations significantly under supervised release and -- and alters the degree of supervision."
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,1446.49,1449.22,The -- it does alter --
2018.17-8995,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1449.22,1450.16,"I guess -- I guess, just to --"
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,1450.16,1450.66,"-- the degree, but --"
2018.17-8995,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1450.66,1460.88500005,"-- to interrupt, I guess I would say I would think of the period that you're detained as being a lot more like the period you'd be imprisoned than the period when you're out free and being supervised."
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,1460.88500005,1469.07,"As it -- as -- with respect to the being held in custody, you are correct."
2018.17-8995,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1497.94,1498.74,But what do you think --
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,1498.74,1498.8,So --
2018.17-8995,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1498.8,1521.955,"-- is the -- the purpose of supervised release? A person can be -- who is in prison serving a sentence can receive vocational training or any other sort of training, but I thought that the purpose of -- of supervised release or parole was to see how that person would do in the outside world. I don't want to take up your rebuttal time, but --"
2018.17-8995,0,63099,vanessa_f_malone,,1521.955,1522.91,Yes.
2018.17-8995,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1579.36,1588.685,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Ellickson."
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,1588.685,1612.49,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner was not serving his federal term of supervised release during the 10 months when he was sitting in state jail between his arrest and sentencing for new crimes. That conclusion follows from the plain text of Section 3624(e), which broadly tolls supervised release during periods of imprisonment in connection with a conviction."
2018.17-8995,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1612.49,1615.83,"Ms. Ellickson, whatever this is, I don't think it's really clear."
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,1637.115,1642.26,The -- the standard for legislative drafting is to phrase statutes in the present tense.
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1644.12,1649.775,"The Dictionary Act says that the presumption is it's the present tense, but Congress can not do that."
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,1649.775,1650.37,Yes.
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1650.37,1651.405,So go ahead and finish.
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,1651.405,1672.685,"Yes, now that's correct, but we know that Congress has, in at least one other statute that it passed at the same time in the Sentencing Reform Act, used the present tense to describe a period that -- of tolling that -- where the tolling would be subject to a later determination. And Congress thought that present tense was an appropriate way to -- to frame the statute there."
2018.17-8995,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1686.44,1697.335,"I mean, ""in connection with,"" as I say, I totally accept your point that it's very broad, but the question is whether it can effectively change the tense of the statute just because it's so broad."
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,1702.45,1704.76,It's not changing the tense of the statute.
2018.17-8995,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1721.04,1724.635,"But doesn't it? Because if -- let's, you know, go back a little bit in the statute."
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,1745.115,1753.145,"I disagree, Your Honor, because the -- the phrase ""do not run"" is used to describe the period that will be considered the tolled period."
2018.17-8995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1759.115,1765.87,"The inquiry doesn't, but why don't you read the sentence as you think it really means it? Just read the sentence as you think it means it."
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,1765.87,1767.63,What the sentence means is if there --
2018.17-8995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1767.63,1769.045,"No, no, don't tell me what it means."
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,1805.17,1816.21,"Your Honor, I would read the statute to say that at the moment that an inquiry into the tolling status of a period of imprisonment becomes necessary, at that moment, you determine whether there is --"
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1816.21,1823.65,"Wouldn't you draft the statute clearly, more clearly, and in a different way if that's what Congress intended?"
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,1823.65,1824.61,There are --
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1824.61,1832.61,"As Justice Ginsburg -- as Justice -- my, now I've done it -- as Justice Kagan has just said to you -- (Laughter.)"
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1832.61,1842.66,"-- there is ambiguity, doesn't that ambiguity suggest that there is a clearer way to write this if that's what Congress intended?"
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,1842.66,1844.4,There may have been other language that Congress --
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1844.4,1848.69,"They could, instead of imprisonment, they could have said for any period of detention."
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,1848.69,1849.34,There --
2018.17-8995,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1849.34,1860.36,"But they could have -- I mean, what they could have said -- I think closer to what Justice Breyer was looking for -- any period in which the person is considered to have been imprisoned in connection with a conviction."
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,1860.36,1861.37,That's a --
2018.17-8995,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1861.37,1883.305,"And I -- I -- I mean, the difficulty is that they're engaging in -- in something of a legal fiction because there's a conviction and the judge says, well, you're getting five years and we're going to start counting 10 months ago. I mean, the -- the -- the process of imposing the sentence sort of changes the nature of how the period has been counted."
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,1890.995,1894.13,"Yes, I think there are -- there are different ways the statute could have been phrased."
2018.17-8995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1894.13,1896.645,My problem is I think it's unambiguous.
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,1915.15,1916.815,"Well, it's possible --"
2018.17-8995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1916.815,1917.83,But I --
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,1917.83,1950.845,"-- although that -- the formulation that Your Honor just proposed actually suggests that the tolling would apply only to imprisonment that preceded the conviction. And Congress evidently wanted to make sure to have a more capacious understanding of the type of imprisonment that would qualify. And that makes sense in the context of the supervised release scheme because supervised release, and time imprisonment, imprisoned, they're ultimately incompatible states. And it made sense that Congress would want to limit the number of situations where a person would be deemed to be serving a term of supervised release while they were in custody."
2018.17-8995,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1950.845,1953.55,"Well, your friend on the other side suggests that's not true."
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,1959.73,1987.26,"My understanding is that that's not -- that's not correct, that the probation office generally treats pretrial detention as triggering tolling, that they are not capable of supervising defendants in -- including in jail in pretrial detention in the way that they can on the outside. And there are a number of things that probation officers do when defendants are out in the community that are simply not possible in jail. Ordering drug testing, for example, asking the defendant to participate in certain types of community treatment --"
2018.17-8995,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1987.26,1990.985,Why is drug testing? I -- I assume they do drug testing in prison on a pretty regular basis.
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,1990.985,1993.63,They -- they may -- the jailing facility may well do that.
2018.17-8995,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1999.28,2003.1,Which may be different than the -- than the supervised release.
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2019.26,2023.34,"It's -- it's -- it's a very awkward situation, Your Honor."
2018.17-8995,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2048.19,2065.62,"Even under -- am I right about this -- that even under your view of the statute, you will run into that problem in certain situations? You'll run into it when the confinement is for fewer than 30 days, and you'll run into it when the defendant ends up being acquitted."
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2066.395,2067.455,"Yes, that's correct."
2018.17-8995,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2067.455,2069.465,So why is this so different?
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2069.465,2074.88,"Well, this is -- the difference here is this is going to be a much larger swath of defendants."
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2115.78,2158.5,"But why? The probation office determination or the judge's determination is by a preponderance of the evidence. An acquittal really doesn't tell you whether or not that defendant had successfully integrated into the community or not because the judge could always hold a hearing and by a preponderance of the evidence find that he or she hadn't, and still keep them longer, maybe until the earlier case is decided. But the point is that it seems to me that that acquittal -- I don't understand the legislative grace or how you get it out of the language of this statute."
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2158.5,2177.35,"It is true that a defendant who is acquitted or has charges dismissed may have also failed on supervised release, but Congress determined that it wasn't necessary to have automatic tolling in that circumstance. Perhaps Congress was concerned that there was a possibility that the defendant was jailed by mistake, or perhaps Congress wanted to --"
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2177.35,2178.57,But if he wasn't --
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2178.57,2179.13,If --
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2179.13,2187.985,"-- and he was -- he would have been just as detained, why shouldn't the time under your reading be extended?"
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2187.985,2201.75,"Well, the difference for that defendant is that we know that defendant will get no credit against another sentence for his time in jail, whereas a defendant who is ultimately convicted will, almost invariably, get credit for that presentencing detention."
2018.17-8995,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2201.75,2202.26,But doesn't the --
2018.17-8995,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2202.26,2221.18,"Can you just back up and explain how we get into this mess and why we need tolling? How does supervised release work? That is, in -- in -- in this case, the defendant failed two drug tests while he was on supervised release."
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2243.66,2296.285,"That's a matter for the -- the sentencing judge has to determine at what point it becomes -- the defendant's noncompliance with supervised release rises to the level where it might warrant revocation proceedings. In this case, the judge determined to defer that decision until after the state prosecutions concluded, at least until the defendant was sentenced on those prosecutions, which is not uncommon. Often judges, federal judges, when faced with a defendant who has been accused of a new crime, wants to see how -- how that unfolds in the other jurisdiction before rushing to judgment, perhaps, on what the -- whether the defendant is or is not guilty of the offense. It would certainly be appropriate for the -- the judge, the federal judge, to make a determination before that if they chose to, but many of the judges want to wait and see what happens."
2018.17-8995,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2296.285,2311.02,And that's totally up to the individual judge? There are no guidelines for when the released person has done something that warrants putting him back in prison?
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2311.02,2339.05,"There are guidelines. And I think when -- in -- in a case like this one where the defendant has violated criminal laws on supervised release, that's a serious violation that as a general matter should warrant revocation. But the question is the timing of the revocation and whether the revocation has to come immediately or whether the district court can potentially defer that adjudication to allow the parallel -- the new criminal proceedings to unfold. In this case --"
2018.17-8995,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2339.05,2351.235,"Under a legislative grace argument, I think we have a choice between reading ""in connection with"" capaciously or reading it kind of, I think you would characterize, hypertextually."
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2375.24,2375.785,Yes.
2018.17-8995,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2388.25,2393.48,"But the same purpose would still be served in that circumstance, correct?"
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2393.48,2394.615,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-8995,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2433.51,2439.23,And why -- what do you think the reasonable policy call is there? Can you explain why they would do it that way?
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2439.23,2463.57,"It may be because -- I think the -- the -- the inference that I would draw is that Congress may have believed that a defendant who is jailed but not ultimately convicted has not necessarily failed on supervised release. In that circumstance, the supervised release scheme gives the federal judge tools to determine whether it is nevertheless appropriate to revoke the defendant for that conduct."
2018.17-8995,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2463.57,2471.4,"Even though, by definition, the person would have been in jail for a longer -- a potentially long period of time?"
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2471.4,2498.59,"It is -- it is -- it is certainly possible that -- that they -- the district court who sentenced them may determine that they require additional supervised release and that whatever put them in jail was, in fact, an indication that they were failing on supervised release and that they needed to have their supervised release revoked. In that context, the -- the federal judge would have the option of revoking supervised release, imposing a new sentence of imprisonment, and imposing more supervised release."
2018.17-8995,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2498.59,2507.845,"I can see why it seems just unfair at a big picture level, but I guess I'm not seeing the policy call other than that."
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2507.845,2510.515,The question is just what the default should be.
2018.17-8995,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2535.86,2548.49,"Suppose the -- the defendant, while in the -- while in pretrial detention, does something that would constitute a violation of the conditions of supervised release."
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2552.415,2574.56,"If the status of the defendant's imprisonment was not at that time clear, if it was not yet clear whether the defendant was going to be imprisoned for more than 30 days in connection with a conviction, then the defendant would not, as a practical matter, be on supervised release in -- while in pretrial detention, because it's possible that the supervised release term was not running. If it becomes clear --"
2018.17-8995,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2574.56,2574.84,I'm sorry.
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2583.955,2602.315,"That's correct because -- because, at that point, when -- when it -- when we have not yet determined whether the term of supervised release is running, then the defendant is -- can't be subject to the terms of supervised release, and then later it might turn out that the term of supervised release was running because he was not convicted."
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2610.14,2610.2,So --
2018.17-8995,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2610.2,2621.905,And would the district court during that time have jurisdiction to consider -- to adjudicate an alleged violation that occurred before incarceration?
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2621.905,2622.11,Yes.
2018.17-8995,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2622.23,2625.31,Where it would not be deprived of jurisdiction during that period?
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2625.31,2642.315,"No, that's correct. And during any period in which the defendant's -- the tolling status of a period of imprisonment is unclear, the district court's jurisdiction would not be unclear because the district court, as long as the supervised release term has not yet ended, would be able to adjudicate a violation that occurred before."
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2642.315,2649.41,So let's assume the following hypothetical: Defendant is arrested for drug charges.
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2666.385,2668.28,"Well, so -- so under --"
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2668.28,2670.09,He can't issue a warrant then?
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2670.09,2670.4,Yes.
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2683.74,2693.755,"That -- that's what renders the ""is imprisoned"" language a little bit suspect in this statute, because you're sort of looking backwards all the time."
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2693.755,2695.15,There is --
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2695.15,2702.72,"Instead of looking at present moment, the suspension period starts 30 days after detention, you're looking forward."
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2715.82,2725.6,"Your Honor, I think that we -- that the rule in the court of appeals below was that pretrial -- they -- they had the rule that we're advocating here, which is that pretrial detention forward --"
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2725.6,2727.07,"All right, so they didn't have to reach it?"
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2727.07,2727.375,Yes.
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2727.375,2728.55,And it wasn't argued?
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2728.55,2729.02,Yes.
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2729.41,2735.73,"Has any other court argued that point -- or, I'm sorry, not argued, addressed that issue and decided it?"
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2735.73,2736.62,The Ninth --
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2736.62,2738.97,"There's at least two, Ninth Circuit and --"
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2738.97,2739.62,Yes.
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2739.62,2746.18,-- and one other circuit who are -- who are on Petitioner's side.
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2749.025,2760.235,"The Ninth Circuit, in one of their opinions on this issue at least, they determined that -- in that case, it was a very short period of imprisonment that followed the -- the entry of the defendant's guilty plea."
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2764.5,2764.93,In that case?
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2764.93,2765.18,Yes.
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2765.18,2767.825,But they didn't address the legal question in full?
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2767.825,2772.22,"They -- they -- they made a quick -- they had a quick discussion of it, but --"
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2772.22,2772.96,All right.
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2786.47,2809.26,"If this Court is addressing the question that the courts below addressed, which is the status of -- whether the -- the imprisonment here was in connection with a conviction, under either understanding of what ""conviction"" could -- could mean in the statute, the defendant's imprisonment here would qualify because, certainly, if the conviction means the entry of the -- of the guilty plea or the --"
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2809.26,2818.475,"No, no, I'm saying if we agree on the question -- with her on the question granted, why should we reach your alternative argument?"
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2818.475,2819.32,"Oh, sorry."
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2819.32,2832.6,"That -- that -- that once he entered a -- a conviction, the detention changed from security to -- to imprisonment for a conviction?"
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2832.6,2834.79,"Your Honor, this -- this is part of the question presented."
2018.17-8995,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2849.78,2853.04,I guess I -- I'm -- I'm still struggling with that question.
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2872.905,2875.73,"That's one -- certainly, the Court could do that."
2018.17-8995,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2883.03,2883.55,I got that.
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2883.55,2897.5,"But once the -- once the Court determines that that's not the appropriate line, presumably, it will be answering the question of -- of where the line falls, and to answer that question, the Court would have to determine whether the period between a guilty plea or verdict --"
2018.17-8995,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2897.5,2900.53,"Or we could remand it, right?"
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2900.53,2903.27,The Court can certainly do whatever the Court wants to do. (Laughter.)
2018.17-8995,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2903.27,2907.49,And I was just -- I was just giving you an opportunity to tell me why we wouldn't do that.
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2908.66,2915.51,"No, no, I'm -- I'm -- I -- I would say that the Court -- I would -- I would urge the Court to decide the question because it is --"
2018.17-8995,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2915.51,2917.2,Even if you lose that one too?
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2917.2,2918.35,"Well, maybe -- maybe --"
2018.17-8995,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2918.35,2921.57,Maybe not then. (Laughter.)
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,2921.57,2955.55,"But -- but I would also like to just address the fact that Petitioner's reading is in -- in conflict with the text of the statute and with the statutory scheme that Congress has set up here. With respect to the text of the statute, the phrase ""in connection with a conviction"" is inherently broad and it indicates that Congress intended for a broad range of imprisonment to toll supervised release, not just imprisonment after a conviction, not just imprisonment as a result of a conviction. Congress has used that alternative language in other statutes."
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3072.86,3073.91,Is there a reason --
2018.17-8995,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3073.91,3074.09,"Well, that --"
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3074.09,3074.55,I'm -- I'm sorry.
2018.17-8995,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3074.55,3080.12,"I was going to say that's just because, I mean, they're going to have different periods of preconviction detention as well."
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,3080.12,3087.02,"Yes, Your Honor, but -- but they will -- they will have the same -- they have the same period of imprisonment on their sentence."
2018.17-8995,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3099.95,3105.86,"Well, in some sentencings, judges may say you get credit for the time in pretrial detention and others would say you don't."
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,3117.845,3139.18,"Well, Your Honor, in terms of the -- the crediting of supervised -- of -- of pretrial detention, I would -- I'd like to note that it is actually, in the large majority of jurisdictions, it is required and automatic that your time in pretrial detention be credited to your sentence. That's the rule in the federal system, in 45 states, and in the District of Columbia. There are five states that have potential for -- for credit as well."
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3140.42,3162.33,"Could you tell me if there's a cost to filing a warrant by a judge?

2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,3162.33,3162.89,Well --
2018.17-8995,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3162.89,3169.145,-- that would be a reason why a judge wouldn't just issue a warrant when someone's arrested?
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,3169.145,3186.77,"In theory, a judge could issue a warrant, but it's a little bit of an odd answer to the problem presented by the defendant who goes to jail during supervised release. And, in fact, it was -- the 3583(i) warrant procedure was not added to the statute until 1994, which is 10 years after Congress designed --"
2018.17-8995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3186.77,3190.955,"What -- what -- what would you want to say, if anything? Imagine you lose everything."
2018.17-8995,1,63100,jenny_ellickson,,3209.385,3256.235,"The statutory language indicates that ""conviction"" means the adjudication of guilt by a plea or trial. You can look to the first sentence of 3624(e), which is not the tolling provision, but it is an -- an earlier part of the -- the same -- the same statutory provision where it refers to a sentence. And the fact that 3624(e) elsewhere uses the word ""sentence"" but decided to shift to the word ""conviction"" in the context of the tolling provision indicates that Congress intended to refer to a different moment, a different event in the criminal adjudicative proceedings. We also know in the Sentencing Reform Act that Congress regularly used the word ""conviction"" or ""convicted"" to refer to the state of being adjudicated guilty before the entry of a sentence."
