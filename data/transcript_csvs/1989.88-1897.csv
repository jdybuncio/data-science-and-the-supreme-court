1989.88-1897,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.654,"We'll hear argument now in No. 88-1897, the Michigan Department of State Police v. Rick Sitz."
1989.88-1897,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,10.522,14.574,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1989.88-1897,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,89.605,99.162,"Mr. Casey, this action was brought as a facial challenge of some kind to the program?"
1989.88-1897,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,99.162,99.512,That's correct.
1989.88-1897,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,99.512,106.899,And the plaintiffs in the case are simply citizens who drive in Michigan?
1989.88-1897,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,106.899,107.768,That's correct.
1989.88-1897,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,107.768,114.172,No one was a plaintiff named in the case who had been stopped at a checkpoint?
1989.88-1897,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,114.172,118.041,The complaint was filed before any sobriety checkpoints had been operated.
1989.88-1897,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,118.041,120.909,Do you think that the plaintiffs have standing?
1989.88-1897,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,120.909,122.293,I believe they do.
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1015.163,1023.669,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1897,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1092.496,1099.733,"Mr. Nightingale, going back to Justice O'Connor's question, is the problem any less serious with regard to firearms?"
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1099.733,1109.089,"I believe that there were more people killed in traffic crashes, Your Honor, than there were in... by murder."
1989.88-1897,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1109.089,1111.672,"But only 25 percent of those are alcohol related, I thought you said."
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1111.672,1116.826,"Well, in... 25 percent of the drivers involved are legally intoxicated."
1989.88-1897,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1124.114,1124.948,How do guns compare?
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1128.15,1136.822,"--I believe that the number of murders in the country... and this is a rough recollection of something I read along the way... is on the order of 20,000."
1989.88-1897,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1138.222,1141.274,"Pretty serious problem, too, isn't it?"
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1141.274,1141.81,--Host of very serious problems.
1989.88-1897,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1141.81,1144.093,How about drug traffic?
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1150.416,1152.799,"It's certainly a very serious national problem, yes."
1989.88-1897,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1152.799,1160.772,"So, can the government set up stop-and-frisk points for pedestrians in drug use areas of cities?"
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1160.772,1171.079,"You Honor, a frisk is a much more intrusive form of interference with 4th Amendment interests than a traffic stop."
1989.88-1897,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1195.528,1200.147,"The government cannot insist that you have a license to walk along the sidewalk, can it?"
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1200.147,1202.58,"No, Your Honor, I wouldn't think so."
1989.88-1897,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1202.58,1205.599,And it does have the right to insist that you have a license to drive.
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1205.599,1213.287,"That's true, driving is a very highly regulated activity in this country, in keeping with the risk that it presents to others on the road."
1989.88-1897,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1213.287,1221.06,"So it's not inconceivable that you might have a traffic stop not just for intoxication, but for drug use."
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1226.964,1238.688,"I believe that at least under the Department of Transportation's guidelines, as a result of recent regulation, that drug use and alcohol use are treated the same."
1989.88-1897,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1238.688,1251.995,"Well, speaking of statistics, I think there are more deaths by automobile accidents than in all the wars of this country put together."
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1257.399,1261.685,"Right... yes, Your Honor, and also in the concurring opinion that you wrote, I believe."
1989.88-1897,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1261.685,1265.339,How do we decide how effective this is?
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1276.195,1287.086,"I would think not, Justice Scalia, in this sense: in a number of the Court's cases you have had to assess, necessarily, the deterrent effect of various programs."
1989.88-1897,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1324.258,1328.71,"Yes, but have we done it in cases when the trial court has reviewed evidence on the issue and their record has been developed?"
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1339.35,1343.485,"--Well, I think it's important to focus on the sort of trial record that was developed here."
1989.88-1897,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1355.193,1359.062,--Whatever the record was is what the state put in in order to justify the program.
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1365.466,1373.172,"That's true, Your Honor... not necessarily true that I could have tried it better, but it's certainly true the state had an opportunity to put in the evidence."
1989.88-1897,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1407.162,1411.797,"We never viewed our role as just deciding the case or controversy that's brought to us for decision, I suppose."
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1411.797,1426.306,"--Well, that's certainly true, but I think in this case the question is whether there is a reasonable basis for a conclusion on the part of the state authorities that this is a potentially effective means of reducing drinking and driving."
1989.88-1897,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1426.306,1432.008,"Is that all it takes, a reasonable basis in order to make the weighing of whether this is a reasonable intrusion of privacy or not?"
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1453.539,1455.189,"In this case, Your Honor, two people were--"
1989.88-1897,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1455.189,1455.908,Suppose I think that?
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1455.908,1457.658,--I think that--
1989.88-1897,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1457.658,1460.11,"Do I have to say well, the legislature might have thought otherwise?"
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1463.562,1484.226,"--Because the test is not that searching at this stage, where the issue is the base of the program against a background of a very minimal intrusion on privacy and very, very constrained limits on discretion."
1989.88-1897,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1486.809,1490.027,But it's still not clear to me what we looked at... how do we decide reasonableness?
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1490.027,1493.664,--I believe that you look--
1989.88-1897,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1493.664,1495.364,Are these statistics irrelevant?
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1495.364,1502.87,--I believe that the statistics demonstrate... confirm what common sense suggests in this area.
1989.88-1897,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1505.472,1506.589,So we do look at the statistics?
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1507.222,1509.341,"--I think you may look at them, yes."
1989.88-1897,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1522.315,1525.267,How long was the program in operation before the suit was brought?
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1525.267,1527.067,There was one checkpoint operated.
1989.88-1897,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1527.067,1528.083,For how long?
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1528.083,1529.135,For about an hour.
1989.88-1897,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1541.527,1544.144,Then it was stopped because the Court enjoined it?
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1544.144,1545.344,That's correct.
1989.88-1897,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1555.119,1559.254,"Mr. Nightingale, I'll have to take back what I said."
1989.88-1897,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1562.106,1603.599,"Now, why... getting back to Justice Scalia's question about why it would be reasonable for the Court to put a program like this in place, experience demonstrates that only between one in 200 and one in 2,000 drunk drivers can be apprehended on an average weekend night, and therefore it's been the focus of efforts to improve on the situation in this area, to achieve more visibility, to achieve a more impressive reminder of the state's commitment to curbing drunk driving."
1989.88-1897,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1604.566,1607.301,"Thank you, Mr. Nightingale."
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,1611.753,1616.907,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1897,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1694.489,1696.306,How about Martinez-Fuerte?
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,1696.306,1713.284,"Martinez-Fuerte... Justice Powell, in his decision in that case, in a footnote, indicated that many of the seizures which take place in a... at the border search or at the border stops, resulted in something which did not go to a formal charge."
1989.88-1897,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1714.2,1716.736,"But it was... it was enforcing the criminal law, nonetheless?"
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,1716.736,1717.086,--That's correct.
1989.88-1897,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1757.044,1763.298,"Well, to... to say that they're... end up not being prosecuted doesn't mean they weren't being used to enforce the criminal law."
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,1767.352,1771.304,But... but it wasn't being enforced through means of a prosecution was the point.
1989.88-1897,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1771.304,1772.92,"Well, why does that make any difference?"
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,1772.92,1774.839,"Well, it makes a... it would make a difference--"
1989.88-1897,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1774.839,1779.16,"I mean, did the cases you rely on, last year, make that point?"
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,1779.16,1780.41,--Excuse me?
1989.88-1897,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1780.41,1785.064,"Did the cases you rely on that we decided last year, Von Raab and the other--"
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,1785.064,1785.53,Skinner.
1989.88-1897,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1785.53,1789.397,"--Skinner case, make the point that you're making?"
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,1789.397,1790.047,Yes.
1989.88-1897,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1810.395,1823.286,"Well, but, I thought the point you were making was that Martinez-Fuerte was really not a criminal case, because so few people were prosecuted under it?"
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,1823.286,1824.321,"No, that's not what I'm saying."
1989.88-1897,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1847.603,1850.555,"Well, but that doesn't mean it's an admitted... an administrative scheme."
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,1858.042,1875.003,"Well, I would... in... in response to your original question, Mr. Chief Justice, I would also indicate to the Court that this Court has indicated since Martinez-Fuerte that there is... there is a... a nexus to the border... the border which allowed the Court to make the decision in Martinez-Fuerte as it did."
1989.88-1897,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1898.952,1913.711,"Mr. Granzotto, what... what do you do about truck checkpoints on... which exist on many state highways, requiring trucks to pull over to determine whether they're overloaded and whether their safety equipment is operational?"
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,1913.711,1932.006,"To some extent, those cases may fell... fall within the balancing test, even under this Court's decision in Von Raab and Skinner, because they may involve, in particular states certainly, noncriminal prosecutions, or at least a situation in which there is both an administrative aspect--"
1989.88-1897,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1932.006,1932.473,"Well... well, okay, I'll make up one."
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,1939.176,1952.919,"--Well, there's another construct to the Fourth Amendment which may come into play in the situation of a truck and a weigh station, and that is the heavily regulated industry concept which has been developed by the Court and applied in a number of cases."
1989.88-1897,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1955.704,1957.404,Heavily regulated industry... I don't know.
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,1962.792,1967.696,--But it is... excuse me... it is regulated because of the weight of the vehicle.
1989.88-1897,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1973.416,1974.166,It seems to me circular.
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,1978.534,1979.003,--No.
1989.88-1897,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1994.829,1998.965,How long had this checkpoint--
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,2004.685,2005.085,Yes.
1989.88-1897,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2036.34,2042.827,How long had this checkpoint been in operation before it was stopped by the court order?
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,2042.827,2044.096,This court case?
1989.88-1897,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2065.775,2073.864,"If... if you sought to enjoin it before it even was established, then how did you expect the state to have any statistical evidence as to its operation?"
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,2073.864,2075.531,"--Justice Kennedy, this program--"
1989.88-1897,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2075.531,2080.202,"The... the sooner you bring it, the... the better off your suit is, because the state has no statistics to back up what they're doing?"
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,2080.202,2080.635,--No.
1989.88-1897,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2132.285,2141.14,"So... so it was improper, in your view, for Michigan to even enact this statute and... and... and to try to administer the roadblock on its own and gather its own statistics?"
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,2141.14,2141.94,--That's correct.
1989.88-1897,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2141.94,2158.685,"Mr. Granzotto, would it have made a difference if these weren't stops along the way, but if these were... suppose they set up at the... at the entrance to... to Michigan highways?"
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,2178.028,2197.107,"Well, my position is that, with respect to a... an investigation and attempting to find criminal wrongdoing, that there is something fundamentally different about that, and a stop for... a for vehicle code violation or... or a toll booth."
1989.88-1897,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2197.107,2198.44,"Well, it's hard to separate the one from the other."
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,2216.799,2219.085,But the purpose is achieved through the enforcement of the criminal law.
1989.88-1897,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2219.085,2224.989,"--Well, likewise, in the case I just spoke about, when they're checking you to get on the road."
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,2233.575,2234.26,No.
1989.88-1897,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2234.26,2236.61,"But if they arrest you for bad brakes, then it becomes bad?"
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,2236.61,2236.962,No.
1989.88-1897,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2324.584,2330.055,How did he define significant and how did he define worthless?
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,2330.055,2347.017,"It's not exactly defined, but what Dr. Ross I believe was talking about when we was talking about worthless is that you are taking, you are removing a number of officers from a practice which does have positive effect, and that is roving patrols."
1989.88-1897,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2357.455,2378.619,"Well, so the... the... if the state feels differently, if the state after evaluating its enforcement proceedings feels that the roving patrols don't do the job and that this checkpoint should at least be given a try, they're not entitled to do that if some expert takes the stand and says it... it... I think differently."
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,2378.619,2379.238,No.
1989.88-1897,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2379.804,2381.69,"Well, isn't that about what it amounts to?"
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,2381.69,2390.628,"--No, no, because, Mr. Chief Justice, in this case the... the witnesses called by the state, their own witnesses--"
1989.88-1897,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2390.628,2391.378,"Well, no, but I was talking about--"
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,2391.378,2391.911,--acknowledged--
1989.88-1897,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2391.911,2393.83,--I was talking about Dr. Ross's testimony.
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,2399.401,2399.951,--That's correct.
1989.88-1897,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2399.951,2406.555,Well... and I take it you're relying on that testimony because you feel it supports the finding of the trial court.
1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,2417.113,2428.069,"What is important about this case is that the witnesses who testified for the state in this case, the... Colonel Hough, who was the head of the Michigan State Police, testified--"

1989.88-1897,2,35879,mark_granzotto,,2430.652,2437.174,--Absolutely not because Dr. Ross's testimony was absolutely consistent with every piece of evidence presented in this case.
1989.88-1897,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2437.174,2437.807,"Well, okay."

1989.88-1897,3,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3347.234,3348.136,"No, I don't agree with that."
1989.88-1897,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3349.72,3352.005,Because that... that bears upon the scope of intrusion.
