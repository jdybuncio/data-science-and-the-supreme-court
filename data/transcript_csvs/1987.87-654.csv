1987.87-654,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.088,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-654, New Energy Company of Indiana versus Joanne Limbach."
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,14.031,23.755,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.87-654,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,119.309,136.199,"Mr. Schwartz, what if all we had in front of us was an Ohio statute that granted a tax credit to producers of ethanol in Ohio, no reciprocity provision."
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,142.035,145.746,"Yes, Your Honor, if it grants a tax credit only to Ohio ethanol, yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-654,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,145.746,152.931,Do you think that would be true if Ohio had a serious concern about its citizens' health problems?
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,152.931,154.531,Yes.
1987.87-654,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,154.531,160.475,Do you think it couldn't provide a tax credit to encourage the production and use of ethanol in Ohio?
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,160.475,161.627,Yes.
1987.87-654,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,177.137,178.527,"Well, let me ask you this."
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,189.193,190.164,Yes.
1987.87-654,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,191.356,192.185,It could do that?
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,192.185,192.786,Yes.
1987.87-654,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,193.427,198.249,You don't think that a tax credit is essentially the same thing as a bonus?
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,198.249,199.711,"No, it's not, Your Honor."
1987.87-654,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,220.355,229.441,"Well, I guess it's a little hard though to distinguish between an outright grant of state money and an extension of a tax credit?"
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,229.441,230.061,Right.
1987.87-654,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,290.51,299.426,So you would just distinguish the Alexandria Scrap type situation based on the fact that this is within the tax structure?
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,299.426,300.077,--That's right.
1987.87-654,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,330.266,333.988,"Mr. Schwartz, I'm not sure you'd really hold to that line."
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,360.805,363.149,"Yes, Your Honor, I would say that."
1987.87-654,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,363.149,363.958,You would.
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,363.958,364.649,Because it is not a tax.
1987.87-654,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,365.61,368.562,"As long as it's not a tax, you can do whatever you like to--"
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,368.562,372.413,"--Well, you can spend your money in any way you want so long as you're not taxing."
1987.87-654,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,376.806,385.342,"--So I can subsidize an in-state produce but only if he ships nothing out of state and as soon as he ships out of state, he looses the subsidy and that doesn't interfere with the Commerce Clause?"
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,385.342,396.919,"Well, I think that's right because I think at that point, it comes close to the market participant doctrine although there is a danger that that doctrine could swallow up the entire situation."
1987.87-654,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,421.045,422.757,A volume--
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,423.488,424.908,Pardon?
1987.87-654,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,424.908,425.839,A volume of logic.
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,425.839,428.281,I stand corrected.
1987.87-654,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,669.659,672.901,May I stop you on that point just for a moment.
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,679.266,680.117,"--Right, Your Honor."
1987.87-654,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,680.117,690.892,And it isn't altogether clear to me whether or not there was an additional purpose to provide a cleaner and safer environment for Ohio citizens.
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,690.892,693.594,"Your Honor, that's a-troubling point."
1987.87-654,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,723.783,732.76,"If it was a purpose of the legislature, how does that affect the legal analysis?"
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,732.76,738.083,"Not at all, Your Honor, because if it were, there would still be a least drastic alternative test."
1987.87-654,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,814.933,821.308,Do we have cases which say that it's improper to try to influence the policies of other states'?
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,821.308,828.123,"Yes, there are, but of course, it depends on the method of influence."
1987.87-654,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,879.386,883.239,So the objective itself is legitimate to try to influence the policy of other states?
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,883.239,883.99,"That objective, yes, Your Honor, yes."
1987.87-654,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,887.78,899.1,What if Ohio felt that coal-fired energy plants in Indiana to the west of it were producing a lot of acid rain in Indiana.
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,906.784,914.35,"If that were the least drastic way of dealing with that very serious health problem, the answer would be, yes."
1987.87-654,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,914.35,920.852,What's the leading case that you can think of that applies the least drastic alternative test in this situation?
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,920.852,927.367,"Well, I'm not quite sure by, this situation, but the cases I rely on are Dean Milk."
1987.87-654,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,927.367,929.858,"Did that use the term, least drastic?"
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,929.858,930.398,Yes.
1987.87-654,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,941.566,951.143,"I thought Dean used the reasonable alternative analysis, it said whether there's a reasonable alternative."
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,951.143,961.669,"I don't think so, Your Honor, because I think as I recall Justice Black was unhappy because it was using First Amendment doctrine, and I think he commented on that."
1987.87-654,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1011.861,1014.943,"But, Mr. Schwartz, it's one thing to say you have to look at other alternatives."
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,1014.943,1015.664,Right.
1987.87-654,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1015.664,1019.458,It's quite another thing to say you must employ the least drastic of these alternatives.
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,1019.458,1029.663,"Well, Your Honor, even if it's not least drastic, the Court certainly has insisted on less burdensome, and there are less burdensome."
1987.87-654,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1295.156,1316.681,"Mr. Schwartz, before you go on to the new argument, will you tell me why this is different from what we have clearly allowed that is facially discriminatory and that is the assessment by a state of a compensating use tax."
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,1350.814,1357.428,"--Your Honor, I think the difference is, and the case you're talking about is obviously Henneford v. Silas Mason, that line of case."
1987.87-654,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1357.428,1358.059,Right.
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,1358.529,1359.1,Right.
1987.87-654,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1499.709,1503.793,"Well, that doesn't explain Alexandria Scrap, I don't think."
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,1503.793,1517.462,"It doesn't explain it fully except Justice Powell referred to the case as, I think the Reeves case as a situation in which the State was really acting as a purchaser."
1987.87-654,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1520.694,1521.846,"Well, I don't think so."
1987.87-654,0,28111,herman_schwartz,,1537.606,1539.436,--Yes.
1987.87-654,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1636.48,1637.852,"Thank you, Mr. Schwartz."
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,1640.273,1644.184,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1987.87-654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1821.792,1827.465,"When under your view of it did Ohio enter the market, in 1981 or 1984?"
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,1827.465,1838.034,"Justice Stevens, I believe Ohio entered the market initially when it first enacted the credit provision 1981."
1987.87-654,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1865.74,1873.597,"Mr. Farrin, do you really think it solves matters to simply say it's the application of a state subsidy?"
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,1906.028,1914.764,"Justice Scalia, initially I think from an economic standpoint, that's a very unlikely event."
1987.87-654,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1920.617,1923.239,I didn't ask either of those questions.
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,1931.253,1942.64,"I do not think it would be to simply use a tax exemption to favor local business with no other purpose, I do not believe would be constitutional, Justice Scalia."
1987.87-654,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1942.64,1945.923,So subsidy isn't the answer.
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,1950.207,1957.901,"Your Honor, I submit under Alexandria Scrap that a direct subsidy may in fact be unlimited."
1987.87-654,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2029.768,2037.653,"Well, it's purpose is to insist that other states do it Ohio's way, isn't it?"
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2037.653,2048.111,"Justice Kennedy, I was speaking of the scheme as a whole, and I think that's what Alexandria Scrap looked at, the scheme as a whole was intended to further a legitimate state purpose."
1987.87-654,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2049.77,2059.618,"But it did so in a way that penalized producers from one state and not others, and incidentally helped Ohio producers."
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2059.618,2071.346,"--Justice Kennedy, I don't think the record indicates whether or not it did help Ohio producers or whether it was intended to help Ohio producers viz a viz their foreign competitors."
1987.87-654,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2071.346,2073.607,"Well, it didn't hurt Ohio producers, did it?"
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2073.607,2077.34,"I would be amazed if it hurt Ohio producers, Justice Kennedy."
1987.87-654,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2093.08,2096.644,"Well, there, the State was actually buying the hulks."
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2101.018,2107.14,"--Justice Kennedy, I don't believe that the State of Maryland was purchasing hulks in the Alexandria Scrap."
1987.87-654,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2120.97,2127.643,"Well, it's giving a tax credit which has the same economic effect as a subsidy, isn't that right?"
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2127.643,2136.769,"Justice O'Connor, that's correct, it's a tax credit, but I submit that it would be extremely formalistic to suggest that it is different in form."
1987.87-654,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2136.769,2146.746,"Well, have we ever applied the market participant theory to a tax scheme in a state?"
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2146.746,2148.927,"No, Justice O'Connor, this Court has not."
1987.87-654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2148.927,2157.232,"Yes, but isn't there a difference in Alexandria Scrap the hulks that they wanted to get rid of were all located in Maryland, weren't they?"
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2194.658,2208.216,"Justice Stevens, the reason why Ohio is attempting to encourage other states to pass similar credits is so that ethanol will be used in those states."
1987.87-654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2208.216,2211.759,But what does Ohio care about whether ethanol's used in those states.
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2217.422,2227.888,"Justice Stevens, I think Ohio is also legitimately concerned in the clean air of other states."
1987.87-654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2227.888,2228.569,In Indiana?
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2230.011,2231.992,"Justice Stevens, that air comes into Ohio."
1987.87-654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2242.771,2247.502,Is there anything in the legislative history to support this theory?
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2247.502,2251.754,There's simply no legislative history in this matter.
1987.87-654,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2251.754,2259.781,Is there anything in our precedents which says that one state can take action to influence the conduct and the policies of other states?
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2264.332,2271.398,"Justice Kennedy, I don't believe there are any decisions of this Court that suggest a state cannot encourage other states to act."
1987.87-654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2303.309,2312.966,You seriously think the '84 amendment actually would encourage industry as a whole rather than discourage it?
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2312.966,2314.736,"Yes, I do, Justice Stevens."
1987.87-654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2314.736,2317.207,It certainly wouldn't help it any in Indiana.
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2317.207,2324.884,It would help the industry greatly if Indiana took the encouragement of Ohio and passed some type of a credit for ethanol.
1987.87-654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2324.884,2327.055,"Well, maybe Indiana has a better way of doing it."
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2331.206,2332.628,"Justice Stevens, I--"
1987.87-654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2332.628,2334.407,Why is one better than the other?
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2334.407,2341.052,"--I don't submit that one might be better than the other, but I do submit that it would have no difference in effect."
1987.87-654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2353.471,2364.388,"Well, what do you say to your opponent's argument that maybe the Indiana gasohol that no longer comes into Ohio has been replaced by lead gas rather than gasohol?"
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2364.388,2365.229,"Justice Stevens,--"
1987.87-654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2365.229,2365.9,That's possible.
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2365.9,2368.982,--I would first say that there's nothing at all in the record to suggest that.
1987.87-654,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2404.395,2412.931,"General Farrin, do these subsidy laws tend to predominate in those states that have a lot of air or those states that have a lot of corn?"
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2417.532,2432.312,"Justice Scalia, if you're referring simply to a subsidy provision such as the one that Indiana had at one time, I'm not aware that there are any, if many, of those types of provisions."
1987.87-654,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2437.658,2440.512,"They are corn growing, aren't they?"
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2440.512,2464.305,"Justice Scalia, I'm not an expert on agriculture, but it would not surprise me that those states that have large corn surpluses would find that also to be an additional reason for encouraging the use of ethanol, because clearly the more ethanol that is used, the more corn, which is a primary raw material, is used."
1987.87-654,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2485.499,2487.402,"There is a national market in corn, of course."
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2490.355,2493.805,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1987.87-654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2581.103,2590.58,"General Farrin, how do you distinguish the Hawaiian tax case on these exotic beverages they had over there, the tax credit for those local--"
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2590.58,2605.359,"Justice Stevens, perhaps the major distinction is that there was no purpose other than simply to protect local industry in that case."
1987.87-654,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2614.566,2619.769,--And that purpose is the health and environment purpose?
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2619.769,2621.519,I believe it's the health environment purpose.
1987.87-654,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2656.262,2662.444,"Well, has the Court required a close fit, even if the purpose is legitimate?"
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2680.928,2692.435,"Justice O'Connor, I don't think this Court has ever stated that you actually need an alternative purpose other than to protect the local businesses."
1987.87-654,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2710.136,2716.04,But that was because Maryland created a market that had not previously existed.
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2724.025,2737.926,"Justice Kennedy, the majority in Alexandria Scrap found that the record in that case did not establish that the market in that scrap processing did not exist."
1987.87-654,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2767.264,2773.529,"Well, how about gasohol from other States?"
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2773.529,2795.462,"Justice White, gasohol or ethanol from, other States cannot compete with gasoline either without subsidies, and again, that goes back to what I submit is one of the purposes of the reciprocity provision."
1987.87-654,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2817.698,2836.549,"Well, how does keeping out a seller from another state that doesn't grant reciprocity, that doesn't grant Ohio people a credit there, how does keeping them out serve the health's interest of Ohio?"
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2836.549,2844.595,"Justice White, it's because of the method by which that encouragement is taken."
1987.87-654,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2858.414,2871.681,"Well, here's an outsider that wants to, that apparently has enough product to sell in Ohio."
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2887.482,2889.205,"That's correct, Justice White."
1987.87-654,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2890.535,2894.959,"Well, what difference does it make where the ethanol comes from?"
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2894.959,2898.091,--For the purposes of--
1987.87-654,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2898.091,2904.944,"Looks to me like the more sellers of ethanol you've got in Ohio, the more service to your health's interest you'd have."
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,2904.944,2907.114,"--Justice White, that goes part of the way, I believe."
1987.87-654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3024.723,3030.437,"If you state it that broadly, I guess the Dean Milk case was incorrectly decided."
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,3037.59,3057.275,"Justice Stevens, perhaps the distinguishing fact in Dean Milk was that it in effect barred, completely barred a product from coming into a marketplace unless it complied with the statute."
1987.87-654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3069.82,3074.675,How much Indiana ethanol is sold in Ohio when you have this particular situation?
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,3077.287,3089.035,"Justice Stevens, the record doesn't indicate it because this case was filed before the statute went into effect, but I would not dispute that it is very likely that they sell little or no ethanol."
1987.87-654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3089.035,3089.686,None at all.
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,3090.695,3092.959,"Justice Stevens, I think it's different."
1987.87-654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3099.05,3117.732,"Well, but maybe Madison, Wisconsin, because if we really want to encourage everybody else in the country to have the same strict health regulations we have, too, the best way to do it is to have everybody adopt this kind of protectionist ordinance that no milk can be shipped--"
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,3117.732,3136.436,"--Justice Stevens, if in Dean Milk, the ordinance said, you will do it within five miles of the city, I believe, or in a plant in another area which has the same requirements, I think that would have passed the Constitutional test."
1987.87-654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3145.072,3157.159,"--Not other ethanol, but meets the same physical requirements and health standards and all the rest but just that it's produced in states that adopt the same public policies of how to subsidize the industry that we think are the wisest."
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,3157.159,3169.806,"That's correct, Justice Stevens, and I think that's a matter for the legislature to determine as to the wisdom of its course of action, and whether it believes it will effect that result."
1987.87-654,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3169.806,3176.031,"Well, Mr. Farrin, this Court so far has invalidated all these reciprocity laws."
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,3191.55,3198.637,"Justice O'Connor, I don't think in any of those cases, this Court struck down a scheme such as the one at issue here."
1987.87-654,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3252.75,3266.261,I don't think the Court has distinguished between an absolute ban and a substantial burden on interstate commerce.
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,3266.261,3283.391,"Justice O'Connor, I believe this Court has distinguished for purposes of determining which type of Commerce Clause test to apply whether it subjected it to a regular balancing test or whether it subjected it to a stricter scrutiny test, such as was used in the A&P case."
1987.87-654,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3305.097,3316.193,Do you think that Ohio could impose a penny tax on all gasoline from states that don't subsidize ethanol?
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,3341.9,3347.062,"No, Justice Scalia, it would not be limited to ethanol."
1987.87-654,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3347.763,3348.604,"That's scary, isn't it?"
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,3348.604,3358.642,--I think what it would be limited to is whether or not they had a legitimate purpose that was carried out other than simply to protect their local businesses.
1987.87-654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3358.642,3364.345,"It would be the same purpose you have in this case, to encourage other states to adopt this kind of an ethanol policy."
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,3364.345,3365.955,That's correct.
1987.87-654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3365.955,3373.552,You could perhaps tax all imports from Indiana unless Indiana adopted this type of tax credit.
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,3373.552,3385.41,"I assume I would believe that this Court would not allow that broad a prohibition, of an absolute prohibition."
1987.87-654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3385.41,3387.399,"No, I don't think it would, either, but I think your theory would."
1987.87-654,1,39263,richard_c_farrin,,3387.399,3414.087,"The second issue that was discussed in the Alexandria case, but was not decided because the majority of the Court felt there was not an adequate record upon which to determine it, was whether or not the Commerce Clause forbids state action affecting a flow of commerce that is dependent for its existence on state subsidies rather than on private market forces."
1987.87-654,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3498.253,3499.383,"Thank you, Mr. Farrin."
1987.87-654,2,28111,herman_schwartz,,3501.804,3508.908,"Your Honor, I am not going to take any rebuttal time unless the Court has questions for me."
1987.87-654,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3549.204,3551.207,"Thank you, Mr. Schwartz."
