2000.99-1434,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.378,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-1434, the United States v. Mead Corporation."
2000.99-1434,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,8.508,11.993,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2000.99-1434,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,151.892,154.45,"Mr. Jones, there is kind of a curious feature."
2000.99-1434,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,161.524,162.304,Yes.
2000.99-1434,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,162.304,167.631,"--as I understand it, it engages in de novo review of the classification rulings?"
2000.99-1434,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,167.631,171.442,I think the... we have used that expressing in describing it--
2000.99-1434,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,171.442,171.998,Yes.
2000.99-1434,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,171.998,182.034,"--but as the Court pointed out in Haggar, and as we have argued in these two cases, what really happens is there is a de novo fact-finding on the record made in the Court of International Trade."
2000.99-1434,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,182.034,193.393,"Do you think that court affords some kind of deference to the views of the customs service, and would it be some kind of deference to the ruling such as we have here?"
2000.99-1434,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,193.393,205.964,"Well, Haggar also pointed out that what the court does is, in determining what the law is that it applies these facts to, it looks to the agency's interpretations, and we think it should look to the agency's rulings."
2000.99-1434,1,29799,j_peter_coll_jr,,1693.948,1694.783,"You are, sir."
2000.99-1434,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1743.873,1745.714,With no waiting period?
2000.99-1434,1,29799,j_peter_coll_jr,,1745.714,1746.892,No.
2000.99-1434,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1747.418,1751.667,"So that the very day of the notice, it became dutiable?"
2000.99-1434,1,29799,j_peter_coll_jr,,1751.667,1783.085,"--We had the opportunity, which we took advantage of, which was to get a detrimental reliance letter from the customs service that said to the effect that those imports that were in process we were able to rely on the previous ruling, on the previous classification ruling, but that we could not rely in the future, so that the first revocation allowed us to take those orders that we had in process and bring them in duty free, but thereafter we now had duty attached."
2000.99-1434,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1783.085,1785.99,"Now, is there a different regulatory scheme in effect today?"
2000.99-1434,1,29799,j_peter_coll_jr,,1785.99,1791.971,There is now a notice provision that requires publication in the Customs Bulletin.
2000.99-1434,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1791.971,1795.08,Is that the one that's set forth in page 3 of the Government's brief?
2000.99-1434,1,29799,j_peter_coll_jr,,1795.08,1798.628,"I don't have it by the page, Your Honor, but I believe it is."
2000.99-1434,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1798.628,1800.789,19 U.S.C. 1625?
2000.99-1434,1,29799,j_peter_coll_jr,,1800.789,1805.542,"That's correct, and its reflected in the... in 19 C.F.R.--"
2000.99-1434,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1805.542,1808.126,But that was not in force in the case before us?
2000.99-1434,1,29799,j_peter_coll_jr,,1808.126,1808.667,--It was not.
2000.99-1434,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1835.041,1858.911,"Now, with respect... with respect to reliance by someone other than the original importer, as I recall the briefs there was a difference of opinion between you and Mr. Jones on that, and I think his response to you was that the... that someone other than the original importer can rely unless notice is given by the Government."
2000.99-1434,1,29799,j_peter_coll_jr,,1862.219,1868.09,"--Well, I think it's probably a matter of practice as much as it is a matter of the interpretation of the rules, or the regulations."
2000.99-1434,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1925.704,1931.193,So they... in any case they can get a prospective determination as long as they're on their toes.
2000.99-1434,1,29799,j_peter_coll_jr,,1931.193,1933.035,--I don't think it's a prospective determination.
2000.99-1434,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1941.528,1942.045,"Well, does--"
2000.99-1434,1,29799,j_peter_coll_jr,,1942.045,1942.569,Whether--
2000.99-1434,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3399.859,3400.887,Thank you.
2000.99-1434,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3518.204,3519.343,"Thank you, Mr. Jones."
