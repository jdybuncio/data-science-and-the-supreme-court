1955.170,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,473.497,492.434,"In other words, it was then that the arrangement touched only these unsecured creditors and therefore, if General Stores had gone on with the business subject to eventuality of the (Inaudible) events seems nothing new, the situation of the stockholders will remain the same."
1955.170,0,16798,aaron_rosen,,492.434,494.424,"Exactly, sir."
1955.170,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,540.85,544.79,Were these the representatives coming from each (Inaudible)
1955.170,0,16798,aaron_rosen,,544.79,545.69,"No, sir."
1955.170,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,550.138,556.718,Did he -- wasn't there a truth meaning it's solely for himself that was (Inaudible)
1955.170,0,16798,aaron_rosen,,556.718,559.515,I believe it may have been in this represented capacity.
1955.170,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,563.675,572.605,"In other words, I want to know that the stockholder -- whether the stockholders were the bargainers objected to it."
1955.170,0,16798,aaron_rosen,,572.605,573.585,I -- I can say --
1955.170,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,573.585,583.854,On Chapter XI arrangement or whether the -- whether the suit really is with the Security and Exchange Commission representing its note within the public interest?
1955.170,0,16798,aaron_rosen,,583.854,587.984,"Well, I -- I can best answer that question this way."
1955.170,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,837.214,855.554,"Mr. Rosen, your burden to establish that or proceeding under Chapter X is forbidden by Chapter X, in order to establish the -- an arrangement under Chapter XI is allowable."
1955.170,0,16798,aaron_rosen,,855.554,875.136,"Had this corporation filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter X seeking in that proceeding, only an adjustment or extension of its commercial and trade debts, it would not have been filed in good faith."
1955.170,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,885.526,888.386,"Then your position is it couldn't, not that --"
1955.170,0,16798,aaron_rosen,,888.386,888.476,Correct.
1955.170,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,888.476,894.036,-- that'll be between X and XI which is -- which is allowable as in XI -- Chapter XI procedure.
1955.170,0,16798,aaron_rosen,,894.036,894.726,"Yes, sir."
1955.170,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1153.199,1181.557,"Well, isn't the ultimate that would be here suppose the security that the District Court in that case in the -- under the facts of that case was entitled -- would exercise the jurisdiction preceded of entertaining this with Chapter XI and that the Court of Appeals that that was not on abuse of discretion that -- that the Court of Appeals in reversing that was in error."
1955.170,0,16798,aaron_rosen,,1181.557,1181.677,I agree.
1955.170,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1181.677,1183.397,Is that what it gets down to?
1955.170,0,16798,aaron_rosen,,1183.397,1185.487,I agree.
1955.170,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1185.487,1195.331,"Now, this case -- in this case, the District Court admitted -- the District in this case -- the District Court exercised its jurisdiction not to entertain Chapter XI."
1955.170,0,16798,aaron_rosen,,1195.331,1199.472,"Thats correct, and the Court of Appeals sustained it."
1955.170,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1199.472,1204.702,As you say that -- did you say that the (Inaudible)
1955.170,0,16798,aaron_rosen,,1204.702,1205.392,Judge Dimock is correct.
1955.170,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1205.392,1214.104,Do you -- do you say that Judge Dimock couldn't exercise discretion was so compelled when you raises the question whether he was concerned.
1955.170,0,16798,aaron_rosen,,1220.784,1230.917,"Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I strongly submit that nowhere in the statute is there any such discretion granted to the Court."
1955.170,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1318.193,1321.597,"Well, the stockholders' interest were involved in that case."
1955.170,0,16798,aaron_rosen,,1321.597,1322.839,In the --
1955.170,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1322.839,1323.631,In the Realty?
1955.170,0,16798,aaron_rosen,,1323.631,1326.615,"In the Realty case, not stockholders."
1955.170,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1383.579,1392.459,Would you think your case was different or this case was different if the ordinary creditors opposed it -- the arrangement?
1955.170,0,16798,aaron_rosen,,1392.459,1398.089,"If the ordinary creditors oppose the arrangements, there isn't any -- quite you mean the commercial and trade credit?"
1955.170,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1398.089,1398.16,Yes.
1955.170,0,16798,aaron_rosen,,1398.16,1399.481,It could never be confirmed.
1955.170,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1411.687,1415.753,"Well then, it would have to go to adjudication?"
1955.170,0,16798,aaron_rosen,,1415.753,1416.614,Not necessarily.
1955.170,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1510.644,1513.948,That -- that time was the fair and equitable rule in both --
1955.170,0,16798,aaron_rosen,,1513.948,1514.159,In both --
1955.170,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1514.159,1515.471,-- X and XI
1955.170,0,16798,aaron_rosen,,1515.471,1516.632,"It was, sir."
1955.170,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1527.624,1531.249,Will you discuss later why that was removed from the list?
1955.170,0,16798,aaron_rosen,,1532.982,1537.728,"Well, I -- I believe -- I think it will be discussed, sir."
1955.170,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1827.004,1832.01,Mr. Goldweber.
1955.170,1,35954,max_goldweber,,1832.01,1833.913,If the Court please.
1955.170,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,1963.43,1972.7,"If the wage earners have claimed for much more than the time they gave him a land, how -- how long do they have to be in the Court, three months or something?"
1955.170,1,35954,max_goldweber,,1972.7,1973.812,Three months.
1955.170,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,1973.812,1977.326,(Inaudible) you -- you have a less than three months wages?
1955.170,1,35954,max_goldweber,,1977.326,1978.158,That's correct.
1955.170,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,1990.41,1992.583,That is they claim a longer term?
1955.170,1,35954,max_goldweber,,1992.583,1993.725,"Oh, no."
1955.170,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,1994.296,1995.288,Only it was the three months?
1955.170,1,35954,max_goldweber,,1995.288,1997.281,Only for the three months as to the priority.
1955.170,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,2003.048,2006.532,It's fairly the same in both either on the X and XI.
1955.170,1,35954,max_goldweber,,2006.532,2007.073,"Well, yes."
1955.170,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,2010.697,2014.622,"Do you say under XI, they have a 3 months claim but under the X they don't."
1955.170,1,35954,max_goldweber,,2014.622,2020.219,"Under XI Section 64 (a) gives them a priority, to give up to $600."
1955.170,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2161.988,2168.726,Mr. Singer.
1955.170,2,35125,leon_singer,,2168.726,2171.4,May it please the Court.
1955.170,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2209.026,2211.751,"Which one of those three groups, did you say you represented?"
1955.170,2,35125,leon_singer,,2211.751,2215.125,"We represent all, as the official Creditors Committee."
1955.170,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2215.125,2215.506,You represent all?
1955.170,2,35125,leon_singer,,2215.506,2215.977,We represent all --
1955.170,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2215.977,2218.07,"Including -- including the wage earners, too?"
1955.170,2,35125,leon_singer,,2218.07,2220.133,-- including the wage earners --
1955.170,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2220.133,2220.293,You represent --
1955.170,2,35125,leon_singer,,2220.293,2224.147,-- on their unsecured claims.
1955.170,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2462.853,2475.446,"If it wouldn't disturb you, I -- I understand the claim of the wage earners, the term here as to why the creditors would be injured by the taking away their lead."
1955.170,2,35125,leon_singer,,2481.375,2484.258,"That is the point I'm now arriving at, Judge Black."
1955.170,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2484.258,2486.561,I understand.
1955.170,2,35125,leon_singer,,2486.561,2504.13,"This record discloses that the liquid assets of this debtor, presently, are insufficient to pay unsecured creditors to the full extent of their claims."
1955.170,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2579.354,2593.359,"Why wouldn't the term which you -- which has now been offered which the creditors are accepting under the Chapter XI, be terms available under Chapter X because of fair and equitable would be a part?"
1955.170,2,35125,leon_singer,,2593.359,2596.993,I -- I feel that is so.
1955.170,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2599.266,2600.217,Neither proportions (Voice Overlap) --
1955.170,2,35125,leon_singer,,2600.217,2612.509,"The proportions, they would have to be so -- as Judge Stone say, “You have to eliminate the stockholders to apply the fair and equitable rule in a Chapter X proceeding.”"
1955.170,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2613.23,2614.963,There may have to be a risk involved.
1955.170,2,35125,leon_singer,,2614.963,2615.324,That is a risk.
1955.170,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2615.324,2616.976,That the policy would be ready.
1955.170,2,35125,leon_singer,,2616.976,2618.407,"Definitely, so."
1955.170,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2888.933,2891.136,"Did they indicate any desire at all, one way or the other?"
1955.170,2,35125,leon_singer,,2891.136,2892.438,"Well no, sir."
1955.170,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2900.216,2901.067,I understand that.
1955.170,2,35125,leon_singer,,2901.067,2911.459,And the Securities and Exchange Commission was required to be notified under the statute upon the making of the motion.
1955.170,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2911.459,2922.562,"The question I was asking is related to the statement of that this counsel, would you say they have indicated no desire to have inputted --"
1955.170,2,35125,leon_singer,,2922.562,2923.504,So far as --
1955.170,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2923.504,2927.749,Have they indicated any of provisions and is being inputted again?
1955.170,2,35125,leon_singer,,2927.749,2931.522,"Insofar as this has come to our attention Judge, none whatsoever."
1955.170,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2931.522,2932.503,Did the record show how it happened?
1955.170,2,35125,leon_singer,,2932.503,2934.125,The record does not show --
1955.170,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2934.125,2936.508,And they have taken no part of any crime?
1955.170,2,35125,leon_singer,,2936.508,2937.149,That is correct.
1955.170,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2950.263,2952.446,I'd looked at the petitioner here.
1955.170,2,35125,leon_singer,,2956.801,2966.223,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1955.170,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2966.223,2975.604,Mr. Reich.
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,2979.018,2982.672,May it please the Court.
1955.170,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3023.579,3023.9,May I suggest --
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,3023.9,3024.041,So of course -- excuse me.
1955.170,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3024.041,3034.362,"-- it wouldn't be plus if whatever construction was difficult except for a language, we can reconstruct the language (Inaudible)"
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,3037.696,3039.178,The language of the statute.
1955.170,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3039.178,3039.79,Yes.
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,3039.79,3040.632,That is correct.
1955.170,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3048.588,3048.769,"Now, suppose --"
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,3048.769,3053.304,-- a considerable meaning to that phrase and that decision and we believe that --
1955.170,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3053.304,3058.44,"That is really troubled by the word ""plus."""
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,3058.44,3062.375,I think your observation is -- Your Honor's observation is quite correct.
1955.170,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3238.7,3253.977,How do we take judicial notice (Inaudible) as a matter of fact stockholders (Inaudible) is very often is a representative action?
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,3253.977,3256.14,"I think that is probably so, Your Honor."
1955.170,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3465.813,3478.517,But it couldn't in the big and small public or private only that it's come out of in the fourth company between the other venues of Chapter XI (Inaudible)
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,3478.517,3485.595,"I think this should be said, Your Honor."
1955.170,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3517.277,3517.809,But would it be in respect of --
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,3517.809,3520.262,And that was rejected by this Court in Realty.
1955.170,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3520.262,3530.974,Put it here in active (Inaudible) involved the public corporations and necessary to go under its hem instead of going to -- would that be a good handle for that case?
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,3530.974,3538.493,"I think that is, perhaps, the most important single criterion, Mr. Justice Frankfurter."
1955.170,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3621.913,3624.757,May I ask you a question to see if I understand you correctly.
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,3625.959,3626.89,"Yes, sir."
1955.170,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3626.89,3651.426,"Suppose in this proceeding where a question was raised as to which one it should come on the X or XI, the evidence shows beyond dispute, that it finally shows beyond dispute, that under XI proceedings all creditors would be paid in full, secured and unsecured."
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,3685.479,3690.936,"I would like to answer your question, Justice, specifically and directly as I can, Your Honor."
1955.170,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3694.451,3695.683,I don't know about this case.
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,3696.074,3699.749,"No, I mean insofar as the size and number of stockholders --"
1955.170,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3699.749,3701.482,Without regard to the size.
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,3753.155,3755.959,"I'd like to answer this way, if I may, Mr. Justice Black."
1955.170,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3816.074,3819.078,How was it found here?
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,3820.89,3824.354,"Well, there are no facts in this record that I know of."
1955.170,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3900.469,3905.705,That's -- that's answered by saying that no such finding could be possibly be made.
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,3905.705,3908.957,No such finding can possibly be made nor was made here and the --
1955.170,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3908.957,3911.741,"Well, assuming that it could just for a moment."
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,3911.741,3913.334,Yes.
1955.170,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3913.334,3931.027,"I had always to hold that all the bankruptcy if I had anything to do with (Inaudible) as the basic primary decision was permanent to see that the creditors were paid before the stockholders got in, is that right or wrong?"
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,3931.027,3936.844,That is certainly true in -- under Chapter X --
1955.170,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3936.844,3938.206,Under any proceeding?
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,3938.206,3939.918,It is also true under Chapter XI.
1955.170,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3939.918,3941.45,But individual I suppose.
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,3944.694,3945.976,That is true.
1955.170,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3945.976,3949.11,And the same principle is applied to XI to the corporation?
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,3949.11,3950.582,That is true.
1955.170,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3950.713,3958.629,And you don't think you have any burden here and -- and insofar as and I'm asking you because my mind is wholly undecided.
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,3958.629,3959.04,"Yes, Your Honor."
1955.170,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3959.04,3966.753,You don't think you have any burden on the basis of that statement that's representing all the creditors.
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,3983.085,3992.955,"No, we respectfully submit, Your Honor, that that is not the controlling determination and even if it were so."
1955.170,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4085.564,4089.089,"I can -- I can understand that, if you put it on that basis."
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4089.089,4089.58,I think that's the basis of Realty.
1955.170,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4089.58,4116.22,"But I can't understand why -- maybe we should as to why we have held anything in that early case that may be original are in class rules, even though the circumstances in fact that the Court can know, that one court will pay the stockholders in full without jeopardize -- I mean the -- the credit is in full, without jeopardizing the stockholders."
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4128.125,4139.897,"The -- the short answer, Your Honor, and I think it's a conclusive answer is that it is impossible to make that determination in this type of proceeding."
1955.170,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4188.055,4190.261,Would you mind -- would it take too much of your time.
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4211.784,4213.696,"Now, this is the best of my ability, Your Honor."
1955.170,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4214.007,4223.268,But you be -- you'll be the judge from an answer to that question and the time it would take (Inaudible) on the argument of your plan?
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4223.268,4233.85,"Well, with the caveat that I necessarily will -- will paint it in broad brush strokes and the -- the risk of leaving out a good deal."
1955.170,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4271.045,4275.79,(Inaudible) the proceeding were meant to of just result.
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4275.79,4276.371,Yes.
1955.170,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4276.432,4282.638,And that you can take whatever means of federal district judge can and after the proceedings to put questions.
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4282.638,4284.13,That is -- that is correct.
1955.170,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4287.364,4288.726,(Inaudible)
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4288.726,4295.644,Equity -- the common law of composition which was codified in Section 12 of the Bankruptcy Act.
1955.170,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4305.436,4314.528,I'm not saying this (Inaudible) in upholding this.
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4317.641,4318.482,"None, whatsoever."
1955.170,3,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,4370.503,4373.237,"Well, this is the appraisal of the property, isn't it?"
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4373.237,4376.291,There can be an appraisal if necessary.
1955.170,3,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,4376.291,4377.702,And if everybody wants them.
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4377.702,4381.442,If it's asked for the judge in its -- in his discretion in that.
1955.170,3,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,4381.442,4390.453,And you spoke that in Chapter XI they would look for the benefit of the creditors but then they were protecting denial?
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4390.453,4392.946,That's right under the --
1955.170,3,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,4392.946,4404.829,But -- but they could under XI or how I feel can't be under XI to avoid payments to the creditors in full?
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4404.829,4405.661,Yes.
1955.170,3,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,4407.474,4410.258,"Well, but the stockholders will save something out of it?"
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4410.258,4411.51,That is -- that is possible.
1955.170,3,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,4411.51,4422.653,Within the purpose of XI to give opportunities to reorganize business to protect the investing public into investing in the stock rather than to creditors?
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4422.653,4424.605,"No, it is not, Your Honor."
1955.170,3,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,4445.738,4447.831,But it's to the sum of those stockholders?
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4447.831,4449.232,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
1955.170,3,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,4449.613,4452.737,"But that's the only place he can get anything, is it?"
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4452.737,4452.968,No.
1955.170,3,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,4453.669,4463.43,If -- if there's not enough assets to pay all the creditors and the stockholders -- if -- if the corporation can't pay both of them.
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4463.43,4465.062,Yes.
1955.170,3,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,4465.062,4468.166,"Then it needs to go into XI, I think."
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4468.166,4469.437,That is right.
1955.170,3,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,4480.06,4480.811,Benefit the stocks.
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4480.811,4484.985,-- would benefit the stockholders because they'll get more than if they'd put -- than if the creditors --
1955.170,3,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,4484.985,4486.497,"Well, I think they knew their business."
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4494.386,4495.798,Those are considerations.
1955.170,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4588.994,4591.236,Is that what happened in the transition?
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4591.236,4592.544,"We don't know, Your Honor."
1955.170,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4603.704,4612.823,"Mr. Timbers, what would be the position of the Wage Claimants under -- under number X, Chapter X that is the preferred wage claimants?"
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4613.214,4613.375,Yes.
1955.170,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4613.375,4615.137,-- same status as under XI?
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4615.137,4620.533,"That is our position, Your Honor, as I reinstated in our little supplemental brief."
1955.170,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4669.937,4678.046,Is -- is it a matter of discretion with the -- with the Court in that situation or -- or does he have a positive right to the priority?
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4678.046,4686.561,I think it's a mater of discretion and so far as we know it has been exercised uniformly in favor of the Wage Claimants.
1955.170,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4686.561,4688.934,But it isn't a matter of discretion under XI.
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4691.257,4691.789,That is correct.
1955.170,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4691.789,4693.362,"Well, there is a difference then."
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4693.362,4698.648,"Yes, there is, as to the priority claimants, as to the priority wage claimants."
1955.170,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4735.384,4737.186,I don't quite understand that.
1955.170,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4753.885,4759.642,What you're saying was the rule of equity the -- the rule of equity practice is somehow (Inaudible)
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4759.642,4764.107,"That's what I tried to say, Mr. Justice Douglas that is the all equity rules sometime --"
1955.170,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4764.107,4767.09,(Inaudible)
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4767.09,4767.771,That's right.
1955.170,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4771.31,4772.472,I happen to know.
1955.170,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4786.64,4790.474,I think that's very unusual but they --
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4790.474,4794.51,"We know no such instance, Your Honor, certainly in a Chapter X proceeding."
1955.170,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4794.51,4798.784,I may be wrong but the amendment I offered may have been reference to another matter.
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4817.945,4818.457,The reason for that is --
1955.170,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4818.457,4824.304,I don't mean to say it shouldn't be gotten away from but I -- I just don't quite understand how you could do it.
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4824.304,4841.699,"The -- the reason for that as we understand it, was to permit the -- give to the Chapter X court greater flexibility with respect to its handling of a number of different types of claims, one of which was the wage earners claims."
1955.170,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4866.36,4867.022,I stated it.
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4873.63,4881.179,As a matter of fact these Wage Claimants might very well get more under Chapter X than they would under Chapter XI.
1955.170,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4881.961,4885.105,How?
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4885.105,4891.782,They'd be entitled to -- to go back six months instead of the three months period for which they're claiming priority.
1955.170,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4904.606,4912.945,Within what ranges can a judge exercise his discretion in determining the purpose (Inaudible)
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,4912.945,4921.636,I suppose it's the usual criteria for a -- an equity judge exercising his discretion.
1955.170,3,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,4994.616,5005.08,What is the Section (Inaudible) Section 30 of the bill as to the Section of 328?
1955.170,3,46383,williams_h_timbers,,5005.08,5016.655,That is set forth at page --
1955.170,3,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,5016.655,5017.457,"Well, never mind."
1955.170,4,16878,a_alan_reich,,5639.975,5643.395,Your Honor pleases.
1955.170,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5826.536,5833.136,"In your petition, is there any suggestion of an organization of funds or a misconduct?"
1955.170,4,16878,a_alan_reich,,5833.136,5833.728,No sir.
1955.170,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5833.728,5834.871,(Inaudible)
1955.170,4,16878,a_alan_reich,,5834.871,5835.422,"No, sir."
1955.170,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5848.91,5856.558,Do you raise any issues of fact in your motion to make a X proceedings instead XI?
1955.170,4,16878,a_alan_reich,,5856.558,5857.28,No.
1955.170,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5882.237,5895.452,"And if -- and if the judgment below should be affirmed and this has to go into X, what will go into X would be the plan that is now in its (Inaudible) being XI at the same time, wouldn't it?"
1955.170,4,16878,a_alan_reich,,5895.452,5896.654,"Yes, sir."
1955.170,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5913.924,5915.076,So far --
1955.170,4,16878,a_alan_reich,,5915.076,5915.167,"Excuse me, sir."
1955.170,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5915.167,5921.443,"So far as anything that ended in the corporation, there's nothing in the record that indicate anything else (Inaudible)"
1955.170,4,16878,a_alan_reich,,5921.443,5926.734,"Well, sir we -- we don't know that the corporation would be called upon to submit a plan."
1955.170,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6106.011,6111.608,"In the Transvision, there was suggestions of -- of dubious conducts by the management."
1955.170,4,16878,a_alan_reich,,6111.608,6119.537,"In the Transvision case in which I was one the respondents, the position was entirely different."
1955.170,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6143.034,6144.906,All I know is that I read their opinion.
1955.170,4,16878,a_alan_reich,,6144.906,6146.013,"Yes, sir."
1955.170,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6235.885,6244.245,That may make a small minority holdings more at the risk of the management and it's through the light of distribution and management hasn't such a grip.
1955.170,4,16878,a_alan_reich,,6244.245,6255.938,"Well, sir, we have this particular situation where management itself owns a small block of stock and take this small block of stock and uses it to swing the corporation."
1955.170,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6306.856,6308.388,You have -- you have five minutes.
1955.170,4,16878,a_alan_reich,,6308.388,6309.07,"Oh, fine."
1955.170,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6309.07,6309.431,Five minutes more.
1955.170,4,16878,a_alan_reich,,6309.431,6314.036,That's just fine.
1955.170,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6371.011,6377.1,"In other words -- in other words, what you've read are two more sentences goes before and after --"
1955.170,4,16878,a_alan_reich,,6377.1,6377.671,That's right.
1955.170,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6377.671,6380.795,-- to prove that it is the majority of the Court to see.
1955.170,4,16878,a_alan_reich,,6383.007,6383.868,"That's right, sir."
1955.170,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6383.868,6386.772,And now the jurisdiction is exclusive.
1955.170,4,16878,a_alan_reich,,6386.772,6400.066,"Well, they -- yes, that's correct.We contend that the standards set for jurisdiction have been set forth very clearly and concisely under the Realty decision."
1955.170,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6419.688,6421.694,That is my understanding what the Realty case was.
1955.170,4,16878,a_alan_reich,,6421.694,6422.826,"That's right, sir."
1955.170,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6549.772,6550.503,Mr. Reich --
1955.170,4,16878,a_alan_reich,,6550.503,6550.574,"Yes, sir."
1955.170,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6550.574,6551.845,-- we control of that.
1955.170,4,16878,a_alan_reich,,6559.685,6560.296,"Right, sir."
1955.170,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6560.296,6572.545,What the amendment of 52 gives as well as to -- to try again by pointing that (Inaudible) from XI to X --
1955.170,4,16878,a_alan_reich,,6572.545,6572.976,That's right.
1955.170,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6572.976,6579.815,-- that you're drawing out and you have to start all over again with all the difficulty that the X transferred from X to XI.
1955.170,4,16878,a_alan_reich,,6584.521,6586.264,That's exactly right.
1955.170,5,16798,aaron_rosen,,6805.664,6806.825,(Inaudible)
1955.170,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6806.825,6810.609,Yes.
1955.170,5,16798,aaron_rosen,,6810.609,6814.674,If the Court please.
