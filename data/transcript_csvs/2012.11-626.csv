2012.11-626,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.57,"We'll hear argument next in Case 11-626, Lozman v. The City of Riviera Beach."
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,8.504,12.558,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,50.547,53.266,"You should have phrased the test that way then, because it really--"
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,53.266,53.885,--Pardon?
2012.11-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,53.885,65.257,--That doesn't seem to me a very felicitous description of what -- of what the test is -- is enunciated to be.
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,65.257,66.923,"Well, I think--"
2012.11-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,66.923,70.225,"The test is whether it's, what, practically able?"
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,70.225,71.494,--Practically capable.
2012.11-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,71.494,72.877,Practically capable.
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,81.182,83.634,"Well, that's not what this Court -- case is saying--"
2012.11-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,83.634,84.318,I understand.
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,98.061,99.861,"--With all due respect, I don't think that's correct."
2012.11-626,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,117.123,120.074,"Well, that just has -- I understand that argument."
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,123.843,127.061,"Well, I think the word capable obviously is in the statute."
2012.11-626,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,130.615,133.151,"Capable is in the statute, purpose is not, right?"
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,133.151,134.317,--Correct.
2012.11-626,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,155.498,187.869,"You -- you describe cases with this purpose -- or function, but the briefs cited the district court decision, Sea Village Marina, that says floating homes like the one here that can be towed and are not in the business of carrying people or goods, but can be towed miles across the water, that those constitute vessels."
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,203.544,211.15,"Justice Ginsburg, I think there's a confusion of terminology that I hope I can -- that I hope I can straighten out at the outset."
2012.11-626,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,272.273,280.277,"Well, but in -- in your brief, I really lost count, but I think it's six times on the first two pages, you talk about indefinitely moored."
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,320.504,324.371,"--Justice Kennedy, it would be indefinitely moored."
2012.11-626,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,352.725,353.375,But suppose--
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,353.375,354.058,--then the question--
2012.11-626,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,354.058,357.11,"--you know the law school game, suppose it was moved every month."
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,357.11,361.08,--It would still not be a vessel.
2012.11-626,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,363.948,365.948,"That would be indefinitely moored, in your view?"
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,365.948,374.72,"Well, I'm not sure if you'd use the term indefinitely moored at that point, but it certainly wouldn't be transformed into a vessel because look at this Court's Evansville case."
2012.11-626,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,375.756,382.243,"Before you get to Evansville, let's say it moved around, which is one thing, but also it had a raked bow; it wasn't square."
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,394.133,402.221,--I think that's right if you start with something that is a vessel; the fact that you simply leave it at the dock for a long time doesn't take away vessel status.
2012.11-626,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,442.031,458.058,"Counselor, can I -- can I -- I have been lost even as I have read the briefs, because there's a lot of terminology that I'm not sure -- and standards that have been proposed that -- what concepts they're tied to, okay?"
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,493.297,493.916,No.
2012.11-626,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,497.368,501.903,But it applies to whether something is permanently moored or floating on the sea?
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,501.903,503.789,--That helps you determine its purpose.
2012.11-626,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,515.579,518.881,I just don't see how you can get purpose into this statutory language.
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,529.922,532.291,"We're talking about an objective purpose, Justice Alito--"
2012.11-626,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,532.291,536.26,"Well, then you're not talking about purpose; you're talking about function, right?"
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,550.419,551.702,--Exactly.
2012.11-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,565.645,567.714,Can I ask about that definition?
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,571.749,572.216,--Yes.
2012.11-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,572.216,581.705,--which provides the meaning of all -- of the word vessel as used in the United States Code.
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,582.391,583.741,Correct.
2012.11-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,583.741,589.961,What -- what meaning of vessel in the United States Code is at issue here?
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,589.961,599.084,"The word vessel in the Maritime Lien Act, which is what provides the Federal forum, assertedly, for the plaintiff, the City, to bring this case."
2012.11-626,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,623.115,624.349,Aren't you just begging the question?
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,629.269,632.888,--I'm not trying to beg the question; I'm just trying to describe our argument to you.
2012.11-626,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,634.188,635.34,"Well, doesn't your argument beg the question?"
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,635.34,637.373,--I hope not.
2012.11-626,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,687.189,698.163,"I think you may -- you may very well have a good argument, but if you're relying either on purpose or on indefinite mooring, then you've lost me."
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,717.744,722.696,--It absolutely does because the function of a boat is to move people or things over water.
2012.11-626,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,726.099,726.582,Right.
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,747.18,747.846,"Yes, it is."
2012.11-626,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,747.846,753.334,"So it changes -- one -- the same thing is not a boat sometimes, and it is a boat."
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,763.873,769.026,"No, this Court in Stewart rejected the snapshot test that I think is what you just described."
2012.11-626,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,776.096,785.202,"But -- but I'm just -- the hypothetical -- the hypothetical I posed was meant to pose the question, well, sometimes things do both, and how do we tell which it is--"
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,785.202,791.689,"--If it actually does the latter and is performing its function while moving, then it is a vessel."
2012.11-626,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,805.299,806.432,"Well, how do we know that."
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,806.432,807.484,--You could tie it up and move it.
2012.11-626,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,807.484,808.634,"How do we know that, Mr. Fisher?"
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,838.17,842.372,"Well, with all due respect, Justice Kagan, that's not why people have floating homes."
2012.11-626,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,887.4,891.804,But it was still -- it was still tied to the land with roads and ramps and so forth.
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,895.256,896.406,"Well, the important--"
2012.11-626,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,896.406,906.212,"And it seems -- and it seems to me, suppose you -- you want us to make some universal definition of we know what a floating home is."
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,921.656,926.792,--It would sound to me just like the floating warehouse and office in Evansville as I just described that case.
2012.11-626,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,929.56,933.798,And suppose it moved -- suppose it moved up and down the canal to get better or worse weather during different seasons.
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,933.798,941.802,"If it's simply being repositioned and not being used for a transportation purpose, that is to move people or things, then it's not a vessel."
2012.11-626,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,942.804,943.954,"Well, I have the same problem Justice Kagan says."
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,946.922,949.491,"--That is not the point, Justice Kennedy, with all due respect."
2012.11-626,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,956.127,971.839,"Counsel, outside of your floating home, what other structures would be kept out of your definition of purpose or function and the city's definition of practically capable?"
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,976.375,977.743,--Other floating commercial--
2012.11-626,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,977.743,984.981,"Because they disavow water skis and garage doors and say they're practical, capable tests with--"
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,984.981,987.516,"--Well, I'm not sure they can actually disavow that on their tests, but--"
2012.11-626,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,987.516,987.883,"--Well, I know."
2012.11-626,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,988.266,994.52,"--Floating commercial establishments, floating pieces, floating docks, floating trampolines and play structures."
2012.11-626,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1031.062,1032.078,"--Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-626,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1043.435,1045.554,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2012.11-626,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1073.805,1076.406,Can I -- can I interrupt you just there on the dredging?
2012.11-626,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1086.529,1087.297,"--Well, the Court--"
2012.11-626,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1087.297,1087.581,Right?
2012.11-626,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1094.135,1097.987,"--Well, the Court in Stewart said that “ dredges ” -- and I'm quoting from page 492 --"
2012.11-626,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1102.224,1102.557,"Well, I know what it said."
2012.11-626,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1114.615,1122.202,"--Well, but in general, it needs to dredge not just in one place, because it's not just dredging a hole, it's dredging a trench."
2012.11-626,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1123.587,1125.672,"No, but that's saying that it has to be able to move, and I agree with that."
2012.11-626,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1127.989,1129.558,"Well, I think that the Court--"
2012.11-626,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1129.558,1132.993,"You could use it if you had a -- you know, a transportation boat, right?"
2012.11-626,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1137.73,1139.53,"--Yeah, I think that you could do that."
2012.11-626,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1147.42,1147.803,"Sure it is, isn't it?"
2012.11-626,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1155.459,1161.345,"--Oh, but I -- what I meant is that there are people and equipment on the superscoop when it is moving across Boston Harbor."
2012.11-626,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1185.461,1212.528,"If someone builds a replica of an historic watercraft, a Viking boat, the kind of outrigger canoes that the Polynesians used throughout the Pacific Ocean, and the purpose of this is to display it in a museum, no one has any intention whatsoever of ever putting it in the water, but it's built so that if they did, it would -- it would function just like its historic antecedent, is that a vessel?"
2012.11-626,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1212.528,1225.086,"--I think that that would be a vessel, because it really -- its objective function, if you look at its design and its natural function -- that's the phrase that the -- even Respondent's law professor amici used."
2012.11-626,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1230.757,1241.714,"What about the -- I thought there was a -- a kind of caveat in one of these cases, maybe Stewart, that said take a thing that looks just like a boat, the Queen Mary, but if it is permanently -- they use the word “ indefinite ”."
2012.11-626,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1243.114,1243.849,"Well, the Court--"
2012.11-626,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1243.849,1250.253,"But if it is permanently moored to the shore and is never going to sea again, then it isn't a vessel."
2012.11-626,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1250.253,1251.103,--That's true.
2012.11-626,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1251.903,1259.042,"Then if the Polynesian boat is permanently in the museum, there's a lot of objective evidence of that, it would not be a vessel."
2012.11-626,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1263.977,1280.522,--It is true that the Court recognized in Stewart and the Coast Guard's craft routinely operated dockside policy is based upon the presumption that something that used to be a vessel can cease to be a vessel if it is semi-permanently or indefinitely moored.
2012.11-626,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1285.592,1286.659,That doesn't come up here.
2012.11-626,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1291.663,1294.798,--And the Queen Mary is behind a -- is essentially behind a cofferdam.
2012.11-626,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1321.232,1321.865,So I was right.
2012.11-626,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1325.484,1335.525,"--Well, permanent mooring is usually going to be relevant to the question of whether something ceases to be a vessel, because it's no longer practically capable of being used as a means of transportation."
2012.11-626,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1344.715,1350.634,"Well, that's a -- that's a somewhat easy case, because the hull, I think, was removed or something was removed that made it--"
2012.11-626,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1350.634,1355.17,"Well, there were things that had been removed when it had been decommissioned originally."
2012.11-626,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1387.641,1402.817,"So, Mr. Gannon, you think that even at the moment that the thing is being transported, and let's say that the thing has, you know, various furniture and things on it, you think even at that moment under section 3, it's not a -- it might not be a vessel?"
2012.11-626,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1402.817,1405.019,"That's generally going to be true, yes."
2012.11-626,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1421.048,1430.486,"What if it was more seaworthy so that it could be towed 200 miles without suffering any damage, even if there are, you know, small waves, let's say?"
2012.11-626,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1451.4,1453.519,"--Well, I -- I understand the point."
2012.11-626,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1494.077,1495.429,I really just don't understand your answer.
2012.11-626,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1501.916,1502.883,"Well, I--"
2012.11-626,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1502.883,1503.785,It can be moved.
2012.11-626,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1503.785,1508.154,--There is a question about practical capability of being moved.
2012.11-626,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1508.154,1508.42,Okay.
2012.11-626,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1509.606,1511.389,"And before, you were asking about the hook in the statute here."
2012.11-626,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1530.352,1539.875,"What you have said sounds like this structure is not a vessel, period."
2012.11-626,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1556.418,1568.81,"--We think that the record here was not really compiled with an object of answering these questions, the things that we think are relevant, because the district court and the Court of Appeals flatly rejected any inquiry into the purpose or function of the vessel."
2012.11-626,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1569.26,1570.977,So what would we tell them they should look into?
2012.11-626,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1570.977,1574.262,--That they should look into the purpose and function of the vessel.
2012.11-626,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1583.501,1589.572,"On the first question, purpose or function, what did they know that we can't know by looking at this picture and listening to these arguments?"
2012.11-626,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1589.572,1592.607,"--Well, I think that they could hear more about--"
2012.11-626,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1592.607,1596.476,"I mean, I would be willing to stipulate they are better at this than we are, but let's -- let's assume."
2012.11-626,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1596.476,1600.195,"--Well, I -- I think that somebody -- if somebody -- I can't tell everything about the structure."

2012.11-626,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1610.068,1610.868,Don't we know that?

2012.11-626,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1709.166,1710.601,"Just like an inner tube, right?"
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1710.601,1711.651,--No.

2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1727.645,1739.168,"The test would be what's the practical capability, and a raft that has a bottom actually could very well be a vessel under the appropriate standard of practical capability."
2012.11-626,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1739.168,1739.787,With cup.
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1740.52,1742.739,Cup is not because a cup doesn't float.

2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1794.272,1795.474,You're -- yes.
2012.11-626,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1847.222,1850.608,"Under your definition, how do you deal with Evansville?"
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1850.608,1860.732,"Evansville is a case with many layers, but let me just start first start with the fact that the Court announced a practical capability test in Evansville itself."

2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1916.134,1916.819,--No.
2012.11-626,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1985.213,1988.415,"I -- I got stopped here, back at Stewart."
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2065.831,2067.215,I think it certainly did have that.
2012.11-626,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2073.652,2075.187,But it wasn't carrying things.
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2075.187,2076.454,It was carrying his personal effects.
2012.11-626,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2076.454,2077.806,"Well, that's true."
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2091.697,2092.031,I--

2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2095.934,2098.719,--It transported his computers; it transported his clothes.

2012.11-626,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2117.014,2117.348,Okay.
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2150.085,2157.841,"--Well, actually, I think Mr. Fisher conceded that if this had a motor and it was carrying exactly the same personal effects, it would be a vessel."
2012.11-626,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2157.841,2158.175,Okay.
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2176.452,2187.31,"I think that a vessel that has practical capability, a watercraft that has practical capability to float, move and carry goods or people, that's a vessel."

2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2201.352,2204.254,I think I've given up the absurd hypos because there are no litigation on them.
2012.11-626,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2204.254,2204.622,Well--
2012.11-626,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2204.622,2205.722,"Well, suppose, Mr. Frederick, this."
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2241.762,2244.281,"Yes, if it has the practical capability."
2012.11-626,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2249.601,2250.401,"Well, it's a statute--"
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2250.401,2251.317,--of lots of vessel owners.
2012.11-626,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2251.317,2257.055,--You are reading the statute -- you are reading the statute as if it says something can be transported over water.
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2281.003,2294.328,"Justice Kagan, the fact that a vessel only moves once doesn't mean that it's not a vessel if it has -- if it meets the attributes of the statute, as explained by this Court in Stewart, of practical capability."
2012.11-626,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2322.78,2327.984,"Mr. Frederick, the city's position, it is whatever we want it to be."
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2342.91,2348.647,"--Yes, but there are some exceptions and if -- I will let you finish your question."
2012.11-626,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2348.647,2361.722,"Yes, well, my question is, is it -- is it a vessel when you want it to be, and just an ordinary landlord/tenant situation when you want it to be that way?"
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2361.722,2363.49,No.
2012.11-626,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2365.324,2379.167,"Well, let's take this very incident, that is he failed to comply with the revised rules and he was behind in his payment of dockage fees."
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2387.022,2388.105,No.
2012.11-626,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2388.105,2389.272,Why not?
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2389.272,2397.894,Because it's a vessel and the exclusive admiralty jurisdiction of the United States courts means that it has to be litigated in the United States courts.
2012.11-626,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2397.894,2398.311,What about--
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2398.311,2404.448,"That's why in the first one, if I could just explain about the State court, because I think that there is some misapprehension about what happened."
2012.11-626,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2466.89,2471.176,We -- we want I suppose to give the courts of appeals a test that works.
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2509.651,2525.846,"I think that sums up in a nutshell what we would regard as a proper statement of the law, of what this Court has already said, and that is that if it's got practical capability, those practical characteristics, Justice Kennedy, will manifest itself in the functions."
2012.11-626,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2536.869,2545.64,"--That's where -- that's exactly -- I mean, I think that works pretty well; and you think that works pretty well, but I don't agree with you at the moment hypothetically."
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2602.679,2616.337,"--Justice Breyer, there is no basis, I mean, with all due respect, there is no basis in your cases to hold that there is something about transportation that makes it somehow uniquely nautical or maritime as opposed to--"
2012.11-626,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2616.337,2616.554,"No, it's--"
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2616.554,2622.908,--household effects or other goods or services or people that are transported over land.
2012.11-626,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2649.092,2667.955,"I guess the problem is the list of absurdities that they point to, not the least of which is a dry dock, which you talk about whether it's permanently moored or not, but most dry docks are held in place by, you know, heavy ropes but you can cut them and you can stick something on them and they can float away."
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2670.657,2673.609,I don't accept the premise of your argument.
2012.11-626,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2674.425,2674.825,--For the--
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2674.825,2688.119,"--The dry docks with which I am familiar are anchored to the bottom so that they can stay in one place and they don't carry anything, so they don't meet the part of the test that requires carriage."
2012.11-626,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2688.119,2689.552,--So what do you do with the--
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2689.552,2689.919,They are simply physical structures--
2012.11-626,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2689.919,2694.189,--Trampoline and the other examples your adversary gave?
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2698.725,2702.427,--I don't think it's practically capable of carrying anything.
2012.11-626,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2702.427,2704.395,It's carrying the Trampoline.
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2704.395,2705.913,And again--
2012.11-626,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2705.913,2717.286,"So is the difference whether I attach something permanently or temporarily to the top of the floating thing, the floating board, the floating whatever?"
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2717.286,2721.256,"--Well, it would not be subject to towage."
2012.11-626,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2754.394,2768.071,"Counsel, your example of the towing cleats highlights one of the difficulties I have; one, because obviously the question of, well, what if they didn't have the towing cleats, and then what if they had the towing cleats and then took them off, what if they were temporary towing cleats."
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2779.879,2786.699,--Because the physical characteristics of this houseboat all point to the attributes of being a vessel.
2012.11-626,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2791.034,2795.721,It doesn't have -- the thing that makes something look most like a boat in my view is a raked bow.
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2801.392,2802.092,"--Well, Mr. Chief--"
2012.11-626,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2802.092,2807.612,"It doesn't have a -- what are the things called on the side, the elevated sides that you would look for in a boat."
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2807.612,2812.866,--We would submit that Congress did not intend a you-know-it-when-you-see-it test.
2012.11-626,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2825.158,2828.96,"--Mr. Frederick, this is kind of an idiosyncratic case."
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2847.939,2857.462,"Yes, unless it has a physical impediment that takes it out of one of the three attributes that doesn't make it a vessel."
2012.11-626,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2858.362,2873.654,"As long as the vessel stays in one place and the gambling goes on in one place, then it may be towed to a different location, and it stays there."
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2884.529,2885.029,--Yes.
2012.11-626,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2885.029,2892.385,"Even if it's rather permanently moored with a, with a -- like the Intrepid on the Hudson River--"
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2892.385,2894.168,I'm not familiar--
2012.11-626,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2894.168,2896.42,--With about -- aircraft carrier.
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2906.21,2911.029,--We suggest that the way the court should think about that problem is as a physical impediment.
2012.11-626,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2918.619,2923.737,"Mr. Frederick, if that is the case, then your test really comes down to how securely is something fastened."
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2950.388,2954.958,"--I think that's a fair way to view it, Justice Kagan, and it's a perfectly appropriate one."
2012.11-626,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2956.708,2962.046,"That really does become a jury question -- a question of fact for everything, right?"
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2972.402,2987.412,"--Well, I think that as a practical matter, this arises in only a couple of instances and those are the casino boats, many of which were vessels and they traversed the rivers allowing people to gamble because that's how state laws required them to perform."
2012.11-626,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3058.274,3072.016,"--Is there any problem here, which I think maybe the coast guard and the other people who are responsible for vessels, say once we start thinking that everything in the house is a vessel -- I overstate -- we are going to have an impossible time doing our job."
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3082.889,3083.322,Yes--

Mercury Marine, United States v. Locke, in which the coast guard--"
2012.11-626,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3102.202,3113.075,"This is not very compelling in this case because they have regulations that pretty much echo what the Solicitor General is saying, so it's not as if they were going to take a different position."
2012.11-626,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3117.295,3129.103,"--And the statute underlying those regulations, Justice Sotomayor, is found at 46 USC 4302, and it provides the secretary very broad discretion on what to include within the regulations and what not to."
2012.11-626,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3145.731,3149.183,"Well, but, I mean, there is some easy things to visualize as a problem."
