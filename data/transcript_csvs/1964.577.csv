1964.577,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,3.383,"577, Pointer versus Texas."
1964.577,0,37474,orville_a_harlan,,4.189,4.495,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.577,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,4.495,4.855,"I think so, Your Honor."
1964.577,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4.855,5.324,Very well.
1964.577,2,37474,orville_a_harlan,,12.29,17.361,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1964.577,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,88.228,90.987,Within a few blocks of what?
1964.577,2,37474,orville_a_harlan,,90.987,94.702,Within a few blocks of a recent robbery.
1964.577,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,198.03,200.091,Counsel objected at the trial.
1964.577,2,37474,orville_a_harlan,,200.091,200.727,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.577,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,200.727,201.491,(Inaudible)
1964.577,2,37474,orville_a_harlan,,201.491,203.204,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.577,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,223.873,227.438,"In other words, what you are saying is (Inaudible) cross-examined?"
1964.577,2,37474,orville_a_harlan,,227.438,228.161,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.577,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,228.161,229.815,Immaterial (Inaudible)
1964.577,2,37474,orville_a_harlan,,229.815,231.945,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.577,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,411.623,419.901,Is there no requirement at the preliminary examination that a man be advised of his rights to counsel and so forth?
1964.577,2,37474,orville_a_harlan,,419.901,422.779,Not in Texas -- under Texas provisions --
1964.577,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,422.779,425.168,The statute doesn't provide for that?
1964.577,2,37474,orville_a_harlan,,425.168,437.96,"The statute provides, Your Honor, that he had -- it does provide, I beg your pardon, for advising him that he has a right to a continuance if he asks for it to secure counsel."
1964.577,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,457.5,462.163,But it doesn't say that he shall advise him of his right to counsel at all?
1964.577,2,37474,orville_a_harlan,,462.163,465.466,My understanding of the statute is that it does not.
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,838.679,846.087,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1964.577,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,934.404,936.354,Is the State represented?
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,936.354,937.786,"Normally, yes."
1964.577,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1107.962,1135.965,"Mr. Pena the -- however that may be the upshot of this was because of the complaining witness' absence and permanent move to the State of California, the upshot of this was that the defendant was denied or at least prevented from any possibility of cross-examination of this essential witness of this criminal trial, isn't that correct?"
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1135.965,1139.006,"Yes, sir."
1964.577,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1139.006,1152.5,"There is a case in this Court, at least one not probably good as many others implying that the right of cross-examination is a -- is an essential constitutional right."
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1156.777,1157.301,"No, sir."
1964.577,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1157.948,1163.475,"It's -- well, it's in your appellant brief, Alford against United States."
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1163.475,1163.851,"Yes, sir."
1964.577,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1164.891,1182.943,"So that -- and if I understand it, in the normal course of events with only nine exceptions, apparently or the nine recorded exceptions in the last 40 years, this problem would not arise because the complaining witness presumably would be present at the criminal trial, isn't that right?"
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1182.943,1183.533,Yes.
1964.577,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1183.533,1192.843,"So that the -- normally, there perhaps wouldn't be the necessity for counsel at the -- what you call the examining trial or the preliminary hearing."
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1219.093,1221.282,"I would have to answer that, yes, Your Honor."
1964.577,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1242.045,1243.685,He has no lawyer?
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1243.685,1244.514,"No, sir."
1964.577,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1245.315,1250.933,(Inaudible)
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1250.933,1253.11,"No, sir."
1964.577,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1253.11,1260.81,(Inaudible)
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1260.81,1261.05,"No, sir."
1964.577,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1308.12,1313.888,"But you don't suggest that the State would have had a case without the testimony of the complaining witness, do you?"
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1313.888,1316.183,"Well, no, sir."
1964.577,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1319.47,1334.15,I gather you were making a point that -- that you were at least inferring that the lack of counsel at the examining trial wasn't the State's fault.
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1346.406,1347.004,I think so.
1964.577,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1347.868,1351.872,Are you saying that it wasn't the State's job to give him a lawyer at his examining trial?
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1351.872,1357.34,"It would have been the State's job, Your Honor, had he asked for it, and if he couldn't afford one."
1964.577,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1361.8,1384.619,So you're suggesting that whatever the rule may be with regard to an indigent defendant who's -- who is faced with testimony at his trial which is produced at the examining trial that if the fellow can hire -- afford to hire or pay his own lawyer and fails to do so for purposes of an examining trial he hasn't got any complaints later.
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1395.721,1402.556,"Well, of course in that case, I don't think the evidence would be -- the testimony would be admissible because the State would have to show why the witness was not there."
1964.577,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1402.556,1403.05,"Well, I know."
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1414.406,1414.693,"Yes, sir."
1964.577,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1414.693,1415.946,-- moved away.
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1420.438,1430.732,"Well, I think -- well, of course, that's his choice if he wants to not hire a lawyer for the trial."
1964.577,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1456.293,1456.933,"Well, who --"
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1456.933,1457.662,-- to help --
1964.577,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1457.662,1460.465,Who finally represented him on his trial?
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1460.465,1476.603,"A court-appointed lawyer who was appointed by the Court not because he was a pauper but because the Court wanted to get on with the trial and a lawyer that his family had been trying to retain, C. C. Divine and Charles W. Gill."
1964.577,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1476.603,1480.587,How did the Court happen to appoint a lawyer to defend him on the appeal?
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1483.338,1484.668,"Yes, he was."
1964.577,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1484.668,1487.823,"Well, how did that happen?"
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1487.823,1488.311,I don't know.
1964.577,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1492.686,1494.205,He appears as an indigent?
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1494.205,1494.819,"Yes, sir."
1964.577,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1496.441,1516.135,I don't -- I noticed that neither of you mention Snyder versus Massachusetts in the 291st respecting the rather confrontation as a federally protected right in the state trial.
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1524.932,1526.041,"Yes, it does."
1964.577,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1526.041,1529.313,What did your state court say about the Texas Constitution?
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1529.313,1531.454,"It didn't say anything at all, Your Honor."
1964.577,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1584.918,1587.539,We'll recess now Mister.
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1587.539,1594.389,The decision that this Court will make is whether or not this man actually got a fair trial.
1964.577,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1674.715,1690.039,"Well, Mr. Pena, who but the complaining witness could have said that he gave -- gave up this money by reason of the force and the fear that it created in him on the part of this defendant."
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1696.069,1700.896,"Well, it was attempted to be done by the sister who actually observed the robbery."
1964.577,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1700.896,1706.427,Could she tell what was in the mind of the -- of the complaining witness?
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1706.427,1719.129,"No, but she saw the expressions on his -- on -- on her brother's face and there's testimony in the record for that effect, saw the face of the -- of her brother, saw that he had turned pale white."
1964.577,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1745.174,1759.698,"But then the lawyer had cross-examined the complaining witness and had in some way or another discredited his testimony, would you still have had this good a case as you've got?"
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1759.698,1759.952,"No, sir."
1964.577,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1761.569,1762.042,Alright.
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1768.264,1768.591,"Yes, sir."
1964.577,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1768.591,1771.684,That's all it's for.
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1771.684,1784.992,"There was also part of that testimony that was introduced by the defendant's lawyer during the trial for their own use, so that the State was not the only who offered the testimony."
1964.577,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1802.331,1806.785,(Inaudible)
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1806.785,1818.163,"Your Honor as I read the record -- now, I realize that we've assumed that there was an objection made."
1964.577,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1821.579,1822.361,"Well, excuse me."
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1824.067,1825.257,"Yes sir, that's the impression --"
1964.577,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1825.257,1833.206,Two objections on the one hand (Inaudible)
1964.577,3,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1833.206,1840.68,"Well, it -- there's -- there's about three pages of -- of testimony between the Court and Mr. Divine and the District Attorney."
1964.577,4,37474,orville_a_harlan,,2151.128,2157.355,"Now, I would like to give one observation Mr. Chief Justice, if I may."
1964.577,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2247.332,2248.794,"Well, Mr. Harlan --"
1964.577,4,37474,orville_a_harlan,,2248.794,2248.898,"Yes, sir."
1964.577,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2248.898,2256.954,"-- before you sit down, I would like to express thanks from the Court to you for representing this indigent defendant."
1964.577,5,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2275.413,2277.276,And I thank the Court.
