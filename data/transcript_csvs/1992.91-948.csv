1992.91-948,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.606,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 91-948, Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. the City of Hialeah."
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,15.36,17.878,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1992.91-948,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,43.027,45.112,Is that true of each of the ordinances?
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,45.112,47.397,"--It is not recited in all four of them, no, Justice White."
1992.91-948,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,51.183,54.801,So it's possible that some of the ordinances could be upheld--
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,54.801,56.837,"Well, we do need--"
1992.91-948,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,56.837,62.406,--Or at least it's possible that some of the ordinances might not be discriminatory on their face is that it?
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,62.406,64.34,"--It is possible in theory, yes."
1992.91-948,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,64.34,64.673,Okay.
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,65.108,70.227,All four ordinances have merged from the same pattern of legislation.
1992.91-948,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,131.735,135.955,"Mr. Laycock, may I ask you a preliminary question?"
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,143.109,147.336,There is a State law that is incorporated into one of the ordinances.
1992.91-948,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,150.714,161.17,"Well, has the Attorney General of the State interpreted the State law to encompass the practices at issue here?"
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,161.17,162.356,--Yes.
1992.91-948,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,185.02,191.256,"So even if you win here, presumably the State law would be in effect."
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,191.256,195.91,"Whether the State law remains in effect, the State is not a party."
1992.91-948,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,199.845,210.003,"And so do we have any of the concerns expressed in Renee v. Geary, our case dealing with redressability?"
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,210.003,214.289,"I'm not familiar with Renee, but I am familiar with the redressability issue."
1992.91-948,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,237.42,257.733,"Well, the State law may not suffer from what you claim to be the principal flaw in these ordinances, namely, an express intent to affect religious rituals, and the State law may be neutral on its face."
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,257.733,268.625,"Well, the State law is not neutral on its face as applied to this practice, but you're right, Justice White, that the history of the State law is very different."
1992.91-948,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,272.91,281.016,"Well, if there was an attack on the State law, would you be arguing that it is specifically aimed at religious practices and nothing else?"
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,281.016,281.616,--No.
1992.91-948,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,302.43,308.666,"Well, would the attack on the State law be somewhat more difficult for you to sustain than the attack on the local ordinance?"
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,308.666,325.462,"I think that if the ordinances are struck down, the stare decisis effect will pretty much take care of us on the State statute, but the history, the way in which the ordinances were enacted, is unique to the ordinances and does not apply to the statute."
1992.91-948,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,326.895,335.734,"Mr. Laycock, what do you rely on for the threat of prosecution from the city?"
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,339.805,355.481,"--Well, the finding of fact is that the city firmly intended to prevent all animal sacrifice in the city, the city adopted resclutions reciting that intention, the entire legislative package was targeted at my clients."
1992.91-948,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,363.253,367.122,Are some of these ordinances zoning ordinances?
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,367.122,371.507,"No, none of them are zoning ordinances, and zoning is a red herring in the case."
1992.91-948,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,405.58,411.401,And does your client still intend to perform these sacrifices within the City of Hialeah?
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,411.401,412.934,"Yes, he does."
1992.91-948,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,412.934,416.305,Does the ordinance define sacrifice?
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,416.305,428.112,The ordinance defines sacrifice as the unnecessary killing of an animal in a ritual or ceremony not for the primary purpose of food consumption.
1992.91-948,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,428.112,433.314,"And when you say sacrifice, you are using it in the term that the ordinance defines it, then."
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,433.314,433.933,That's right.
1992.91-948,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,433.933,445.824,"Mr. Laycock, if you were attacking solely the State statute and you were doing so following an opinion of the Attorney General that a sacrifice was unnecessary, what would your argument be consistent with Smith?"
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,445.824,463.869,"Well, Smith says that religious acts are subject to neutral and generally applicable regulation, but Smith also reaffirms the long line of cases that says Government cannot resolve religious controversies."
1992.91-948,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,503.268,509.981,"Gee, there... I'm sure there are a lot of statutes, local, State and Federal, that use the term unnecessary."
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,520.871,525.443,"The prohibition has to depend upon something other than the lack of necessity, Justice Scalia."
1992.91-948,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,583.363,586.248,Is there a lot of bow and arrow hunting in the City of Hialeah?
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,587.934,595.003,"Well, there is bow and arrow hunting by citizens of Hialeah who bring their kill, bring the entire carcass back to the city."
1992.91-948,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,601.241,612.382,"Well, certainly under our cases the city can deal with one perceived evil at a time without having to deal with the whole ball of wax, can't it?"
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,612.382,614.584,"I disagree, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.91-948,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,636.597,647.388,"Even though that's the only evil that is occurring in the... and you say that's not so, but supposing that the city council thought that was the only evil that were occurring in the City of Hialeah?"
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,647.388,651.174,But the reason they think it's the only evil is that they disapprove the religion.
1992.91-948,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,651.174,662.732,"Well, yes, but let's withdraw from that a little bit and just say, supposing the city council sees what they perceive as this evil, or something that they want to regulate."
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,675.991,677.691,They have not said that none of those things go on--
1992.91-948,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,677.691,678.374,"No, but I'm giving--"
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,678.374,679.776,--And the record does not show that none of those things go on.
1992.91-948,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,679.776,680.493,--I'm giving you a hypothetical.
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,680.493,683.778,Okay.
1992.91-948,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,701.906,703.439,They can't make any exceptions to it.
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,709.643,714.88,"--I'm inclined to think they can't make any exceptions, but this case doesn't get us anywhere close to that question."
1992.91-948,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,714.88,721.301,"You mean, you couldn't say you may kill animals for food but not for other purposes... not for sport, not for sacrifice, not for anything but food."
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,722.903,727.724,I can imagine an exception you'd kill an animal in self defense if you're being attacked by a bear.
1992.91-948,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,727.724,727.824,"Yes, an animal in self... or--"
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,727.824,728.94,"Right, okay."
1992.91-948,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,748.018,757.64,"--Well, but it may not be targeting the unpopular religion, it may be targeting the unpopular act, which may be an act that happens to be practiced only by the religion."
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,757.64,759.159,The act is not different.
1992.91-948,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,763.361,771.884,"Yes, but you've acknowledged that the act becomes different depending upon what its purpose is, that you'll allow it in self defense, you might allow it for food, but you might not want to allow it for other purposes."
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,771.884,772.25,I... I--
1992.91-948,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,772.25,773.752,It's a different act depending on what the--
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,773.752,782.441,--I do not believe they can allow animals to be killed for food without a ricual or ceremony and forbid these sacrifices where the animals are killed in a ritual or ceremony and then eaten.
1992.91-948,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,783.357,795.999,"--Take, for example, United States v. Reynolds, which was the case in which we upheld the constitutionality of a law prohibiting bigamy in the territory of the United States."
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,816.662,817.864,That law was not invalid.
1992.91-948,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,829.672,830.338,But--
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,830.338,837.842,"--It implemented a prohibition that had been present in Anglo-American law for centuries, and there had been bigamy by people who were not Mormons and who were not religiously motivated."
1992.91-948,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,837.842,850.335,"--That hinges on your saying... or ignoring, I think, the definition of sacrifice though, doesn't it, because the definition of sacrifice includes any ritualistic killing which would include a killing by a fraternity group."
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,857.239,866.845,"There may not have been anybody else in Utah at that moment, but bigamy laws have been around for a long time because there had been a problem that the legislatures and the common law had addressed."
1992.91-948,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,893.178,909.54,Could the city council require that all slaughter of animals within the city be done in a humane manner and define humane in a way that the result of which was to either prohibit or require the alteration of these sacrifices?
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,909.54,928.001,"Again, I think they could do that if they did it in a neutral and across-the-board way, but many of the killings that they permit are slower and less reliable, crueler than the method of sacrifice by slicing the carotid arteries, which is the method specified in the State and Federal humane slaughter acts."
1992.91-948,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,928.001,938.707,"Well, Mr. Laycock, in your view as you read Smith, what is the purpose of the neutrality requirement?"
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,940.909,942.845,I don't think it's an end in itself.
1992.91-948,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,957.486,961.307,"Well, we have a neutrality standard that we administer."
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,962.957,975.649,"Well, I think the purpose is that this Court stands ready, it says in Smith, to say that if you... if a Government singles out religion for special burdens or special prohibition, that is forbidden."
1992.91-948,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,984.053,985.688,And that is the ultimate end.
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,985.688,986.122,Well--
1992.91-948,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,986.122,988.874,We don't have a further reason that--
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,988.874,989.224,--Well--
1992.91-948,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,989.224,989.724,--We are concerned with--
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,989.724,990.159,"--No, I... I--"
1992.91-948,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,990.159,993.111,--Prohibiting legislatures--
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,993.111,993.694,--Well--
1992.91-948,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,993.694,995.644,--From acting with hostility to religion.
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,995.644,1014.691,"--I... I can't read your minds, but I think the purpose for which you enunciated that requirement is that requiring the legislature to treat an unpopular minority faith as well as it treats the bulk of the population will give a sort of self-enforcing political protection to the religious minority."
1992.91-948,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1022.63,1031.903,"Well, but I take it the underlying purpose for that is to avoid a regime which is hostile to religion."
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1031.903,1058.136,"--Well, I think that's right, but whether or not the whole regime is hostile to religion or whether only a particular body of legislation or a single law is hostile to a particular religion, I think the neutrality requirement is designed to protect religious practices at least to keep... it's a way of avoiding open persecution if they can single out a religion and treat it differently from how they treat everybody else."
1992.91-948,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1058.136,1069.778,"Well then the ultimate... our ultimate inquiry, our ultimate purpose, is to avoid a particular subjective motivation on the part of the State."
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1069.778,1076.182,"Well, certainly avoiding that subjective motivation I think is part of your purpose, but I don't think it should be all of the purposes."
1992.91-948,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1087.303,1090.339,"Well, that might be simply an objective mechanism--"
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1090.339,1090.691,That's right.
1992.91-948,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1091.557,1098.511,--For probing the existence of the forbidden intent.
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1098.511,1117.509,"--Both the objective and the subjective I think are evidentiary on each other, but as I read Smith and as I read analogous cases in the equal protection context... Washington v. Davis and Massachusetts v. Feeney, I think either objective discrimination in the text of the statute or a subjective discriminatory motive is sufficient to put us into the compelling--"
1992.91-948,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1117.509,1120.044,Because they both are probative of the forbidden purpose.
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1120.044,1121.094,--I think that's right.
1992.91-948,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1121.094,1124.913,Did the district court make any finding on the question of discrimination?
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1124.913,1125.529,"Yes, he did."
1992.91-948,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1155.9,1158.769,"The family of religions, or the practice of sacrifice."
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1168.624,1172.226,"When you suppress the central ritual, I think you suppress the religion."
1992.91-948,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1172.226,1173.511,"Well, that's true, but you know,--"
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1173.511,1174.011,The finding is--
1992.91-948,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1174.011,1180.765,"--There have been people like the Thugs were a religious group, I believe, and their central ritual was killing other people."
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1180.765,1181.215,--Right.
1992.91-948,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1181.215,1183.034,Surely that can be suppressed.
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1183.034,1189.688,"That can be suppressed pursuant to neutral and generally applicable laws against murder, and I suppose even pursuant to the compelling interest, but--"
1992.91-948,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1189.688,1195.525,"And Hialeah says they have a universal, generally applicable law against ritualistic killing of animals."
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1195.525,1198.711,--But that is not a universal or generally applicable law at all.
1992.91-948,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1198.711,1199.077,Yes--
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1199.077,1200.329,It applies only to religion.
1992.91-948,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1200.329,1200.579,--No.
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1215.422,1219.124,"If that's a valid argument, you really have repealed the free exercise clause."
1992.91-948,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1228.83,1234.65,In effect you're saving you've got to define the act without reference to the intention of the people who perform the act.
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1234.65,1243.942,"--You have to define the act without reference to the religious or secular motives, and you have to define the act without reference to things that are themselves inherently religious."
1992.91-948,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1244.458,1250.178,"You must ban all killing of animals or else no killing of animals because the purpose can't be taken into account, is that what you're saying?"
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1250.178,1253.297,--You must ban all killing of animals or you must permit religious killing of animals.
1992.91-948,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1253.663,1255.647,I thought you said you could at least allow self defense.
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1257.449,1261.903,--I said we would have a much harder and closer case if there were a couple of narrow--
1992.91-948,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1261.903,1262.469,I don't think it's close at all.
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1271.175,1281.281,"--That's right, but if the self defense exception would be permitted it would be because of the indication in Smith that the permitted reasons are compellingly different from the religious reasons."
1992.91-948,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1281.281,1284.25,"--The purpose makes a difference, so you can take purpose into account."
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1284.25,1289.386,"You can... but you don't take it into account at the neutrality stage, you take it into account at the compelling interest stage."
1992.91-948,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1312.216,1320.572,Did the courts below here apply a compelling interest standard in analyzing the ordinances?
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1320.572,1321.941,"I think not, Your Honor."
1992.91-948,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1322.558,1323.108,"Well, they--"
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1323.108,1323.991,--Recited the compelling interest.
1992.91-948,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1323.991,1325.976,--They purported to do so.
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1325.976,1327.762,"They purported to, but--"
1992.91-948,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1327.762,1328.062,And--
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1328.062,1331.713,--They effectively equated it with rational basis.
1992.91-948,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1331.713,1338.2,"--And specifically, where do you find the fault with the analysis of the courts below?"
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1338.2,1345.556,"Well, there's no effort to require the city to show that its compelling interest fit the discrimination in these statutes."
1992.91-948,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1392.085,1403.993,"Certainly city can distinguish between accidental killings of pets by cars and treat them one way and intentional killing of animals on the other, can't it?"
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1403.993,1407.445,"--Yes, but the accident intention distinction doesn't go to the disposal problem."
1992.91-948,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1433.512,1433.878,"Yeah, but--"
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1433.878,1434.814,--To sacrifice.
1992.91-948,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1434.814,1438.732,--One act is intentional and the other is just accidental.
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1438.732,1443.47,But most of the people who intentionally sacrifice do not improperly dispose of the animal.
1992.91-948,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1445.786,1451.539,"Well, like so many cases it depends on how you describe your class."
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1451.539,1455.36,"Well, I understand, but they've described the class in a discriminatory way."
1992.91-948,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1487.915,1497.704,"Is it their failure to preclude broadly enough, is it the underinclusiveness of it which precludes the finding of a compelling State interest?"
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1497.704,1504.174,"You can describe this as underinclusiveness if you want, but this is underinclusiveness with a vengeance, because nothing is included."
1992.91-948,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1504.174,1505.376,You're saying it's underinclusive with a purpose.
1992.91-948,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1505.976,1520.97,"No killings of animals are included except the religious killings of animals, so it's underinclusive in a sense, but they really have singled out religion for a prohibition that is applied nowhere else."
1992.91-948,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1523.255,1524.355,"Very well, Mr. Laycock."
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,1533.543,1536.729,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1992.91-948,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1602.874,1605.14,But not in Hialeah.
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,1605.14,1605.842,"--Excuse me, Your Honor."
1992.91-948,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1605.842,1607.426,But not yet in Hialeah.
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,1607.426,1618.549,"Your Honor, there are facts in the record that reflect that sacrifices had in fact been occurring in Hialeah, that dead animals were being found in public places--"
1992.91-948,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1618.549,1618.899,All right.
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,1618.899,1627.672,"--Within Hialeah, that animals were being, in effect, tortured in Hialeah and subjected to cruel treatment in the form of possession prior to sacrifice."
1992.91-948,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1630.541,1631.307,Okay.
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,1631.307,1642.932,I think that the record should reflect very clearly that Hialeah was responding to the problem of ritualistic sacrifices taking place in the city.
1992.91-948,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1697.668,1698.218,Well... well--
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,1698.218,1698.985,--It is significantly--
1992.91-948,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1698.985,1700.887,--May I interrupt you for a minute?
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,1724.986,1729.038,"--We believe not, in terms of effectiveness, Your Honor."
1992.91-948,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1871.582,1883.973,"You might have an ordinance that was easier to defend, though, in that situation, if it had been directed more precisely at the results of these proceedings rather than at the proceedings themselves."
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,1883.973,1893.763,"--Well, our ordinances, Your Honor, are not directed at religion, they are directed at the practice of animal sacrifice."
1992.91-948,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1937.907,1938.976,But maybe you have to.
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,1960.473,1962.675,"--Your Honor, there are two responses to that:"
1992.91-948,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1996.73,2000.098,"Well, why shouldn't that go to the compelling interest?"
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2010.24,2014.858,"We believe that there are two ways, certainly, to reach the result of the district court."
1992.91-948,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2101.332,2114.407,"But you let householders who have animals slaughter... there is an exception made for slaughter of a small number, outside of a slaughterhouse, of a small number of pigs and such."
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2115.44,2126.448,There is not an exception in the city ordinances of Hialeah that would permit an individual to slaughter his own animals for any reason in his house.
1992.91-948,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2134.471,2140.874,"Supposing somebody had a sick cat, that he thought he had to put him out of his misery, is it unlawful in Hialeah to kill your own cat?"
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2140.874,2147.028,"--There is a situation in Hialeah where you may, for the purposes of--"
1992.91-948,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2147.028,2149.146,"Well, for no purpose except to put him out of its misery."
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2149.146,2157.919,"--Yes, that would be permitted in the City of Hialeah, but we believe that it would be permitted by an establishment that is qualified to do that."
1992.91-948,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2157.919,2160.704,"You mean, I couldn't just drown my own cat in the bathtub or something like that?"
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2161.188,2162.221,"No, that would certainly be cruel."
1992.91-948,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2162.221,2163.323,It would.
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2163.323,2164.34,That would be a cruel killing.
1992.91-948,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2166.192,2167.658,It's forbidden to do that.
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2167.658,2168.058,It's forbidden.
1992.91-948,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2170.077,2177.048,"But supposing I gave him an injection of something to put him to sleep, then, instead of doing it in the bathtub."
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2177.048,2180.416,"In that situation it would be a permitted... it would be a permitted killing, yes."
1992.91-948,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2180.416,2191.057,Let's go back to your reason for not targeting the unsanitary practice rather than targeting the religious practice that you say ultimately leads to it.
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2201.079,2210.554,Because the sanitary problem that we have identified is one that is unique to animal parts in public places growing out of sacrifice.
1992.91-948,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2210.554,2219.927,"Yes, but the sacrifice is unique to private practices in private houses, and I don't see how you are likely to be very effective in reaching that."
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2219.927,2235.519,"Because if you prohibit the sacrifice, because you are in a position to stop it at a point when the animals are possessed, because you also have a possession statute and you have animals lined up going into a residence, you in effect preclude the problem from developing."
1992.91-948,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2235.519,2246.494,"Well, I know you do if you can do it, but I guess my question is, why are you likely to be more effective in preventing the practice within the private house than you are to be in preventing the disposal in a public place?"
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2246.494,2253.798,Because our view is that there are indications of when an animal sacrifice is about to take place in a house.
1992.91-948,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2272.461,2277.846,Did the district court make findings on these indicia of approaching sacrifice?
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2277.846,2305.598,"The district court made some very specific findings about how overwhelming the sacrifice process can become in terms of large numbers of animals being sacrificed in one initiation ceremony in a very small house in Hialeah with a 6 X 10 kitchen, and the district court judge marveled how this could all be done in a sanitary condition under circumstances where the animals were cared for properly under circumstances where the killing was--"
1992.91-948,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2305.598,2307.032,But you don't allow that.
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2322.525,2323.86,"--It can be inspected, it can be regulated--"
1992.91-948,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2323.86,2324.344,Right.
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2324.344,2325.227,--The method of killing can be monitored--
1992.91-948,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2325.227,2334.868,"But if you're talking about sacrificial killing, you don't even allow it to be done at a place... a temple, a church, whatever... where they say, come in and inspect."
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2336.585,2337.404,"--Your Honor, I think--"
1992.91-948,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2337.404,2343.473,"You allow it to be done nowhere, no matter how easy it is for you to police, no matter how willing they are to have you inspect it."
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2344.123,2381.683,"--I think there is an open question with respect to the ordinance 87-72, under circumstances where all of the other problems associated with animal sacrifice were alleviated... and when I'm talking about that, the cruelty to the animals, the situation of the method of slaughter, whether it is humane or not... which could permit the animal slaughtering where the food is consumed, under 87-72, in an area that was properly zoned for slaughterhouses, and I think that that is something that the petitioners have never pursued."
1992.91-948,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2400.727,2403.929,"When you say never pursued, did the city act on it?"
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2403.929,2409.333,--The... it was in effect withdrawn.
1992.91-948,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2411.202,2415.237,So there is no pending application in the City of Hialeah.
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2415.237,2418.272,As we understand at this point there is no pending application at the City of Hialeah.
1992.91-948,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2418.272,2428.996,Does the City of Hialeah allow people in their homes to trap mice and rats--
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2428.996,2429.429,Yes.
1992.91-948,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2429.429,2430.946,--If they're killed in the process--
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2430.946,2431.663,Yes.
1992.91-948,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2431.663,2434.9,--And to boil live lobsters and eat them?
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2435.55,2448.458,"There is clearly a prohibition in the ordinances about the boiling of lobsters, if you read the ordinances as saying, as I think they do... or any other animals, so I don't believe that the lobsters--"
1992.91-948,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2448.458,2449.458,You can't boil the lobster--
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2453.612,2461.468,"--I think that technically... a technical reading of the ordinance would say that the boiling of lobsters is claused by, other animals."
1992.91-948,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2464.001,2466.753,And what's the exception for the mice and rats?
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2467.704,2472.656,--The exception for the mice and rats would be in the State statute with respect to ordinances.
1992.91-948,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2472.656,2474.942,I thought we were looking at the city ordinances.
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2474.942,2478.56,"Yes, and there are--"
1992.91-948,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2478.56,2480.762,I just wondered where I found the exception.
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2482.798,2491.154,--I believe I can.
1992.91-948,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2497.808,2498.974,Could you give us the page number of the--
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2498.974,2499.408,--Well--
1992.91-948,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2499.408,2503.628,"--Are you referring to the text of some ordinance, and where would I find it?"
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2503.628,2503.978,--Yes.
1992.91-948,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2520.304,2523.958,The trapping and so forth are not sacrifices.
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2523.958,2524.791,That's correct.
1992.91-948,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2524.791,2535.849,And that's because what the city was trying to prohibit here was just the ritual sacrifice as performed by this church and others like it.
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2535.849,2542.853,"No, I think that what the effort was here was... and we make... we don't try and argue against this."
1992.91-948,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2546.505,2548.906,By this church and others like it.
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2548.906,2554.393,"--Not only churches, by any person, by any religion, by any cult, by any secular act--"
1992.91-948,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2554.393,2558.678,You talked earlier about the slaughterhouse possibility.
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2569.736,2573.688,--I believe that there are no slaughterhouses at this point in the City of Hialeah.
1992.91-948,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2573.688,2578.609,"Well, I want... I have a hypothetical city and a hypothetical slaughterhouse."
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2578.609,2590.066,"In that situation, I believe that there would under the rulings of this Court probably have to be either a Saturday or Sunday available in order to conduct the rituals in those particular slaughterhouses."
1992.91-948,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2590.066,2600.439,That is to say that the sacrificial rites that are conducted in a slaughterhouse are protected by the First Amendment.
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2600.439,2602.041,I think that they would be.
1992.91-948,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2602.374,2604.743,There is a First Amendment right to sacrifice animals.
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2604.743,2623.038,"No, I believe that there is a First Amendment right to, in a situation where you have a circumstance where you are allowing some religious practices to occur in a slaughterhouse, that you would have to allow them to occur on a Saturday or a Sunday."
1992.91-948,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2626.923,2628.608,"Well, let me ask you this."
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2646.57,2655.676,"No, we do not believe that a church would have a right to engage in animal sacrifice under circumstances that you have now described."
1992.91-948,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2655.676,2656.961,Why?
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2656.961,2668.5,Because we believe that the Constitution does not allow all religious practices to be engaged in even if they are central to the religion.
1992.91-948,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2691.015,2698.205,"Then is the legitimate governmental purpose here the prohibition of sacrifice, per se?"
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2698.205,2699.821,--We submit that it is.
1992.91-948,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2707.061,2716.332,And is it a fair reading of these ordinances to find that that policy is implicit in these ordinances?
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2716.332,2739.965,"--I think it is a fair reading of the ordinances that they in effect attempt to preclude animal sacrifice, and they do that in a number of different ways, and I think that is the question that the Court is facing, whether or not the attempt, and in this case a successful attempt to preclude the animal sacrifice as a governmental problem, is one that can be done under the First Amendment, free exercise provision."
1992.91-948,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2739.965,2766.099,"But would you not agree that in order for the prohibition to be legitimate, the public values that you assert are being furthered by the prohibition must not be allowed to be compromised through other exceptions to the killing that you allow, because otherwise you would have nothing left but an antagonism towards the religion."
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2781.609,2799.903,"I believe that the question becomes what particular problems the municipality is facing, and if the municipality has to go and deal with the hypothetical problems in the scope of the ordinance that are not really facing the community, I don't see why that is constitutionally mandated."
1992.91-948,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2838.778,2840.897,"Mr. Garrett, can I interrupt you for a moment?"
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2883.49,2883.857,That's correct.
1992.91-948,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2891.58,2908.808,"And the other thing that puzzles me, on the one hand you say there are tens of thousands of these sacrifices going on regularly and that's what prompted the ordinance, and then you say, as one very dramatic example of a goat being found on the beach that was apparently very unattractive and unhealthful--"
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2918.313,2922.717,"Well, I don't believe by giving you that one example, which was provided to you to show--"
1992.91-948,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2922.717,2924.051,"And there's only one in the record, is that right?"
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2924.051,2925.234,"--No, that is not true at all."
1992.91-948,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2928.336,2928.688,Goats.
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2928.688,2931.823,--That are testified to as having been placed throughout the community.
1992.91-948,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2943.548,2949.952,"Now, did those... they violate some other neutral statute before this ordinance was passed?"
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,2957.605,2959.74,"--Certainly, but they were ineffective."
1992.91-948,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2993.229,3009.823,"Okay, but an easier way to police them would be to go back to the example that Justice Kennedy was working you towards to provide some regulated place like a slaughterhouse in which the... kind of the core practice could occur, and yet you reject that."
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,3009.823,3037.942,"--I do not reject the possibility that under 87-72, under circumstances where there was an area zoned for slaughterhouses or an application was made for a change in the zoning plan and the animals were in fact consumed, that there would be a situation where constitutionally and under the laws of the city, that would be permitted."
1992.91-948,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3037.942,3038.776,They don't want to consume them.
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,3040.476,3041.061,Currently--
1992.91-948,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3041.061,3041.578,That's right.
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,3051.234,3055.519,"--The way the ordinances are drafted now, sacrifice would not be permitted in that circumstance."
1992.91-948,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3055.519,3058.221,And it's your position that that is perfectly constitutional.
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,3058.221,3062.09,It is our position that that is constitutional.
1992.91-948,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3126.365,3132.186,Isn't it also the case that that same witness rejected the State law definition of humane killing?
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,3137.006,3138.873,His position was that State law--
1992.91-948,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3138.873,3139.875,"Well, isn't that correct?"
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,3139.875,3143.16,--His position was that State did not go far enough in being humane.
1992.91-948,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3143.16,3143.444,Yeah.
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,3143.444,3147.546,"That was his position, and he's not a lawyer, and he wasn't rejecting it legally."
1992.91-948,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3177.065,3190.391,"But as I understand it, there's an exemption in the statute so that there's killing for food, and if it's less than, I think, 35 lambs a week or 20 cattle, something like that, it's permitted."
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,3190.391,3196.879,"It is permitted, but the method of humane slaughter is not altered by that exception."
1992.91-948,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3209.102,3219.91,"Well, your opponent I thought agreed that the city could prohibit inhumane slaughtering so long as it did it across the board."
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,3219.91,3233.635,"I believe that the petitioner's claim that they are entitled to slaughter the animals according to their religious dictates, and that that would not be subject to the regulation that we propose and that the State proposes with respect to humane slaughter."
1992.91-948,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3233.635,3237.087,Would this method of slaughter violate the State statute?
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,3237.087,3238.439,"Yes, it is our position that it would."
1992.91-948,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3238.439,3240.823,Has any of these people ever been prosecuted under the State statute?
1992.91-948,1,39337,richard_g_garrett,,3240.823,3246.477,To my knowledge there have been no prosecutions either at the State or at the local level.
1992.91-948,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3246.477,3248.494,"Thank you, Mr. Garrett."
1992.91-948,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,3264.606,3275.379,"The question of whether this could be done in a slaughterhouse, the ordinances are clear, the ritual or ceremony would be illegal in Hialeah in any kind of slaughterhouse under any kind of conditions."
1992.91-948,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3276.247,3284.769,"Do you agree, Mr. Laycock, that the limited slaughter that is allowed can only be allowed in a slaughterhouse?"
1992.91-948,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,3284.769,3285.702,--That is not correct.
1992.91-948,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3356.849,3358.568,How about humane slaughter regulations?
1992.91-948,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,3358.568,3361.519,--We believe that we are in compliance with humane slaughter.
1992.91-948,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3368.923,3369.773,Why not?
1992.91-948,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,3369.773,3370.042,--Hmm?
1992.91-948,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3370.042,3370.708,Why not?
1992.91-948,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,3372.808,3373.594,"Well, it may--"
1992.91-948,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3373.594,3377.796,"If the theory of your case is correct, why... you know, why not go all the way?"
1992.91-948,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,3377.796,3381.664,"--Well, because... because we're not tormenting and we're not torturing we don't have to go all the way."
1992.91-948,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3413.369,3423.177,"Well, if the intended method is not cruel, could not the city take into account that the intention just wasn't fulfilled sometimes and it turned out to be cruel in fact?"
1992.91-948,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,3423.177,3438.953,"Well, perhaps they could take that into account in a neutral and generally applicable way, but again, look at all the other methods of killing which they permit with no regulation whatever, with no claim that they might be... that they have to be always instantaneous and never a mistake."
1992.91-948,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3459.164,3460.731,"Thank you, Mr. Laycock."
