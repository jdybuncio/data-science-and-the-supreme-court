1976.76-607,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,58.975,"We will hear arguments next in 76-607, Miree against DeKalb County and the three consolidated related cases."
1976.76-607,0,32093,j_arthur_mozley,,62.641,65.779,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it Please the Court."
1976.76-607,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,92.452,97.703,"When you say implied private rights, do you mean an implied cause of action under the Federal Airport Act?"
1976.76-607,0,32093,j_arthur_mozley,,97.703,98.668,"Yes, I do Your Honor."
1976.76-607,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,98.668,104.518,Will you address yourself somewhere in your argument to where that was first raised.
1976.76-607,0,32093,j_arthur_mozley,,113.684,129.078,I believe that it was raised throughout the case Your Honor in terms of being beneficiaries of the safety covenants in the grant agreements and being able to sue as third-party benefits -- to sue for breach of those grant agreements as third-party beneficiaries.
1976.76-607,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,129.078,137.87,"You are simply talking then when you say implied right of action, you mean a third-party beneficiary claim not an implied Cort versus Ash type of claim."
1976.76-607,0,32093,j_arthur_mozley,,137.87,145.93,"Yes sir, I am speaking of an implied Cort versus Ash type of claim based upon breach of these safety covenants in the grant agreements."
1976.76-607,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,152.506,155.284,"Well, are they two different theories of action?"
1976.76-607,0,32093,j_arthur_mozley,,155.284,162.0,"Yes sir, I believe that if we wanted to possibly split hairs, they would be two different theories, yes sir."
1976.76-607,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,162.0,167.198,"Well, then if you have time to say when you first raised your Cort versus Ash claim."
1976.76-607,0,32093,j_arthur_mozley,,167.198,177.746,"I believe it was probably in the Fifth Circuit Your Honor, when it became apparent that the Fifth Circuit had turned a question on Federal Law."
1976.76-607,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,265.633,267.189,Did you say air force?
1976.76-607,0,32093,j_arthur_mozley,,267.189,286.113,"Airport purposes, excuse me Your Honor and possibly the most important is four; mitigation and removal of existing airport hazards and airport hazards being defined by Federal Law, as anything that adversely affects safety of life."
1976.76-607,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,286.113,293.884,"Now, these recitals in the statute, these are the conditions on which the federal government makes the grant."
1976.76-607,0,32093,j_arthur_mozley,,293.884,304.238,These were recitals in the grant agreements between the FAA and the County and they are also statutory requirements under the Federal Airport Act.
1976.76-607,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,304.238,306.642,"Well, they come into the contract because they are in the statute."
1976.76-607,0,32093,j_arthur_mozley,,306.642,313.693,"Yes sir, they come into the contract because Congress required them to be there."
1976.76-607,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,338.898,345.463,Why does the District Court then refer to your claim as a diversity suit in the Fifth Circuit too?
1976.76-607,0,32093,j_arthur_mozley,,345.463,349.171,"We have both types of jurisdiction here, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1976.76-607,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,358.952,366.799,"I do not doubt it, but all I am saying is the District Court opinion refers to it as diversity litigation, the Fifth Circuit refers to it as diversity litigation."
1976.76-607,0,32093,j_arthur_mozley,,366.799,370.104,"That is correct, Yes sir."
1976.76-607,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,372.192,383.475,"But your federal question jurisdiction is linked entirely to your claim of an implied cause of action, I think if you do not have an implied cause of action then you do not have a federal…"
1976.76-607,0,32093,j_arthur_mozley,,383.475,385.803,We do not have a federal question type jurisdiction.
1976.76-607,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,385.803,389.027,But we would still remain with complete diversity of jurisdiction.
1976.76-607,0,32093,j_arthur_mozley,,389.027,398.245,"Yes sir, with respect to our argument based upon federal preemption, we wish to make these points."
1976.76-607,1,16216,alan_w_heldman,,798.038,800.837,Mr. Chief Justice may it Please the Court.
1976.76-607,2,23627,f_clay_bush,,1922.39,1940.321,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it Please the Court. I am here on behalf of the DeKalb County and there are multitude question that this court has presented, but let me go ahead with what I’ve prepared as and it will probably bring in some of the question which you all have raised to the various opposing council."
1976.76-607,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1940.321,1945.385,You can do well if you can avoid questions by a statement like that.
1976.76-607,2,23627,f_clay_bush,,1945.385,1952.768,"Let me point out that in the initial panel opinion, as raised by the dissent by a Circuit Judge Dyer."
1976.76-607,3,32093,j_arthur_mozley,,2778.113,2784.65,"May it Please the Court, I would like to respond briefly to council’s arguments, that the county has immunity of the contracts claims."
1976.76-607,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2784.65,2788.587,"Mr. Mozley, your time has actually expired but we will give you till 12 o’clock."
1976.76-607,3,32093,j_arthur_mozley,,2788.587,2789.463,"Alright, thank you very much Your Honor."
1976.76-607,3,32093,j_arthur_mozley,,2791.113,2792.239,Thank you.
1976.76-607,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2840.344,2842.467,What contract was he referring to do you think?
1976.76-607,3,32093,j_arthur_mozley,,2842.467,2852.483,"The contract in this case was a contract authorized by the Uniform Airport’s Law which is same type of contract we have here Your Honor, of FAA, Grant Agreement."
1976.76-607,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2862.639,2865.691,The en banc majority and a footnote disagree with that?
1976.76-607,3,32093,j_arthur_mozley,,2865.691,2878.028,"No, sir the majority in the footnote simply said, “We believe that under Georgia Law, the result would be the same because under Georgia law, these petitioners are not indented beneficiaries."
1976.76-607,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2883.818,2884.502,"Thank you, gentleman."
