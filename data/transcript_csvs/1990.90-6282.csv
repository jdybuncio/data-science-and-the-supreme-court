1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.708,"We'll hear argument this morning first in No. 90-6282, Daniel Touby v. the United States."
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,10.909,15.471,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-6282,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,130.536,131.898,What about the President?
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,131.898,134.91,The President?
1990.90-6282,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,136.51,146.566,"There are a lot of statutes that give many Federal officials the right to define crimes... the Secretary of HHS, for example."
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,165.29,168.931,"Yes, Justice Scalia, but I think... I think there are two distinctions there."
1990.90-6282,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,186.201,190.065,Did the Attorney General personally prosecute this case?
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,190.065,191.197,"--No, he didn't, but he got--"
1990.90-6282,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,191.197,192.866,"So it's the same situation, isn't it?"
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,192.866,193.807,--I don't think so.
1990.90-6282,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,193.807,203.893,"I mean it isn't that the Attorney General both... in fact did the Attorney General personally do you think define the drug offense or do you think... he delegated that to DEA, didn't he?"
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,203.893,204.634,He did.
1990.90-6282,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,204.634,216.232,"So you had two different Federal officials, one making the determination of what's a crime, and another one, a United States attorney presumably, making the prosecution which is the same thing you have with HHS."
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,216.232,219.244,"I don't think it is in a structural sense, Justice Scalia."
1990.90-6282,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,264.485,276.943,"You know I expect the Justice Department as a whole today is larger than the entire Federal Government was oh, perhaps, certainly when... in the first century of... of the republic."
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,291.121,296.916,"I... with respect, I don't think that's an accurate perception, and let me suggest I think the legislative history suggests otherwise as well."
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,309.844,313.244,"What is your constitutional point, Mr. Klein?"
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,321.692,323.283,--Not... not to the same department.
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,323.283,331.287,"Well, what authority is there for that in our cases to say that there's some sort of internal separation of powers' principle within the executive branch?"
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,332.369,333.27,"Well, I think--"
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,333.27,335.381,"I mean, what authority is there in our cases for that?"
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,335.381,348.547,--Let me say the only authority that I've uncovered I think are cases like Gagnon and Morrissey which say the same person in the... in the executive cannot prosecute a parole violation as well as sit on it.
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,352.26,354.053,"Yes, but we don't have any adjudicatory function here."
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,354.053,359.857,"I agree, but, Chief Justice Rehnquist, I think it's fair to say the reason there's no authority... there's no contrary authority either."
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,381.17,386.004,Except that Congress has always been able to delegate some of those functions to the executive.
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,386.004,386.585,--Absolutely.
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,386.585,389.576,Including filling in the blanks in criminal statutes.
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,389.576,391.146,And... and I agree.
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,422.777,431.072,But where in... where in our cases or in what provision of the Constitution do you find a requirement of two separated judgments like you're talking about?
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,431.072,433.004,--I believe that's inherent in separation of powers.
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,437.986,439.809,But you have no case supporting that.
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,439.809,441.359,"Well, the only case I say is Gagnon."
1990.90-6282,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,447.854,454.627,"Well, you don't... you don't attack the standard by which... under which Congress delegated this power, do you?"
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,454.627,455.529,"--No, sir, I don't."
1990.90-6282,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,456.37,462.143,"So, it's delegating executive powers, not legislative powers?"
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,462.143,463.325,--I think--
1990.90-6282,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,463.325,463.974,Is that right?
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,463.974,465.336,--I don't agree with that.
1990.90-6282,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,465.336,466.716,"Well, you--"
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,466.716,467.417,It can't.
1990.90-6282,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,467.417,470.547,"--Well, then you must be saying... challenge the standard."
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,473.86,480.726,"Justice White, if I can... I don't want to... I don't want to debate words... but I think by definition Congress doesn't delegate executive functions."
1990.90-6282,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,490.521,499.607,"Well, if it's an intelligible standard, what authority does... what kind of a power does the executive exercise when it... when it responds to that delegation?"
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,499.607,502.609,--I believe the executive exercises executive power.
1990.90-6282,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,513.784,514.106,That's true.
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,520.47,521.39,--Absolutely.
1990.90-6282,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,562.859,566.152,And you say this is a separation of powers case?
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,570.443,576.428,"--I believe that... I believe it's a separation of powers, but I think... I think a part of separation of powers is due process."
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,585.964,590.198,"You've cited, Mr. Klein, Gagnon a couple of times."
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,594.929,597.811,"Gagnon v. Scarpelli and Morrissey v. Brewer, Your Honor."
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,597.811,599.322,And is it cited in your brief?
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,599.322,599.952,"Yes, it is."
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,601.455,603.755,It's not cited in your opening brief I guess.
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,603.755,604.045,"No, it's not."
1990.90-6282,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,605.156,622.688,"Mr. Klein, the scheme adopted by Congress also provides for some permanent regulations of schedule 1 drugs; does it not?"
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,622.688,623.479,"Yes, it does."
1990.90-6282,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,623.479,628.13,And the Attorney General plays a role in that as well?
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,628.13,629.182,"Yes, he does."
1990.90-6282,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,629.182,631.924,And can also prosecute for those.
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,637.878,638.639,"No, I don't--"
1990.90-6282,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,638.639,639.748,--regulations?
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,639.748,640.099,--and I think there's a critical distinction.
1990.90-6282,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,640.099,640.82,And why not?
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,646.714,650.567,"I... let me say what I think the critical distinction is, Justice O'Connor."
1990.90-6282,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,676.193,681.176,And that gets back I suppose to the problem Justice Scalia asked you about.
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,701.909,708.714,"I agree that we normally don't think of it that way, but that's because I don't think this issue, which I think is unique in our history, has been raised before."
1990.90-6282,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,736.583,750.301,"But there aren't separate... you either have to make it depend upon the executive, in which case the President has everything, or else your objection is that it's the same person that's doing both."
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,767.215,770.206,"But, Justice Scalia, with respect, the statute says the Attorney General has the power."
1990.90-6282,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,780.361,788.557,"And the Constitution says that the President can make the drug a crime, because any power that's delegated to the Attorney General belongs to the President."
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,808.651,812.491,But I think... I think the theory is even... is even questionable in the following sense.
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,830.514,838.631,And the Cabinet... in Jackson's administration... the Cabinet officer was removed by Andrew Jackson for refusing to remove the funds from the bank.
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,838.631,842.663,"--That's still a different consideration, Mr. Chief Justice, than making something a crime."
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,849.869,854.96,"Well, and he can get a... get a new Attorney General, just like Andrew Jackson did, who will make it a crime."
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,854.96,859.723,"Ultimately, I suppose, that's right, but I think that's a significant check."
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,859.723,860.103,Well--
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,860.103,878.196,"But I think to say that that is some... somehow no different from having on the one hand Health and Human Services promulgating a criminal enforcement regulation, and on the other hand, the Attorney General being in power to enforce it, that seems to me to be a very big difference structurally."
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,878.196,881.579,--Gagnon is not a separation of powers case at all.
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,881.579,883.178,It's a due process case.
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,883.178,883.458,It's a due process case.
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,883.458,884.47,I agree with that.
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,890.534,897.907,"Well, that really just sounds very, very mushy to me to say that due process has an underlying core of separation of powers."
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,904.182,907.855,But I... I don't mean it to be mushy.
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,916.06,920.544,"Well, so do all eight provisions of the... of the first eight amendments."
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,922.715,923.536,--Okay.
1990.90-6282,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1070.892,1072.702,"Well, I don't understand why."
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1091.315,1092.387,I don't think that's correct.
1990.90-6282,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1114.17,1121.205,"Oh, you certainly do unless you've been... unless you're affected by its mere existence... unless your business is affected by its mere existence."
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1121.205,1123.055,"Well, but that's the key distinction."
1990.90-6282,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1158.278,1160.842,You're saying Abbott Labs is a constitutional decision?
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1160.842,1163.611,--I say the only time it happened the statute was read the other way.
1990.90-6282,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1175.168,1184.074,"I thought Abbott Labs was considered quite a novelty when it was pronounced, that you're entitled to pre-enforcement review of a regulation."
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1191.631,1201.338,"--There is... it's not a constitutional decision, although I suggest that a year later in Oestereich, Justice Harlan at least suggested that pre-enforcement review is a constitutional necessity."
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1219.059,1223.922,"Well, Estep pretty much involved the same thing under the Selective Services Regulations, didn't it?"
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1223.922,1230.557,But Estep the court read into the Selective Service Regulations a post-induction... you don't have to be indicted.
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1231.628,1234.337,"Yes, but you couldn't challenge it before you were inducted."
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1234.337,1236.49,--You could challenge it if you went into the military.
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1238.09,1238.31,"Well, but--"
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1238.31,1239.182,--seek habeas corpus.
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1239.562,1242.324,"--Being inducted means going into the military, I think."
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1242.324,1243.393,"--Yes, oh, I'm sorry."
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1244.004,1244.835,"No, inducted."
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1245.166,1249.688,But you could there be... you could challenge it prior to any indictment.
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1272.484,1280.409,"Well, you can get judicial review here, too, of your... of your... you can get the thing reviewed in your criminal prosecution."
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1280.409,1285.602,"Well, I think that's constitutionally inadequate for the reasons I've given."
1990.90-6282,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1338.585,1342.008,"Well, the court of appeals read it that way, didn't it?"
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1342.008,1345.07,"The court of appeals even read it more curiously, Justice White, that if it didn't--"
1990.90-6282,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1345.07,1355.757,"Well, I thought it said that they anticipated that they would allow... they would allow judicial review in the course of a prosecution."
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1355.757,1357.349,--They said we don't foreclose that.
1990.90-6282,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1362.622,1366.786,"Well, they obviously didn't read the statute the way you did if they didn't foreclose it."
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1366.786,1369.958,"Well, I... I think they didn't read it the way I did."
1990.90-6282,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1373.051,1374.36,"Well, that's the judgment we're reviewing."
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1374.36,1375.94,--said... that's correct.
1990.90-6282,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1483.642,1488.174,"Mr. Klein, may I ask you to comment on a problem that I haven't quite been able to figure out."
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1493.937,1494.679,"Yes, sir."
1990.90-6282,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1494.679,1503.202,"But as I understand the Food and Drug Act, if this were a new drug, and it's not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, it is already a crime to distribute it."
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1508.696,1510.188,I think that's not accurate.
1990.90-6282,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1539.097,1543.28,"I see, because that only... the Food and Drug prohibition only attaches the act of selling--"
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1543.28,1544.52,In interstate commerce.
1990.90-6282,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1544.52,1545.531,--introducing in the... into commerce.
1990.90-6282,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1545.531,1546.412,"That's correct, sir."
1990.90-6282,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1552.987,1554.087,"Very well, Mr. Klein."
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1555.399,1557.362,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice:"
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1580.055,1582.036,"Well, then if that's true, let me ask you this further question."
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1594.004,1600.399,"Well, part of the problem here... it's perhaps best, Your Honor, to explain exactly how these situations arise."
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1639.195,1643.138,"In other words, it's really a matter of just increasing the penalties for what is already illegal."
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1643.138,1645.209,--Largely that is what the effect of this is.
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1645.209,1647.961,"And that's the emergency, that you've got to have the stiffer penalty immediately."
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1647.961,1652.545,"Yes, because otherwise the misdemeanor penalty is simply not sufficient material for--"
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1652.545,1655.954,"Well, you're in jail... you can go to jail for a year... isn't it that 1 year in jail is the punishment?"
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1655.954,1656.495,"--Yes, that's right."
1990.90-6282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1799.53,1803.474,You're saying there's no such thing as a constitutional delegation?
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1803.474,1804.966,That is... I think that is right.
1990.90-6282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1804.966,1808.459,The term delegation is really a... a misusage.
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1812.793,1814.703,"I believe that's absolutely right, Your Honor."
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1814.703,1821.078,"Now, as you have heard, petitioners concede that section 201(h) amply satisfies the intelligible principle test."
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1841.711,1842.673,Certainly.
1990.90-6282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1842.673,1844.363,And therefore unconstitutional.
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1850.337,1851.849,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1851.849,1856.411,Has the Court's opinions been as pristine as Justice Scalia would like?
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1856.411,1857.894,I'm afraid that it's not.
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1857.894,1860.004,So you have... you're in good company at least.
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1860.004,1866.81,"As this Court has repeatedly emphasized, the Constitution divides government power into three co-equal branches of Government."
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2045.135,2048.097,May I ask about your theory of how you read the statute?
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2055.023,2056.161,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2064.567,2067.748,--And would they be entitled to put in evidence in support of that motion?
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2068.32,2069.181,"Yes, they would."
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2069.181,2075.755,"They could put the whole record in, get into arguments about the procedures that were followed in the... by the Attorney General and the likely kind of thing you might--"
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2075.755,2078.869,"Excuse me, I didn't mean to interrupt."
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2078.869,2087.543,--It occurs to me that perhaps you're inviting some protracted proceedings in advance of trial in a lot of criminal cases in these things.
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2087.543,2095.279,"I think not, Your Honor, because I think what would happen in these cases is that we would rely on the administrative record that was compiled for the emergency listing."
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2110.068,2113.841,"And if the judge should dismiss an indictment, I gather you can appeal that, can't you?"
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2113.841,2115.021,"--Yes, we would appeal."
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2115.021,2116.553,You can appeal an order dismissing the indictment.
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2116.553,2126.991,"Now, as I said in this case the petitioners could have challenged the listing of euphoria in this particular case, but they chose simply not to do that."
1990.90-6282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2128.221,2130.561,Why can they do that in light of the words in the statute?
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2130.561,2133.884,--Our construction of the statute is as follows.
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2175.071,2178.744,You're saying it really means it's not subject to judicial review under the provisions of this statute.
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2178.744,2181.025,It says there shall be no judicial review.
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2181.025,2185.279,Is not subject to judicial review... an order issued under paragraph 1 is not subject to judicial review.
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2185.279,2186.347,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2186.347,2188.29,And you say except in a criminal proceeding.
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2188.29,2194.472,"Yes, we would say that in a case of criminal proceeding it's a different situation where you're allowed to raise that as a defense."
1990.90-6282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2194.472,2197.146,Where is judicial review provided for?
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2197.146,2199.167,"It is section 507, which is--"
1990.90-6282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2199.167,2199.798,What's that?
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2199.798,2203.37,--21 U.S.C. 877 is the statutory--
1990.90-6282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2203.37,2204.28,That's not... that's not in your brief.
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2204.28,2208.454,"--No, I believe it is summarized in a footnote in our brief, however."
1990.90-6282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2208.454,2212.067,21 U.S.C.?
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2212.067,2214.527,21 U.S.C. 877.
1990.90-6282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2221.17,2222.011,I'll get it.
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2222.662,2227.313,"Now, there's nothing unusual in challenging agency action in a criminal enforcement proceeding."
1990.90-6282,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2249.85,2271.773,"Well, if somebody is prosecuted for violating a regulation, the violation of which is made a crime, I would suppose he could plainly defend the... his prosecution on the... on the basis that regulation is inconsistent with the statute."
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2271.773,2274.284,"Yes, and in fact, the APA recognizes that."
1990.90-6282,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2281.44,2286.934,"Yes, but of course the Yakus case holds that if there is a provision that precludes judicial review, he cannot do that."
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2286.934,2287.565,That's right.
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2297.052,2301.493,The difference would be that there they at least allow judicial review for a stated period of time.
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2301.493,2305.566,"--Yes, at some point after the criminal enforcement proceeding, as in here."
1990.90-6282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2316.953,2326.65,Do you agree that this statute would be unconstitutional if you read section 6 to preclude judicial review entirely?
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2326.65,2327.8,"No, no."
1990.90-6282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2329.653,2330.063,It wouldn't.
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2330.063,2331.602,It would not be unconstitutional in this--
1990.90-6282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2331.602,2333.125,"Well, then why should I read it that way?"
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2333.125,2339.968,--We believe this is the best reading of the statute in light of the guidance this Court has given it in interpreting judicial review provisions.
1990.90-6282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2343.952,2345.224,It doesn't say here under it.
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2346.736,2350.017,"That's correct, and if the Court wished to read the statute like this--"
1990.90-6282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2350.017,2354.291,"I mean, if you told me... you know... there's a real constitutional problem otherwise, I... you know... I'd stretch a point."
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2360.645,2363.586,"--We believe it would still be constitutional, and for this reason."
1990.90-6282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2374.482,2376.793,As applied you say at least it's constitutional.
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2376.793,2377.324,--Yes.
1990.90-6282,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2377.324,2384.81,It won't always be the case that a drug he defines is necessarily already a crime under the Food and Drug Act.
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2384.81,2394.746,"Well, I think we can presume that it... that we're entitled to that presumption in determining the constitution... constitutionality of the statute that they... that he would act properly under the statute."
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2398.399,2399.06,Let me just go back for a second.
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2399.06,2399.43,--Yes.
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2399.43,2405.704,"What is your authority for the proposition that if you read the statute the way your opponent does, it clearly would be constitutional?"
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2405.704,2408.894,First would be the... the Yakus.
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2408.894,2410.326,The Yakus is the closest you get.
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2410.326,2411.598,The Yakus is the closest situation.
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2411.598,2412.507,Right.
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2412.507,2418.631,"It's worth pointing out though, however, that in some cases there certainly can be delegations of executive power for which there is no judicial review."
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2424.055,2428.529,"I understand, but your position is just as novel as your opponents in this particular issue."
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2428.529,2434.413,"No, I do... with all respect, Your Honor, I think it is... I think that we have... certainly have much stronger case support than they do."
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2434.413,2437.375,"I'm not saying that, but you don't have the case on the nose and neither does he."
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2437.375,2438.795,That is correct.
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2559.455,2561.596,"May I ask on that question, how far down the line could he delegate?"
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2568.959,2573.874,We... we think under Buckley v. Valeo this would have to be exercised by an officer of the United States.
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2578.326,2580.236,You say it would have to be an officer of the United States?
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2581.308,2582.57,"--No, the statute does not say that."
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2587.642,2588.404,I understand.
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2588.404,2591.936,So there certainly could be responsibilities that could be delegated to employees.
1990.90-6282,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2591.936,2594.788,But you think there's an implied limit on what the statute seems to say on its face?
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2594.788,2597.4,"We think there might be a constitutional limit on that, yes."
1990.90-6282,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2597.4,2610.176,"Is the theory of the Federal Enclaves Act, in which the Federal Government for its properties incorporates the existing criminal law of the State, has that ever been challenged under delegation principles?"
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2610.176,2612.079,I'm not aware of any challenge to that.
1990.90-6282,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2625.226,2633.002,Could the Congress delegate to the Attorney General the authority to declare any common law crime applicable on any Federal territory?
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2633.002,2640.847,I think that that would depend on a question of whether there's an intelligible principle that has been stated there.
1990.90-6282,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2640.847,2642.52,If it's necessary for the public safety?
1990.90-6282,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2642.52,2651.202,"I think that we might... well, the broader the delegation I think the more insistent we are that there be a clear... a clear indication of an intelligible principle."
1990.90-6282,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2668.326,2670.246,"Very well, Mr. Minear."
1990.90-6282,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2672.097,2675.379,"Yes, very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.90-6282,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2804.346,2806.086,"Thank you, Mr. Klein."
