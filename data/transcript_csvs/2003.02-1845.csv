2003.02-1845,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.972,"We will hear argument next in No. 02-1845, The Aetna Health Care v. Davila and Cigna HealthCare v. Calad."
2003.02-1845,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,61.384,64.066,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1845,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,148.198,158.701,"Now just to be clear, Mr. Estrada, you take the position that ERISA Section 502(a) completely preempts the Texas scheme here?"
2003.02-1845,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,158.701,159.344,Yes.
2003.02-1845,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,159.344,167.228,And we don't have before us any conflict preemption under Section 514?
2003.02-1845,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,167.228,169.375,"That is... that is right, Justice O'Connor."
2003.02-1845,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,170.905,171.36,Okay.
2003.02-1845,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,171.36,176.932,And turning to Section 502(a) and to the--
2003.02-1845,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,176.932,179.078,"Mr. Estrada, can I just raise a question?"
2003.02-1845,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,217.716,218.254,--No.
2003.02-1845,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,281.679,288.488,"Yes, of course they could, but the fact that if we held there was no preemption, it wouldn't necessarily mean they would win on the merits."
2003.02-1845,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,295.835,308.717,"Well, I didn't understand the claim as to the Aetna case necessarily to be a challenge to the promulgation of the formulary, which is expressly authorized by the prescription drug writer of the plan."
2003.02-1845,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,327.786,347.727,"I don't want you to go too long on point two without getting back to point one, but as long as we're here, it does seem to me that the dichotomy, the duality you propose between a decision about benefits and medical treatment might, at the edges, blur into each other."
2003.02-1845,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,363.702,365.56,"No, it is not, Justice Kennedy."
2003.02-1845,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,437.141,448.12,"I guess my point was, at some time, and even in these cases, there... that there was a component of what we might call medical judgment involved."
2003.02-1845,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,448.12,463.269,"--That is undisputed, Justice Kennedy, and I think that our position is that there is a fundamental difference between a claimant who has a doctor patient relationship with his doctor and a claimant who had an insuretal coverage relation with his insurer."
2003.02-1845,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,529.899,531.218,59a of what?
2003.02-1845,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,531.218,536.791,"--Of the Aetna petition appendix, 02-1885, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-1845,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,594.932,595.636,Oh.
2003.02-1845,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,595.636,596.972,"--you know, the one that I read."
2003.02-1845,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,618.382,624.781,"Yes, but let me just focus on the case involving the woman who may have needed a second day in the hospital."
2003.02-1845,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,633.902,637.329,I don't... I don't know if there's anything in the record about that.
2003.02-1845,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,651.447,658.672,So the decision as to whether she would have the second day in the hospital would depend on a medical judgment made by an agent of the plan.
2003.02-1845,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,659.786,669.324,--It would... it would ultimately... it would ultimately turn on... on a coverage decision that may include medical criteria.
2003.02-1845,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,669.324,672.296,"But the coverage is if it's medically needed, it would... she would get the second day."
2003.02-1845,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,676.466,680.059,But the question of medical necessity is a coverage term.
2003.02-1845,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,682.327,687.611,"Yes, but is not correct, to make the coverage decision, one has to make a medical decision?"
2003.02-1845,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,687.611,693.927,--It... one has to make... one part of the coverage decision is the medical decision.
2003.02-1845,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,707.635,712.503,"Well, I was focusing on the CIGNA case, because it seemed to me that it's a little clearer there that there would be a medical judgment required."
2003.02-1845,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,712.503,721.874,"--Well, once again, Justice Stevens, we do not contend that health insurance does not involve the consideration of medical factors."
2003.02-1845,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,729.964,743.794,"But it's a little... it's a little like... if you're telling doctors what's medically necessary under the plan, it's in effect maybe defining the basic standards of medical care, in a way."
2003.02-1845,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,743.794,747.776,"That is not right, Justice O'Connor, for the following reason."
2003.02-1845,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,829.389,851.391,"If you are correct that Section 502(a) preempts, is it possible that under ERISA 502(a)(3), that the plaintiffs might recover some money, for example, for pain and suffering and things like that?"
2003.02-1845,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,851.391,853.909,"I would think not, Justice O'Connor."
2003.02-1845,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,875.457,889.696,"Yes, but if you make an analogy to a trustee in equity, I think this is a different case than Mertens or Great West, because here, let's see, Aetna and CIGNA are fiduciaries, are they not?"
2003.02-1845,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,889.696,895.352,--Aetna is... and CIGNA is for purposes of claims processing.
2003.02-1845,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,895.352,895.64,Yes.
2003.02-1845,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,931.306,937.705,"That was the view to which I refer earlier, Justice Ginsberg, and it is possible that it may be right."
2003.02-1845,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,948.397,950.626,"No, but the whole thing would work if we could do that, wouldn't it?"
2003.02-1845,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,986.746,993.7,"--Well, it might, but it also works in the way it currently is for the following reason."
2003.02-1845,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1040.761,1042.33,"Very well, Mr. Estrada."
2003.02-1845,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1044.067,1062.022,"Mr. Feldman, will you tell us what the government thinks can be recovered under 502(a)(3) in the way of damages or other recovery?"
2003.02-1845,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1062.022,1062.477,Yes.
2003.02-1845,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1071.31,1072.303,Pretty big point to be in a footnote.
2003.02-1845,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1072.303,1079.566,"--Well, it's... it really isn't the issue in this case because our position in this case is that the claims are preempted by 502(a)(1)(B)."
2003.02-1845,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1092.115,1113.913,"Lest we be too sanguine about the application of that law in this context, I don't know any equitable cases that would consider make whole relief to be giving... where what is at issue is merely the payment... the failure to pay money, refusal to pay money."
2003.02-1845,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1122.724,1128.834,"--You get... there were... there are cases that I... I don't want to get too deeply into 502(a)(3)(B), because I don't think it's what's at issue in this case."
2003.02-1845,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1139.691,1159.176,"Sure. But all that's going on here is that the claimant was perfectly able to buy Vioxx with his own money, but when it was said by the insurer that they wouldn't pay for Vioxx, the claimant went and... went with the drug that was covered."
2003.02-1845,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1178.329,1187.495,"--Well, 502(a)(3)... I mean, ERISA does head up a beneficiary trustee... a beneficiary fiduciary type of relationship that does have analogies in traditional equity."
2003.02-1845,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1188.443,1205.821,"And the government has taken position... this is... the footnote is not the easiest to read, but I take it the Department of Labor has taken the position, in some ERISA cases, that there would be just the kind of relief that Justice Scalia mentioned."
2003.02-1845,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1208.217,1214.366,"--I... it's not clear to me whether it would, because it's not clear to me whether there was a fiduciary involved in this case."
2003.02-1845,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1222.046,1230.424,"But, as Mr. Estrada just told us that, for these purposes, both Aetna and CIGNA would be fiduciaries."
2003.02-1845,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1230.424,1236.657,"They... well, whether the... you know, I frankly haven't thought about whether the plan itself would be a fiduciary."
2003.02-1845,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1256.514,1259.57,I would like to hear your arguments on the preemption issue.
2003.02-1845,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1259.57,1260.229,Thank you.
2003.02-1845,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1294.947,1299.61,"Yes, but in the situation in the hospital case, there was no time to get relief."
2003.02-1845,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1306.092,1312.696,"--Well, I... in the first place, she was told before... I think the complaint says she was told before she entered the hospital that she would have only one day in the hospital."
2003.02-1845,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1314.432,1316.949,Unless it was medically necessary to stay an extra day.
2003.02-1845,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1316.949,1317.32,--Right.
2003.02-1845,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1328.222,1329.913,And what does that mean in the hospital setting?
2003.02-1845,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1333.174,1345.062,"--These claims can be made orally, again, if the exigencies require, and she could... she didn't try... as far as we know, no one made a phone call to the insurer and said can I get the extra benefits; she needs it."
2003.02-1845,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1347.291,1351.006,Well let's assume the case... because your preemption item would cover even the most extreme case.
2003.02-1845,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1362.689,1363.144,But then--
2003.02-1845,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1363.144,1367.973,Why are you preempting the state providing a remedy for that situation?
2003.02-1845,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1367.973,1373.463,--That would have been itself a denial of their obligations under the Department's claim processing... claims processing procedures.
2003.02-1845,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1374.911,1378.664,"It would have been a denial, but it wouldn't have given her the extra day in the hospital?"
2003.02-1845,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1378.664,1381.802,"--Right, but there are other backstops for her getting the extra day in the hospital."
2003.02-1845,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1387.169,1387.541,I understand.
2003.02-1845,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1387.541,1394.888,"It's up to her doctor, with whom she has a doctor patient relationship that's a consensual relationship for providing medical treatment."
2003.02-1845,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1399.058,1399.901,But she can't--
2003.02-1845,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1399.901,1406.283,--But the question we really are facing is whether the State of Texas is denied the authority to provide a remedy in that situation.
2003.02-1845,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1406.283,1419.536,"Yeah, but the State of Texas has many remedies to make sure the hospitals don't discharge people who need an extra day in the hospital and medical ethics provides additional reasons why doctors have... cannot discharge patients who need an extra day in the hospital."
2003.02-1845,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1419.536,1425.275,"I take it you... the drug case, the man couldn't pay for the more expensive drugs."
2003.02-1845,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1443.851,1450.788,"There was... he took the drug, I think that... the record actually shows, I think, that he took the drug for several weeks before he had... before he had the problem with it."
2003.02-1845,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1564.434,1574.958,Is there any indication in the record whether these individuals did not have the funds to stay in the hospital another day or to buy Vioxx?
2003.02-1845,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1574.958,1578.014,There's... I don't think there's any indication of whether they did or not.
2003.02-1845,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1643.499,1650.065,"But isn't that correct that those cases did not involve treatment decisions, Pilot Life and Metropolitan?"
2003.02-1845,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1650.065,1655.721,"Those cases involved disability insurance, but they were... they had a medical element in those... in those decisions."
2003.02-1845,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1656.176,1656.836,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
2003.02-1845,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1656.836,1657.373,--Thank you.
2003.02-1845,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1657.373,1659.065,"Mr. Young, we'll hear from you."
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,1659.065,1664.637,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1845,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1722.473,1723.792,What do you mean free to do it?
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,1731.511,1732.504,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1845,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1733.99,1737.517,"And if they didn't pay up, they would be... would be liable for damages."
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,1737.517,1741.753,If there is time for an appeal and if the circumstances would permit an appeal.
2003.02-1845,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1745.59,1745.806,No.
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,1760.988,1773.165,"--But, Justice Scalia, in these two cases, the patients did what the HMO wanted and when, under their argument, if the patients do what the HMO wants and it turns out those were bad medical decisions, there is no remedy."
2003.02-1845,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1773.703,1782.785,"They don't do what the HMO... all the HMO said is, look, under the plan, as we understand it and as we judge medical necessity, we don't have to pay for Vioxx."
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,1796.737,1797.935,--Well--
2003.02-1845,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1797.935,1804.501,But to say that the plan condemned them to not using Vioxx is simply not true.
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,1809.952,1819.406,"--Well, the truth is, Your Honor, that neither of these claimants would have needed health insurance if they had the independent means to just whip out gold card and pay for the drug."
2003.02-1845,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1819.406,1827.125,"See, that's why I'm thinking that Vioxx is not that... you know, on your argument you were just making, and I'll only lead you into this red herring once."
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,1827.125,1827.579,Okay.
2003.02-1845,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1827.579,1844.836,"But it would all work, you see, if I have a trust, the trust is supposed to buy me an insurance policy, and through total fault of the trust it doesn't, and the house burns down, the equitable relief appropriate would be consequential damages of the value of the house."
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,1853.048,1853.048,"But under this Court's opinions previously under 502, that remedy and those kinds of relief are not available."
2003.02-1845,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1853.048,1861.387,"So you see then the logical point where I'm... I'd like to say modify those perhaps, but, well, the very fact that you're trying to fill this hole here proves the point, because if there is a hole, it's because the court has interpreted this statute perhaps wrongly as the Federal relief being A, B, and C. Maybe it should be A, B, C, and D, and so what the state's trying to do here, is add D."
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,1890.161,1899.199,"It's true, Your Honor, that there is this whole, but that is not the reason that we should prevail on this narrow jurisdictional issue, because it's the source of the duty."
2003.02-1845,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1912.657,1924.463,"Well, how different is the question of the merits here, whether you should prevail and the question of complete preemption which is raised in the removal issue?"
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,1924.463,1926.775,Mr. Chief Justice they are different.
2003.02-1845,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1954.972,1966.118,"So your view is you could prevail on the propriety of removal, because there's not complete preemption, and yet go back and lose on the issue of whether your claim is in fact preempted?"
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,1966.118,1971.523,"Yes Your Honor, that is the way complete versus conflict preemption can work and the way that this Circuit said it could work."
2003.02-1845,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2009.214,2012.019,"Well that's contrary to Pilot Life, isn't it?"
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,2012.019,2014.248,"No, Your Honor, and for this reason."
2003.02-1845,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2017.592,2019.161,A very definite statement.
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,2019.161,2030.306,"--that 502, might trump and probably according to Pilot Life could trump the insurance saving clause, the Court also found very clearly that the insurance saving clause was not met in that case."
2003.02-1845,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2057.966,2068.739,"The strangeness of your argument is that you said all right, Pilot Life faced that issue, and says the savings clause doesn't apply in the complete preemption situation."
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,2113.405,2119.942,"Your Honor, the confusion arises because we don't write... we don't write the terms of the HMO's coverage if you will."
2003.02-1845,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2127.622,2128.737,Well they're the ones that--
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,2128.737,2129.358,They're the ones that can--
2003.02-1845,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2129.358,2135.302,--is there any insurer that does not at some point incorporate some issue of medical judgement in it's coverage?
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,2135.302,2136.583,--Yes.
2003.02-1845,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2136.583,2143.27,"If it does not, then in effect it is giving carte blanche to any medical decision by a doctor without right of review."
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,2143.27,2151.156,"Yes, Your Honor, in fact, some HMO's in the last two or three years have abolished this second guessing of the physician, this medical necessity step."
2003.02-1845,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2151.156,2163.166,"But let's... but suppose they don't, do the agents of the insurers who make these determinations do they have to be admitted to the practice of medicine in Texas?"
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,2163.166,2167.707,"Not in Texas, but they have to be medical professionals according to the Texas statute."
2003.02-1845,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2171.134,2172.787,What is a medical professional?
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,2172.787,2175.471,"--Well, in the case of a nurse, nursing judgment."
2003.02-1845,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2176.009,2177.617,But they don't have to be doctors?
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,2177.617,2181.043,--They do if they're making a medical decision that a doctor would make.
2003.02-1845,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2193.887,2196.859,"But you talk about the standard of care, but they're not giving care."
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,2198.551,2199.255,Your Honor.
2003.02-1845,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2199.255,2206.602,"They're not giving care at all, the caregiver was the individual's doctor who said stay in another day or take Vioxx."
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,2212.38,2213.494,Justice Scalia--
2003.02-1845,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2213.494,2214.98,That's not giving care.
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,2214.98,2221.462,--Justice Scalia I think it would be very helpful to look at when a payment decision could be made and when it is made in these cases.
2003.02-1845,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2239.583,2240.948,But it's a decision to pay money?
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,2240.948,2243.753,It is a decision that may--
2003.02-1845,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2243.753,2244.868,Or not to pay money?
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,2244.868,2255.187,"--Not exactly Your Honor, because it is a decision that could result in not paying money, but it is first foremost done here, or here to influence the medical decision--"
2003.02-1845,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2255.187,2255.642,It's both.
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,2311.619,2315.085,"--Yes, because of Pegram, this court in Pegram said very clearly--"
2003.02-1845,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2315.085,2324.539,"In Pegram you were dealing with the doctor who was the treating physician, that is precisely what Justice Breyer has just defined as not being the case here."
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,2324.539,2331.682,"--Your Honor, in Pegram this court said... the majority said there's no basis to distinguish an HMO where the decision's made--"
2003.02-1845,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2331.682,2337.271,"When we were dealing with a treating physician, we're not dealing with a treating physician here."
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,2337.271,2350.44,"--But here Your Honor, you're dealing with a medical judgment that's not made at the end when the bill comes due, it's made early on with the sole purpose of influencing the medical treatment, the course of treatment."
2003.02-1845,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2352.176,2352.381,Why do you say that?
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,2364.435,2368.334,"--Justice Scalia, if that were true then they would make these decisions at the end."
2003.02-1845,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2369.842,2372.071,It's important to the patient to know.
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,2392.755,2396.942,"--Well, the truth is that making the decision here shifts the risk."
2003.02-1845,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2406.007,2414.552,"Well except that you say when it's made here it is the choice of the doctor, the pharmacy or the hospital to seek that judgment early, isn't it."
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,2435.728,2445.266,"According to the documentation the HMO has, Your Honor, the two HMOs require that those decision be sought from them before or in the middle of treatment--"
2003.02-1845,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2445.266,2447.7,"If you don't get it then, they automatically deny it later?"
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,2447.7,2451.126,"--It's not just that they could deny it, they... there could be consequences to the provider."
2003.02-1845,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2455.834,2456.039,"So, they do force it."
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,2456.949,2458.064,"They do force it, Your Honor."
2003.02-1845,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2459.179,2464.38,"Well, I really thought the train left the station in Pilot Life."
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,2467.435,2470.862,"Well no, Your Honor, we are not here to disagree with Pilot Life."
2003.02-1845,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2474.122,2477.344,Well I thought that this was that circumstance of benefits.
2003.02-1845,2,26347,george_parker_young,,2477.344,2477.92,I was afraid you might.
2003.02-1845,3,21212,david_c_mattax,,2854.732,2866.332,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2003.02-1845,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2942.122,2944.268,How does it distinguish it from Pilot Life?
2003.02-1845,3,21212,david_c_mattax,,2947.778,2950.462,"--Yes, Chief Justice."
2003.02-1845,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2950.462,2961.979,"And then they said that even though apparently on it's face had to do with insurance and you'd think it would have been taken out, it wasn't taken out because of the fact that it interfered with the basic purposes of the act."
2003.02-1845,3,21212,david_c_mattax,,2961.979,2967.718,Pilot Life was based on the Court's complete preemption decision in Allis-Chalmers versus Lueck.
2003.02-1845,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2967.718,2968.378,Uh-huh.
2003.02-1845,3,21212,david_c_mattax,,2968.378,2978.863,And in that case the Court recognized that the tort claim that was being alleged was derived from the general proposition to perform contracts in good faith.
2003.02-1845,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3017.79,3027.161,"Yes, but is it not true that in order to recover under the Texas statute, not only do you have to prove a violation of the duty to use the due care and so forth."
2003.02-1845,3,21212,david_c_mattax,,3029.762,3031.498,No I disagree.
2003.02-1845,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3071.994,3080.289,"But it's also a defense that I did not fail to make any delay, I did not delay or fail to make any payment due."
2003.02-1845,3,21212,david_c_mattax,,3080.289,3081.282,--And if--
2003.02-1845,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3081.282,3082.146,Isn't that a defense?
2003.02-1845,3,21212,david_c_mattax,,3082.146,3084.708,--The statute provides that as a defense.
2003.02-1845,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3096.347,3099.319,But you make a medical judgment when you refuse to make a payment.
2003.02-1845,3,21212,david_c_mattax,,3101.465,3102.087,--Correct.
2003.02-1845,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3111.791,3112.247,No you're not.
2003.02-1845,3,21212,david_c_mattax,,3119.843,3120.958,And what I'm saying there is--
2003.02-1845,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3120.958,3121.33,Have you said that?
2003.02-1845,3,21212,david_c_mattax,,3121.33,3123.892,--That is a defense to the claim.
2003.02-1845,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3134.227,3136.728,Back to Pilot Life.
2003.02-1845,3,21212,david_c_mattax,,3164.509,3166.366,There's separate duties involved here.
2003.02-1845,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3203.025,3206.407,"It's not just an HMO, it's also a health insurance carrier."
2003.02-1845,3,21212,david_c_mattax,,3207.316,3212.806,It is theoretically anyone who exercises medical judgment that influences care.
2003.02-1845,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3276.214,3280.589,"But it's just... even at the early stage, it's simply a statement, we will not pay for it."
2003.02-1845,3,21212,david_c_mattax,,3286.905,3290.127,Well respectfully the statement is we don't think it's good for you.
2003.02-1845,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3296.071,3299.415,Well isn't it more a question of medical necessity.
2003.02-1845,3,21212,david_c_mattax,,3308.043,3316.771,"--Well the plan itself can put in the term medical necessity, but the plan is not making the determination of whether it's medically necessary or not."
2003.02-1845,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3320.979,3322.532,Well then it's certainly it's by the plan.
2003.02-1845,3,21212,david_c_mattax,,3326.952,3340.531,--But the reason to make that decision is because the medical necessity decision is a result of a determination by that managed care entity that they are going to manage the care that's provided.
2003.02-1845,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3342.35,3344.308,Well how much does that advance the argument.
2003.02-1845,3,21212,david_c_mattax,,3347.058,3356.922,--But the decision is based on a determination by a managed care entity that in their medical judgment that the care is not necessary.
2003.02-1845,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3381.525,3385.119,But you could say that in respect to any benefit of a plan.
2003.02-1845,3,21212,david_c_mattax,,3419.42,3429.247,And I believe the answer to that question is what the statute is concerned about is limiting and defining the liability of employers and plan sponsors.
2003.02-1845,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3457.565,3459.878,You really don't think... well never mind.
2003.02-1845,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3459.878,3462.191,Thank you Mr. Mattax.
2003.02-1845,3,21212,david_c_mattax,,3462.191,3463.677,Thank you.
2003.02-1845,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3463.677,3465.618,"Mr. Estrada, you have three minutes remaining."
2003.02-1845,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3465.618,3473.381,"Mr. Estrada, you can address what you would like but there are three points that have come up during the Respondent's presentation that I'd be interested with a response to."
2003.02-1845,4,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3483.041,3499.016,"Well it is true by virtue of DOL regulations which provide that no claim may be turned down, without input from a medical professional in the relevant area."
2003.02-1845,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3499.016,3505.537,"My other two points are, what is your response to the point that the plan is not liable under Texas law--"
2003.02-1845,4,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3505.537,3505.908,Well--
2003.02-1845,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3505.908,3507.766,--just the insurance company here.
2003.02-1845,4,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3507.766,3509.047,--That was going to be one of my points--
2003.02-1845,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3509.047,3509.435,Just so you can--
2003.02-1845,4,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3509.435,3513.605,"--That is consistent with every case, from Pilot Life, Taylor, and Ingersoll Rand."
2003.02-1845,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3544.425,3545.673,--Lastly.
2003.02-1845,4,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3556.973,3560.522,No and in fact it is also not true in this case that that's so.
2003.02-1845,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3680.279,3681.326,"Thank you, Mr. Estrada."
