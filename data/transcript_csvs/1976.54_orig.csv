1976.54_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,33.959,"We will hear argument next in 54 Original, the United States against Florida and Texas."
1976.54_orig,0,34311,lee_c_clyburn,,41.785,44.953,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.54_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,267.161,275.203,Was there anything in that legislation passed last October that has anything to do with the Doctrine of Sovereign Immunity that you know that Congress passed?
1976.54_orig,0,34311,lee_c_clyburn,,275.203,277.62,"Your Honor, we feel not."
1976.54_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,327.675,338.881,"Is there anything to the suggestion that if your counterclaim is allowed, other states will be implicated also?"
1976.54_orig,0,34311,lee_c_clyburn,,338.881,350.487,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, it is true that the issue that we raise in our counterclaim would probably be of interest to the other coastal states as well as merely to our two States or defendants in this lawsuit."
1976.54_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,380.124,385.378,"Well then, you are not relying just on your status as a counter claimant."
1976.54_orig,0,34311,lee_c_clyburn,,395.228,401.318,"I really do not know what our position would be if other states sought to intervene, Your Honor."
1976.54_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,476.142,492.136,"Isn’t that quote from the Government’s Brief largely based on our opinion last year on the Testan case, where we pretty much took the same position that there maybe a more enlightened view that Sovereign Immunity be abrogated but it is not up to this Court to do it."
1976.54_orig,0,34311,lee_c_clyburn,,492.136,496.946,"Your Honor, they do cite the Court’s opinion immediately after the quote that I read."
1976.54_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,525.096,536.503,"General Clyburn, may I ask you a question on the nature of the conflict between the United States and the two defendants within the three-mile limit?"
1976.54_orig,0,34311,lee_c_clyburn,,552.903,553.408,Yes Sir.
1976.54_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,553.408,560.723,"Two questions, is there anything else in the record shedding any light on the nature of the conflict between the States and the Government within the three-mile limit."
1976.54_orig,0,34311,lee_c_clyburn,,560.723,562.932,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.54_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,574.513,590.464,"Yeah, I was wondering how -- it is in response to interrogatories in the like that they say that there has been no conflict in this -- or is there is anything the record indicate there is any conflict in the sense that the drill vessels are arguing with one another about who can make arrests or is there any actual physical conflict of any kind?"
1976.54_orig,0,34311,lee_c_clyburn,,590.464,602.665,"Mr. Justice Stevens, the answer to your question is no, and the answer to your question is no both as to the belt within three miles and as to the area outside of three miles, at least, as far as the State of Texas is concerned."
1976.54_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,636.664,640.817,"If you are right about that, there will never be need for the counterclaim, will there?"
1976.54_orig,0,34311,lee_c_clyburn,,640.817,641.729,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1976.54_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,649.517,662.563,"Could you, perhaps 10.51 you would ask the other side, but what do you understand to be the United States’ theory with respect to the area outside the three–mile zone."
1976.54_orig,0,34311,lee_c_clyburn,,662.563,667.219,"Well, Your Honor, it is not clear in my mind, to be honest with the Court, but it is my understanding there has to..."
1976.54_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,667.219,669.697,You are claiming the right after the three marine leagues?
1976.54_orig,0,34311,lee_c_clyburn,,669.697,673.048,Yes Sir.
1976.54_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,673.048,674.675,What do you think their position is?
1976.54_orig,0,34311,lee_c_clyburn,,674.675,691.84,As I can understand their position is linked to the notion that the territory of sea of United States has traditionally been three miles and that action beyond that could have implications that they say would have more effect on them than our actions within three miles.
1976.54_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,691.84,699.661,"So, it is a different -- if they deny your right within three miles, it is for a different reason than outside."
1976.54_orig,0,34311,lee_c_clyburn,,699.661,703.15,"Excuse me, Your Honor, I think I might have not been plain in my answer."
1976.54_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,705.056,710.212,I am wondering if the grounds urged are different.
1976.54_orig,0,34311,lee_c_clyburn,,710.212,711.538,"Not really, Your Honor."
1976.54_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,722.263,728.26,But do you think both within and without three miles their idea is that this has foreign relations implication?
1976.54_orig,0,34311,lee_c_clyburn,,728.26,729.249,"Yes sir, that is correct."
1976.54_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,747.329,754.185,"Well, do they draw a difference between navigation and fishing?"
1976.54_orig,0,34311,lee_c_clyburn,,754.185,760.614,Fishing is the only issue that they raised in their lawsuit or that we mentioned in our counterclaim.
1976.54_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,766.66,772.861,Do you as in terms of what your rights are?
1976.54_orig,0,34311,lee_c_clyburn,,772.861,774.843,"Yes, yes Your Honor."
1976.54_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,777.695,779.105,To exclude a foreign ship.
1976.54_orig,0,34311,lee_c_clyburn,,779.105,779.967,Absolutely not.
1976.54_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,786.697,791.168,"General Clyburn, let me just ask you again, I am little puzzled about the prejudice to the State of Texas."
1976.54_orig,0,34311,lee_c_clyburn,,794.702,796.972,If we prevail on the merits of the lawsuit?
1976.54_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,796.972,797.557,Yes.
1976.54_orig,0,34311,lee_c_clyburn,,797.557,800.001,"Probably not, probably not Mr. Justice Stevens."
1976.54_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,800.001,808.253,"Then it is up to the Government, and if you lose, don’t you have two bites of the apple in effect with regard to the area within three miles."
1976.54_orig,0,34311,lee_c_clyburn,,814.833,833.34,"The prejudice Your Honor, it would come in and we feel in various ways; first and not of ultimate importance in this Court but a very rare one to the States would be that it would subject us to the very real possibility of repeat litigation a few years now when they decide to sue us only in a belt."
1976.54_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,858.546,861.81,And that would be the position of every single other coastal state.
1976.54_orig,0,34311,lee_c_clyburn,,861.81,862.823,It would seem so and our rights...
1976.54_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,862.823,868.684,"That is right, that 14.23 along with every other coastal state except for Texas and Florida or in the Gulf."
1976.54_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,868.684,871.889,Isn’t that the same parole 14.29 that is existed for the last 100 years...
1976.54_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,871.889,873.722,...for every coastal state?
1976.54_orig,0,34311,lee_c_clyburn,,873.722,887.143,We do not think so Your Honor because to my knowledge the recent developments in this lawsuit when the first time the United States just come right out and told us we do not think you have any rights at all to enforce your laws against foreign nationals anywhere offshore.
1976.54_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,976.014,985.085,Is it possible to infer that you may have raised the issue by asking certain questions in written interrogatories and all?
1976.54_orig,0,34311,lee_c_clyburn,,985.085,1008.999,"Well, Your Honor, we -- 16.26 interrogators 16.27 to get at the distinction they had raised in their lawsuit by suing us only outside of three or asked them to try to file the logical basis for their choice of suing us only outside of three rather than all the way into the shore and it is in response that they said you do not have any rights."
1976.54_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1021.244,1022.041,Very well.
1976.54_orig,1,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1024.481,1027.548,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.54_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1048.082,1054.854,"Mr. Sheehan, I wonder if you could lift that microphone up a little bit."
1976.54_orig,1,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1054.854,1059.751,The States have taken the position that they do have those rights.
1976.54_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1319.115,1324.534,Do you have a case involving a counterclaim against the Federal Government.
1976.54_orig,1,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1324.534,1325.251,I am sorry Mr. Justice.
1976.54_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1325.251,1331.794,Do you have a case involving a counterclaim against the Federal Government and Sovereign Immunity.
1976.54_orig,1,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1331.794,1347.093,"Yes, indeed I have two: One is United States against Shaw 309 United States reports; and another is United States against United States Fidelity."
1976.54_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1347.093,1348.757,309 and what?
1976.54_orig,1,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1348.757,1364.116,"309 U.S. Reports, Page 495, and the second is United States against United States Fidelity Company, 309 United States Reports, 506."
1976.54_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1408.4,1414.485,"So, you do not think 23.29?"
1976.54_orig,1,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1414.485,1416.619,"Well, I do think the 23.35 Mr. Justice."
1976.54_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1424.208,1434.635,"Would it be possible without this for the Master to say that in deciding your case, he now decides against you but he goes a little step further."
1976.54_orig,1,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1442.554,1448.719,"No, the Special Master can decide the United States complaint without reaching any of the issues posed by the counterclaim in our view."
1976.54_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1448.719,1455.595,I am saying he does grant 24.12 the counterclaim asked for without the state asking for it?
1976.54_orig,1,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1455.595,1465.514,"Well, to the degree that there is an identity of issues as a state asserts between the subject matter of its counterclaim and the subject matter of the Government’s complaint then there is no necessity for the counterclaim."
1976.54_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1467.509,1482.606,I am saying that they did not file the counterclaim and the case went to judge and the Special Master ruled against you and gave them the additional leave which they had not even asked for.
1976.54_orig,1,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1489.415,1492.039,"Well, I think that the United States would object in that."
1976.54_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1518.64,1536.1,"But if you lose on the merits of the claim that you asserted in your original complaint a fortiori the merits of the counterclaim would be decided against you, wouldn’t it?"
1976.54_orig,1,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1544.412,1545.666,That’s correct.
1976.54_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1545.666,1546.934,And...
1976.54_orig,1,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1546.934,1548.612,And if we lose…
1976.54_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1548.612,1564.586,"If the Master says and this Court ultimately says, sorry, the State does have a power to regulate fisheries between the three miles and three leagues within a fortiori would have power to regulate fisheries within the three mile."
1976.54_orig,1,46106,william_f_sheehan,,1564.586,1571.377,"I think It would, at the very least, be very strong precedent against the subject when sued by the United States."
1976.54_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1577.277,1580.571,Very well.
1976.54_orig,2,41775,sidney_h_mckenzie_iii,,1587.738,1590.654,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.54_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1662.152,1663.228,And you are reading from?
1976.54_orig,2,41775,sidney_h_mckenzie_iii,,1663.228,1671.133,"I am reading from Luckenbach Steamship versus The Norwegian barque, the Thekla."
1976.54_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1671.133,1676.75,Wasn’t that pretty well limited to admiralty cases by the Shaw case that was decided later?
1976.54_orig,2,41775,sidney_h_mckenzie_iii,,1676.75,1699.665,"No, Your Honor, I submit what the Shaw case did was simply state that the Thekla should not be interpreted as throwing the gates open wide to counterclaims against the Federal Government, and I do not think it does, and I do not think the language of it should be interpreted as doing so."
1976.54_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1723.308,1727.938,Except this one.
1976.54_orig,2,41775,sidney_h_mckenzie_iii,,1727.938,1732.472,"Well, except this one as one unique circumstance, Your Honor, and it is unique."
1976.54_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1732.472,1734.61,But what limit would you put on it?
1976.54_orig,2,41775,sidney_h_mckenzie_iii,,1734.61,1751.409,"I would put on it the limits of a counterclaim which one, does not involve the expenditure of public funds; two, does not involve an assertion of a right regarding federal property; and three, does not interfere with public administration."
1976.54_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1751.409,1758.269,"Well, what 29.12 United States says that interference with what the 29.16."
1976.54_orig,2,41775,sidney_h_mckenzie_iii,,1758.269,1760.196,"Well if they say, it involves..."
1976.54_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1760.196,1763.046,An interference with the federal control 29.22.
1976.54_orig,2,41775,sidney_h_mckenzie_iii,,1763.046,1764.872,"But that is not what they said, Your Honor."
1976.54_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1764.872,1766.351,But what if they did?
1976.54_orig,2,41775,sidney_h_mckenzie_iii,,1766.351,1767.631,What if they did?
1976.54_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1770.748,1781.178,What is your thought of -- what do you understand the Government’s theory is with respect to the area between three and nine marine league?
1976.54_orig,2,41775,sidney_h_mckenzie_iii,,1781.178,1792.384,"Well, unfortunately, the arguments in their brief and their arguments and the statements by state department officials run somewhere non-parallel to each other."
1976.54_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1880.734,1904.46,"Well, don’t you think there is something to be said for that if anyone on behalf of a dozen or more states is free to go out and grappling hooks on a Russian fishing boat, or Panamanian or whatever and pull them into the shore and hold the crew in custody."
1976.54_orig,2,41775,sidney_h_mckenzie_iii,,1904.46,1908.397,"Absolutely, Your Honor and that is exactly our point in bringing this counterclaim."
1976.54_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1916.711,1918.604,That all goes to the merits of this controversy.
1976.54_orig,2,41775,sidney_h_mckenzie_iii,,1922.144,1923.123,"I am sorry, Your Honor."
1976.54_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1923.123,1925.001,All these things go to the merits of whether or not you are right or wrong to the merits.
1976.54_orig,2,41775,sidney_h_mckenzie_iii,,1925.001,1936.53,"Well, in order to determine whether we fall within what we feel as the exception to the absolute prohibition against counterclaims as expressed in the Thekla case."
1976.54_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2020.163,2037.374,"Is it not possible that the Master and presumably this Court may accept the report, would rule that the same rule of law applies within the three-mile limit as applies between the three miles and the nine miles limit and if he does, then won't you get your answer when the case is all over?"
1976.54_orig,2,41775,sidney_h_mckenzie_iii,,2037.374,2064.661,"Well, Your Honor, of course something like that would be true in any case where there was a possibility of a counterclaim that a court might go beyond the declaratory relief of the original action but the result would be that by relying on happenstance and chance in that way, the positions of the parties would not be set forth for the benefit of the Master or for the benefit of this Court."
1976.54_orig,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2064.661,2072.482,The other thing that you are really worried about is if the Court rules with the Government you can't file a new suit because of Sovereign Immunity.
1976.54_orig,2,41775,sidney_h_mckenzie_iii,,2072.482,2075.246,"Well, that is why I say it is a matter of happenstance."
1976.54_orig,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2078.678,2083.732,Weren’t you considering filing the suit before the Federal Government did?
1976.54_orig,2,41775,sidney_h_mckenzie_iii,,2083.732,2085.487,Were we considering filing it?
1976.54_orig,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2085.487,2088.632,"Yeah, and found out you could not, so you waited."
1976.54_orig,2,41775,sidney_h_mckenzie_iii,,2088.632,2090.777,"Not to the best of my knowledge, Your Honor."
1976.54_orig,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2090.777,2093.045,"It is not possible, is it?"
1976.54_orig,2,41775,sidney_h_mckenzie_iii,,2093.045,2106.141,"Our people were asserting their rights quite unequivocally, and I think that is what inspired the Federal Government to bring this suit."
1976.54_orig,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2106.141,2111.228,But the point is that right now the Federal Government withdraws the suit.
1976.54_orig,2,41775,sidney_h_mckenzie_iii,,2111.228,2112.47,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.54_orig,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2112.47,2116.208,"So, would your counterclaim be ignored."
1976.54_orig,2,41775,sidney_h_mckenzie_iii,,2116.208,2119.95,If they would -- yes and I am saying if the issue it should be…
1976.54_orig,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2119.95,2123.971,The only way you have got a counterclaim is because they filed a suit.
1976.54_orig,2,41775,sidney_h_mckenzie_iii,,2123.971,2131.836,"And that is exactly the language of the Thekla where they said, it is said that there is no statute by which the Government accept this liability."
1976.54_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2194.442,2195.365,"Thank you, gentlemen."
