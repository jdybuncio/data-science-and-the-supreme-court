1993.92-6921,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.677,"We'll hear argument next in Number 92-6921, John Patrick Liteky v. United States."
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,14.121,16.753,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.92-6921,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,80.863,84.465,"If they were petty misdemeanors, how did they get into Federal court?"
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,85.897,86.698,It was.
1993.92-6921,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,195.844,202.91,"Mr. Thompson, was there an appeal in the... in the 1983 case, was there any appeal?"
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,202.91,205.203,"There was not in the 1983 case, Your Honor."
1993.92-6921,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,205.203,219.493,"Isn't there some concern here that the recusal motion is being used to substitute for, to do service for an appeal objecting to the fairness of the trial in 1983?"
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,219.493,226.407,"Justice Ginsburg, there is not a concern that I've seen raised by the Government in this case concerning that."
1993.92-6921,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,227.478,258.629,"Well, in allowing a litigant to rely on conduct in a prior trial when that judgment wasn't appealed, allow that many years later to come up in the guise of a recusal motion, is... perhaps that's the reason why courts have said they're not going to entertain what might be regarded as a substitute for an appeal in this form."
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,258.629,264.904,"--Your Honor, I don't think that would be a substitute for the appeal because it would be governed by substantially different standards."
1993.92-6921,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,302.269,314.529,"Now, the challenge here was brought under 455(a), is that correct, not under any of the provisions of 455(b)?"
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,314.529,316.78,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-6921,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,321.955,343.507,"And would you think that the facts here as you allege them to be would also be sufficient to amount to something that could be challenged under 455(b)(1), which is the personal bias or prejudice concerning a party?"
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,343.507,353.385,"I do not, Your Honor, because personal bias or prejudice since United States v. Grinnell in 1966 means extrajudicial conduct, and I think that--"
1993.92-6921,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,353.385,354.466,And you accept that--
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,354.466,355.036,--I accept that.
1993.92-6921,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,355.036,356.729,--requirement under (b)(1)?
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,356.729,357.709,I accept that.
1993.92-6921,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,357.709,366.585,So you're trying to fit this under the whether the impartiality might reasonably be questioned standard.
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,366.585,366.965,Exactly.
1993.92-6921,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,366.965,367.947,Thank you.
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,367.947,378.004,"And I think the face of the statute supports exactly that distinction, and that is really, I think, what clearly is to be decided here."
1993.92-6921,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,429.343,433.567,"Well, what... now, let's find out what kind of bias we're talking about."
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,454.371,457.293,"Mr. Chief Justice, it is not, in my view."
1993.92-6921,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,492.047,498.162,And not a disfavor or dislike of a particular kind of lawsuit.
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,498.162,499.323,Not at all.
1993.92-6921,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,502.555,527.663,"There is some overlap between the fairness of the trial, because the things that you... if you have a biased judge, certainly you don't have a fair trial, and so you are asking this judge to go over making this decision, the record of an old trial, in somewhat of the manner that a court of appeals would review it to determine if the trial had been fair."
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,546.666,549.831,"--Justice Ginsburg, I think there is substantial similarity."
1993.92-6921,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,611.627,619.453,"It would have to be the appearance, because a judge takes an oath to administer justice without respect to persons."
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,636.526,655.89,"Exactly, and that's exactly why 455(a) was passed, because at the time it was passed, it was passed to conform with the Code of Judicial Conduct which had just been passed by the American Bar Association, which incorporated for the first time in these statutes an appearance of impropriety standard rather than actual bias."
1993.92-6921,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,655.89,660.293,Is there... let me ask you another question about the kind of bias we're talking about.
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,676.826,685.271,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't know if... under 455(a) the affidavit is not required."
1993.92-6921,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,718.233,721.575,"Well, what I'm... I think what I'm trying to get at is something a little different."
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,748.803,753.627,I'm not sure if that would be sufficient.
1993.92-6921,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,766.206,780.825,"Well then, where do you draw the line between that and someone who is not at all friendly to plaintiffs' personal injury suits but treats all plaintiffs, personal injury plaintiffs, with equal ""hostility""?"
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,780.825,786.839,"--Where you draw the lines, Your Honor, I think is very difficult."
1993.92-6921,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,786.839,789.891,Certainly the way you're going at it I think it is.
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,789.891,800.259,"I think... you know, Congress, by passing this statute, a broad statute like this, basically indicated that it may be very difficult to make these determinations."
1993.92-6921,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,803.542,816.85,"Whether it's difficult in a particular case for a judge to make it, I certainly agree with you, but don't we have to have some uniform definition of bias before we can get at the reasonableness and so forth, which may be very difficult?"
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,816.85,858.487,"--I was reviewing on Sunday afternoon some of the cases and articles, and I wrote out, although I wasn't asked to and it wasn't part of the tasks for the briefs, because I thought this might come up, a definition of bias as I think it would fit into the standards that were applicable in 455(a), and what I came up with was this: circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to question whether the judge's inclination or state of mind toward a party belies favor or aversion of a degree or kind that might affect the judge's impartiality in the case."
1993.92-6921,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,880.021,885.174,The problem... your response to the Chief Justice disclosed this.
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,1029.627,1032.636,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1993.92-6921,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1102.177,1106.149,Why shouldn't it be... haven't you made a point that doesn't work in your favor?
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,1144.197,1146.056,"For two reasons, Your Honor."
1993.92-6921,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1194.349,1195.34,I have one question.
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,1209.832,1213.934,You mean in the 1983 or the 1991 trial?
1993.92-6921,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1213.934,1214.404,"Well, you take your pick."
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,1229.576,1246.417,"The only misconduct that is specifically alleged on this petition is the failure to look at the whole transcript, so we're clear on that."
1993.92-6921,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1268.172,1270.825,"And my question is, which of the ten do you think is the worst?"
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,1270.825,1305.068,"In... one of the ten in 1983, and I would say when Judge Elliott... Father Rosebaugh got up to give a closing argument, and Judge Elliott, who was the finder of fact in that case because it was a bench trial, so severely criticized Father Rosebaugh for giving a statement when he hadn't testified at trial that Father Rosebaugh was obviously intimidated and stopped and abandoned his argument, and then--"
1993.92-6921,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1305.068,1308.211,"We might have done the same thing here, if you had given a similar statement."
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,1319.948,1320.308,--It's--
1993.92-6921,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1320.308,1326.712,"It may be there's a polite and an impolite way to do this, I suppose."
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,1326.712,1335.498,"--And I knew that as soon as I gave one out of the ten in '83, or one out of the ten in '91, I could be met with that rejoinder."
1993.92-6921,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1350.879,1353.663,You rely on the principle of synergism.
1993.92-6921,0,38389,peter_j_thompson,,1353.663,1354.983,"In part, Your Honor."
1993.92-6921,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1357.795,1359.037,"Thank you, Mr. Thompson."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1361.1,1369.335,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-6921,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1385.186,1386.996,"Mr. Hungar, you just said, generally."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1388.858,1398.856,"Well, the Eleventh Circuit and every other court of appeals to address the question, Justice Ginsburg, has recognized a pervasive bias exception to the extrajudicial source requirement."
1993.92-6921,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1405.391,1408.373,"You read the sentence in the opinion we're reviewing,"
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1420.183,1423.165,"Well, what the Eleventh Circuit did there, Your Honor, is state the general rule."
1993.92-6921,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1481.536,1488.552,"I take it the answer to my question is yes, you do not read this as an ironclad rule without any exception?"
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1488.552,1489.683,--Correct.
1993.92-6921,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1522.857,1529.713,"And, of course, we could construe subsection (a) entirely consistently with what you have just said--"
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1529.713,1530.344,That's exactly right.
1993.92-6921,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1530.344,1532.758,"--and still come out your way, I take it."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1532.758,1533.789,"That's correct, Justice Souter."
1993.92-6921,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1574.868,1575.158,Well--
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1602.1,1608.202,"Obviously, Mr. Chief Justice, it's difficult to draw precise lines in this area."
1993.92-6921,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1610.836,1612.678,"If that doesn't, what would?"
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1613.66,1628.493,"The Fifth Circuit, for example, in a case cited in petitioner's reply brief, United States v. Holland, found pervasive bias where a defendant invited an error by the trial judge and then obtained reversal on that ground and the case was sent back to the same judge."
1993.92-6921,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1649.293,1656.74,Do you define pervasive bias as what a reasonable person would ascertain as being biased?
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1656.74,1662.112,"--I think that the... yes, Justice Kennedy."
1993.92-6921,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1662.112,1672.851,I'm not quite sure why your exception doesn't mean that the whole exercise of judicial and extrajudicial sources is just irrelevant.
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1672.851,1694.255,"It's not irrelevant, Justice Kennedy, because in the vast majority of cases, what... the way these cases are actually litigated is that parties tend to dislike rulings by judges, and then they may be able to point to a few stray comments by a judge that imitate... that indicate some irritation, and putting those unfavorable rulings and the few stray comments together, they try and claim that recusal is required, and--"
1993.92-6921,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1694.255,1709.065,"But if you have to go through the exercise of reviewing to see whether there's persuasive bias, why don't we just say that this is insufficient as a showing to disqualify, and the whole dichotomy between judicial and extrajudicial just becomes irrelevant at that point?"
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1719.082,1724.537,"--The courts of appeals, Your Honor, have had no difficulty separating the wheat from the chaff in this area."
1993.92-6921,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1747.172,1752.578,"Well, it is a little hard to real all that into the language of 455(a), isn't it?"
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1752.578,1766.144,"The requirement... I believe that that's correct, Justice O'Connor, it is difficult to read into the language of 455(a) the rather awkward and time-consuming procedures that petitioners are suggesting are there, and what's more--"
1993.92-6921,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1766.144,1770.409,"Well, I think it's hard to read into it a pervasiveness requirement."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1776.863,1790.864,"--With respect, Justice O'Connor, I think not, because, of course, the language ""reasonableness"" necessarily implies some flexibility and Congress obviously intended the courts to have some flexibility in applying that statute."
1993.92-6921,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1814.932,1816.465,So then we're just saying that that's not bias.
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1816.465,1817.774,--Exactly.
1993.92-6921,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1829.284,1835.799,"But then, I don't think pervasive is quite the right word for the kind of bias you accept."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1852.654,1875.508,"--That's correct, Your Honor, and the word 455(a) is leave to the courts a certain degree of discretion in defining the types of judicial conduct that should lead to recusal."
1993.92-6921,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1904.586,1928.884,"Is your position essentially that the statute is silent, but there is... there was a background jurisprudence, and Congress is taken to have allowed that... to either have incorporated it or allowed it to stay undisturbed, so you don't get it out of the statute, except that the statute doesn't overturn what has been the doctrine?"
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1928.884,1930.026,"That's exactly right, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-6921,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1958.936,1965.25,"Well, with the exception of the fact that (b)(1) refers to personal bias and (a) does not."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1965.25,1970.744,It wouldn't have made any sense for Congress to refer to personal bias in 455(a).
1993.92-6921,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1977.251,1979.951,"Well, doesn't that assume the question before us?"
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1989.018,2017.098,"--With respect, Justice Souter, even assuming... and I think it is correct that section 455(a) can, of course, give rise to grounds for recusal for bias, but it wouldn't have made sense for Congress in an all-encompassing provision that is aimed not merely at recusal for bias but at recusal for interest, recusal for relationship, and indeed, from everything we can tell from the legislative history, was adopted specifically with reference to the law of recusal for interest, and not with respect to the law of recusal for bias."
1993.92-6921,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2065.454,2079.815,"Well, if that's all it had wanted to do, wouldn't it have been easier to amend 144, because 144 does have a textual basis for the gloss that was put on it, because it refers to personal bias or prejudice, which is a textual basis for the extrajudicial source rule?"
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2079.815,2091.664,"This Court has never based... despite what the petitioner claims about this Court's decision in the Grinnell Corporation case, this Court has never identified the word 144 as the basis for the extrajudicial source doctrine."
1993.92-6921,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2120.814,2127.769,"Well, once again, you're not saying that if the judge forms his opinion based on what's in the case there's absolutely no basis."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2133.893,2140.699,"That's correct, Your Honor, because that's how this doctrine that has existed for 80 years has been applied by the courts of appeals, and that's consistent--"
1993.92-6921,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2140.699,2151.654,"--Can you give me a definition of pervasive bias, because I really... I agree with Justice Kennedy, I don't see what's gained by adopting this rule with this exception."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2151.654,2152.716,--I'm not sure.
1993.92-6921,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2157.44,2160.453,Does it mean anything different than really bad bias?
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2161.965,2164.957,"--That might be as good a way of putting it as any, Justice Scalia."
1993.92-6921,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2164.957,2169.52,"It may be better than pervasive, because pervasive to me means more than the single comment."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2173.854,2174.295,That's correct.
1993.92-6921,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2174.295,2183.372,--I notice in your brief there was some discomfort that you had with pervasive bias that you get out of a Fifth Circuit decision which you credit for it.
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2197.092,2201.616,"Well, I think the case I mentioned, the Fifth Circuit case by definition, since that's--"
1993.92-6921,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2201.616,2208.912,"You would have preferred that they characterized it as an extreme case, instead of saying pervasive bias existed."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2208.912,2211.934,"--Well, it doesn't really matter, Justice Ginsburg, how it's characterized."
1993.92-6921,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2231.338,2244.786,"Well, you might have an extreme case that is not one where the bias has been... pervasive has the idea throughout, and you could have an extreme case based on one remark."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2244.786,2246.979,"--Yes, we agree with that, Justice Ginsburg, and that--"
1993.92-6921,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2246.979,2248.458,"If it was a racial epithet, for example."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2248.458,2256.894,"--Precisely, and the Justice... and the courts of appeals have not construed the pervasive bias exception to require multiple incidents throughout."
1993.92-6921,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2263.188,2265.842,Mr. Thompson says that this is an extreme case.
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2272.69,2273.98,Well--
1993.92-6921,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2273.98,2275.951,Where does it get you to say it has to be an extreme case?
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2277.453,2285.859,"--Well, in this case, Justice Scalia, it gets us the judgment, because they never raised the pervasive bias argument, either in the district court, in the court of appeals, or in this Court."
1993.92-6921,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2287.861,2291.786,"They had to say... he didn't say this is an extreme case below, either?"
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2292.464,2301.951,--This case has been litigated from the beginning on the ground that petitioners lose if the extrajudicial source requirement survived enactment of section 455(a).
1993.92-6921,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2301.951,2308.466,--But it's not as if the pervasive bias exception were set forth in the statute as a kind of affirmative defense.
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2313.18,2316.841,"Yes, and part of the interpretation of this doctrine as it has existed."
1993.92-6921,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2409.861,2423.252,"I'm a little puzzled by this, because the... as I understand your argument, the pervasive bias exception is something that developed 80 years ago, so it's an exception to a rule that was superseded by 455(a)."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2432.977,2434.88,"--Well, that assumes the conclusion, Justice Stevens."
1993.92-6921,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2435.999,2437.862,455(a) is a new rule.
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2437.862,2440.773,--Not with respect to recusal for bias.
1993.92-6921,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2442.615,2448.19,"Well, it's a recusal for appearance of... where it's partiality might reasonably be questioned."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2450.353,2453.686,"Well, section 144 also addressed the appearance of bias."
1993.92-6921,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2469.32,2473.743,But you in your opposition say that the judge didn't abuse his discretion in finding he was not biased.
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2478.004,2480.378,"--It's up to the judge to decide the motion, Your Honor."
1993.92-6921,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2523.287,2527.181,"In all candor, I haven't read the pervasive bias exception cases."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2530.784,2533.155,"I believe so, Your Honor."
1993.92-6921,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2534.457,2540.11,Is there sort of a leading case you can point to on the pervasive bias exception as applied to 455(a)?
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2540.11,2542.633,"--Not that I'm aware of, Your Honor."
1993.92-6921,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2594.686,2597.108,Are you... let me... I just want to be sure I understand your position.
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2614.685,2619.256,If the court of appeals said that there's no indication that anything the judge did in this case or the early case--
1993.92-6921,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2619.256,2619.466,"No, no--"
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2619.466,2620.448,--had an extrajudicial source.
1993.92-6921,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2620.448,2620.648,--That's not my question.
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2627.773,2628.114,No.
1993.92-6921,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2655.714,2671.345,"What if the judge says to somebody, say a man during a divorce trial, that after hearing what you did in this case, I'm simply appalled, and I can't believe any human being would do that."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2681.3,2687.203,"--No, it's not, Your Honor, because the judge based that opinion, based on what the judge saw in the course of the trial, on the facts and the--"
1993.92-6921,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2687.203,2689.546,"Well, I don't think it makes good sense, then."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2730.964,2745.022,"--Well, certainly, Your Honor, the law as it existed under section 144 and the extrajudicial source requirement, and as we claim should continue to exist, provides that a judge's philosophical views of the law are not a proper basis for recusal."
1993.92-6921,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2746.725,2765.787,"Mr. Hungar, I guess I really don't understand just what's... did you say that if the judge says that in the course of the trial, I'm going to rule against you because you're Hispanic, that does not come within the extrajudicial source?"
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2765.787,2767.95,It would be an extrajudicial source.
1993.92-6921,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2767.95,2769.719,It would be an extrajudicial source--
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2769.719,2770.069,"Yes, because--"
1993.92-6921,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2770.069,2771.779,--even though the statement is made during the trial?
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2771.779,2773.171,--The question is not where the--
1993.92-6921,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2773.171,2776.353,"It's the source of the bias, not the source of the statement that counts?"
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2776.353,2776.584,--Precisely.
1993.92-6921,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2786.603,2789.167,But he only discovered the man was Hispanic at the trial.
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2789.986,2791.187,"--Well, that's right, Your Honor, but--"
1993.92-6921,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2791.187,2791.818,--he never knew this man before.
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2791.818,2798.932,"--I think we presume that there is some extrajudicial source for that basis, and the courts of appeals have so said."
1993.92-6921,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2800.144,2803.877,"Mr. Hungar, the cases speak in terms of in-court conduct."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2806.839,2825.789,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg, but if the in-court conduct... if the judge evidences an extrajudicial bias, that is, the reason the judge is doing something in court is because the judge is biased against a particular class, a particular race of defendants, or what have you, the courts of appeals have uniformly said that that is extrajudicial."
1993.92-6921,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2829.282,2838.839,"--Yes, but what if the judge said, I've tried 100 narcotics cases involving Hispanic defendants, and they're all liars, I'm convinced of that, and I therefore conclude I don't like Hispanics."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2845.224,2854.012,--The courts of appeals have applied the... have found that alleged bias is judicial if it's based on what the judge learned about a defendant in the course of conducting trials involving--

1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2865.909,2867.75,"--Well, yes, although that--"
1993.92-6921,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2867.75,2870.393,"--in the judicial proceeding, and that's the only time he ever met a Hispanic, was in the courtroom."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2870.393,2870.742,"--That's correct, Justice Stevens."
1993.92-6921,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2889.114,2895.709,"But it seems to me the inquiry is to the nature and the intensity of the bias, and not its source."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2895.709,2898.351,"--The source is directly relevant to that inquiry, Justice Kennedy."
1993.92-6921,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2912.532,2919.758,"That's not a fair hypothetical, because in one case we know that the bias was proper, and in the other case we know that there's no bias at all."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2919.758,2921.17,"--That's exactly right, Justice Kennedy."
1993.92-6921,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2925.694,2934.2,"But so then you've just given us a hypothetical in which it's self-answering, because there's no bias at all in the second hypothetical under any theory."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2934.2,2946.057,"--That's our submission, Justice Kennedy, that there is no bias within the meaning of section 455, and the doctrine of recusal for bias as a general rule, at least, if a judge forms opinions about the parties based on what the judge has learned in the case."
1993.92-6921,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2946.057,2956.705,"Of course, you'd also say there's no bias if what the judge said is, I've seen your right eye twitching during this whole trial, and I conclude from that that you are just an incorrigible liar."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2959.575,2960.236,"Well, again--"
1993.92-6921,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2960.236,2963.428,--That's a judicial source.
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2969.673,2971.613,"--Well, it might be grounds for reversal, Your Honor."
1993.92-6921,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2981.393,2982.975,That is not an extrajudicial source.
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2984.478,2985.119,--I wouldn't acknowledge that.
1993.92-6921,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2989.323,2989.533,Wait... now wait.
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2989.533,2990.775,"--fairly ridiculous hypothetical, but--"
1993.92-6921,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2990.775,2994.609,"If he says, on the basis of what you said, I conclude you're an incorrigible liar."
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3002.376,3002.626,--No.
1993.92-6921,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3012.366,3015.067,Could he have read a book out of court about eye-twitchers?
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3015.067,3017.18,--That might constitute an extrajudicial source.
1993.92-6921,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3017.18,3036.673,"Is there an easy way to get where we all seem to be agreeing we should end up, simply to say that subsection (a) does not contain the limitation that you say it contains, and construe it simply to require a very serious, a very bad degree of bias before it comes into play?"
1993.92-6921,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3065.044,3072.329,"It may or may not be easier, Justice Souter, but it would not be consistent with this Court's cases defining the appropriate approach to statutory construction."

1993.92-6921,2,38389,peter_j_thompson,,3200.899,3201.37,I agree.

1993.92-6921,2,38389,peter_j_thompson,,3361.445,3362.155,It does.
