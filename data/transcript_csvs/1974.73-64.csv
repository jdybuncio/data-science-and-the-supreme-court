1974.73-64,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,95.501,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-64, Iannelli against the United States."
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,100.818,104.491,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1974.73-64,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,235.993,238.431,It wasn't a very wide ranging rule --
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,238.431,241.777,"No, no your honor, it was not."
1974.73-64,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,551.847,564.772,"But then, the rule you're contending for Mr. McLaughlin would be a fact, a case-by-case application rather than a flat rule one way or the other?"
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,564.772,566.662,"Yes, I think so, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1974.73-64,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,579.659,591.55,"Well, I took the government's point to be that if they could demonstrate some instances in which Wharton's Rule wouldn't apply in the administration of the statute, then it shouldn't apply at all."
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,591.55,618.618,"Well, I think that's the position they take but the position we take is that they would have to demonstrate some practical, possible hypothetical -- in point of actual practice, any bookmaker who employed ten high school students in an aide or in an effort to operate a gambling business probably wouldn't even be mentally competent to stay on trial."
1974.73-64,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,618.618,630.031,"Now, if you convert that into some dangerous drugs, you might have a more commercially feasible illustration, might you not?"
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,630.031,645.8,"Yes, well now, traditionally now, for instance in the drug cases, Wharton's Rule does not apply because a single person can clearly be involved in the sale of drugs or transfer of drugs."
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,762.185,765.943,"Well, I gather that the differences with maybe our constitutional source."
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,772.469,775.863,"Now, I haven's suggested that, no."
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,776.692,779.072,A double jeopardy source.
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,779.072,781.052,It verges on that.(Voice Overlap)
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,781.052,782.096,You don't argue with that?
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,782.096,783.68,No.
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,785.269,791.9,"Well, you were asking us to apply Wharton's Rule just as a matter of supervisory value or ?"
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,791.9,808.325,"Well yes, and as a matter of -- there is a conflict in the circuits and the Solicitor General recognizes this conflict and recognizes in his memorandum in response to our petition that the problem is a recurring one and is of considerable importance."
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,860.701,886.129,"Now, as I say, I think the government almost concedes that there is something offensive about this idea of dual punishment but they take the position of course that there is no, in this case, no trial should be required because the Court can simply just straighten everything out by straightening out the concept of the punishment."
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,886.129,906.755,"Is it your contention, Mr. McLaughlin, that charges of conspiracy and of the substantive offense cannot be brought or that the jury must be instructed that they cannot find guilt of both even if they are brought?"
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,906.755,923.145,"That is not our position that they cannot be brought because in this particular case in Iannelli, there were two other substantive offenses charged and the conspiracy related to those as well."
1974.73-64,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,963.648,965.82,"Now, I'm not sure I follow."
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,993.474,995.931,I don't think the jury should be instructed on conspiracy at all.
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1018.653,1026.03,"You could have, of course, just to conspiracy case in the case where the gambling operation was never in fact set up."
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1026.03,1026.165,That's --
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1026.165,1028.517,You can have a conspiracy plus an overt act and --
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1028.517,1029.337,That's possible.
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1029.337,1037.262,But frustration of the object of the conspiracy would always (Voice Overlap) and that you could have guilty -- have people guilty of conspiracy.
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1037.262,1043.463,"That's right, but the Court can make that determination at that time I think and he doesn't have to submit it."
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1067.111,1071.681,"Well, I still don't know that I understand your answer to my question."
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1088.113,1088.221,That's correct.
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1088.221,1088.871,You concede that.
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1088.871,1089.509,"That's correct, Mr. Chief."
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1089.509,1107.348,"Alright, then let's assume that the proof at the trial shows that there was a conspiracy and that there was a commission of the substantive offense by five or more because five or more people were engaged in it."
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1124.394,1127.072,"Yes, that's at a minimum."
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1127.072,1129.021,"Well, what is your --"
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1129.021,1133.049,"Frankly, if he has determined that there is sufficient evidence --"
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1133.049,1133.622,Of both.
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1133.622,1138.542,"Of both, then I do not think that he should submit both to the jury."
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1138.542,1140.623,Which one must he eliminate?
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1140.623,1148.776,I would think that he would submit the substantive offense because it carries the more vigorous penalty.
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1148.776,1151.176,That's not a very defendant minded answer.
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1151.176,1168.893,"No, it's not but I think that that's probably a more palatable choice for the District Court because I think that they probably would feel that the more serious charge would be the one that should be submitted."
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1168.893,1170.776,The conspiracy is a pretty serious charge.
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1174.938,1175.521,Right.
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1175.521,1178.427,This Court has often said so..
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1178.427,1185.653,"But in terms of penalty, Congress has elected to make the substantive offense of the more serious crime."
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1185.653,1188.841,"Well then, would you answer my question."
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1217.358,1217.962,We feel that --
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1217.962,1218.811,There is always one.
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1218.811,1220.331,To dismiss the conspiracy.
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1220.331,1221.789,Why?
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1221.789,1230.871,Because the conspiracy is an integral part of the substantive offense.
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1235.981,1249.675,"Yes, but the conspiracy doesn't always result in the substantive offense and the jury might or might not reject the incriminating evidence with respect to the substantive offense."
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1265.732,1267.711,"Well, then perhaps maybe they should, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1283.165,1295.452,"And I didn't know if that was your position or if it was your position that in the event that there were a finding of guilt as to both, then it became incumbent upon the District Judge to do something about it."
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1295.452,1300.424,"No, as a matter, I think that's totally the wrong approach to it, what you portray (Voice Overlap)."
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1300.424,1303.671,"Well, what is your --"
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1303.671,1311.844,"I think he has to cure the matter by his charge, the minimum, before it goes to the jury but not wait until (Voice Overlap)"
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1311.844,1313.806,And say what -- (Voice Overlap) by his charge.
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1313.806,1324.078,That they may not find and the defendant's guilty of both offenses.
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1341.376,1346.682,And the instruction should be that way rather that you can't find them guilty of both.
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1351.988,1352.227,Not guilty --
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1352.227,1352.992,Or not consider --
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1352.992,1355.052,Or not consider it.
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1363.053,1371.197,And only in with the instruction be only if you find him not guilty of the substantive offense are you permitted to consider the conspiracy charge?
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1373.987,1376.949,"Yes, yes Mr. Justice Stewart, I believe it would."
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1380.489,1383.293,"Well, I want to know what your submission is here, that's all."
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1383.293,1386.331,"Well, what you said is correct."
1974.73-64,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1389.969,1390.64,Okay.
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1410.081,1413.729,"Well -- yes, they are bound together."
1974.73-64,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1427.582,1436.898,And then what you're saying is that there can't be any offensive conspiracy to commit the offense?
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1436.898,1437.645,"Really, that's what I'm --"
1974.73-64,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1437.645,1444.78,You must consummate it in order to have any criminal act.
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1444.78,1450.54,"That's right, because the statute requires that the five or more people actually be in operation."
1974.73-64,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1573.728,1589.239,"In your submission in response to Mr. Justice Stewart, do I understand you correctly to say that if both offenses are submitted to the jury, the jury can take its choice but they must -- they're mutually exclusive."
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1589.239,1590.872,They're mutually exclusive.
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1609.552,1617.771,"However that they're not necessarily mutually exclusive, that there could be a conspiracy without any evidence at all of the element commission of the substantive offense."
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1617.771,1620.654,"That's a hypothetical possibility, Mr. Justice."
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1620.654,1622.307,Only hypothetical.
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1637.381,1637.568,I would --
1974.73-64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1637.568,1639.694,There would be a conspiracy without a substantive offense.
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1639.694,1643.036,I would certainly concede that it is possible.
1974.73-64,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1652.41,1655.008,"If I follow you, that's a different answer from the one you gave me at the moment --"
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1655.008,1685.435,"But I don't think it's -- I don't think it's a probable situation and in the instance where you have the substantive offense and the Court is satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to submit the substantive offense to the jury, then clearly there is a conspiracy, too, because the substantive offense requires one."
1974.73-64,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1704.947,1717.727,You're analogizing this in a sense of having a jury find a man guilty of a given crime and a lesser included defense under the same statute.
1974.73-64,0,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,1717.727,1721.155,"It's somewhat similar, yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-64,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1725.758,1726.845,Very well.
1974.73-64,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1733.918,1736.92,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1974.73-64,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1759.56,1775.826,Does that mean that if you had a case where there were exactly five people who conspired and who were -- who then carried out their conspiracy by conducting a gambling operation then Wharton's Rule would be applicable?
1974.73-64,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1775.826,1776.827,Well in our contention --
1974.73-64,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1776.827,1779.031,I mean just with respect to your point two?
1974.73-64,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1779.031,1782.532,"As to point two, that's right."
1974.73-64,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1907.346,1912.381,"This argument leads you right into Mr. McLaughlin's case, isn't it?"
1974.73-64,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1914.135,1915.676,"No, no, we're not saying they're the same."
1974.73-64,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1919.088,1925.42,You're saying that the substantive offense is basically the same because they support the same exceptions to the hearsay rule.
1974.73-64,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1925.42,1941.347,"Well, we're -- in a sense, if Wharton's Rule apply, and I'm here taking everything that he has said is given, if Wharton's Rule applies yes, there is inherent in the substantive offense the very conspiracy to which he objects that in terms of a subsequent -- in terms of separate counts --"
1974.73-64,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1941.347,1942.627,"I see, you're beginning this argument by --"
1974.73-64,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1942.627,1948.177,I'm just beginning by accepting everything just to discuss only what should be done with this case if everything were accepted.
1974.73-64,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1948.177,1959.065,I see.
1974.73-64,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1959.065,1988.058,"Now, even if for some reason the hearsay testimony would be inadmissible if there were only the substantive count at trial that the District Judge here contrary to the suggestion that Mr. McLaughlin's brief makes specifically instructed the jury that they could consider that hearsay testimony, those hearsay declarations only in connection with the conspiracy count on page 61 of the appendix."
1974.73-64,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2149.241,2153.966,"What authority are you relying onto that proposition, that the double jeopardy forbids that?"
1974.73-64,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2153.966,2167.401,"Well, inferring it from decisions of this Court, most particularly North Carolina against Pierce, in which the Court stated that -- and there may be others, too, that --"
1974.73-64,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2167.401,2187.244,"You seem to be making this trial as being straightforward application of the double jeopardy clause, but such that conviction of the greater offense by (Inaudible)."
1974.73-64,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2187.244,2190.212,That's right.
1974.73-64,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2192.821,2194.757,Mr. Evans yes.
1974.73-64,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2194.757,2195.547,Yes.
1974.73-64,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2198.707,2199.517,Do you feel --
1974.73-64,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2199.517,2201.235,We're looking for a constitutional source.
1974.73-64,2,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,3574.051,3581.821,"I would address myself solely to one point, and that's the point of proper relief."
1974.73-64,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3629.072,3632.415,That was the receiving stolen property and the conviction for both and for larceny.
1974.73-64,2,31985,james_e_mclaughlin,,3632.415,3634.322,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-64,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3651.406,3652.242,"Thank you, gentlemen."
