1973.71-6852,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,22.008,"We’ll hear arguments next in number 71-6852, Lubin against Panish."
1973.71-6852,0,35469,marguerite_m_buckley,,24.534,28.703,"Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.71-6852,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,196.094,203.037,"Ms. Buckley, would Judge Weinkie's ruling have been appealable itself to the District Court of Appeal had you chosen to go that route?"
1973.71-6852,0,35469,marguerite_m_buckley,,203.037,215.243,"Yes, but it would have been meaningless in terms of relief for our clients because we could never have gotten any kind of hearing before the elections would be held."
1973.71-6852,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,258.761,267.46,"Under California law, is that necessarily a determination on the merits, their denial without hearing of a petition over extraordinary writ?"
1973.71-6852,0,35469,marguerite_m_buckley,,267.46,276.09,"In as much as they had the complete proceedings of the lower court, I know of no case Your Honor."
1973.71-6852,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,276.09,277.424,This was not certiorari.
1973.71-6852,0,35469,marguerite_m_buckley,,281.491,288.226,"But if it presented to the Court, all of the material, which was before the lower court Your Honor."
1973.71-6852,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,288.226,299.768,"And then, their denial without having you sit in is necessarily the decision on the merits, they don’t in their practice occasionally simply deny this disgression."
1973.71-6852,0,35469,marguerite_m_buckley,,299.768,305.249,I have no knowledge of that Your Honor.
1973.71-6852,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,306.594,310.601,On the writ of mandate in California is an extraordinary writ as somewhat --
1973.71-6852,0,35469,marguerite_m_buckley,,310.601,311.132,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.71-6852,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,311.132,313.675,"Well, isn’t that the answer?"
1973.71-6852,0,35469,marguerite_m_buckley,,316.523,317.43,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.71-6852,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,332.562,341.42,"Ms. Buckley, while your interrupted let me ask, has the California law with respect to write-ins have been changed since this case developed?"
1973.71-6852,0,35469,marguerite_m_buckley,,341.42,351.396,"Justice Blackmun, it has not been changed and even if it were, I submit to this Court that write-ins are not a suitable alternative."
1973.71-6852,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,351.396,357.906,You would feel that your case is no weaker if write-ins were permitted.
1973.71-6852,0,35469,marguerite_m_buckley,,357.906,358.266,That is correct.
1973.71-6852,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,358.266,359.483,Without payment of fee.
1973.71-6852,0,35469,marguerite_m_buckley,,359.483,360.637,That is correct.
1973.71-6852,1,22389,edward_h_gaylord,,1494.16,1497.999,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.71-6852,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1602.265,1603.383,You may hand that to the clerk if you wish.
1973.71-6852,1,22389,edward_h_gaylord,,1603.383,1606.658,I will hand that to the clerk then I -- wait for a moment.
1973.71-6852,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1606.658,1608.864,"And I take it, Ms. Buckley has copies of her own --"
1973.71-6852,1,22389,edward_h_gaylord,,1608.864,1613.113,I will see that she has a copy.
1973.71-6852,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1635.794,1642.692,Your brief proceeds upon the premise that the Court decided the constitutional merit to this case.
1973.71-6852,1,22389,edward_h_gaylord,,1642.692,1645.536,I say I am not objecting the jurisdiction of this Court.
1973.71-6852,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1713.885,1720.532,What is in California law on write-in that is not exactly correct with the -- started and fees growth?
1973.71-6852,1,22389,edward_h_gaylord,,1720.532,1721.864,"No, it is not that fee."
1973.71-6852,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1739.212,1745.645,"I understand that, but there are some states where the name, if you leave out the initial, it is no good."
1973.71-6852,1,22389,edward_h_gaylord,,1746.643,1760.883,"No, I think the rule in California is that if you can definitely ascertain that the name written in is for this particular individual, the vote will be counted for that individual."
1973.71-6852,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1811.441,1821.691,"Suppose the Board of Supervisors of Los Angeles County, how large is board present?"
1973.71-6852,1,22389,edward_h_gaylord,,1821.691,1823.775,It’s five-member board.
1973.71-6852,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1823.775,1825.028,All five elected at the (Voice Overlap).
1973.71-6852,1,22389,edward_h_gaylord,,1825.028,1832.792,"All five elected of those supervisorial districts of about 1,400,000 people in each district."
1973.71-6852,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1832.792,1834.166,Each on to the separate districts or --
1973.71-6852,1,22389,edward_h_gaylord,,1834.166,1835.073,Each on to the separate districts and --
1973.71-6852,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1835.073,1836.348,They do not run at large throughout the county?
1973.71-6852,1,22389,edward_h_gaylord,,1836.348,1837.791,That is correct
1973.71-6852,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1837.791,1838.545,Each runs separate.
1973.71-6852,1,22389,edward_h_gaylord,,1838.545,1844.862,"So there would be the voters in a district with a population of 1,400,000."
1973.71-6852,2,35469,marguerite_m_buckley,,2298.97,2335.05,"In respect to the question of whether the Supreme Court of the state of California had considered the matter prior to denying it, I would like to draw to your attention the fact that in my experience, the Supreme Court of the state of California generally when presented with the writ of mandate for the first time which it does not believe it has sufficient information to deal with kicks it back to the Appellate Court for decision."
1973.71-6852,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2462.841,2469.86,"Though I had that person were a pauper, it would not make any difference of the filing fee were $5.00 or $500.00 or they did not have anything."
1973.71-6852,2,35469,marguerite_m_buckley,,2469.86,2471.958,"That is true, Your Honor."
1973.71-6852,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2472.55,2476.471,"In that case, was the plaintiff a pauper?"
1973.71-6852,2,35469,marguerite_m_buckley,,2476.471,2478.839,"No, I do not believe so, Your Honor."
1973.71-6852,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2485.063,2486.861,I will ask somebody about that case.
1973.71-6852,2,35469,marguerite_m_buckley,,2486.861,2512.836,"But, in that case, the dicta was to the effect that while these fees were reasonable ranging from $10.00 to $50.00, that if the fee structure had been based on the emoluments of office as the present system is that they would have struck it down because such a fee would have no relationship to what it cost to run on election."
1973.71-6852,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2516.372,2519.223,"But, that case was designed as a matter of California law was it or --"
1973.71-6852,2,35469,marguerite_m_buckley,,2519.223,2530.81,"Yes, it was, in 1909 and it is the case which my opponent relies upon and which I believe Judge Rehnquist relied upon in saying that California fees were reasonable."
1973.71-6852,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2530.81,2538.121,"I have the impression from your earlier argument Ms. Buckley that if a fee with $100.00, you would still be here, is that right or not?"
1973.71-6852,2,35469,marguerite_m_buckley,,2538.121,2538.754,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.71-6852,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2538.754,2541.09,$10.00?
1973.71-6852,2,35469,marguerite_m_buckley,,2541.09,2543.974,"Well, Your Honor, I really object to the --"
1973.71-6852,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2543.974,2545.807,"You really object to any fee, don’t you?"
1973.71-6852,2,35469,marguerite_m_buckley,,2545.807,2555.04,"Well, if it cost $10.00 to print up the forms for nominating fees, then I think perhaps that could be reasonably explained."
