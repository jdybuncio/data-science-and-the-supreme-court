1967.92,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,21.519,"Number 92, James H. Harris, Petitioner, versus United States."
1967.92,0,38463,paul_h_weinstein,,23.95,28.2,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,1870.406,1875.237,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1933.187,1934.748,What's the difference?
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,1934.748,1935.449,Pardon?
1967.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1935.449,1937.933,What's the difference?
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,1944.948,1949.099,"Oh, I take it if there is no search, the Fourth Amendment doesn't apply and --"
1967.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1949.099,1954.408,I understand that but I mean to say what is the objective factual difference?
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,1986.028,1989.284,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1967.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2015.61,2052.442,"Mr. Weinstein has put to us very squarely and fairly the following preposition as I understand it that where in the course of an administrative search for proper reasons, a custodial search, something is found which has an evidentiary or incriminating effect can that later be used, that crime against the defendant."
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2093.17,2104.939,"Well, it seems to me to say a search is a search requires one to reject the findings that were made by both the courts below."
1967.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2136.214,2149.815,But suppose a policeman come to the door of my house and they opened the door in my house and they walk in and stop right there.
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2158.928,2160.918,I would suppose that it would be but I would --
1967.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2160.918,2161.17,"Yes, it is."
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2161.17,2163.091,-- like to know why they opened the door.
1967.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2163.091,2165.416,"It doesn't make any difference, I suggest to you."
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2165.416,2166.465,If your house is on the fire or --
1967.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2166.465,2175.393,That it may or may not be a violation of the Fourth Amendment but it's a search right there which sets in motion a legal inquiry.
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2185.535,2195.444,"Well, we'll assume that with the petitioner, there was a search here."
1967.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2228.721,2247.015,"The Fourth Amendment is written in terms of making the three different things unconstitutional, at least three different things, an unreasonable search, unreasonable seizure, and of things and on the reasonable seizure of persons."
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2266.381,2275.592,"Well, I'm -- I don't know of any situations here before where that dichotomy has been adopted."
1967.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2314.333,2314.649,"Well, the --"
1967.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2314.649,2327.565,Somebody I suppose again Mr. Weinstein I might say that he would like to discourage would be to abuse this valid administrative search for the protection of the car and its owner.
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2334.924,2335.216,"Oh, I don't know how --"
1967.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2335.216,2343.184,And the way to prevent that abuse is to forbid the introduction of this at this criminal trial.
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2343.184,2345.69,"Oh, I don't know how it was abused by opening the door --"
1967.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2345.69,2346.311,(Inaudible)
1967.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2346.311,2361.363,Justification for this was it -- was the administrative search of the car to be sure that no property was going to be lost or stolen and to roll up the windows of the car to be sure that there it -- it wouldn't rain in the upholstery.
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2377.159,2388.879,"Well, it seems to me of what the Government is doing is reasonable the fact that pursuant to it, it finds something that's usable doesn't lead you to the result that it can't be used."
1967.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2388.879,2391.377,To say it might have been the seizure that was unreasonable.
1967.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2393.579,2409.965,"Well, of course here the officer did what -- it seems to be conceded the police can do in a sense they looked in the car or maybe administrative purposes."
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2434.519,2439.458,Yes.
1967.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2439.458,2450.293,Suppose you'd pull up the -- suppose the trunk had been opened and they wanted to stop and protect it from the rain.
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2464.526,2469.502,"Well, I hope that at least it could be seized and removed."
1967.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2479.841,2486.562,I judge them -- what they all say is that -- he wasn't looking for this but he just actually have saw it.
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2486.562,2488.999,That's essentially I think what happened.
1967.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2504.051,2513.663,"Supposed they hadn't seized the property but he just wanted to testify to what he saw, wholly by accident but not looking for it, not searching for a thing in the world."
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2520.821,2520.875,"Well, I --"
1967.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2520.875,2522.854,-- by the Fifth Amendment?
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2522.854,2528.823,"I would suppose, Your Honor that if the card could not be introduced, he could not testify."
1967.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2538.943,2539.862,You're agreeing now.
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2542.808,2543.727,Yes.
1967.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2543.727,2549.423,"Made no effort to get it, didn't want it, didn't know anything about the agreement."
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2556.745,2559.586,"Well, I would hope that it wouldn't bar him from testifying."
1967.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2566.9,2568.11,"Well, why would it be?"
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2577.079,2577.314,Correct.
1967.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2577.314,2579.203,-- he's have -- to testifying to something that you saw.
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2581.39,2582.242,"No, I agree."
1967.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2591.309,2596.737,"Well, why does it necessary to follow the two and distribute, they're locked together."
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2607.489,2619.631,"Well, perhaps they're not but it would be -- it seems to me it would be kind of a curious rule if you had the thing that he saw and you couldn't introduce that but he could testify as to what it was."
1967.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2619.631,2624.755,But it might be except to the Fourth Amendment directed that the effects of (Inaudible).
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2624.755,2627.834,Yes Sir.
1967.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2627.834,2651.622,"Mr. Beytagh, it doesn't make any difference -- or would it -- let's suppose we have all the facts we have here except that the car was impounded because it was parked after four o'clock in an unparking zone as has happened on this city the -- bring a crane and take it down under the six and I take if this -- incidentally I notice this regulation is rather explicit."
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2664.504,2669.606,What then if pursuant to this search?
1967.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2674.59,2676.521,"But -- well, I don't understand why."
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2679.753,2700.588,"Because in the context to none of this Court's decisions talking about automobile searches and seizures, the Cooper case which is the last authority on the point, speaks in terms of the relationship of the search to the crime for which the person was suspected here."
1967.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2710.59,2723.651,But isn't this a reasonable for the police to inventory the contents of the car seized for illegal parking as it is to inventory this car which has been seized in connection with the arrest?
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2723.651,2727.735,"I think it's reasonable, yes."
1967.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2728.696,2730.683,Or is unreasonable?
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2730.683,2732.742,Or is unreasonable.
1967.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2757.019,2760.861,Do you quarrel with Preston?
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2760.861,2770.471,"Well, it's a little difficult to know what Preston stands for anymore."
1967.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2770.471,2771.639,Do you say anymore?
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2771.639,2772.614,Anymore.
1967.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2796.288,2798.764,"Could also pointed out, didn't it?"
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2810.328,2813.417,"Well, that's what Cooper said."
1967.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2813.417,2815.327,"Well, that's a fact, isn't it?"
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2815.327,2815.407,It's a fact --
1967.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2815.407,2817.402,Isn't that what the courts been holding?
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2817.402,2828.24,"It's a fact Your Honor that there are a lot of cases that speak in those terms but it also -- I have to concede as a fact that there are other cases that speak in somewhat different terms, speak in terms of --"
1967.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2828.24,2830.607,You say it does not depend on the (Voice Overlap) --
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2830.607,2843.912,They don't say it doesn't depend on the reasonableness but they talk in terms of the opportunity or ability to obtain a warrant and there are these two lines of authority that move along sometimes (Voice Overlap) --
1967.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2843.912,2846.709,They're all part of the circumstances?
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2846.709,2852.698,"Well, I -- that's one way to look at them."
1967.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2853.721,2863.068,"Assuming that Preston is still the law, is this distinguishable from Preston?"
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2863.068,2867.449,I think the situation here is distinguishable from Preston.
1967.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2900.046,2913.752,"When did it -- it was impounded, it was that the state who was entitled to the possession of it because of a statute bearing upon the narcotic traffic, wasn't that (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2913.752,2916.037,Which authorized the forfeiture of --
1967.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2916.037,2916.241,Yes.
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2916.241,2917.461,"-- upon conviction, yes."
1967.92,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2917.461,2921.604,Yes.
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2921.604,2934.743,That element was in the Cooper Case but the Cooper opinion itself said that the forfeiture cannot resolve until a conviction have been obtained.
1967.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2983.455,2985.789,"May I ask you -- before you do that, may I ask you this?"
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2985.789,2988.693,Yes sir.
1967.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2988.693,3003.918,Are you going on the assumption that the Preston case held those circumstances were the only ones under which -- which would make a search reasonable.
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3003.918,3005.179,You mean the Cooper case?
1967.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3005.179,3007.416,That the -- to the Preston Case.
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3019.425,3021.418,"No, I don't think Preston should be read (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3021.418,3027.567,"When on the whole facts and circumstances of the case is still reasonable, isn't it?"
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3027.567,3038.95,"Well in Preston as you pointed out in Cooper, the major effort was to justify the search on the ground it was incidental to an arrest."
1967.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3055.371,3066.552,"But you didn't understand it to say did you, that there's a per se rule, per se just that, no more, no less, that Preston had decided --"
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3066.552,3066.628,No Your Honor.
1967.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3066.628,3072.443,"-- that all searches made -- after you'd had a car, certain length, the time were unreasonable?"
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3074.142,3077.318,"No, Your Honor and I think that --"
1967.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3077.318,3092.713,I thought it was written on the basis of what I have thought for a long time was the law that we look at all the facts and circumstances of each case to see if it is unreasonable search and it's largely a question of judgment.
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3092.713,3094.479,I think that's right and I agree with you.
1967.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3094.479,3105.878,"And you are relying here as I understand it on the fact that eight judges, Court of Appeals held that this was reasonable?"
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3105.878,3110.534,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3160.598,3187.45,"Mr. Beytagh, I think the -- and there's another possibility, first, I'd tell you, what you're saying now is that the custody, police custody of the automobile here should be assimilated to the impoundment situation in Cooper."
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3187.45,3189.051,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3189.051,3216.905,"Now, that would mean as I think a colloquy a moment ago indicated that anytime the police impounded an automobile whether it was because of unlawful parking or whatnot that -- you would say that Cooper ought to apply even though Cooper was a different kind of a case, it was a forfeiture type of case, is that right?"
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3216.905,3219.167,"There was that element in Cooper, yes."
1967.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3219.167,3233.456,"Yes, but you're saying that anytime the police lawfully take possession of an automobile whether it's for parking or whatnot that it ought to be treated as -- that Cooper ought to be applied, is that your (Voice Overlap)?"
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3233.456,3235.493,"No, I don't think it's necessary to reach that."
1967.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3254.423,3261.079,"Well, how about in the present case now, what -- am I right, was Cooper a -- Cooper was a narcotics --"
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3261.079,3261.53,"Yes, Your Honor"
1967.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3261.53,3262.603,-- case?
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3266.761,3267.399,Yes.
1967.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3267.399,3270.432,"Now this was not a narcotics case, was it?"
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3270.432,3271.082,No.
1967.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3271.082,3272.475,This was -- what was this?
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3272.475,3279.592,This was a robbery in which the -- this vehicle had been identified as the getaway car and had been --
1967.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3279.592,3288.863,"So that you don't have the same possibility that you're suggesting is relevant of a -- use of the car as a place of concealment, do you?"
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3288.863,3291.612,"I'm not sure that you don't have, Your Honor."
1967.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3291.612,3293.081,You mean for the fruits of the --
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3293.081,3300.634,That the -- the first place that the fruits of a robbery go when a car is used to get away from the scene is into the car.
1967.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3300.634,3303.067,"Well, there was (Inaudible) of time here, wasn't there?"
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3303.067,3303.873,Yes.
1967.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3303.873,3309.488,Between the commission of the robbery and the time that the police grabbed the car?
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3309.488,3316.543,"Yes, the robbery was at midnight and the police seized the car the next day at 1:30."
1967.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3316.543,3323.69,"By now this -- alright, I think I understand your position on that but there's still another approach here, isn't there?"
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3362.68,3365.096,I don't think it's separate and distinct.
1967.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3372.004,3393.223,"Well, if you assume though that Cooper placed special emphasis upon the forfeiture aspect, the second analysis that I have suggested here would get away from what maybe the difficulty of analogizing this situation to a forfeiture situation."
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3393.223,3399.512,"Right, I agree with you."
1967.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3474.987,3480.506,"I expect the larger -- is the largest proportion of those, these which have towed away for (Voice Overlap) --"

1967.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3482.664,3483.555,Yes.

1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3489.39,3492.155,And get them.
1967.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3594.626,3595.419,And envelopes?
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3595.419,3595.985,Envelopes.
1967.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3595.985,3598.225,Paper bags with guns in it.
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3598.225,3601.905,That's right.
1967.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3650.66,3652.068,Let's say I understand you.
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3678.284,3682.65,"Well, I don't know why they entered the house and I don't know what --"
1967.92,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3682.65,3689.243,"Well, suppose a -- they entered a house in pursuit of some robbers --"
1967.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3689.243,3697.753,"And they see an envelope with some photography shots but sealed up, they're looking for pictures of the robber."
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3697.753,3699.761,"Well, I don't know about the -- part of --"
1967.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3699.761,3700.967,"That was Gilbert, remember?"
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3706.478,3713.303,"Well, it seems to me that you have to apply the test of reasonableness as to the seizure and if --"
1967.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3713.303,3721.627,"Let's say they could open the envelop and lo and behold, there pictures of the robber, they can use it."
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3721.627,3730.802,Well I'd -- again I say that a Court would I think look at all the circumstances of the situation.
1967.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3738.566,3751.457,"But what if your -- what if somebody starts to ask him questions just as a witness here, just to investigate him, asks him some questions to see a brown paper sack on the table."
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3776.273,3776.968,I don't think so.

1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3805.957,3809.62,I think that's very -- and I think that makes it difficult to answer somewhat in the abstract --
1967.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3809.62,3815.339,It's hard to answer a per se question particularly about anyone of particular things.
1967.92,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3815.339,3816.171,"Yes, Your Honor."
