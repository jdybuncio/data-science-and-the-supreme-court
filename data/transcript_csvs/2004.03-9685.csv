2004.03-9685,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,5.504,We'll now hear argument in Johnson against the United States.
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,6.715,11.867,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-9685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,93.355,96.566,One little complication here.
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,108.182,109.014,--Correct.
2004.03-9685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,109.014,123.456,And subsection (4) of that section says: the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,150.06,153.729,"Well, there... there are several levels to the response."
2004.03-9685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,168.743,170.642,"Well, but you're not being responsive to my question."
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,178.53,179.293,Yes.
2004.03-9685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,179.293,186.743,"But I asked you, is there any requirement that the defendant act promptly in going back to the State to get the vacaturs?"
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,186.743,189.17,There's no requirement in... in the fourth trigger.
2004.03-9685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,189.767,194.077,"Well, except that the statute itself speaks of diligence."
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,218.375,221.629,--The requirement is not found in the fourth trigger.
2004.03-9685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,229.384,236.76,"Well, but the Federal statute says... it puts a burden of diligence on the defendant."
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,236.76,242.488,"--Reading the plain language, we think that burden of diligence applies to discovering the vacatur."
2004.03-9685,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,246.558,248.595,How... how could one not discover the vacatur?
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,372.65,379.034,"--I do and here's why, first, starting with the language before I turn to the policy side of your question."
2004.03-9685,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,420.31,432.55,"And when it could have been discovered I guess if he had taken due diligence and gone and made the motion within a year, at least, of his having been convicted in the Federal court."
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,461.702,463.974,--I--
2004.03-9685,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,463.974,466.177,"I don't see how you can do both, in other words."
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,466.177,467.281,--I think we can.
2004.03-9685,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,487.484,490.599,"On the pure English language, it's not exactly a fact."
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,490.599,491.522,--Well--
2004.03-9685,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,491.522,494.157,"I mean, it's a legal determination."
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,496.242,503.565,"--And... and as we point out in our brief, there's nothing... in this context in particular, a vacatur is like a conviction."
2004.03-9685,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,507.794,535.032,"Well, just so that I understand your argument then, going back to Justice O'Connor's question, if you get a long sentence, can you sit there for 10 years, then initiate the process to get the earlier conviction vacated and then say, as soon as it is, with due diligence I'm here at the courthouse because, although I waited 10 years, I have brought my 2255 as soon as I learned that my earlier sentence had been vacated?"
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,539.058,544.434,"He satisfies the statute, but I need to point out something that I think is critical to understanding this question."
2004.03-9685,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,555.096,574.92,"Okay, but in... in six States, I would have thought that, A, the due diligence language, together with the general obvious policy of AEDPA, to get this over with, would have made it very difficult to conclude that he can sit there without doing anything for 10 years."
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,574.92,576.307,"--Well, I--"
2004.03-9685,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,576.307,579.47,"Maybe it's only in six States, but six States count."
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,579.47,581.592,--They do count.
2004.03-9685,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,633.081,633.22,All right.
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,676.655,684.789,Because if you were going to be strict about it... and... and I'm not sure I understand all of the parameters of the hypothetical... in--
2004.03-9685,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,712.661,684.789,Easy.
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,713.311,718.399,"--If Mr. Johnson had done that in this case, he still would have missed the 1-year statute of limitations."
2004.03-9685,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,725.605,736.079,"But he would have acted with due diligence and he would have had as... I suppose, a very powerful argument, which... which the Government apparently would accept, for... for tolling."
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,736.079,737.653,For equitable tolling?
2004.03-9685,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,741.183,748.394,"Well, as I understood Justice Souter's question, it is the alternate that the Government said."
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,807.05,817.093,"Well, AEDPA was enacted after Custis was decided and I think we presume that the Congress was aware of the precedent, but the--"
2004.03-9685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,817.093,826.954,"Now, wasn't... didn't Mr. Johnson here wait a couple of years after the Federal sentencing before he tried to go back to the State courts?"
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,826.954,827.952,"--Yes, he did."
2004.03-9685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,831.238,834.315,I'm not sure that was a diligent sort of a... an effort.
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,834.315,840.208,"--We believe it was diligent within the... the fourth trigger because, again, we rely on the plain language."
2004.03-9685,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,915.228,927.521,"But then you... you have to concede that you are watering down almost to nothing any due diligence requirement because on your reading of the statute, there isn't... there isn't any such requirement."
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,927.521,940.812,"--Well, we think that that is... I'll... I'll say that there's no... we don't believe that there is a requirement in the Federal statute, in agreement with... with your statement, to exercise diligence and seeking the vacatur."
2004.03-9685,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1010.785,1040.135,"Do you make the argument or is it implicit in your argument... maybe you don't have this concern... that if you imply a Federal due diligence standard on your duty to vacate the State conviction, that it's just too burdensome on the petitioner who has to begin fighting the vacatur battle at the same time that he has only 1 year to complete his habeas with reference to the other challenges to his conviction?"
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,1040.135,1044.049,That is not something that we've argued in the briefs.
2004.03-9685,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1047.873,1050.908,May I ask?
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,1062.247,1068.972,Limitations period by statute or they have a laches principle that would limit the ability.
2004.03-9685,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1068.972,1077.409,So that the... the hypothetical of the prisoner waiting 10 years to challenge the State conviction can only arise in a few States.
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,1078.225,1089.943,"That's right, and from what I can tell from the Department of Justice statistics, there are even fewer number of convictions in those States, and best I can back-of-the-envelope it, we're talking about maybe I think less than 10 people per year."
2004.03-9685,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1089.943,1094.103,In those... in those six States or those few States--
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,1094.103,1094.653,Yes.
2004.03-9685,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1094.653,1104.205,"--have those States all made clear they'd say we will never apply laches, or is it just the case that there have never... there's never been an instance where the laches issue was presented to them?"
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,1104.205,1106.354,The latter is more accurate.
2004.03-9685,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1154.957,1156.045,I know... I know--
2004.03-9685,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1156.045,1158.365,But do you have any explanation of why your client waited so long?
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,1158.365,1162.461,The record doesn't reveal except that he is pro se.
2004.03-9685,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1162.461,1162.909,Pro se.
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,1162.909,1163.704,Yes.
2004.03-9685,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1163.704,1166.547,--Even... that was the question I was going to ask.
2004.03-9685,0,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,1203.32,1212.403,"There's... I'm aware of the facts, but there's none in the record other than the fact that he's pro se and has limited education."
2004.03-9685,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1327.246,1327.918,You may.
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1332.655,1337.759,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-9685,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1434.528,1436.165,"Well, are you saying that (4) is inapplicable?"
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1436.165,1438.512,"No, Justice Kennedy."
2004.03-9685,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1502.4,1509.211,But do you agree with your opponent that most States have their own limitations period that will reduce the number of cases in which there can be inordinate delay?
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1509.211,1512.23,Some States do have statutes of limitations.
2004.03-9685,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1536.272,1538.811,But he says some of them have doctrines of laches that would kick in.
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1538.811,1545.728,"I think that's... that... that may well be true, Justice Stevens, but laches is a much more... a... a case-by-case--"
2004.03-9685,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1545.728,1559.2,"It... it does seem to me that the State has a greater interest than the Federal Government does in the finality of its own convictions, and so the State would be the primary guardian of preventing dilatory tactics, it would seem to me."
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1559.2,1561.056,--The... the State does have an interest.
2004.03-9685,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1591.734,1592.476,"Well, as to your first--"
2004.03-9685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1592.476,1592.828,I was going to say that.
2004.03-9685,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1594.535,1598.439,"--as to your first... as to your first instance, if there's lack of diligence, then there's laches."
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1604.647,1613.596,"--The... the important point, Justice Kennedy, is the limitation provision at issue here has to do with the finality of Federal convictions."
2004.03-9685,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1617.532,1626.909,"Well, we're... yes, I... I recognize that that's going to be the ultimate issue, but your point was, oh, well, the State is powerless because the prosecutor might not have the records."
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1633.944,1644.621,"--Justice Kennedy, we're not saying that States are powerless, and there are many cases, probably the majority of them, where States do diligently defend their own convictions in cases of this type."
2004.03-9685,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1654.605,1656.84,Mr. Himmelfarb--
2004.03-9685,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1656.84,1665.437,"Well, in this case now, the petitioner did obtain a vacatur of the two State convictions."
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1671.213,1672.088,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
2004.03-9685,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1682.222,1683.448,But he did succeed.
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1699.731,1712.104,"Well, in a case of this type, you would have to look to both subpart (1) and subpart (4) and determine which one gives him more time, and whichever one gives him more time is the one that applies."
2004.03-9685,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1719.528,1731.806,"Well, that's possible, but you also question whether the vacatur can be a fact under subsection (4)."
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1731.806,1734.169,"We don't really, Justice O'Connor."
2004.03-9685,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1734.169,1734.281,Okay.
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1734.281,1739.47,I think the lower court placed some weight on that idea.
2004.03-9685,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1743.604,1743.823,Okay.
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1755.935,1756.549,That's exactly right.
2004.03-9685,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1765.147,1768.817,And you say he was not diligent in challenging those convictions.
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1768.817,1770.955,"That's... that's absolutely our position, Justice O'Connor."
2004.03-9685,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1770.955,1771.531,--Mr.--
2004.03-9685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1771.531,1772.667,But that's... go on.
2004.03-9685,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1772.667,1785.579,"--Would... would you comment on... on one difficulty I have with what, I take it, is your preferred position of measuring due diligence from... as I understand it, from the... the date at which the State conviction became final?"
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1850.39,1851.398,No.
2004.03-9685,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1871.158,1871.547,Yes.
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1871.547,1879.739,"--perhaps the time that Federal charges are brought because at that time, that's when the defendant has the incentive to... to challenge the State conviction."
2004.03-9685,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1894.465,1901.937,"Well, would you comment specifically on your preferred position which starts at the very... as I understand it, starts at the earliest date, which would be the date of the State conviction?"
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1901.937,1902.625,--That's right.
2004.03-9685,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1926.433,1933.569,"Yes, but isn't it... I guess my problem is isn't... isn't it a sense... isn't your argument for a sense of diligence which is really other-wordly?"
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1966.823,1975.783,"Well, Justice Souter, the... we think that there's a... a textual problem with the interpretation you're offering because it doesn't tie diligence to facts supporting a claim."
2004.03-9685,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1975.783,1975.917,"Well, how about the one you're offering?"
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1983.522,1992.925,"Because it avoids the problem that you could have a Federal conviction long after, years or a decade or a more after, the State conviction."
2004.03-9685,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2001.661,2001.923,That's... that's right.
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2031.485,2039.245,"--Justice Souter, an argument along those lines was actually raised in Daniels itself and rejected by the Court."
2004.03-9685,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2069.918,2071.592,So you say we're all stuck with that.
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2071.592,2074.216,--I think that--
2004.03-9685,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2074.216,2080.472,"You don't mind, but... if... if you think... if you think there's anything to my objection, you're in effect saying, too late."
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2080.472,2088.744,--I think that the arguments against your objection weigh in favor of our interpretation.
2004.03-9685,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2088.744,2099.998,"Well, I'm not sure I agree with your argument, but I suppose one answer to Justice Souter is that you get the longer of (1) or (4), so that you would always get at least 1 year."
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2110.436,2111.385,"That's right, Justice Kennedy."
2004.03-9685,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2111.385,2112.34,It is right?
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2141.982,2142.478,That's right.
2004.03-9685,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2142.66,2145.849,"So, therefore, it is not true that he always has that year."
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2145.849,2146.846,--No.
2004.03-9685,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2151.422,2151.774,Yes.
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2151.774,2156.724,But the... the limitation period under AEDPA runs from the latest of the four dates--
2004.03-9685,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2156.724,2164.425,"But if the date of judgment became final prior to the running of (4), then he would not have a year."
2004.03-9685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2164.425,2166.046,That's true.
2004.03-9685,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2166.046,2166.574,All right.
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2246.094,2248.921,"--Let me comment on the language, if I could."
2004.03-9685,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2287.162,2293.535,But I... I thought that you conceded at the outset that the facts supporting the claim is the vacatur.
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2297.396,2298.538,"--No, Justice Kennedy."
2004.03-9685,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2314.746,2319.946,"--Well, the minute... the minute that you... you say that, it... it seems to me that you have to accept the petitioner's argument."
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2319.946,2322.362,"--I don't think so, Justice Kennedy, and here's why."
2004.03-9685,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2366.0,2370.699,I'm certainly not taking... advocating the... the defendant's position.
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2439.04,2450.507,"Justice Breyer, under our view, the hypothetical you just gave would be one where a timely 2255 motion could be filed."
2004.03-9685,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2492.741,2501.504,"From your answer, I take it then you would agree with Judge Black in the Eleventh Circuit that equitable tolling would apply."
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2517.787,2519.617,"That's right, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.03-9685,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2547.228,2549.569,May... may I ask you sort of a general background question?
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2570.471,2583.58,"Well, under... under the guidelines, depending upon the... the length of the prison term, I think very old convictions are not counted at all."
2004.03-9685,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2583.58,2584.476,Is that right?
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2584.476,2584.956,Yes.
2004.03-9685,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2594.375,2594.78,Whether he gets the--
2004.03-9685,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2594.78,2597.751,Is that also true under the Armed Career Criminal Act cases?
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2597.751,2599.671,"--I... I don't believe it is, Justice Souter."
2004.03-9685,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2605.394,2608.194,I'm not sure which way that cuts.
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2617.388,2639.191,"--Well, that... I think that's actually a critical point, Justice Kennedy, because our view is that a... a State defendant should be required to challenge his State conviction at the earliest possible opportunity, and in most cases that will be soon after his conviction in State court because that will be the time when he knows about the basis for his State claim."
2004.03-9685,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2659.389,2669.821,"But you're not... you're not insisting on that super diligence because you say, well, in every case he has at least a year to begin to try to undo the State conviction."
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2669.821,2672.253,"That... that's right, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.03-9685,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2729.085,2731.101,Recently I... I lost my luggage.
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2758.269,2760.296,"Well, our--"
2004.03-9685,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2760.296,2766.467,"--position, but it just seems to me that the purpose of this doesn't begin to run until he's been sentenced."
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2777.032,2803.635,"--Well, the... the important point is that... we think is that petitioner's interpretation doesn't work because it gives a defendant an indefinite period to challenge his State conviction, and the only diligence that's required under his interpretation is that you have to exercise diligence in seeing whether the motion to vacate your State conviction was granted whenever it was filed."
2004.03-9685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2803.635,2808.813,"Well, that may be but that also may be what it says."
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2826.829,2827.256,Well--
2004.03-9685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2827.256,2845.48,"And... and as for due diligence, yes, it doesn't seem to make much sense in that context, but as pointed out by your friend on the other side, it makes sense in all other contexts and... and you don't expect the language to be applicable all the time."
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2846.488,2858.558,"--What's wrong with it is that we think it's not only inconsistent with the basic principle embodied in AEDPA's statute of limitations, we think it's inconsistent with the very idea of a statute of limitations."
2004.03-9685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2858.558,2859.848,"It may well be, but that's how they wrote it."
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2861.731,2862.638,Justice--
2004.03-9685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2862.638,2874.835,How can this be a fact supporting the... you... you want us to say a fact supporting the conviction includes the facts that lead up to the facts supporting the conviction or... or supporting the claim.
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2874.835,2898.766,"--Justice Scalia, if the Court rejects our view that the facts supporting the claim under paragraph 6(4) as the factual basis for the State claim, we think it should still reject petitioner's interpretation and should adopt our alternative interpretation which is not subject to that objection because our alternative interpretation assumes that the facts supporting the claim is the vacatur of the State conviction."
2004.03-9685,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2912.835,2918.367,"In other words, you're saying due diligence applies to an extraneous fact when you could, in the simple sense, discover it."
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2922.393,2924.495,"That's absolutely our position, Justice Souter."
2004.03-9685,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2924.495,2926.521,--May I ask sort of a broad question?
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2947.204,2957.524,"As to your first question, Justice Stevens, one... one would think that this is a little bit of an unusual situation and you don't see too many cases where it arises."
2004.03-9685,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2987.716,2990.276,And certainly they would have phrased the statute one way or the other more clearly.
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2991.226,3002.292,"--That could well be, but of course, it wouldn't be the... the first time the Court confronted a situation where there's a statutory text and there's a set of facts that Congress didn't necessarily consider when it was writing the text."
2004.03-9685,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3034.634,3038.698,You certainly... wouldn't you be making the opposite argument if it were a DNA test?
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3058.047,3066.943,"--Well, Justice Breyer, the question of whether a fact supporting a claim could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence is a very fact-specific question which--"
2004.03-9685,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3066.943,3067.333,All right.
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3076.362,3077.071,--No.
2004.03-9685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3102.485,3117.861,"But you're still asking us... I mean, even... even in your fall-back position... your... your principal position asks us to... to play games with the... with the word facts, and your fall-back position asks us to play games with the word discovered."
2004.03-9685,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3126.255,3128.277,"Well, you're right, Justice Scalia."
2004.03-9685,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3134.09,3136.719,"Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb."
2004.03-9685,2,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,3143.573,3145.519,I hope not.
2004.03-9685,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3264.005,3284.613,"Why would you need the placeholder if the rule were, as Judge Black said it should be, that if you go to the State court within the 1 year after your Federal conviction becomes final, then the time that you are in the State court the statute will be tolled?"
2004.03-9685,2,19866,courtland_l_reichman,,3289.035,3291.307,--Two responses to that.
2004.03-9685,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3363.879,3365.292,"Thank you, Mr. Reichman."
