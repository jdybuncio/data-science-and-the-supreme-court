1957.89,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,11.539,"Number 89, Knut Einar Heikkinen versus United States of America."
1957.89,0,21463,david_rein,,31.867,47.106,"Court please, petitioner here was convicted on both counts of the two-count indictment charging a violation of Section 23 of the Internal Security Act of 1950."
1957.89,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,289.106,299.845,"Mr. Rein, was there any such language in that form, that original form that you mentioned a few moments ago, was a clause like that given?"
1957.89,0,21463,david_rein,,299.845,306.364,"No, the original form merely contained, it was not a form letter sent to -- it was a blank --"
1957.89,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,306.364,306.7,A blank?
1957.89,0,21463,david_rein,,306.7,330.353,"-- in which the petitioner -- all the information on the form was filled out by the petitioner, in which he gave his name, his birthplace, his residence, where he might have been a citizen and the purpose of that, sole purpose of that form was so that the service should have the necessary data to procure travel documents for him to be deported."
1957.89,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,358.168,360.83,Well does the service take a labeling or –
1957.89,0,21463,david_rein,,360.83,368.381,"Well it normally does so far as it is in this record as a matter of fact, within the service that is usual practice to take the labeling."
1957.89,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,396.411,405.68,"Well, if it is the service's labeling or is that the consequence of any statute or just something the service does?"
1957.89,0,21463,david_rein,,405.68,419.657,"Just something that seems to be their normal practice, I can say that under the statute they are required to do it or they have the legal obligation, it just seems to be their normal procedure, procedure which -- that people get deported."
1957.89,1,28966,j_f_bishop,,3675.137,3680.567,I would like to say one word about Monongahela before I go into the argument.
1957.89,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3696.191,3698.595,At what day -- the case is no longer respected.
1957.89,1,28966,j_f_bishop,,3698.595,3725.834,"That is not what I am getting at, what I am saying is that there were recent cases that followed the same line, we cited the most recent ones, the ones that had been cited by for comparison by Mr. Justice Douglas in the case of Spector and of course that doesn't absolve us, but we are always confronted with a problem of making a brief of unwieldy length and I apologize for not having thrown that in."
1957.89,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3725.834,3747.274,"This is how – I'm a believer of venial offense but the Monongahela case is case especially important because there the Court was asked in one of the most powerful briefs, in my recollection, in one of the most powerful arguments to reconsider a decision that it had taken several years before."
1957.89,1,28966,j_f_bishop,,3747.274,3747.794,I think a very --
1957.89,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3747.794,3755.974,Exhibit some of the considerations with which as I have indicated I sympathize or urge there and reject it.
1957.89,1,28966,j_f_bishop,,3759.982,3773.555,I think it's of great help to the government and I also -- we have not cited Wadley Southern Railways versus Georgia 235 US 561 and -- which we think is very significant.
1957.89,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3778.108,3794.612,"I have looked at your brief except the index to find out whether you cited, does the government set forth --because when it comes to the responsibility of actually declaring something unconstitutional, I for one like to get an implication, the implication of such definition."
1957.89,1,28966,j_f_bishop,,3803.799,3804.577,We have indicated --
1957.89,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3804.577,3805.881,I shall think there must be.
1957.89,1,28966,j_f_bishop,,3805.881,3807.112,We have given examples --
1957.89,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3807.112,3815.758,Numerous statutes in which an administrative determination has made the basis of an indictment for disobedience.
1957.89,1,28966,j_f_bishop,,3815.758,3817.922,We have cited those in the footnote to our brief.
1957.89,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3835.615,3856.707,"I mean merely volume of -- the number of persons affected, but the body of legislation if there be a body that presents this very serious problem namely to what extent can you administratively predetermine an element of the criminal case?"
1957.89,1,28966,j_f_bishop,,3856.707,3880.674,"We, as I said we have cited some examples of that in the Federal Communications Commission, Civil Aeronautics Board, we also cited even a further field without belaboring the point we cited Maki in the bankruptcy field in which there is very pertinent language by Mr. Justice Frankfurter I believe of the dangers of retrying every administrative determination by the --."
1957.89,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3880.674,3883.897,(Inaudible) controlling would mean than anybody else in this case?
1957.89,1,28966,j_f_bishop,,3883.897,3899.891,"No, I am stating that the examples that we did give and that is not only the administrative area, it is a terrific field and we thought that the thing had been very well decided more recently -- very well."
1957.89,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4426.146,4429.056,"Well what is the practice, is there any --?"
1957.89,1,28966,j_f_bishop,,4429.056,4431.734,The ordinary practice as of this date --
1957.89,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4431.734,4440.768,"May I ask further before you get to that, I gather that this obligation part is only those who are deported for certain reasons, isn't it?"
1957.89,1,28966,j_f_bishop,,4440.768,4442.966,That is correct and that is not challenged here.
1957.89,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4458.852,4461.361,Well assuming he was for the purpose of my --
1957.89,1,28966,j_f_bishop,,4461.361,4465.154,Let us assume that for this and our brief is very clear on that point.
1957.89,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4465.154,4472.836,"Well for the purpose of my question, just what is that the service does in these case, where there is an obligation?"
1957.89,1,28966,j_f_bishop,,4472.836,4480.967,"I will answer that in two ways, one on what was before the jury, in the record and then I will go further than that, if the Court wishes."
