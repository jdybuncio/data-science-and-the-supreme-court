1988.87-2013,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.356,"We'll hear argument now, No. 87-2013, Board of Trustees of the State University of New York v. Todd Fox."
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,13.058,15.891,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-2013,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,119.493,128.183,Would your position proscribe an attorney visiting a student in his dormitory room?
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,128.183,135.17,"If an attorney wished to visit, where he's not yet been retained--"
1988.87-2013,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,135.17,139.122,"No, he's been retained, and it would be... his time would be charged."
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,139.122,157.334,"--There is testimony in the record from, I believe Norman Hofstaeder, in which he says no, that that would not be permitted, believing that there would be more appropriate places for those kinds of communications."
1988.87-2013,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,157.334,162.535,"What about a physician attending a sick student in his dormitory room, for pay?"
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,162.535,167.522,"I think under those... there's no testimony in the record, with respect to that example."
1988.87-2013,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,167.522,169.641,"Well, what does your regulation say?"
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,169.641,172.176,The regulation doesn't speak to it directly.
1988.87-2013,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,195.107,197.959,"Well, what about the lawyer?"
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,197.959,201.612,I'm simply referring to the testimony that was given.
1988.87-2013,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,203.912,204.897,What about a tutor?
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,204.897,208.432,"What about... that question was asked, too."
1988.87-2013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,250.093,251.209,"Well, we may have an overbreadth problem."
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,251.209,251.661,--Excuse me?
1988.87-2013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,251.661,257.949,"We may have an overbreadth problem, of course, and it depends on the meaning of the regulation, and how are we to know what it means?"
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,270.873,274.741,"Well, I believe overbroad... overbreadth is not here, Justice O'Connor."
1988.87-2013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,284.681,288.585,"Well, it can certainly be offered in defense of the judgment below, can't it?"
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,288.585,294.452,"I believe that you have to have preserved that claim, beyond that."
1988.87-2013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,294.452,296.104,I didn't understand that.
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,299.44,305.344,"The cases that we've cited in our applied brief, I, I admit, are Circuit Court cases."
1988.87-2013,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,310.414,312.616,This is commercial speech... this is commercial speech.
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,315.152,316.285,I agree.
1988.87-2013,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,320.12,321.056,And one of them is that?
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,321.056,324.341,The first had to do with non-preservation.
1988.87-2013,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,441.099,447.287,But the case or controversy... the issue here is product demonstrations?
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,447.287,448.655,That's absolutely correct.
1988.87-2013,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,448.655,450.422,That's the application we're talking about?
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,450.422,450.941,Absolutely.
1988.87-2013,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,453.791,456.308,"Mr. Sherwood, can I ask you a question about the procedure in the case?"
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,465.331,465.783,No.
1988.87-2013,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,471.77,472.104,Yes.
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,472.104,472.637,That... no.
1988.87-2013,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,493.966,495.817,What did you lose in the district court?
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,495.817,518.916,"After the Second Circuit decided the case, the district court then applied the commercial speech standard, as it was defined by the Second Circuit, the Second Circuit having said that, with respect to the fourth prong of the Central Hudson test, that that involved a, a least restrictive means test."
1988.87-2013,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,531.307,541.197,"May I ask you, if in your view, the record that we're permitted to look at in deciding this case, includes what happened on remand, as well as what was before the Second Circuit?"
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,541.197,542.464,I believe you could.
1988.87-2013,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,542.464,548.851,"When we're reviewing the Second Circuit decision, we can rely on matter that that court had never even seen at the time of its decision?"
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,548.851,561.159,"Well, the only thing that exists beyond, in the district court, at this point, beyond what the Second Circuit concerned was the decision."
1988.87-2013,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,561.159,562.675,Wasn't there another evidentiary hearing?
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,562.675,563.425,There was not a hearing.
1988.87-2013,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,563.425,563.777,Oh.
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,563.777,564.144,No.
1988.87-2013,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,576.518,578.453,But was there oral argument and briefing at that time or--
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,578.453,579.353,None of those.
1988.87-2013,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,579.353,581.672,"--You mean, you just got the remand?"
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,581.672,583.255,Got the remand and made a decision.
1988.87-2013,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,583.255,586.024,What happens if you win here?
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,588.142,591.944,"If we win here, we believe that the case is over."
1988.87-2013,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,594.796,597.848,"--Well, no, but, what happens to the judgment against you in the district court?"
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,598.798,611.674,"I would imagine that we would go back to the district court in that circumstance, and seek to have the judgment vacated, in view of the decision in this Court."
1988.87-2013,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,611.674,614.293,And if you lost?
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,614.293,620.297,We would then seek to appeal from the denial of our--
1988.87-2013,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,620.297,624.482,"But what if you lost on the ground that it had become final a long time ago, and it's too late to redo it?"
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,624.482,630.719,"--Well, the district court does have before it, a motion in our Part 4 stay, and we assume that you would--"
1988.87-2013,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,630.719,631.588,"Which, it just hasn't acted on?"
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,633.638,639.592,"--I assume that it is in effect, given that the Court has yet to act on our application for the stay."
1988.87-2013,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,639.592,640.611,I see.
1988.87-2013,0,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,643.011,644.229,I doubt it.
1988.87-2013,1,27879,henry_t_reath,,1715.054,1719.792,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court:"
1988.87-2013,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1783.782,1787.734,"But, Mr. Reath, did he ever... is there any testimony that he ever did invite an attorney to his dorm?"
1988.87-2013,1,27879,henry_t_reath,,1787.734,1791.119,"--No, sir, there was not, but again Your Honor--"
1988.87-2013,2,37571,o_peter_sherwood,,3502.738,3505.156,I just wanted to say one thing.
1988.87-2013,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3517.563,3519.647,Very well.
