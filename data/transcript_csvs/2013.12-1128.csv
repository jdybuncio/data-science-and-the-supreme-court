2013.12-1128,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.504,"We'll hear argument this afternoon in case 12-1128, Medtronic v. Boston Scientific Corporation."
2013.12-1128,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,9.606,12.891,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1128,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,67.692,70.81,"Now, this concerns just the risk of nonpersuasion."
2013.12-1128,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,73.929,74.396,That's correct.
2013.12-1128,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,103.715,109.685,"Well, if that's all that's involved, then the case doesn't seem to amount to quite as much as one might have thought otherwise, does it?"
2013.12-1128,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,127.397,128.147,Right.
2013.12-1128,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,228.346,235.833,"It seems to me we could -- all that may be true, but we need to cut down to the basic issue, which is MedImmune changes all that."
2013.12-1128,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,246.808,261.4,"--Well, the -- the reason, Mr. Chief Justice, is the reason that the burden of proof is substantive, and a declaratory judgment action under the Act is not -- is aimed not to change any substantive rights."
2013.12-1128,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,271.089,289.717,"Does it help your answer or -- or does it limit the theory of your case too much to say that in this case, there is a controversy satisfying the declaratory judgment rules because the patentholder gave notice of potential -- or of infringement?"
2013.12-1128,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,290.683,294.787,"You're right about that, and that would be true, Justice Kennedy, on all MedImmune cases."
2013.12-1128,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,294.787,307.779,"Now, could we -- or should we make the case turn on that or can we say, with declaratory judgment, there has to be a dispute, we -- we know that a dispute is likely, a controversy, so the formality of a notice is not important."
2013.12-1128,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,307.779,310.897,"Well, I don't know that it's a formality of a notice."
2013.12-1128,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,324.39,326.09,"Well, it goes to me to -- a basic question of fairness."
2013.12-1128,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,342.268,351.624,"I think the notice is the -- well, it's essential to the Article III MedImmune question whether or not there actually is a case or controversy."
2013.12-1128,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,436.897,451.906,"Mr. Waxman, what do you make of the patent listing non-infringement as an affirmative defense in an infringement suit?"
2013.12-1128,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,451.906,476.605,"We agree with the articulation of the point by the Solicitor General in the United States brief, which is that the cases have recognized that non-infringement can either be a general defense -- that is, when -- when non-infringement is simply a general denial of a cause of -- of a claim of infringement, it is not an affirmative defense."
2013.12-1128,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,545.785,557.859,"What you -- what you just responded, that would go as well for an alleged infringer who is not a licensee, right?"
2013.12-1128,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,557.859,560.728,Yes.
2013.12-1128,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,563.747,570.916,This here -- this case is about the difference between the licensee and the non-licensee.
2013.12-1128,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,570.916,571.602,--Right.
2013.12-1128,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,638.061,652.82,"Mr. Waxman, as I understand it the agreement in this case identified certain patents and contemplated that there would be disputes about whether particular products of Medtronic violated or infringed or practiced, whatever, those patents."
2013.12-1128,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,658.874,659.574,Mm-hmm.
2013.12-1128,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,659.574,663.795,--and essentially treat those as infringing products in the absence of a license.
2013.12-1128,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,689.411,694.147,"So if I understand your question, first to -- to go to the license in this case."
2013.12-1128,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,998.494,999.161,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-1128,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1007.916,1010.634,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1128,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1058.032,1064.888,Are -- are you suggesting that the burden-shifting rule should be different in the hypothetical Justice Kagan--
2013.12-1128,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1064.888,1067.657,"I was not about to suggest that, Justice Sotomayor."
2013.12-1128,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1199.042,1206.647,"Well -- well, but I guess the argument is that it's the mirror image of an action that could not have been brought because Medtronic is paying royalties."
2013.12-1128,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1206.647,1238.869,"Well, the same thing is true in MedImmune, and I think that the Court noted that the -- in MedImmune that the Declaratory Judgment Act was intended to help get the party out of the dilemma it would be in, in deciding whether it should continue to be effectively coerced into paying royalties that it thinks it doesn't need to pay or exposing itself to the risks associated with -- with breaching the license and -- and being subject to treble damages, attorneys' fees and the other remedies that would be available under the Patent Act."
2013.12-1128,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1291.234,1304.477,"I take it you disagree with the -- we have one friend of the Court brief that says this is not a case arising under the patent law, it arises under contract law."
2013.12-1128,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1307.013,1309.898,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, we do disagree with that."
2013.12-1128,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1490.882,1491.748,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,1497.286,1499.304,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2013.12-1128,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1601.539,1605.074,But -- but you could say that about any declaratory judgment action.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,1628.189,1629.856,--I'll tell you what's different here.
2013.12-1128,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1644.349,1646.318,How about a permissive counterclaim?
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,1646.318,1647.118,Pardon me?
2013.12-1128,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1647.118,1650.27,How about a permissive counterclaim?
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,1650.27,1656.09,A permissive counterclaim by definition would have nothing to do with the issue that is involved.
2013.12-1128,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1656.09,1666.398,But could -- could the patentholder bring in the declaratory action a counterclaim for infringement?
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,1666.398,1670.783,"No, they cannot because Medtronic is a licensee."
2013.12-1128,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1674.352,1675.837,"Well, they can be an infringer, Mr. Neustadt, if--"
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,1675.837,1676.52,--Pardon me?
2013.12-1128,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1676.52,1685.943,"--They can be an infringer if they say we're ignoring our agreement; we're not paying royalties, but we're going to go on and continue making the product."
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,1694.715,1695.631,No.
2013.12-1128,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1697.533,1698.183,"No, I'm finished."
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,1698.183,1698.869,"No, I'm sorry."
2013.12-1128,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1714.379,1715.879,I'm not sure how you're receiving royalties.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,1718.664,1721.949,--Medtronic is holding the money.
2013.12-1128,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1721.949,1724.818,"Yes, but it's in an escrow account."
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,1725.937,1729.472,"Well, we do not have access to the money that they're holding, correct."
2013.12-1128,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1729.472,1730.089,Right.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,1734.04,1735.808,"Well, there can't be--"
2013.12-1128,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1735.808,1737.075,Because you're not receiving the money.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,1737.075,1740.612,--Because we agreed to that in the agreement.
2013.12-1128,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1742.046,1744.064,"Yes, but you're still not receiving the money."
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,1744.064,1747.016,But we don't -- we agreed to not receiving the money.
2013.12-1128,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1754.837,1756.139,And you agreed they could sue you.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,1756.139,1756.756,Pardon me?
2013.12-1128,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1756.756,1763.293,"You agreed they could sue you under a Declaratory Judgment Act to find out whether or not they're infringing, correct?"
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,1763.293,1763.66,That's right.
2013.12-1128,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1763.66,1764.495,All right.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,1766.412,1768.03,I'm sorry?
2013.12-1128,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1768.03,1770.299,--Why shouldn't you be bound by that agreement.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,1770.299,1772.016,"Oh, we are bound by the agreement that--"
2013.12-1128,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1772.016,1772.917,To prove that they're infringing.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,1772.917,1774.717,"--No, they're not infringing."
2013.12-1128,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1804.52,1806.139,I don't -- I don't understand.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,1820.664,1822.781,"--Well, they just--"
2013.12-1128,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1822.781,1823.266,Or am I missing something?
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,1823.266,1824.533,"--Yes, I believe you are."
2013.12-1128,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1870.414,1881.437,It seems to me it is often the case in declaratory judgment actions that the defendant in the action cannot counterclaim.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,1914.943,1922.097,"Because under the normal default rule, if only one party is seeking relief, that party has the burden of proof."
2013.12-1128,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1924.882,1926.918,But we are not dealing with the normal default rule.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,1942.86,1955.687,"--The -- if you take the normal default rule as set forth in Schaffer, which is the case we cite, and it's this Court's precedent involving an individual education program."
2013.12-1128,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1978.616,1983.587,But that was not -- Weast was not -- was not a patent infringement case.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,1989.324,1997.264,"It wasn't, but that doesn't make any difference, because there's no exception for declaratory judgment cases in the normal default rule."
2013.12-1128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1997.73,1998.48,"Well, why shouldn't there be?"
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,1998.48,1999.447,--I'm sorry?
2013.12-1128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1999.447,2000.382,"I mean, why shouldn't there be?"
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2008.653,2009.672,Claim coverage.
2013.12-1128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2009.672,2010.288,Claim coverage.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2019.927,2020.795,Correct.
2013.12-1128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2020.795,2022.712,"Now, you want to call that a claim coverage."
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2036.655,2037.672,That's correct.
2013.12-1128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2037.672,2038.674,"Yes, I know."
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2040.141,2041.074,Yes.
2013.12-1128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2041.074,2055.184,"But nonetheless the fact is in many claims -- in many instances, though perhaps not yours, this kind of claim, i.e. that person's patent does not cover my product--"
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2055.184,2056.219,Yes.
2013.12-1128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2056.219,2062.622,"--is actually a way of saying whether your product infringes the patent, one way of saying that."
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2130.934,2142.341,"Well, the answer to your question is that the normal default rule is a fundamental tenet, that you can't go into court and say it's the responsibility of the defendant to disprove the allegations of my complaint."
2013.12-1128,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2170.059,2173.778,Then the Declaratory Judgment Act doesn't change it; that's your position?
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2199.495,2200.061,--Right.
2013.12-1128,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2200.061,2210.569,"Is -- is the prior decision res judicata or are you going to have to relitigate the whole thing, but this time with the burden of proof on you?"
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2210.569,2212.921,"No, you're not going to have to litigate the whole thing."
2013.12-1128,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2212.921,2213.455,Why not?
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2219.409,2220.225,I agree.
2013.12-1128,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2235.068,2241.322,"No, you -- you would normally have the burden as -- as the person claiming infringement."
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2241.322,2242.44,"--Oh, of course."
2013.12-1128,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2242.44,2243.107,Of course.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2243.107,2243.774,Of course.
2013.12-1128,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2243.774,2244.39,Right?
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2256.765,2258.15,Yeah.
2013.12-1128,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2259.736,2262.436,So we have to relitigate the whole thing.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2262.436,2262.853,No.
2013.12-1128,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2264.353,2265.003,What's the alternative?
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2265.003,2265.47,--Okay.
2013.12-1128,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2278.38,2279.847,"It's my hypothetical, okay?"
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2279.847,2280.565,--Okay.
2013.12-1128,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2326.028,2332.582,"So your answer is, Justice Scalia, you're right, but it doesn't matter very much."
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2333.784,2335.917,--And I've got one further answer to that.
2013.12-1128,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2335.917,2336.4,Okay.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2336.4,2344.805,"And that is, there is no exception to -- to 100 percent lack of finality with respect to the normal default rule."
2013.12-1128,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2389.62,2391.303,Why -- why isn't that true here?
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2396.774,2399.892,We're not seeking it in the suit.
2013.12-1128,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2444.605,2457.515,"Well, there would have been infringement if you had refused to pay the royalty, and -- and if they had refused to pay the royalty and you were covered, then -- then there would have been infringement."
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2457.515,2459.015,But then you're changing all the facts around.
2013.12-1128,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2461.633,2462.45,All right.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2462.867,2464.084,And in MedImmune--
2013.12-1128,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2464.084,2466.62,"Well, Mr. Neustadt, I think I just disagree with that."
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2501.508,2502.71,--No.
2013.12-1128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2569.586,2585.364,"Well, how -- what do you do with the government's argument here, which I take it as being on page 17, they make an argument which, as I understood it -- which is a big qualification -- the -- the -- some of these things are awfully complicated."
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2668.267,2669.218,I think it's pretty close.
2013.12-1128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2669.218,2669.718,--All right.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2669.718,2670.553,It's absolutely not true.
2013.12-1128,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2689.265,2691.717,It's -- it's not a patent law exception.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2704.358,2708.227,But you only have that substantive rule where the patentee counterclaims.
2013.12-1128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2731.692,2732.877,But do they have to tell them?
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2732.877,2734.56,"--Well, they always do."
2013.12-1128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2736.729,2738.698,They always do?
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2738.698,2739.681,"--Well, sure."
2013.12-1128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2771.835,2773.371,So that's a good point.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2781.025,2782.158,"Oh, that's right."
2013.12-1128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2782.158,2784.943,"Because the first question would be, well, you tell me how -- how this infringes."
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2784.943,2785.429,Yeah.
2013.12-1128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2792.498,2810.544,"So you're saying I don't really care about what is an action where there is an infringement action or there even could be one in the circumstances before us, that's not my case because they're going to pay me forever if they lose this declaratory judgment, so there's no shift."
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2817.65,2818.466,That's exactly right.
2013.12-1128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2818.466,2819.0,That's your argument.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2819.0,2819.533,Yes.
2013.12-1128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2822.785,2823.554,I -- I see.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2823.554,2824.67,Let me find the controlling law.
2013.12-1128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2833.675,2844.3,"And your argument is that the horribles don't exist because the one on page 19 never has come up, and as far as the no -- no res judicata, I don't care because I'll come to the same result with a different means."
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2844.3,2844.7,Yeah.
2013.12-1128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2846.883,2851.121,And any other -- is there any other -- is there any other practical point that they brought up that you want respond to?
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2851.121,2851.854,"--Oh, sure."
2013.12-1128,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2893.114,2903.689,"Yes, but you are overlooking the elephant in the room, which is the relief they are seeking is protection against the relief that you would be seeking but for the declaratory judgment action."
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2903.689,2906.874,We can never seek it because they are not infringing.
2013.12-1128,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2923.567,2931.073,"The Declaratory Judgment Act is addressed to potential coercion, not actual coercion."
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2964.144,2966.246,"Well, it doesn't shift the burden of proof."
2013.12-1128,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2966.246,2981.506,"It does shift the burden of proof because if what they are worried about is your claiming infringement and exacting a penalty from them for their not paying the royalties that the agreement provides, okay?"
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2993.814,2999.217,"The -- in answer to your hypothetical, I agree with you on all of that."
2013.12-1128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3022.749,3023.849,But you would agree with this.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,3043.596,3044.012,"Well, of course."
2013.12-1128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3044.012,3055.137,"And if they said either an infringement suit or a declaratory judgment action, then again you would have the burden of proof, even in the declaratory judgment action because then they would be totally parallel."
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,3061.808,3065.41,"Well, the way it is, if you have one party seeking relief, the licensee--"
2013.12-1128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3065.41,3065.945,I mean--
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,3065.945,3067.145,--the licensee's got he burden.
2013.12-1128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3067.145,3067.812,--The answer is yes or no.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,3103.618,3104.653,"No, I'm afraid not."
2013.12-1128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3104.653,3105.17,Okay.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,3107.272,3114.359,So really what the Federal Circuit did said there was no shifting here.
2013.12-1128,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3146.997,3151.984,"So you are really looking at it, though, from the view of a contract action rather than a patent action."
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,3151.984,3156.336,"Well, it can't be a patent action because the whole purpose of the license is not to have an infringer."
2013.12-1128,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3184.439,3194.211,"Mr. Neustadt, I was under the impression that, according to this contract, if Medtronics stops paying royalties you can bring not only a contract suit, but in fact a patent suit."
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,3194.211,3195.746,Well--
2013.12-1128,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3195.746,3196.68,An infringement suit.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,3196.68,3199.798,"--that has nothing to do with the contract, because then they've breached the contract."
2013.12-1128,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3199.798,3204.602,But you can bring an infringement suit according to the very agreement that you signed.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,3204.602,3206.385,It's not in accordance with the agreement.
2013.12-1128,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3209.854,3213.791,They are infringing if they break the contract and they stop paying royalties.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,3213.791,3214.274,"Oh, sure."
2013.12-1128,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3214.274,3215.974,And then you can bring an infringement suit.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,3215.974,3216.493,"Well, of course."
2013.12-1128,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3226.882,3232.086,You can always say that in declaratory judgment actions: That is not the situation we face.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,3239.34,3241.875,You cannot say--
2013.12-1128,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3241.875,3244.56,I am worried that you are going to sue me later.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,3249.797,3254.618,--But how can I sue later if you're continuing to pay royalties?
2013.12-1128,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3259.153,3261.605,They don't want to -- they don't want to continue to pay royalties.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,3271.228,3272.413,"--Well, that's absolutely right."
2013.12-1128,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3281.685,3288.089,You cite -- you cite the default rule and you rely on that totally.
2013.12-1128,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,3323.762,3324.795,"--Oh, that's correct."
2013.12-1128,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3329.266,3330.449,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-1128,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3332.868,3339.189,I'd be happy to respond to any questions that the Court has.
2013.12-1128,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3341.824,3343.407,Okay.
