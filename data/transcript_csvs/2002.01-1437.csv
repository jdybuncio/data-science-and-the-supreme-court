2002.01-1437,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,10.031,"The Court will hear argument in Number 01-1437, Branch against Smith, and the cross-appeal of Smith against Branch."
2002.01-1437,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,12.593,14.944,"Justice Stevens, may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1437,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,82.354,89.413,"Now, did... did Mississippi appeal from the injunction?"
2002.01-1437,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,89.413,93.294,"They did not, Your Honor, but we did."
2002.01-1437,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,105.488,123.1,"But... but the issue is whether the State was still pursuing the... the redistricting that was the subject of the application to the Attorney General, and whether it was doing so or not depended upon whether the State was appealing from the Federal injunction."
2002.01-1437,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,128.423,132.138,"I don't... I don't know... I respectfully disagree, Justice Scalia."
2002.01-1437,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,143.533,147.331,"Well, and he also has no right to ignore a Federal injunction--"
2002.01-1437,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,147.331,148.485,That's correct.
2002.01-1437,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,148.485,150.054,--unless he... unless he appeals it.
2002.01-1437,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,154.512,161.282,"That's correct, but... but unlike the situation... but we... I guess my first answer is, we did appeal it, and so the injunction is--"
2002.01-1437,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,161.282,161.737,But you're not the State.
2002.01-1437,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,161.737,163.677,--is subject to being overruled.
2002.01-1437,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,163.677,165.619,The problem with that is that you're not the State.
2002.01-1437,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,165.619,166.483,That's correct.
2002.01-1437,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,207.516,214.219,Why does it make sense under a statute in which the action of the State is by... by definition crucial?
2002.01-1437,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,214.219,222.171,"--Because the action of the... the action of the State here is the action of the State courts, and they have issued an injunction."
2002.01-1437,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,224.113,237.609,"But if we're talking about section 5, the language of section 5 is whenever a State shall enact or seek to administer any voting qualification, et cetera."
2002.01-1437,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,258.043,266.095,I think... I think the executive is seeking to administer it just as much as he was back when the plan was first submitted.
2002.01-1437,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,278.355,291.645,But we would... we would not require the... the State or the... the Federal courts to do a vain... or the Attorney... the Federal Attorney General to perform a vain act.
2002.01-1437,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,311.792,321.739,"--To remove the section 5 obstacle as quickly as possible, consistent with the 60-day deadline in the statute, so that once the constitutional obstacle is removed, the plan can be in force."
2002.01-1437,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,321.739,329.003,But the constitutional obstacle won't be removed as long as the Attorney General doesn't... doesn't appeal the Federal court injunction.
2002.01-1437,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,329.003,336.6,"Well, that... that is assuming that... that my clients don't have standing, and I think we clearly do as parties who secured the State court judgment."
2002.01-1437,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,353.978,357.86,"Mr. McDuff, can I ask you what is the status of the State court litigation?"
2002.01-1437,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,359.225,365.662,There is an appeal pending filed by the State court intervenors challenging the chancery court's plan.
2002.01-1437,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,365.662,369.543,And how do you explain the failure of the Mississippi Supreme Court to rule on that appeal?
2002.01-1437,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,369.543,372.311,That... the briefs have been filed.
2002.01-1437,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,389.379,390.289,"Well, excuse me."
2002.01-1437,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,392.518,393.549,--I'm sorry?
2002.01-1437,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,393.549,397.265,Is our decision going to affect that Federal court order?
2002.01-1437,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,397.265,400.98,"Well, we... we are certainly asking this Court to... to vacate the Federal court order."
2002.01-1437,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,401.723,404.574,It's a... that's the problem I have trying to figure this out.
2002.01-1437,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,430.496,432.808,"--It says 60 days after it's submitted, it's--"
2002.01-1437,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,432.808,433.923,"--Yes, enacts or seeks to administer."
2002.01-1437,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,433.923,434.916,--That is correct.
2002.01-1437,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,434.916,438.481,"They have to enact, and this doesn't sound like an enactment."
2002.01-1437,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,492.712,496.344,I think... I think there are two things we want you to say.
2002.01-1437,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,529.577,530.32,"But Mr. McDuff, the--"
2002.01-1437,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,530.32,531.229,--will go forward in the Justice Department.
2002.01-1437,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,531.229,541.853,"--Mr. McDuff, on your first point, which you would like us to decide first, I thought the district court expressly made that a contingent ruling."
2002.01-1437,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,565.409,566.44,That's correct.
2002.01-1437,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,566.44,572.013,"But if we're reversed on that, then we have something else we want the court to know about."
2002.01-1437,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,583.53,587.867,"I don't know if it was a conditional ruling, Justice Ginsburg."
2002.01-1437,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,594.47,594.925,Why?
2002.01-1437,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1265.504,1267.899,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1437,2,36910,michael_b_wallace,,1905.959,1911.904,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1437,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1984.265,1993.182,"But, Mr. Wallace, don't you agree that with the injunction outstanding, the Justice Department would have the same reason for refusing to preclear that it's already given?"
2002.01-1437,2,36910,michael_b_wallace,,1993.182,2009.324,"I think not, Your Honor, and I think that's because of the very strange system of divided jurisdiction that Congress consciously created back in 1965 when it said, we will let the District of Columbia deal with statutory questions."
2002.01-1437,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2016.549,2029.758,"How long does it take if you take the... if you said derail the preclearance procedure before the Attorney General, switch to the D.C. District Court track?"
2002.01-1437,2,36910,michael_b_wallace,,2038.014,2040.243,"I've never been in one, Your Honor."
2002.01-1437,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2045.073,2053.907,"Well, then why can't we just do what we'd... I'd suggested anyway... I think others did too... that... that you... you... we'd simply say, look, here's an injunction."
2002.01-1437,2,36910,michael_b_wallace,,2101.461,2112.485,"--As a practical matter, Justice Breyer, that might get the process moving, because I think I've understood the United States to indicate that they would get moving if that's what the Court did."
2002.01-1437,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2131.516,2135.027,"Yes, but in affirming that, we certainly can say why we're affirming it."
2002.01-1437,2,36910,michael_b_wallace,,2147.658,2155.914,"--And if... and if the Court does say that, and if the Justice Department does get moving as a result of that opinion, then that will move the process along."
2002.01-1437,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2155.914,2162.602,"So we're in an unusual... I mean, this is unusual because I guess we would be reviewing a reason for the judgment."
2002.01-1437,2,36910,michael_b_wallace,,2203.469,2209.496,"I suspect the Mississippi Supreme Court can take a hint as well as the Justice Department, Justice Breyer."
2002.01-1437,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2258.536,2269.516,"But would you say it's absolutely correct if the constitutional reasoning were wrong, and if they say we won't approve a... a Mississippi plan that is in violation of our constitutional holding?"
2002.01-1437,2,36910,michael_b_wallace,,2269.516,2279.63,"The... as... as Justice Ginsburg has observed, I think that is an alternative ground in the opinion."
2002.01-1437,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2292.633,2300.063,Is it your view that the section 5 ground of decision is sufficient to... to uphold the... the injunction below?
2002.01-1437,2,36910,michael_b_wallace,,2300.063,2306.34,"We believe that it is sufficient to uphold the judgment below because there is no error in the judgment, and there is no error--"
2002.01-1437,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2306.34,2313.066,"But if... if that's true, did not the district court violate our rule against deciding constitutional issues unnecessarily?"
2002.01-1437,2,36910,michael_b_wallace,,2313.066,2318.146,"--I think they did not, although it's a close call."
2002.01-1437,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2319.055,2323.719,Why is it a close call if... if the judgment is clearly correct on the section 5 ground?
2002.01-1437,2,36910,michael_b_wallace,,2323.719,2328.26,--The... the district court--
2002.01-1437,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2328.26,2331.771,It seems to me it's only a close call if you think there's doubt about the section 5 ground.
2002.01-1437,2,36910,michael_b_wallace,,2331.771,2335.03,--And that's why the district court set the alternative judgments.
2002.01-1437,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2340.936,2348.245,"It doesn't... says you don't do it if it's not necessary, and it clearly was not necessary if they're right on the section 5 ground, which everybody seems to agree they were."
2002.01-1437,2,36910,michael_b_wallace,,2348.245,2351.793,"We certainly agree that they were, and if they're... and if--"
2002.01-1437,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2351.793,2353.113,The other side doesn't agree they were.
2002.01-1437,3,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,3302.687,3303.347,"Thank you, Your Honor."
