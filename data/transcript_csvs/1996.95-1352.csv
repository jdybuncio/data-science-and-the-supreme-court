1996.95-1352,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.077,"We'll hear argument next in No. 95-1352, Gary Edwards and Tana Wood v. Jerry Balisok."
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,18.333,24.436,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1352,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,52.697,55.819,"He has not finally waived it or surrendered it, though, has he?"
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,55.819,64.253,Mr. Balisok has specifically reserved his right to contest and litigate over the loss of good-time credits at a later time.
1996.95-1352,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,64.253,65.293,One minor point.
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,74.179,76.051,No.
1996.95-1352,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,77.692,81.605,"--He says that the conviction was overturned, although he's still in custody."
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,83.074,83.725,Yes.
1996.95-1352,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,95.503,97.654,"So, the good-time credits apply in case he's convicted again?"
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,98.415,101.588,"--Yes, they would still be applying to his total term of confinement."
1996.95-1352,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,102.349,107.32,This is a retrial on the same charge that was earlier overturned?
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,107.32,109.073,"I believe so, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-1352,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,109.073,109.712,Has he been retried?
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,109.712,112.333,"I believe so, yes."
1996.95-1352,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,112.333,118.527,"Well, then why... wouldn't the whole good-time calculus begin anew if he were convicted?"
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,118.527,125.333,"I think the good-time calculus would be made on his total time of confinement, if I understand the system right."
1996.95-1352,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,156.582,157.994,May I just add one point to it?
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,165.898,170.623,--I'm not sure precisely which doctrine you're referring to.
1996.95-1352,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,170.623,172.504,"Well, the same or other evidence."
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,173.135,174.415,The some evidence standard?
1996.95-1352,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,174.415,175.296,"--Some, yes."
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,175.296,190.566,"It is correct that if there was a lack of some evidence in the hearing, that our position would be that his good time could not stand, that the hearing should be reversed."
1996.95-1352,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,219.775,222.507,I'm not sure I totally understand your answer.
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,241.399,244.541,That he could win this particular suit--
1996.95-1352,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,244.541,246.973,And not get his good-time credits restored.
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,246.973,251.846,"--Our position is that that is not what would occur, that if he were to--"
1996.95-1352,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,251.846,255.007,"Well, is it possible or just unlikely in your view?"
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,266.204,277.591,"--We believe that the allegations that Mr. Balisok has made necessarily invalidate the sanction of his... imposed in his hearing, that they are so serious."
1996.95-1352,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,279.183,282.716,And they necessarily would require the restoration of his good-time credits?
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,282.716,284.347,"--Yes, under the Heck test."
1996.95-1352,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,284.347,289.799,"Then in order for you to prevail, you would not have to advocate the rule that you do advocate in your brief."
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,289.799,291.682,That is correct.
1996.95-1352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,291.682,292.233,I see.
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,306.572,317.168,"With respect to the claims that he is asserting in this complaint that they are serious enough that a harmless error doctrine would not be brought to bear on these claims, but I--"
1996.95-1352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,317.168,321.402,"Some due process claims would be subject to harmless error, but this would not."
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,321.402,323.843,--That is correct.
1996.95-1352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,324.364,329.176,What is peculiar about this that disentitles it to a harmless error analysis?
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,329.176,347.108,--The nature of the allegations made by Mr. Balisok are the arbitrary denial of witness statements that go to his fundamental ability to prove his innocence and put forth a case and prove his innocence before the disciplinary hearing.
1996.95-1352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,347.108,351.789,But what if those witness statements are brought in and it turns out they're really not very relevant at all?
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,353.722,354.842,No.
1996.95-1352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,362.148,363.978,Then there's nothing inevitable in this case.
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,363.978,378.748,"But just looking at the allegations of the complaint as stated, our position is that some due process violation, some allegations that alleged serious deviations from the rule of standards, will inevitably lead to the restoration of good time."
1996.95-1352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,378.748,378.969,"Yes, but you've just said... excuse me."
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,386.043,391.577,"We think this is one of those cases, but the State of Washington--"
1996.95-1352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,391.577,392.478,You know what the witnesses are going to say.
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,395.64,396.92,--No.
1996.95-1352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,403.975,420.108,"But doesn't... isn't it the case... and I don't want to go on too much longer with this, but isn't it the case that based on the allegations, you simply cannot tell in this case whether the... whether his success at this stage will inevitably result in an entitlement to reduced time."
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,421.006,425.2,"Well, we have not wanted to concede that point in this case because--"
1996.95-1352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,425.2,425.5,I realize.
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,425.5,426.759,--we think they are so serious.
1996.95-1352,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,449.186,466.637,"One of the oddities in this area is that we have the State arguing that the prisoner is probably going to prevail in all of these procedural matters, and in order to establish a 1983 suit, the prisoner argues the contrary."
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,472.72,474.211,--Yes.
1996.95-1352,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,495.936,511.935,"The question you present in your petition for certiorari is whether Heck bars the 1983 action brought by a prisoner challenging prisoner disciplinary procedures, if the success of that action would necessarily imply the invalidity of the prisoner's loss of good time."
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,525.936,548.75,"Yes, and that certainly is the language in Heck, and I think, Mr. Chief Justice, the problem you have in a prison disciplinary case, in a case like Balisok, is that if we can't conclude that there is a 100 percent chance that the sanction is going to be reversed, then the lower courts are saying that doesn't meet that language in Heck that says necessarily invalidate."
1996.95-1352,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,564.82,572.516,"Well, are you asking us to make some clarification of Heck or change it in some way?"
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,572.516,583.783,"We are proposing that the Court adopt what we refer to as a bright line rule to address a broader context of cases, particularly prison disciplinary cases."
1996.95-1352,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,583.783,585.433,"So, your answer is yes to my question?"
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,585.433,585.854,Yes.
1996.95-1352,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,585.854,589.035,You do want a change or a clarification in Heck.
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,589.035,590.617,Yes.
1996.95-1352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,604.827,606.209,"Ms. Mix, this is bait and switch."
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,669.031,682.338,"Well, Justice Scalia, what we have done is we have argued that Heck is applicable to a category of cases in the prison disciplinary context and that it does fit squarely into that context, that the lower courts are doing that."
1996.95-1352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,682.338,685.941,I thought the issue was whether good-time credits comes within Heck.
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,700.681,719.093,"Justice Scalia, I think that whichever route the Court goes with this case, it is very important to say that Heck explicitly applies in the prison disciplinary context and that good-time credits are, as the courts have consistently found, within the definition of fact and duration of confinement--"
1996.95-1352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,719.093,728.06,"And it would do some good just to decide that point, right, even if we don't reconsider Heck and adopt a much more expansive rule?"
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,728.06,741.457,"--It would do some good to address that point, but there will continue to be difficulties just under that rule because the courts, such as the Ninth Circuit, can take a very serious--"
1996.95-1352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,741.457,746.022,"And maybe some day we'll agree to consider those difficulties, but I didn't think we had agreed to consider them here."
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,746.022,764.955,"--What I'm saying, though, is even if you make explicit that Heck applies to the prison disciplinary context, if the lower courts are going to say, but nothing fits within the necessary invalidation rule of Heck, the rigors of the Heck test, then we haven't achieved very much."
1996.95-1352,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,764.955,768.037,"Ms. Mix, I'm confused and perhaps you can help me."
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,841.665,852.882,"That is how Mr. Balisok has presented his complaint certainly and how he would like his complaint to be read, but we have to remember a couple of things."
1996.95-1352,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,874.196,875.118,"Well, what's wrong with that?"
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,881.292,892.078,--Because this Court has said on a number of occasions that procedural due process exists in the first instance to protect against the mistaken and unjustified depravation of liberty.
1996.95-1352,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,915.424,916.355,But is that necessarily true?
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,925.33,934.557,"That is correct, but I would characterize that, Justice Stevens, as comparable to a new trial, a new hearing, where the relief--"
1996.95-1352,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,934.557,940.36,A new trial that ended up with exactly the same period of incarceration as he got with the unfair trial.
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,941.981,951.378,"--But the remedy that is given, the rehearing or the retrial, should be given by a court sitting in habeas corpus, not by a 1983 court."
1996.95-1352,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,951.378,958.741,"The Ninth Circuit in this case, Ms. Mix, as I understand it, relied on its earlier opinion in Gotcher against Wood."
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,979.304,988.192,Their conclusion is that simply challenging the procedures doesn't call into question the good time.
1996.95-1352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,996.227,1002.14,Their position is that just challenging the procedures never calls into question the good time.
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,1011.337,1013.017,I think--
1996.95-1352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1013.017,1020.563,"--that there is... that there was harmful error, the Ninth Circuit would say good-time credits just don't count for purposes of Heck."
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,1021.542,1022.313,--I think that is correct.
1996.95-1352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1022.714,1023.583,And you take the other extreme.
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,1035.463,1038.693,--I suppose that's possible.
1996.95-1352,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1079.85,1081.442,I'll look at Heck.
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,1086.574,1090.428,Heck uses the term I think in relation to the Wolff--
1996.95-1352,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1090.428,1091.768,Yes.
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,1091.768,1093.831,"--passage, necessarily vitiate."
1996.95-1352,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1093.831,1094.649,Necessarily vitiate.
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,1094.649,1096.081,"Yes, that is correct."
1996.95-1352,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1096.081,1103.696,"Suppose Mr. Balisok had gotten his disciplinary sanction, hadn't attacked it, and then brought a suit--"
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,1103.696,1104.357,I'm sorry.
1996.95-1352,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1104.767,1119.738,"--Suppose instead of this emerging in a particular disciplinary action, Mr. Balisok had brought a separate action in which he said I've been disciplined before, I'm likely to be disciplined again."
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,1134.396,1146.534,"--Yes, I believe it would be because he would not be under... suffering from any sanction that affected the fact and duration of confinement sufficient to put it into habeas."
1996.95-1352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1251.073,1253.985,We don't have any discretion under section 1983.
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,1316.236,1340.633,"--Justice Scalia, I think the answer to that is when a prisoner is challenging procedures where the challenge to that procedure logically will affect and call into question, the very language the Court used into... in Heck, the confinement, then that is a case that involves the fact and duration of confinement, and it should proceed first in Federal habeas corpus."
1996.95-1352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1343.064,1346.417,But you've acknowledged that it does not necessarily call into question--
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,1346.417,1348.087,We--
1996.95-1352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1348.087,1348.628,--the confinement.
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,1348.628,1365.427,"--Granted that can be the case in many prisoner cases, but I think what we need to do is look at what is the next natural step after Heck in dealing with claims that call into question confinement, effect of duration, confinement--"
1996.95-1352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1365.427,1372.092,"The next natural step is another Federal statute, going beyond the statute that enabled us to go as far as we did in Heck."
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,1372.092,1374.404,"--Justice Scalia, I disagree."
1996.95-1352,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1396.57,1410.337,"But you say that Mr. Balisok could do exactly what on the surface he seems to want to do which is to get a fair procedure, disciplinary procedure, installed, and he could do that under 1983, but he has to pay a price."
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,1442.068,1445.25,--He has an alternative.
1996.95-1352,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1447.381,1448.823,"Well, that's what you are saying."
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,1466.324,1479.854,--His alternative to conceding that result is go... to go first into State court and attempt to have the State court look at the substantive liberty interest that is at issue.
1996.95-1352,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1485.785,1487.408,"But if he prefers the Federal forum, he can have it."
1996.95-1352,0,33923,kathleen_d_mix,,1493.761,1523.871,"--That is correct, but I think he still has other avenues back into the Federal forum should he choose the exhaustion route first, and even if he should not prevail in that and be subject to a harmless error situation under the rule that we have proposed, the broader rule that we have proposed, he could then go forward with a nominal damages claim, another... other Carey-type claims because he would not be foreclosed on that."
1996.95-1352,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1527.985,1529.254,"Very well, Ms. Mix."
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,1530.556,1534.738,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1570.161,1573.203,"Number two was not agreed to by the decision below, though, was it?"
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,1582.42,1584.262,"No, Your Honor."
1996.95-1352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1596.229,1601.373,Let me take the opposite side of the side I was taking with Ms. Mix.
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,1649.415,1650.915,"No, it does not."
1996.95-1352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1666.496,1666.867,We've never said that.
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,1670.917,1676.543,"--Well, the procedure made a difference, Your Honor, because he wasn't allowed to call a witness at a hearing."
1996.95-1352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1676.543,1677.221,That's the procedure.
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,1677.221,1678.373,That's the procedure.
1996.95-1352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1678.373,1678.833,What's the difference?
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,1683.035,1690.12,The difference is that he wasn't allowed to have a witness at a hearing and whether or not that--
1996.95-1352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1690.12,1695.054,"He does not have to go ahead and say, in order to have standing, and that made a difference in the outcome."
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,1697.404,1708.654,"--He has to say for standing purposes that he had a right to call that and that it may have affected the outcome of the hearing, not that it would have affected, that he had a right to have those witnesses there."
1996.95-1352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1711.834,1713.557,He does not have to assert that it affected the outcome of the hearing.
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,1713.557,1715.77,--He has to assert that it may have affected the outcome of the hearing.
1996.95-1352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1715.77,1716.091,Just that it may have?
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,1716.091,1725.027,"Well, because he can't, under 1983 and the habeas dichotomy, Your Honor, because the decision as to whether it would have affected the outcome belongs in State court."
1996.95-1352,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1727.969,1730.2,No.
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,1756.876,1768.024,"That's correct, Your Honor, because in the State of Washington and in most States, when a prisoner goes in to attack habeas, he is going in under a standard of, one, some or any evidence that upholds the hearing."
1996.95-1352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1790.169,1792.32,One is never denied due process.
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,1795.482,1796.872,Yes.
1996.95-1352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1796.872,1799.604,The process itself is worthless.
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,1820.397,1825.873,The grievance is that he was denied the right to present witnesses.
1996.95-1352,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1838.95,1845.094,"Are you saying it's... he's saying, it's not inevitable that I will get my good time, but at least I'll have a shot at it?"
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,1859.213,1873.772,"If the Court held that he was denied constitutional procedure under 1983 and awarded him the injunction he seeks and nominal damages, he would... it would not necessarily imply any change in the outcome of his hearing at all."
1996.95-1352,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1873.772,1890.853,"--But wouldn't he have to have something in the... I thought his situation is, I've had an unfair trial, so at least I ought to get my good-time credits restored, and then we can have a fair disciplinary proceeding and maybe they'll be taken away again."
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,1895.027,1896.549,"No, Your Honor, I'm not."
1996.95-1352,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1912.598,1914.808,"Yes, but procedural rights don't exist in the air."
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,1923.534,1926.627,"Yes, the liberty interest and good-time credits and the right to a fair hearing."
1996.95-1352,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1927.849,1943.949,"You say, Mr. Rice, that he would get a declaration of some sort in the Federal court that he had been denied procedural rights in the disciplinary proceeding."
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,1949.473,1954.045,"Well, he would go to State court, if he had the opportunity to, to go to State court."
1996.95-1352,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1972.989,1976.171,That seems like a very strange bifurcation.
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,1989.838,1992.781,"They're separate and distinct procedures, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-1352,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1993.121,2000.215,But surely we had that same objection that the Chief Justice is questioning when you're attacking the conviction itself.
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2008.381,2010.413,"--Well, absolutely."
1996.95-1352,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2010.413,2019.86,"And yet, that seems to be the very process that you're holding out here as the solution to some of the questions we've been raising in the context of good time."
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2019.86,2029.463,"Well, an attack to the conviction or the sentence imposed at the conviction by Federal statute under habeas must be done in habeas corpus and must exhaust State remedies."
1996.95-1352,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2031.566,2039.871,"That's because we've said so, and we've said so in order to preserve the State from Federal interference."
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2051.047,2056.702,"--Well, Your Honor, they don't because, one, 1983 is a different statute which doesn't require exhaustion."
1996.95-1352,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2058.695,2064.157,But we were talking about 1983 in the context of the collateral attack on a conviction as well.
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2064.157,2075.754,"--That's true, but in there... in Heck you also affirmed Wolff and said an attack to the procedure that doesn't necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction or the sentence is valid and can go forward."
1996.95-1352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2075.754,2090.425,Why doesn't this necessarily imply the invalidity of the sentence if you consider as the sentence the increase by reason of the denial of his good-time credits?
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2090.425,2096.268,"It doesn't imply it, Your Honor, because when he goes to State court, when he goes into... to the attack of habeas--"
1996.95-1352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2096.268,2098.46,That denial of good-time credits is invalid.
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2108.707,2109.595,--It's not automatic.
1996.95-1352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2115.98,2116.431,"--No, no, no."
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2132.731,2133.562,It does not.
1996.95-1352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2133.562,2135.833,It does not even imply that?
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2135.833,2139.847,It may... it implies the procedures were--
1996.95-1352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2139.847,2148.281,"Careful, because what it says, whether a judgment would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence."
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2148.281,2148.561,--That's correct.
1996.95-1352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2148.561,2160.911,"And I don't see how it's possible to say that when you prevail under 1983 on the ground that the procedures were wrong, that does not imply that the denial of good-time credits was in error."
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2160.911,2186.316,"Well, Your Honor, this Court used footnote 7 in Heck to explain what it meant by necessarily imply, and in footnote 7 this Court said if the attack on procedures had a different doctrine such as inevitable discovery or harmless error, then our holding that the procedure was invalid doesn't necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction or sentence because of other doctrines which intersect on that issue."
1996.95-1352,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2186.316,2204.05,"Under your theory, Mr. Rice, could you go into Federal court and say with respect to a trial in which you had been found guilty of a criminal offense that you had been denied the right of counsel and that the Federal judge says, well, you know, that should be in habeas?"
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2221.812,2228.925,"Your Honor, you can reach certain levels of constitutional depravation that no court would hold a fair hearing."
1996.95-1352,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2236.742,2242.094,Can a Federal court make that determination without... in a 1983 action?
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2242.094,2250.73,I think that immunities granted in the judicial context would prohibit a Federal court from making that--
1996.95-1352,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2250.73,2252.361,"Well, immunity is an affirmative defense."
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2306.576,2318.665,"--Well, Your Honor, I go back to this Court's precedent in Carey v. Piphus and in Memphis School District where there was a challenge to an unconstitutional procedure which the Court said it wouldn't have affected the outcome of the hearing."
1996.95-1352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2339.198,2343.432,It's significant that footnote 7 does not refer to harmless error.
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2353.156,2358.231,"And it also says, and of course, harmless error under Arizona v. Fulmanente."
1996.95-1352,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2360.542,2370.139,"Isn't it enough for your case, Mr. Rice, to admit the possibility that there may be some procedural depravations that simply couldn't be cured?"
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2373.539,2374.741,Well--
1996.95-1352,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2374.741,2379.824,"And then simply say, but that is not the issue in this case and there is no claim that this is one of them."
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2410.846,2412.485,"--Yes, it is enough for us to prevail."
1996.95-1352,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2412.485,2428.777,"Now, is that something different from what I understood a moment ago you to be arguing which was there's a further step simply because there would be no collateral estoppel or no res judicata effect in a State court?"
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2428.777,2437.171,"That's correct because of the State having the some or any evidence standard, having a substantial and actual injury for a constitutional--"
1996.95-1352,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2437.171,2447.448,"Okay, but wouldn't your argument be exactly the same if, let's say, suddenly tomorrow morning you could show that a return to the State court would be futile?"
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2456.684,2458.177,"--On Federal habeas, that's correct."
1996.95-1352,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2458.177,2463.579,"Yes, and that's enough for you to win... I understood your argument to be that that's enough for you to win this case."
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2463.579,2464.17,That's enough for us to win.
1996.95-1352,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2464.17,2469.933,Can you explain... for a minute I would appreciate going back to the Chief Justice's question.
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2538.489,2548.824,"While it seems convoluted, Your Honor, it makes sense because there is very distinct and separate remedies in 1983 and in habeas corpus."
1996.95-1352,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2659.667,2661.239,Actually three strikes and you're in.
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2662.749,2663.62,"Well, three strikes and you're in."
1996.95-1352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2669.333,2673.176,"Mr. Rice, what was the relief asked for in this lawsuit?"
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2673.176,2678.268,Mr. Balisok asked for a declaration that the conduct of the guards was unconstitutional.
1996.95-1352,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2704.335,2720.847,"In his... if he prevailed and had a determination, a declaratory judgment, that his rights had been violated by the guards, would that not have preclusive effect as to that finding against the State in a State court... in a subsequent State court proceeding?"
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2722.237,2725.34,"Not really, Your Honor, and here's why."
1996.95-1352,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2757.72,2759.943,Is there in Washington law?
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2759.943,2762.974,"No, there is not, not that I'm aware of."
1996.95-1352,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2774.523,2776.364,May I just... that went by me very quickly.
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2782.989,2794.656,"--Your Honor, a Federal court... a State court is required to honor a sister court judgment under full faith and credit of the Constitution, and a Federal court must honor a State court judgment under the full faith and credit statute."
1996.95-1352,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2797.738,2798.629,But there is the Supremacy Clause.
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2798.629,2806.063,--The Supremacy Clause would infer to the State that it should give deference to the Federal court judgment.
1996.95-1352,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2806.063,2811.709,You're saying that a court decree doesn't count as a Federal act.
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2811.709,2825.698,"In terms of applying it to 2254 which gives the State the right of independent review, that the State court can look separate from the Federal judgment in 1983."
1996.95-1352,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2825.698,2852.135,"I thought... and maybe I'm wrong about this... that it was well accepted that essentially the Federal court judgment gets the same full faith and credit in a State court that a sister State... the notion that a Federal court judgment is entitled to less respect in State A than a judgment of a sister State, State B judgment, that's very strange to me, and I frankly don't think it's the law."
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2852.135,2863.593,"Well, Your Honor, it's my understanding that the full faith and credit of the Constitution goes State to State and that the full faith and credit statute governs both."
1996.95-1352,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2863.593,2867.546,"Yes, but the... but there are other doctrines and one of them is the supremacy of Federal law."
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2874.808,2879.172,It would not revoke his good time because of the State court rights under some or any evidence.
1996.95-1352,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2879.172,2879.711,That's a much sounder argument.
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2879.711,2880.542,Pardon me?
1996.95-1352,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2880.542,2885.825,"That's a much sounder argument than to say that a State court doesn't have to give, in effect, full faith and credit to a Federal judgment."
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2894.941,2905.66,"Well, Your Honor, when the decision... when the 1983 decision goes into State court, the State court has several avenues to look at the facts of the case independently."
1996.95-1352,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2938.91,2947.826,"But 2254 applies to Federal court proceedings, and you're saying there's also a provision in 2254 that says a State court--"
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2947.826,2958.634,--2254(b) says that a State court has the first... gives the States the first right of review on habeas grounds.
1996.95-1352,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2964.439,2971.792,"--Yes, but the whole assumption of the 1983 action is that it is not functionally equivalent to habeas."
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2973.345,2976.597,I don't--
1996.95-1352,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2976.597,2982.321,"I mean, the... 2254 is applying habeas versus habeas, State versus Federal."
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2982.321,2983.069,--Right.
1996.95-1352,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2983.069,2993.878,The whole premise of our argument is that the 1983 action is not to be regarded as a covert habeas action under certain circumstances.
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2993.878,2996.389,It's not a covert habeas action at all.
1996.95-1352,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2996.389,2996.76,So--
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,2996.76,2997.928,But it depends upon--
1996.95-1352,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2997.928,3002.353,"--So, therefore, 2254 doesn't have any application one way or the other, does it?"
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,3002.353,3008.867,--It has application with regard to what the State standard is when it reviews a prisoner habeas petition.
1996.95-1352,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3017.763,3019.394,"Well, we could look at this later."
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,3029.672,3033.174,"That's right, and that has been interpreted--"
1996.95-1352,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3033.174,3038.577,And it has been interpreted to say that the State court need not be bound by any prior Federal judgment.
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,3038.577,3055.638,"--Well, look... you can look at the language in Heck v. Humphrey where the State there was saying you have to in Heck... you can't allow this ruling to afford in Heck because it's going to be preclusion in State court, and the opinion in Heck addresses that point and says, no, it's not going to be preclusion."
1996.95-1352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3133.009,3138.041,"Mr. Rice, I've been looking for footnote 11 in Heck v. Humphrey."
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,3146.486,3148.309,Footnote 9.
1996.95-1352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3148.928,3149.268,I see.
1996.95-1352,1,43236,thomas_h_speedy_rice,,3149.268,3160.297,"Look at footnote 9 where this Court says, while we have no occasion to rule on the matter at this time, it is at least plain preclusion will not necessarily be an automatic or even permissible effect."
