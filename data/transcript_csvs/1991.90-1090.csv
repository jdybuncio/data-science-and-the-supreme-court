1991.90-1090,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.239,"We will now hear argument in number 90-1090, INS v. National Center for Immigrants' Rights."
1991.90-1090,0,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,42.36,45.533,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1090,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,211.654,213.576,"Mr. Marzen, can I interrupt you with one question?"
1991.90-1090,0,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,228.587,241.303,--It would be perfectly consistent to apply it even for authorized work as to aliens who are authorized to work only by regulation.
1991.90-1090,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,255.144,265.961,"What about the aliens in this recent amnesty program where there was, where they applied for amnesty and during a period of time large groups were eligible for work that they might not otherwise have been eligible for, say, about that group?"
1991.90-1090,0,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,265.961,266.071,Yes.
1991.90-1090,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,269.042,269.323,To them.
1991.90-1090,0,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,269.323,272.324,--against them to forbid their work.
1991.90-1090,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,298.766,301.487,How does that work out in the administration of this bond condition?
1991.90-1090,0,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,307.612,318.77,"--Before the bond is stamped no work authorized, there is a determination by the district director or his designate that--"
1991.90-1090,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,318.77,323.712,"But, in what kind of... is this an ex parte determination or does the alien have any part in the decision?"
1991.90-1090,0,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,323.712,332.698,"--The alien has an important part to play because he has to, he will be asked to furnish evidence of his work authorization."
1991.90-1090,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,398.251,403.685,"So if the alien doesn't happen to have the card with him at the time he's apprehended, what does he do?"
1991.90-1090,0,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,403.685,407.057,"He, he can still say what his A number is."
1991.90-1090,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,414.144,418.104,And then the officer just decides whether or not to ask for this condition right there on the spot.
1991.90-1090,0,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,418.104,418.254,No.
1991.90-1090,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,429.462,429.863,I understand.
1991.90-1090,0,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,438.468,444.563,There's no specific... the initial determination by the district director or his designate is informal.
1991.90-1090,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,448.957,454.881,"But what happens in doubtful cases where you can't really tell right away and you got, the bond request is made right away?"
1991.90-1090,0,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,454.881,463.309,"We take the position, and it hasn't been applied yet, but we would take the position that the burden of proof is on the alien."
1991.90-1090,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,536.796,542.77,"If he, in that determination, in that hearing, if he demonstrates that he is authorized to work, then the condition would be removed from the bond."
1991.90-1090,0,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,542.77,543.621,That's correct.
1991.90-1090,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,581.669,592.067,"Mr. Marzen, is an alien who is found to be doing work which is not authorized subject to deportation on that ground?"
1991.90-1090,0,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,592.067,595.727,It depends on the alien's status.
1991.90-1090,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,617.524,622.177,The working without authorization is not an additional ground for deportation.
1991.90-1090,0,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,622.177,624.821,--For the vast majority of aliens in deportation proceedings.
1991.90-1090,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,684.993,686.913,I'm just curious about something.
1991.90-1090,0,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,709.719,713.692,"Well, we want to enforce this regulation."
1991.90-1090,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,765.679,769.623,"Mr. Marzen, I just, to be sure I understand your answer to an earlier question by Justice O'Connor."
1991.90-1090,0,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,777.229,778.451,--That's correct.
1991.90-1090,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,778.451,783.246,--Because he will always have committed a violation by accepting unauthorized work.
1991.90-1090,0,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,783.246,784.548,Correct.
1991.90-1090,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,784.548,787.638,"It makes it a double violation, is all that happens."
1991.90-1090,0,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,787.638,790.67,I was... and maybe I misunderstood the question.
1991.90-1090,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,918.419,929.959,"I was going to ask you, is that condition that you just mentioned, that you shall obey all laws of every State in the United States, is that included regularly in the bonds that we're talking about?"
1991.90-1090,0,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,929.959,931.371,No.
1991.90-1090,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,932.283,932.864,Could it be?
1991.90-1090,0,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,932.864,935.524,"--Yes, without question."
1991.90-1090,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1139.128,1149.724,"I'm just curious why, I mean, I understand you don't want to bite off any more than you have to, but why does the condition have to relate to a purpose of the immigration laws?"
1991.90-1090,0,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1165.875,1171.319,"Well, Justice Scalia, I'm not giving up much, because the immigration laws vest vast, vast discretion to the Attorney General."
1991.90-1090,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1207.826,1217.613,"I may be wrong, Mr. Marzen, but didn't the majority opinion in the Carlson case suggest that anyway it had to relate to some purpose of the statute, the condition?"
1991.90-1090,0,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1217.613,1222.308,"The Carlson majority said it, said it had to relate to the legislative scheme."
1991.90-1090,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1235.746,1236.317,I understand that.
1991.90-1090,0,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1243.922,1245.392,--That's true.
1991.90-1090,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1514.533,1518.126,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1090,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1569.499,1573.432,"Which they are, in law, obliged to do anyway."
1991.90-1090,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1582.718,1596.118,"Well, Justice Scalia, what the law says is that when you are arrested, you are arrested upon probable cause, just as in a criminal case, you would be arrested upon probable cause."
1991.90-1090,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1688.953,1692.455,"Mr. Schey, what's fair depends upon what Congress thinks is fair."
1991.90-1090,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1720.164,1721.526,Absolutely not.
1991.90-1090,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1721.526,1722.547,He could not do that.
1991.90-1090,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1722.547,1723.267,Absolutely not.
1991.90-1090,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1848.08,1868.824,"Well, Mr.... Mr. Schey, how then, if that's your answer to Justice Scalia, how do you read 8 USC 1252(a) where it says pending a determination of deportability, an alien may, upon warrant of the Attorney General be arrested and taken into consideration, and one of the alternatives is that he may be continued in custody?"
1991.90-1090,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1868.824,1883.594,"Well, Your Honor, I think that as this Court stated in Carlson v. Landon, it said that the Attorney General is left without standards to determine when to admit to bail and when to detain."
1991.90-1090,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1897.764,1900.927,"How does that, go ahead, how does that bear on--"
1991.90-1090,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1900.927,1905.779,"--Well, Carlson was dealing with the same language that we're dealing with today."
1991.90-1090,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1909.182,1910.912,"--It held, it held the aliens could be detained."
1991.90-1090,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1910.912,1914.675,--It held that the aliens could be detained based on two things.
1991.90-1090,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1968.279,1973.562,But that was... that's not the only thing that subjects one to deportability.
1991.90-1090,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1973.562,1974.273,That is correct.
1991.90-1090,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2000.175,2006.598,"Well, then why did it enact this thing which appears on its face to grant the, grant the authority to the Attorney General?"
1991.90-1090,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2017.115,2057.803,"--Well, Congress enacted this particular provision within the framework of discussions and debate and conference reports that make it absolutely clear that Congress did not intend... the only detention, in fact, ultimately in 1952 when this law was enacted, if you go to part (b) or (c) of the statute, for people who have been found deportable, there Congress specifically said that the person could be released on detention on bond in amount and specifying such conditions for... excuse me, let me just read you the exact language."
1991.90-1090,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2109.649,2117.254,"But you know... quite apart from what it may authorize as the Attorney General to impose conditions, it says they may be continued in custody."
1991.90-1090,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2119.727,2120.055,Right.
1991.90-1090,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2145.035,2145.495,Excuse me.
1991.90-1090,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2147.177,2147.968,--Any alien.
1991.90-1090,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2158.917,2159.709,Only if he's an alien.
1991.90-1090,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2159.709,2171.773,"--any alien who received public assistance within 5 years after entry into the United States, any alien... there are approximately 100 separate grounds of deportation."
1991.90-1090,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2506.791,2508.281,Maybe they read the statute wrong.
1991.90-1090,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2508.281,2510.344,"--Well, they wrote the statute."
1991.90-1090,2,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3272.709,3274.402,Three points.
1991.90-1090,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3292.283,3294.046,What do you do about those two cases?
1991.90-1090,2,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3294.046,3301.239,"The second part of my point is at page 25 of our opening brief, footnote 16."
1991.90-1090,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3322.476,3326.036,"It says will not normally be, but the language of the regulation would seem to apply."
1991.90-1090,2,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3326.036,3330.771,We do make an exception in the operating instruction for just this sort of case.
1991.90-1090,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3365.438,3374.114,"What about the most recent amendment, does... if the statute means what you say it means, why was that needed, do you suppose?"
1991.90-1090,2,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3374.114,3375.216,I'm referring to the most recent amendment.
1991.90-1090,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3401.205,3407.747,"Before you leave that one point, Mr. Marzen, the regulation to which you refer in the footnote 16 that you cited, when was that adopted?"
1991.90-1090,2,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3407.747,3408.338,--Um--
1991.90-1090,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3408.338,3413.612,Was that after this case began or was it in effect before the regulation was--
1991.90-1090,2,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3413.612,3414.613,--I'm not sure.
1991.90-1090,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3488.614,3492.607,--What do you say to Carlson and the other Supreme Court case that he cites?
1991.90-1090,2,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3492.607,3498.612,Carlson affirms that you can impose conditions that are unrelated to release.
1991.90-1090,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3505.825,3508.236,"Thank you, Mr. Marzen, the case is submitted."
