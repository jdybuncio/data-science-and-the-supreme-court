1971.70-29,0,35030,la_rossa,,0.0,10.48,United States Attorney enclosing to the Jury said he referring to Taliento received no promises that he would not be indited.
1971.70-29,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,37.923,40.597,(Inaudible)?
1971.70-29,0,35030,la_rossa,,40.597,41.852,"Yes Sir, I am."
1971.70-29,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,50.297,56.374,"Well, you characterized it as perjury rather than misunderstanding on Taliento’s part?"
1971.70-29,0,35030,la_rossa,,56.374,57.637,That is correct Sir.
1971.70-29,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,57.637,59.527,Did you go so far?
1971.70-29,0,35030,la_rossa,,59.527,63.408,"No, I do not believe I do Mr. Justice Blackmun, I do not think I have to."
1971.70-29,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,85.193,96.975,"It carries out a little beyond if in fact, the Assistant United States Attorney did not know and was making the argument in good faith."
1971.70-29,0,35030,la_rossa,,103.071,105.04,"No Sir, I do not believe so."
1971.70-29,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,226.304,232.995,Is there anything in the records to show the power of an Assistant US Attorney to grant immunity?
1971.70-29,0,35030,la_rossa,,232.995,252.87,"Well, the affidavits in opposition Mr. Justice Marshall, state that an Assistant US Attorney has no authority to grant immunity and an affidavit from Mr. Hoey suggest that this can not be done and Judge Rio’s decision was based in part on the fact that our Assistant US Attorney has no right to grant immunity."
1971.70-29,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,270.982,273.31,And the US Attorney did he know about it?
1971.70-29,0,35030,la_rossa,,273.31,275.392,"At times, he did Sir if it was important."
1971.70-29,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,275.392,286.156,"Well, I am saying do you mean that US Attorney can grant immunity to amend charge with treason and nobody has to know about it?"
1971.70-29,0,35030,la_rossa,,288.564,291.885,"Well Mr. Justice Marshall, my I add one thing and I say yes, it is."
1971.70-29,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,291.885,292.514,It is?
1971.70-29,0,35030,la_rossa,,292.514,302.107,"Yes Sir and further than that, if that man under that grant of immunity testified before that Grand Jury and then that testimony was introduced against themselves, would this court uphold one?"
1971.70-29,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,302.107,306.854,"I did not talk about the Grand Jury, I am talking about the prosecution."
1971.70-29,0,35030,la_rossa,,306.854,308.431,"Yes Sir, I understand your point."
1971.70-29,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,308.431,317.647,You say that the Assistant US Attorney can say that you are charged of treason but I grant you immunity and you will not be prosecuted.
1971.70-29,0,35030,la_rossa,,317.647,318.873,"Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, I do not know --"
1971.70-29,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,318.873,320.221,"You could, well let me ask you this."
1971.70-29,0,35030,la_rossa,,320.221,323.301,I do not know what there is particular regulation with treason.
1971.70-29,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,323.301,330.095,"If an Assistant US Attorney told this man that you would not be prosecuted, could Mr. Lee prosecute him?"
1971.70-29,0,35030,la_rossa,,330.095,331.501,"I do not believe so, no Sir."
1971.70-29,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,331.605,334.079,But the Attorney General ordered to prosecute him.
1971.70-29,0,35030,la_rossa,,338.062,339.574,I do not believe Sir.
1971.70-29,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,341.831,343.362,What grounds do you have for that?
1971.70-29,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1545.338,1554.644,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1971.70-29,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1701.911,1702.961,How old is Giglio?
1971.70-29,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1702.961,1707.75,Giglio as about 26 or 27 at time.
1971.70-29,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1707.75,1715.361,What you are presiding now is what the Trial and the Assistant attributed in his affidavit?
1971.70-29,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1715.361,1718.12,"That is correct, that is correct, that is correct."
1971.70-29,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1872.579,1878.852,What is your construction of the good judgment and conscience of the Government?
1971.70-29,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1878.852,1897.385,"I think the Government was holding over Mr. Taliento’s head, the possibility that he could still be indicted if he did not testify or if he got up and instead of testifying the same way he had in previous times, changes his testimony to make it more favorable to the Defense."
1971.70-29,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1897.385,1908.069,"What makes Taliento, that a true judgment, a good conscience that if he was at least an extremely good witness, he would not be prosecuted."
1971.70-29,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1908.069,1911.27,"I think he probably did not, if he screwed it that way and that is the way—."
1971.70-29,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1911.27,1916.399,Is that a promise?
1971.70-29,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1916.399,1922.057,"I think what it was was something less than a promise, but certainly an indication to it."
1971.70-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1976.778,1992.874,"No, what bothers me as a matter of the facts and that is what you are now discussing is that the witness Taliento on cross examination said this, he said “Nobody told me, I would not be prosecuted”."
1971.70-29,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2013.551,2017.202,I do not think there is far apart as they seem -- you keep in mind the context--
1971.70-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2017.202,2020.176,"Quid pro quo, but you already deliver the quid pro quo."
1971.70-29,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2026.124,2036.117,"Now, what I was suggesting your honors that in the context of his testimony, he is there on Trial being crossed examined."
1971.70-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2036.554,2038.686,"Yes, after his direct testimony."
1971.70-29,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2038.686,2055.293,"He may well have understood this to be question as to whether he had a deal with the Government, it was 4, 5 pages about whether he had a deal with the Government, and he did not try do deny that he expected that the --"
1971.70-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2055.293,2058.931,"Well, his words were and nobody told me I would not be prosecuted."
1971.70-29,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2067.103,2072.242,But he also had within the week before his testimony.
1971.70-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2072.242,2073.224,"Well, he also had--"
1971.70-29,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2073.224,2077.504,The explanation from the US Attorney that no promise had been made.
1971.70-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2077.504,2078.013,Yes.
1971.70-29,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2078.013,2088.292,And Taliento may have interpreted whatever had been said to him two-and-a-half years before differently than Mr. DiPaola interpreted that.
1971.70-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2088.292,2092.647,"That word “nobody” has a meaning in the English language, does it not?"
1971.70-29,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2092.647,2093.167,"Yes, it does."
1971.70-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2093.167,2097.85,And DiPaola states under oath that he did tell him that he would not be prosecuted?
1971.70-29,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2097.85,2099.7,That is correct.
1971.70-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2099.7,2102.713,And the witness says nobody told me that I would not be prosecuted.
1971.70-29,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2110.484,2125.291,"But it seems to me that it is less than perjury, when the witness has spent a week with the Federal Attorneys just before this testimony in which they have made it perfectly clear to him that he could still be prosecuted, and he have had --."
1971.70-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2125.291,2127.373,If he did not testify?
1971.70-29,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2129.357,2131.739,"No, but they—"
1971.70-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2131.739,2133.911,"So, he delivered his part of the bargain."
1971.70-29,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2133.911,2144.44,"And Mr. Hoey had also apparently made it clear to him that even if he did testify, he would simply have to rely on the good faith and judgment of the Government."
1971.70-29,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2158.663,2171.737,It has the conflict which Justice White focused on between the affidavit of the Trial Assistant and the affidavit of the man who compared the case with at Trial.
1971.70-29,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2181.281,2189.211,I do no think the District Court saw it as a necessary conflict in --
1971.70-29,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2189.211,2195.417,Do not you agree that there is a conflict as Justice White pointed out?
1971.70-29,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2195.417,2199.004,I really think there is a conflict.
1971.70-29,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2226.503,2242.812,"What if on a hearing before of the District Judge now, Mr. DiPaola retracted his affidavit and said that he had never given any such assurances for whatever reasons we may not be concerned now."
1971.70-29,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2248.926,2250.726,I really do not think so your Honor.
1971.70-29,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2284.539,2293.135,I am a little puzzled by your suggestion with the hypothetical situation.
1971.70-29,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2313.869,2317.617,"No, I agree, in that situation, the case would be over."
