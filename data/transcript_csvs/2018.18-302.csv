2018.18-302,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.64,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-302, Iancu versus Brunetti. Mr. Stewart."
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,6.64,18.48,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Lanham Act's ban on federal registration of scandalous trademarks is not a restriction on speech but a valid condition on participation in a federal program."
2018.18-302,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,31.84,43.68,"Could you please tell me how you're defining ""scandalous mark""? From your brief, I thought you were giving it a different definition than has been used by the agency for a while."
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,43.68,55.52,"Well, the -- the term -- the adjectives that have sometimes been used as synonyms for ""scandalous"" by the agency are terms like ""shocking,"" ""disgraceful,"" ""offensive,"" and ""disreputable."" I think one --"
2018.18-302,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,55.52,59.12,"Well, if you use all those adjectives, you run head-on to Tam."
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,59.12,70.52,"I think one sense in which we have -- the -- I think this has always been at the core of the prohibition, but I think Tam has led us to focus more on limiting the scope of those adjectives."
2018.18-302,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,81.36,82.92,But that's viewpoint discrimination.
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,82.92,83.84,That's viewpoint discrimination.
2018.18-302,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,99.56,124.16,"How is -- how is that determined, that a substantial composite of the general public would find the -- the mark shocking or offensive? I mean, if -- considering what's involved in this case, if you were to take a -- a composite of, say, 20-year-olds, do you think that that answer would be they would find it shocking?"
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,124.16,131.84,I -- I think not -- I think there are certainly some segments of society that are more likely to find particular marks shocking than others.
2018.18-302,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,152.0,165.96,"So why are you using a subjective standard? Why not just something like obscene, vulgar, even profane? But, once you get to shockingly offensive, you get to viewpoint."
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,179.88,196.0,"I -- I would agree that if you just looked at the words like ""shocking"" and ""offensive"" on their face and gave them their ordinary meanings, that they could easily encompass material that was shocking because it expressed an outrageous point of view or a point of view that most members --"
2018.18-302,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,196.0,220.2,"Well, Mr. Stewart, if -- if you agree with that, I mean, what are we supposed to be doing here? Are we supposed to be looking at the statutory words? Are we supposed to be looking at the fuller standard that the Federal Circuit gave to explain those words? Or are we supposed to be looking just at your commitments as to what you're doing going forward? I mean, if you take the statutory words, they're very broad."
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,235.56,267.92,"Well, I think typically the Court would attempt to construe a federal statute in a way that would render it constitutional rather than unconstitutional. And I think the scandalous marks provision is, at the very least, susceptible of a reading that would render it constitutional. If the focus is on profanity, vulgarity -- and we're not just talking about words; we're also talking about images, that trademarks can include images as well as words -- and if the scandalous marks provision were struck down, then applicants would be free to obtain registration of sexually explicit images."
2018.18-302,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,267.92,270.8,"Is it -- your -- this is a facial challenge, right?"
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,270.8,271.52,That's correct.
2018.18-302,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,271.52,276.4,"So it's not simply enough to determine that this particular trademark is scandalous, right?"
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,276.4,278.4,That's -- that's correct.
2018.18-302,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,278.4,282.2,"Well, I didn't understand you in your brief to make much of an argument about that."
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,282.2,311.16,"Well, in part -- in part because, once you -- if you accept the PTO's initial determination that this mark would be perceived as the equivalent of the past participle form of the -- the paradigmatic profane word in our culture, once you accept that, it's hard to see what would be covered if this is not. But I certainly -- we certainly agree with your point that it's a facial challenge. The question is whether it is susceptible of constitutional application."
2018.18-302,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,313.52,316.68,Whether the -- whether the provision itself is susceptible?
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,316.68,318.2,Of constitutional application.
2018.18-302,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,318.2,318.44,Right.
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,319.92,321.56,It would cover obscenity.
2018.18-302,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,321.72,327.76,So if it's -- what would happen if we agreed with the Respondents? Would the whole provision be struck down?
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,327.76,346.96,"I -- the Respondents -- I -- the Respondents might say that the provision on its face is so substantial -- that if the only legitimate applications were to obscene materials, the Respondent might say it is so substantially broad, overbroad on its face, covers so much more than that, that it can't be sustained even --"
2018.18-302,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,346.96,352.64,"So if this is -- the entire provision is struck down, the government would not be able to restrict trademarks that are obscene?"
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,352.64,390.92,"We -- I mean, the government could restrict -- without regard to federal registration, the government could restrict the sale of goods in commerce that -- that -- on which were emblazoned obscene trademarks or the -- the mailing of such goods. I think, for that reason, to limit it in that fashion wouldn't really accomplish much. We -- we agree that it should be limited so that it isn't viewpoint discriminatory, but to limit it to obscene words, both would render it a virtual nullity, and there's also no good reason that the standard for determining whether a particular mark can be placed on goods that are out in the public marketplace should be the same as --"
2018.18-302,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,390.92,391.6,Let me --
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,391.6,396.2,-- the standard for determining whether the goods can be sent through the mail to a willing buyer.
2018.18-302,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,396.2,398.16,Let me just be a little more precise.
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,407.24,419.16,"Well, I -- I -- I think there are certainly ways -- if the Court struck down the statute on its face on the ground that it was substantially overbroad, then, no, I don't think that there is any other provision that the -- of the Trademark Act."
2018.18-302,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,419.6,422.56,"Well, and this is -- as we established, this is a facial challenge?"
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,422.56,423.0,Right.
2018.18-302,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,423.0,423.2,Okay.
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,427.56,429.76,I -- I think that's -- I think that's correct.
2018.18-302,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,429.76,436.56,"And -- and just so I could understand, you're asking us to narrow this statute to exactly what?"
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,436.56,448.04,"To marks that are offensive, shocking to a substantial segment of the public because of their mode of expression, independent of any views that they may express. And --"
2018.18-302,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,448.04,462.52,"Suppose -- suppose in the niche market that these goods are targeting, the -- the name is -- the word is mainstream."
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,481.08,512.44,"I don't think that would be an appropriate means of proceeding, and -- and let me explain why if I may. If you look, for instance, at George Carlin's filthy words monologue, the monologue that was at issue in Pacifica, that's a paradigmatic example of profane copyrightable expression. Now our society has reached a good accommodation where people who find the Carlin monologue funny or thought-provoking can buy the CDs, they can buy the DVDs; when Carlin was alive, they could watch live performances."
2018.18-302,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,518.32,549.96,"But what is the standard that you're looking to, at bottom, and this is framed by Justice Ginsburg's question, is -- what is Congress's interest? Is it -- does it have an independent interest in not having the federal government associated with certain words? Or is it just an interest in following whatever the population thinks is offensive or scandalous or immoral at a particular point in time?"
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,549.96,551.24,It is some of --
2018.18-302,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,551.24,552.76,Those are not necessarily the same.
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,552.76,563.76,"It is some of both, but, with respect to -- to the second interest, we would emphasize the interest is in protecting unwilling viewers from material that they find offensive."
2018.18-302,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,581.24,590.68,"Well, I -- I don't see how the second interest is implicated much at all, because this -- this word and all sorts of other words can be used in connection with the sale of goods."
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,596.64,621.32,"Well, it's -- it -- it's partly the first interest, but it's partly the second because, even though the government cannot prohibit the use of a mark like this on the clothing, it can attempt to disincentivize it or it can attempt to remove the creation -- to avoid the creation of artificial incentives to its use by providing the benefits that are associated with federal trademark registration. And the point I --"
2018.18-302,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,621.32,634.48,Why are you resisting Justice Alito? Why can't the government's interest in not being associated with sexually explicit activity or words be enough?
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,634.48,639.36,"We think that it is enough, but we don't want to abandon the -- the first interest either because we do think --"
2018.18-302,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,639.36,639.64,Why?
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,639.64,640.28,Because we --
2018.18-302,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,640.28,648.64,"I'm -- I'm -- I'm curious because Justice Alito is right, trademarks can be used with or without registration."
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,654.24,655.12,Right.
2018.18-302,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,655.12,655.56,All right.
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,659.92,660.24,I -- I --
2018.18-302,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,660.24,663.12,You're defending it in a way that suggests that I'm missing something.
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,663.12,673.28,"I wouldn't say that it's more compelling, but I would say that the government has an independent interest in protecting unwilling viewers to the extent possible from materials that they find --"
2018.18-302,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,673.28,686.36,"But that falls -- that falls prey to what Justice Alito said, which is now the government is moving with public morals rather than with freedom of speech and the idea that morals can and should change."
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,686.36,739.04,"Well, we -- I mean, we do have -- in a traditional subsidy program, for instance, if the government was handing out grants for aspiring artists, grants to help them -- them create art, the government obviously couldn't prohibit artists from creating vulgar, profane art, art that a substantial segment of the population would find offensive, but it might still have an interest in encouraging the creation of art that would be accessible and welcome to all segments of the community, including to -- to children. And, again, the point I was making about source identifiers is the reason that it's not feasible to restrict source I -- inspection of source identifiers to people who want the product is source identifiers are -- they're not the expression that you get once you have decided to buy the product."
2018.18-302,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,764.48,764.92,How -- how do you --
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,764.92,765.72,-- by members --
2018.18-302,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,765.72,766.04,Excuse me.
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,775.28,814.0,"Well, I think some of it is -- some of it will be resolved by Tam; that is, to the extent that the PTO had previously taken into account whether the views expressed were shocking or offensive, that won't be done any longer. The second thing I would say is more -- more leeway is given in situations -- in terms of vagueness, in situations where the government is not prohibiting speech but is simply declining to provide a benefit. Here -- here, the consequence of the determination that Mr. Brunetti's mark was scandalous was not that he was subjected to any penalty, he could continue to market his goods in commerce with the -- the trademark he had been using."
2018.18-302,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,814.0,848.32,"But, if I understand what you're saying, Mr. Stewart, you're essentially saying we should uphold this statute on the basis of various commitments that the government is now making to apply this statute to only a small subset of the things that it could apply to, if you look at it on its face as to just the words used. And -- and that's a strange thing for us to do, isn't it, to basically, you know, take your commitment that, look, these are very broad words, but we're going to pretend that they say something much narrower than they do?"
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,848.32,864.4,"Well, I think even up to this point, the core of the provision as the PTO has applied it has been profane, vulgar, vulgar words, sexually explicit images, offensive excretory references, things that were regarded as offensive."
2018.18-302,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,864.4,888.96,"How can -- how can one say that when many of these marks have been refused registration on dual grounds, and one ground is that they're scandalous and the other ground is that they resemble a mark that is already registered, so, if the mark is already registered, then it's not scandalous."
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,888.96,900.24,"I -- I think it's anomalous at first glance, but I don't think that there's a logical contradiction because the Lanham Act doesn't simply prohibit registration of marks that are identical to a -- an existing mark."
2018.18-302,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,913.84,914.44,"Well, but, Mister --"
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,914.44,915.72,-- one of which is barely scandalous --
2018.18-302,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,915.72,916.24,"-- but, Mister --"
2018.18-302,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,916.24,917.28,But this is -- if this --
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,917.28,917.92,-- the other --
2018.18-302,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,917.92,919.52,"Mr. Stewart, though --"
2018.18-302,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,919.52,920.0,Go ahead.
2018.18-302,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,920.0,944.4,"Justice Ginsburg's point takes us back to Justice Kavanaugh's, I think, which is you look at the -- the seven words at the end of the red brief and there are shocking numbers of ones granted and ones refused that -- that do look remarkably similar. How is a reasonable citizen supposed to know? What notice do they have about how the government's going to treat their mark?"
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,944.4,957.8,"Well, I -- I think one of the -- I think the notice is in -- in part the -- based on the PTO decisions, but, obviously, whatever the Court says, if it upheld the provision, the Court can say what it wants to say about the permissible --"
2018.18-302,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,957.8,961.12,"No, no, but let me -- we -- we can fix your problem for you, I got that."
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,983.88,987.2,"Well, I think, in part, the PTO looks to context."
2018.18-302,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1014.4,1017.68,I don't want to -- I don't want to go through the examples.
2018.18-302,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1020.52,1039.36,But I can come up with several that are granted that -- that have -- have phonetics along the lines you've described and a couple that have been denied. And what's the rational line? How is a person -- a person who wants to get a mark supposed to tell what the PTO is going to do? Is it a flip of the coin?
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1039.36,1064.76,"I guess the two things I would say are, first, the PTO looks to context. And so, if a phonetic word like the one I described appears in a sentence or in a phrase in which the profane word would commonly appear, the PTO is more likely to conclude that a substantial segment of the public will regard that as the equivalent of the profane mark because it is being used in the way that the profane mark is often used."
2018.18-302,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1064.76,1079.68,"What's going to -- if this is held to be unconstitutional, what is going to happen with whatever list of really dirty words still exist and all of their variations? There's going to be a mad scramble by people to register these marks."
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1089.44,1098.24,"I mean, there -- there are other barriers to trademark registration. That is, it's not the case that any non-scandalous word could be trademarked."
2018.18-302,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1159.08,1161.52,What about racial slurs?
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1161.52,1168.04,"I think, in general, racial slurs are taken off the table by Tam, because it is the --"
2018.18-302,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1168.04,1181.96,"Because I -- I've looked into a little, and there are certain ones that have exactly the same physiological effect on a person, if any, as the word we're using here, and there is a physiological effect."
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1181.96,1182.16,I --
2018.18-302,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1182.16,1185.84,There is a -- it's stored in a different place in the brain.
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1193.4,1193.64,I --
2018.18-302,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1193.64,1197.72,-- to think of a racial slur that has exactly the same effect.
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1197.72,1198.08,Agreed.
2018.18-302,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1265.92,1280.24,"What about Mr. Brunetti's argument that the use of the word expresses a viewpoint precisely because of its offensiveness? You know, it's edgy, it expresses a non-conformist attitude, all of that?"
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1280.24,1339.28,"I -- I don't deny that that might be a reason that people would use profanity in certain circumstances, but I think if that were treated as a form of viewpoint discrimination, it would really cast doubt on a lot of other practices. For example, we've -- we've indicated in -- in our brief that, under Mr. Brunetti's theory, if the government had -- if -- if a municipal government operated buses and rented out advertising on the buses but precluded the use of profanity on the advertisements, if the use -- if -- an applicant could say, as Mr. Brunetti is saying, I want to use profanity because it communicates an edgy message, and I think the government legitimately should be able to say that may or may not be so, but we don't want profanity on our buses where they're visible to unconsenting adults and children, we don't want that word on our buses regardless of the message that you intend to convey. And we think that would be sufficient to make the -- the provision viewpoint-neutral."
2018.18-302,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1339.28,1344.08,"Well, you keep talking about this as a government program."
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1344.08,1344.84,Uh-huh.
2018.18-302,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1344.84,1357.92,"And Tam addresses this and says it's an odd government program because people are paying you to give the service; you're not giving them much of anything except legal rights, which are not unimportant."
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1392.32,1421.28,"I mean, I think -- I do think we don't regard it as a limited public forum because the registration program gives significant commercial benefits to registrants, but getting the mark on the PTO's principal or supplemental register is not the way in which Mr. Brunetti would want to communicate with his potential customers. The -- the way in which he would communicate with his potential customers is by advertisements, promotional materials, placing the goods on shelves --"
2018.18-302,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1421.28,1422.48,"Oh, but that's not true."
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1426.2,1427.04,It does and it --
2018.18-302,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1427.04,1431.64,And -- and it gives him the legal protections that come from that notice.
2018.18-302,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1442.76,1450.36,And we think essentially the same legal standard should apply to the restrictions at issue here as would apply to a limited public forum.
2018.18-302,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1534.36,1539.76,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Sommer."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,1539.76,1546.36,"Mr. -- Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There's two important points to be made."
2018.18-302,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1594.24,1611.08,"But there are books and scientists' reports and so forth, I don't know how -- I haven't seen them contested, that say take six or seven words, and today -- in the past, they might have been religious, but today they do include the word at issue and they do include racial slurs."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,1659.48,1664.52,"Well, if you're asking about the government association, the Tam Court dealt with that already."
2018.18-302,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1664.52,1665.04,I wasn't.
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,1666.12,1666.84,Okay.
2018.18-302,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1667.16,1672.68,"-- primarily about, there is a way of distinguishing these matters, I think."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,1672.68,1672.88,Well --
2018.18-302,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1672.88,1677.4,And I wouldn't ask you if I were certain of the answer.
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,1677.4,1687.32,"Well, if you're suggesting that there's a content-neutral way of deciding which marks are too scandalous to register by doing a test of -- the test on the body --"
2018.18-302,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1687.32,1689.48,"You don't have to do -- it's not too tough, you know."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,1697.08,1701.56,But that -- that avoids the issue about whether this is viewpoint.
2018.18-302,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1717.16,1727.28,"Well, suppose the statute didn't say what it said, but suppose the statute, in fact, said what Mr. Stewart says the PTO is going to do going forward."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,1744.56,1747.16,"Well, the first quest --"
2018.18-302,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1747.16,1748.84,Is that viewpoint-based?
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,1748.84,1756.96,"Yes, because, if you want to have a statute that prohibits profanity, obscenity, that would be constitutional."
2018.18-302,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1772.48,1802.68,"Well, our -- our standard for obscenity is so high, I can't believe that many trademarks would really qualify as -- as obscene, but I -- but let's say that the government has a real interest in preventing a certain kind of just profanity, vulgarity, nothing to do with the viewpoints of speakers but something to do with the way they express those viewpoints. I guess that that a little bit stacks the deck in terms of the question, but why -- why would that be viewpoint-based?"
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,1802.68,1819.88,"Well, if you're talking about the mode of expression argument, that is a misreading of Cohen, because Cohen could have said fooey on the draft, and that's what the government says he should have done, and if he said something else, he should have been arrested and his conviction should have been affirmed, but we know his conviction was reversed."
2018.18-302,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1822.56,1832.6,"Well, it's -- it's -- Cohen rejected it in that context, where somebody was being punished for -- for saying the words, but is it a little -- isn't it -- is it exactly the same here?"
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,1832.6,1833.48,I think so.
2018.18-302,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1833.48,1839.32,"That the government is not saying, you can't use this phrase, this word, you -- we just won't register it."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,1839.32,1851.08,"Well, there -- if you're -- if -- basically, the question seems to be is can we prohibit the seven dirty words. You know, if the government had a list of seven dirty words, would that be constitutional? And the answer is it would be not for two reasons."
2018.18-302,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1866.0,1866.84,"Oh, come on."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,1868.0,1868.64,"Well, I agree with --"
2018.18-302,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1868.64,1869.24,Be serious.
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,1871.24,1871.48,That's --
2018.18-302,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1871.48,1879.92,"So it's -- you have the seven dirty words and anything that -- you know, any clever way of trying to say it in a different way, using different letters."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,1879.92,1884.68,"But that's my point, because F-C-U-K is granted and F-V-C-K is granted --"
2018.18-302,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1884.68,1885.08,Okay.
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,1885.48,1886.2,-- and the only reason --
2018.18-302,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1886.2,1894.4,"-- it's been inconsistently applied, but let's say we're going forward and there's a list of words and you just can't use those."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,1894.4,1894.96,If Congress --
2018.18-302,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1894.96,1897.4,Your position is that would be unconstitutional?
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,1897.4,1898.16,I think so.
2018.18-302,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1902.96,1932.92,"Well, but you -- you -- your -- your -- your basic point -- and this is where I'm having a harder time, I think we're in a period where swear words -- and that's what they are, swear words -- where their content is changing so that younger people feel that these racial slurs are just as bad, if not worse. So suppose that you can pick that out. Sometimes it will be used to convey a message. I grant you that."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,1961.96,1965.68,"Of -- I'm sorry, I don't really know where to start."
2018.18-302,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1965.84,1968.92,I didn't think you necessarily would --
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,1968.92,1968.92,Yeah.
2018.18-302,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1968.92,1971.16,-- because there are several things mixed up there.
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,1971.16,1971.36,Yeah.
2018.18-302,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1971.36,1975.2,And I want in my mind this straightened out.
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,1975.2,1981.32,"Well, I -- I -- as I think you agree, that it's viewpoint, because I'm not looking at it from the viewpoint --"
2018.18-302,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1981.32,1982.64,"No, I don't agree with it's viewpoint."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2007.92,2018.4,"Well, Mr. Brunetti's viewpoint is, as already pointed out, I can be offensive, I don't have to obey the authority. And that's viewpoint."
2018.18-302,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2018.4,2021.28,"I don't want to distract you in that, but that's completely circular."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2034.88,2046.32,"Well, if we look -- we're doing -- have a facial challenge here, so the question is, is it overbroad? And it doesn't matter if Mr. Brunetti's mark should be granted or not."
2018.18-302,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2056.04,2057.48,Do -- that's a different argument.
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2111.76,2116.16,"Well, just granting federal registration doesn't require that anyone use a trademark."
2018.18-302,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2119.96,2161.88,"Well, I'm not sure that's an answer to Justice Breyer's question. Why isn't it a government benefit and why can't the people choose to withhold the benefit on the basis that there are certain words that are profane and that we, as a matter of civility in our culture, would like to see less of rather than more of, and you can use -- you're free to use them. Cohen can have his T-shirt, but we are not going to trademark them, and we've held just last year that a patent is a public benefit that can be withdrawn without a judge. Why isn't this also similarly a public benefit rather than a private right?"
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2161.88,2168.12,"Well, I would respond with 44 Liquormart, because the government doesn't have to grant the benefit."
2018.18-302,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2180.4,2198.04,"That's viewpoint. Why is it that the government can't say, as it does with every registration system, you can register your marriage, but we don't permit people to declare their love in their marriage license."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2226.4,2226.72,Well --
2018.18-302,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2226.72,2232.6,"And we don't want profane words, no matter how you use them."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2232.6,2233.36,"Well, I think there's two --"
2018.18-302,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2233.36,2250.4,"Whether it's pro or con, any idea, we don't want vulgar, profane, sexually explicit, or other words. Now we've got a separate problem with the lack of consistent application by the government."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2267.36,2269.76,"Well, I think you've explained why it's not a public forum."
2018.18-302,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2287.72,2289.04,"Actually, you're right."
2018.18-302,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2289.04,2291.44,"Maybe, but, I mean, the government's interests, you --"
2018.18-302,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2291.44,2293.4,I think they do.
2018.18-302,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2293.4,2298.12,"-- you say that, you know, this product's not going to be in Wal-Mart, right?"
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2298.12,2299.04,Correct.
2018.18-302,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2299.04,2302.4,But it is going to be on people walking down through the mall.
2018.18-302,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2317.36,2333.84,"-- but you -- but you -- you understand my point, is that the government's registration of it will facilitate its use in commerce, not necessarily as speech, but as a commercial product, and that has consequences beyond -- regardless of where the product is sold?"
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2333.84,2351.48,"Well, I think that's where the government has a -- a conundrum, because the government can -- has a -- assuming even if it's only intermediate scrutiny, doesn't have a compelling interest if it can't stop people from using it. And so people -- Mr. Brunetti can still use his mark regardless of whether it's registered or not."
2018.18-302,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2351.48,2355.92,"Yeah, I know, but the whole point is that the federal registration increases the exposure."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2375.48,2392.96,"Well, that gets back to why the statute was unconstitutional from the beginning, because the legislative intent shows that we -- the Congress recognized it couldn't prohibit use of vulgar marks, but its -- the legislative history says that, well, we can deny registration and that will prevent them from using it."
2018.18-302,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2392.96,2401.44,What -- what is your answer to Justice Breyer's comment that insult -- insulting someone is not a viewpoint?
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2401.44,2414.28,"Well, I would agree that all the traditional exceptions to the free speech, such as fighting words, is not expressing a viewpoint, but, as to insulting someone being viewpoint, you decided that unanimously in Tam."
2018.18-302,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2414.28,2435.8,"Tam was a word -- Tam, they were using a word that doesn't have -- for whatever reasons, it doesn't have this tremendous retentive power that would lead someone to try as quickly as possible to get his brand registered with that name in order to grab attention."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2455.96,2456.64,"Well, the trademark --"
2018.18-302,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2456.64,2458.0,-- but there may be something there.
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2460.04,2465.92,"Well, since Tam, the trademark office has taken the position that it cannot refuse any racial slur."
2018.18-302,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2473.44,2479.96,What about Mr. Stewart's comment about public buses' ad space that he says would not be able to be regulated if you were to prevail here?
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2479.96,2490.72,"Well, I guess sort of -- I hope this isn't too flippant, but you -- you have considered whether to grant cert on that question. But I don't think the profanity always expresses viewpoint."
2018.18-302,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2492.96,2494.56,When does it not?
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2494.56,2507.68,"Well, fleeting expletives and I think when it's used without any relevance to the subject matter, such as in high school speech, and, of course, there still can be --"
2018.18-302,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2507.68,2515.68,Some -- some of us would say that a vulgar word with relationship to selling clothes is sort of irrelevant?
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2515.68,2525.84,"Well, it's not irrelevant because, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, the audience that Mr. Brunetti is appealing to is young men who want to be rebels."
2018.18-302,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2526.68,2532.24,"Well, that may be the audience he's targeting, but that's not the only audience he reaches."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2532.24,2533.2,Agreed.
2018.18-302,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2533.2,2550.6,"Well, I mean, but that sort of gets to the government interest in whether or not it wants to be association -- associated with facilitating this type of vulgarity with -- which reaches -- and the whole -- I mean, I guess you would say the whole point is to reach beyond the targeted audience to offend people."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2550.6,2559.52,"Well, as under your jurisprudence, under the Court's jurisprudence, if this is strict scrutiny or even if it's content regulation, that's not a compelling government interest."
2018.18-302,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2569.6,2570.8,"Well, but everything -- the whole --"
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2570.8,2571.04,-- to the --
2018.18-302,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2571.04,2571.84,"I'm sorry, go ahead."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2571.84,2575.48,"To -- to, you know, the lowest common denominator, the most squeamish among us."
2018.18-302,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2575.48,2580.6,"Yeah, but the point -- this is a different type of program. The whole point of this program is to regulate content."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2591.48,2591.6,Well --
2018.18-302,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2591.6,2597.88,"The fact that it's -- it is -- I'll -- I'll concede, it's completely content-based, but it's the nature of the program."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2597.88,2603.84,"Well, it's not a program; it's a registration scheme, and it is not content-based on most grounds."
2018.18-302,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2611.28,2618.32,"You would agree that there are other content restrictions, wouldn't you? You know, the flag one or -- you know, there are a number, yes?"
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2618.32,2630.68,"Well, I think that 2(b), which deals with flag -- flags and symbols, and 2(c), with using people's names, could under certain circumstances raise constitutional issues."
2018.18-302,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2637.52,2640.64,You think likelihood of confusion is not content-based?
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2640.64,2641.12,I think --
2018.18-302,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2641.12,2645.16,How do you determine whether something is likely to confuse without looking at the content of it?
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2645.16,2666.88,"Well, I would say not only content-based, but I'd also say that that is the traditional exception of preventing confusion, because the whole point of refusing a new application is it's likely to be confused with the other one. But you're actually not -- it's almost like a secondary meaning case like City of Renton, because you're looking at applied mark A and registered mark B, and you're not looking at the content."
2018.18-302,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2670.92,2682.32,"With respect to words and letters, as opposed to images, is there any combination of words or letters that you think can be barred --"
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2682.32,2682.88,"Well, I think it only --"
2018.18-302,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2682.88,2685.04,-- under the scandalous/immoral provision?
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2685.04,2688.8,"Well, I think, constitutionally, only obscenity can be barred. And it would be --"
2018.18-302,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2688.8,2694.44,"And what -- what would you -- with respect to words and letters, how would you define obscenity in this context?"
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2694.44,2717.64,"Well, I would just use Miller versus California, because the government basically is arguing here we should ignore Miller versus California or modify it or create a new exception to the First Amendment for vulgar. So a picture I can see can be obscene. And I can see if you had a long sentence that said some things, which I don't need to give you an example, but you could imagine a sentence or two that could be prurient interest and --"
2018.18-302,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2717.64,2721.76,But that gets to the question of how do you draw a line between this and that.
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2721.76,2730.92,"Well, the Court has been satisfied with the obscenity standard since 1970 whatever for Miller versus California, and I think that's a good standard."
2018.18-302,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2732.6,2744.04,"But what do we do about the fact this is a -- a facial challenge, and so at least some of this material would presumably be okay even under your test for the -- for the trademark office to refuse?"
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2744.04,2748.04,Only -- I'm -- I'm contending that only obscenity could be refused properly.
2018.18-302,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2748.04,2756.72,"Well, but isn't -- in a facial challenge, your -- your obligation is to prove that the -- that the statute's unconstitutional in all of its application or almost all of it."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2756.72,2762.6,"Well, for vagueness, but for overbreadth, I believe it's only necessary to show that it covers a substantial amount of speech."
2018.18-302,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2762.6,2765.28,"Well, but a very substantial amount of speech."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2766.2,2774.16,"Well, that's why it's unconstitutional, because it covers religious speech -- I've given you an example of religious controversial marks that were refused."
2018.18-302,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2781.84,2788.84,"Well, but assuming profanity is borderline, right, and some of it might be okay for the -- for the government to regulate and some of it might not be."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2793.8,2817.04,"I believe so, because I have shown that there's a substantial amount of speech that is improperly refused under this provision. And the provision is so incredibly overbroad, because if it's taken at its word -- at its -- on its face, Steak 'n Shake can't be registered because some people believe you can't -- a substantial portion of Americans believe that eating beef is immoral."
2018.18-302,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2821.96,2825.44,"I'm not sure you answered my bus question, so I want to get it one more time."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2831.6,2834.36,"Definitely, because that is a public forum."
2018.18-302,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2840.48,2841.16,Public?
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2841.16,2842.4,Disruption.
2018.18-302,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2842.4,2844.2,Because people see a word and all of a sudden --
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2844.2,2845.56,And then there's --
2018.18-302,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2845.56,2846.84,-- can't handle themselves?
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2846.84,2847.72,And then there's --
2018.18-302,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2847.72,2849.52,I don't understand that.
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2849.52,2858.44,And there's also a case that involves where bus -- affirming standards for taking ads because the purpose of the bus program is revenue.
2018.18-302,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2861.36,2864.0,Can you explain the disruption point more?
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2864.0,2869.8,"Well, I'm not sure -- at least in the high school context, like Bethel School, I think that there is disruption."
2018.18-302,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2869.8,2871.72,"On a public -- on a public bus, how would this --"
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2871.72,2872.0,Okay.
2018.18-302,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2874.68,2874.76,Okay.
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2874.76,2876.16,-- hard to -- to draw a line there.
2018.18-302,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2884.84,2894.24,"Well, what about where -- if -- there may be words that are almost never used, actually, to express what the word literally means."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2923.4,2925.48,"Well, I think two -- two responses."
2018.18-302,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2931.2,2931.44,No.
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2940.0,2945.84,"Well, because of your decision in Tam, the -- the provision in the whole is invalid."
2018.18-302,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2948.88,2968.76,"So what exactly is the harm to the First Amendment speech interest here? I mean, this is, after all, simply not forbidding use of any word in any place, but you can't put a little R next to it. It doesn't stop you."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,2992.68,3013.96,"Because people who want to -- like Mr. Brunetti, who want to have a somewhat undefined viewpoint, or people with a more defined viewpoint, like in the cancer and the racism case, they have a viewpoint that they want to make. And as the Court already held in Tam, denial of registration -- if denial of registration in Tam is a sufficient burden to raise constitutional --"
2018.18-302,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3013.96,3014.96,I -- I understand your Tam.
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,3014.96,3015.44,Okay.
2018.18-302,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3015.44,3049.12,"That's why I wanted to get your articulation in best words, since the statute books of the federal government, as well as every state, are filled with prohibitions against saying all kinds of things in areas of commerce, securities, you name it. I mean, all kinds of things. So what I want your words for is to distinguish this case in terms of harm to First Amendment interests."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,3051.44,3052.28,I would say --
2018.18-302,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3052.28,3053.72,And I'm -- and I'm -- I'm not saying you don't have one.
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,3055.88,3062.08,I would say Brunetti cannot express his viewpoint --
2018.18-302,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3062.08,3062.2,Okay.
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,3062.2,3065.48,-- without an unconstitutional burden.
2018.18-302,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3065.48,3073.0,"See, I take it that the -- a correct spelling of the vulgar word at the heart of the case, that can't be trademarked, right?"
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,3073.0,3076.76,The -- the word -- bad word itself?
2018.18-302,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3076.76,3077.0,Yeah.
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,3077.0,3078.68,It could be.
2018.18-302,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3107.88,3110.8,"Right, but I guess I don't understand."
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,3112.04,3114.28,The trademark is on the neck label.
2018.18-302,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3170.32,3183.28,You're -- you're conceding to the Chief Justice that anyone who uses the words on goods to sell them can use any profane word and register it?
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,3183.28,3185.24,"Well, there's two questions there."
2018.18-302,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3206.92,3211.28,But the word that the Chief asked you about you say can be registered --
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,3211.28,3211.92,I believe it can be --
2018.18-302,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3211.92,3213.28,-- if it's on the neck?
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,3213.28,3214.24,"Yes, I believe so."
2018.18-302,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3214.24,3217.72,"I think I understand your difference, but --"
2018.18-302,1,63116,john_r_sommer,,3217.72,3218.88,All right.
2018.18-302,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3219.64,3223.44,"Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Stewart."
2018.18-302,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3223.44,3276.4,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to make one factual clarification and then three quick legal points. First, as to the PTO's current practice with respect to racial slurs, in general, the PTO views Tam as prohibiting a denial of registration for racial slurs, but, with respect to the single-most offensive racial slur, the PTO is currently holding in abeyance applications that incorporate that word, pending this Court's decision on -- leave open the possibility that that word might be viewed as scandalous. Second, with respect to Cohen, Cohen simply illustrates the difference between a prohibition on speech and on content-based restrictions on speech that are used to prohibit and content-based criteria for government benefits. The reason that the law in Cohen was held to be invalid was that it entirely prohibited the use of the word in a public space."
