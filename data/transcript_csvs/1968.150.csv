1968.150,0,39320,robert_n_grosby,,26.086,29.959,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.150,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,128.542,134.862,How is that work by look to the Connecticut statute and found some difficulty?
1968.150,0,39320,robert_n_grosby,,156.756,157.595,That's right sir.
1968.150,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,157.595,158.855,And then how they concur it?
1968.150,0,39320,robert_n_grosby,,158.855,170.761,"Except this way that at the time of sentencing, the applicable law was that the sentence on lascivious carriage could also be for three years to the reformatory."
1968.150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,192.32,195.159,I understand.
1968.150,0,39320,robert_n_grosby,,199.452,202.623,"And -- Well, not with respect to 17-379."
1968.150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,236.212,245.781,In cases of course as death with situation wherein the boys and girls can be convicted with same thing.
1968.150,0,39320,robert_n_grosby,,245.781,246.907,"Yes, sir."
1968.150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,246.907,249.949,Not so --
1968.150,0,39320,robert_n_grosby,,249.949,250.356,With respect --
1968.150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,250.356,255.768,You can get something proper than that that you can figure (Inaudible).
1968.150,0,39320,robert_n_grosby,,255.768,262.463,A man could be convicted of fornication or breach of the peach or disorderly conduct and be sentence to two years to reformatory.
1968.150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,262.463,269.271,-- to be raised the rational of these cases?
1968.150,0,39320,robert_n_grosby,,269.271,270.529,"No, sir."
1968.150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,270.529,281.226,Do you think that concurs in the books that direct (Inaudible) cases cited the -- or they not be in prison in two years?
1968.150,0,39320,robert_n_grosby,,281.226,281.57,"Yes, sir."
1968.150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,285.916,292.768,They have comfortable term in the same time --
1968.150,0,39320,robert_n_grosby,,292.768,296.385,"Yes, sir."
1968.150,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,320.771,324.585,"Is it clear what sentence, he is now serving?"
1968.150,0,39320,robert_n_grosby,,324.585,324.863,"Yes, sir."
1968.150,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,346.495,348.338,I have the impression she was at liberty now.
1968.150,0,39320,robert_n_grosby,,348.338,349.423,She's on parole.
1968.150,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,349.423,349.905,On parole?
1968.150,0,39320,robert_n_grosby,,349.905,359.127,"Yes, sir."
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,858.819,868.693,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.150,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,957.379,962.269,Why is that do have any importance to that -- is that bear on whether or not these are concurrent sentences?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,962.269,963.527,I don't think it does.
1968.150,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,972.138,972.306,Yes.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,972.306,989.959,"Now, on Section 53-279 which is the statute -- I'm sorry, 17-379 which is the statute that's under appeal here, 17-379 in which are contain the words “manifest danger fall into vise” -- habit to vise."
1968.150,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,992.761,993.061,Yes.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,993.061,1003.741,"-- in any unmarried female between 16 and 21, she'll be committed there until she's 21, but Section 17-360 which I think we can agree is the actual committing vehicle."
1968.150,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1003.741,1005.211,Limits it to a maximum?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1005.211,1006.831,Limits it to a maximum of three years.
1968.150,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1006.831,1006.999,Yes.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1006.999,1017.928,"So, you have a certain dilemma there and in our brief in appendix A, we set forth in Attorney General's opinion in which he said the numbers of the statutes were different then, but I don't think there's any quarrel about this."
1968.150,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1023.608,1025.782,Elapse ----
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1025.782,1035.656,Which ever is earlier and I set that forth in my brief as an opinion but it's but -- just by the Attorney General's opinion and I don't think there's any real quarrel about that.
1968.150,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1058.149,1059.335,In June of 1969?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1059.335,1059.742,"Yes, sir."
1968.150,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1059.742,1062.782,Under the falling into danger?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1062.782,1063.622,Under the falling into danger.
1968.150,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1063.622,1070.389,"And she is already free, do you agree with counsel that she is already free under the lascivious carriage?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1070.389,1071.365,"Oh, no Mr. Justice."
1968.150,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1071.365,1071.902,You don't?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1071.902,1088.103,And that's our main argument if I may that this conviction and sentence stand an independent state grounds; namely the conviction on lascivious carriage charge under 53-219.
1968.150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1139.937,1151.348,"Wasn't the rational of the Connecticut cases have set the -- inspite of the three-year provision that a women could only be held for two years, wasn't the rational equal protection?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1151.348,1152.293,It was.
1968.150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1152.293,1159.12,And that since men convicted for the same crime could only be held two years -- is it illegal to hold the woman three?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1159.12,1160.246,That's correct.
1968.150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1160.246,1164.259,And your argument is that there is no comparable crime here for the man?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1164.259,1167.233,And that's correct Mr. Justice and my argument is more than that.
1968.150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1217.124,1227.663,"I know but the claim is that under the Connecticut law no matter what the statute says, the woman can only be held two years."
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1227.663,1228.322,"Well, I claim --"
1968.150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1228.322,1230.363,Isn't this direct appeal?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1230.363,1231.429,This is a direct appeal.
1968.150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1231.429,1250.157,"Yes, and they're saying that under the applicable Connecticut law as revealed in these cases, this sentence on the lascivious carriage charges not three years, it's only two because the Connecticut Courts have construed sentences like this to be only two years because of the equal protection law."
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1250.157,1259.567,I take issue with that because of the fact that the highest court of Connecticut is not said so and the fact is that the only --
1968.150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1259.567,1268.264,"Well, he could certainly make the claim that he can certainly make the claim here which she has that this is a denial of equal protection."
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1268.264,1275.26,He can make the claim that it's a denial of equal protection but I can make the claim that this convictions stands on the independent state grounds.
1968.150,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1282.374,1285.775,"Well, what's your independent state ground that no appeal was ever taken --"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1285.775,1286.721,No appeal was ever taken --
1968.150,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1286.721,1290.95,"-- from the conviction, is that it, and the conviction on lascivious carriage?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1290.95,1292.076,"Yes, Your Honor and --"
1968.150,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1292.076,1297.393,"With no appeal was ever taken when the Connecticut Appellate Court come back conviction, is that your --"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1297.393,1299.575,I don't understand the question.
1968.150,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1299.575,1302.603,I'm trying to find out what you mean by independent state ground.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1311.932,1312.89,I said it.
1968.150,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1313.908,1334.314,"Yes, but and therefore, I gather your point is that whatever maybe the case as to two years and three years, this petitioner at least, appellant whatever, is concluded by the failure to appeal by the three-year sentence that was given, is that right?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1334.314,1334.755,That's right.
1968.150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1349.773,1360.18,I -- all you're saying is that the cases at the petitioner relies on just didn't have to be decided under this particular section?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1360.18,1360.47,And they --
1968.150,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1360.47,1361.835,"Now, you're saying more than that, aren't you?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1361.835,1362.614,"Well, I think yes --"
1968.150,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1362.614,1364.159,Two or three things more than that?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1364.159,1365.165,I'm saying more than that.
1968.150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1365.165,1367.848,"Why -- well, isn't this a direct appeal?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1367.848,1373.105,This is a direct appeal from the denial of the demur.
1968.150,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1373.105,1373.764,But you say not --
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1373.764,1375.321,On 53 -- excuse me.
1968.150,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1375.321,1384.69,"Well, if I understand you now what you have been saying is that there's never been an appeal from the conviction for lascivious carriage which carried with it the three-year sentence, if it's properly called a sentence."
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1396.959,1398.371,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.150,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1406.73,1408.287,Mr. Carroll.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1408.287,1408.455,"Yes, sir."
1968.150,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1408.455,1431.941,"On the statute that she was convicted on and I understand from your brief at page 13, am I correct that you take the position that vise and habits of vise are no more or no less on ambiguous in the word “obscene”, is that position you take?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1431.941,1438.049,"I think that there are at least, that the word “vise” is at least this clear in common language --"
1968.150,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1438.049,1441.031,But no more so than obscene?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1441.031,1443.845,That's a hard thing to answer Mr. Justice as a matter of degree.
1968.150,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1443.905,1444.384,I just want to --
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1444.384,1450.253,I think vise is prefers more clear.
1968.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1547.131,1551.702,There's been proper in this situation to bring the record here?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1551.702,1553.587,It wasn't made a part of the record.
1968.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1558.179,1563.808,"No, would've there been proper for counsel to put that in the appendix?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1563.808,1563.928,The Court --
1968.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1563.928,1567.084,-- or not under the appellate procedure?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1567.084,1573.838,"Are not the way the appeal was taken, no because it was just an appeal from the overruling of the demur."
1968.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1573.838,1579.946,"Yes, that you don't question whether it should've been here or not?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1579.946,1602.979,"Oh, well, yes I do because under our practice in the case that I've cited in my brief called State versus Sol is that you cannot -- the overrule by a demur to the constitutionality of the statute then proceed to a full trial and be convicted and then appeal the overruling of the demur without any evidence before the Appellate Court."
1968.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1639.362,1642.835,The overruling of the demur or the -- comes to conviction?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1642.835,1645.71,The overruling the demur.
1968.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1645.71,1659.933,And what you said that is the practice if you appeal with the overruling of the demur but there been a substantive trial after the overruling the demur that the Appellate Court must have the trial before it?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1659.933,1663.813,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1663.813,1674.472,"Well, what I'm interested in, do you question whether the appeal is properly before us in this posture?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1674.472,1676.795,"Yes, I do because --"
1968.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1676.795,1678.418,Do you argue that in your brief?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1678.418,1702.191,"Yes, I don't know if I argue just in the terms that Chief Justice means but I argue with in terms of the state -- this Court being unable to pass upon the statute without having before it the facts that were brought out at the trial and were the basis of her conviction under it."
1968.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1702.778,1706.479,That's the additional independent state ground isn't it?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1706.479,1712.342,"Yes, it is but I think Mr. Chief Justice's point that I have made a procedural argument on that."
1968.150,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1718.869,1726.055,"Yes, but you said the Court of Appeals I gather that -- Connecticut nevertheless -- the statute?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1726.055,1726.402,It did involve --
1968.150,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1726.402,1729.815,-- involve or was not part as a practice of argument.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1733.588,1735.073,"Yes, and that -- the leading --"
1968.150,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1735.073,1740.227,"But why would he not, when he able also to do what your advice of?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1740.227,1753.534,"I'm sorry, I'd certainly wouldn't deny you that prerogative -- I would say though, and that's why I think I cast this more in terms the practical difficulty of applying a statute to a set of facts that are non-existing."
1968.150,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1791.244,1793.87,May I ask you for a quick moment.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1816.945,1818.989,Six months maximum.
1968.150,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1818.989,1844.22,"Now, what happen here is that this moment being under 21, 16 or 17 was convicted of that same crime of lascivious carriage, and your position is that the effective sentence was three years because of the order committing her to the State Farm for women, is that right?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1844.22,1845.674,"Yes, sir."
1968.150,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1845.674,1859.784,"But so far as the conviction of the crime of lascivious carriage is concern, the sentence provided by Section 53 whenever it is, is six months, is that right?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1859.784,1860.821,"Yes, sir."
1968.150,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1860.821,1876.344,"And the three-year hypothesis depends solely upon what is it, Section 17-360?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1876.344,1877.256,"Yes, sir."
1968.150,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1877.256,1899.567,"And Section 17-360 makes no reference to the crime of lascivious carriage, but provides only as I understand it that the maximum commitment to the State Farm for Women shall be three years, is that right?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1912.565,1915.371,I'm relying on 17-360 but the different part of it.
1968.150,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1915.371,1917.527,Please tell me what part of it.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1917.527,1933.395,"Persons who maybe committed to this institution, persons who plead guilty to the commission of felonies which this is not, second persons convicted of or who plead guilty to the commission of misdemeanors including prostitution, intoxication, drug using and disorderly conduct."
1968.150,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1933.395,1935.516,But not lascivious carriage?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1935.516,1941.864,"No, but that's -- I will take that to mean including, but not eliminating or not being exclusive."
1968.150,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1941.864,1944.564,You mean the listing is not exclusive?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1944.564,1945.211,"Yes, sir."
1968.150,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1945.211,1946.097,"All right, go ahead."
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,1950.143,1951.062,Yes.
1968.150,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1974.449,2004.276,"Well, all right now, tell me in summary if you don't mind just how -- just on what theory keeping those statutory sections in mind you contend that appellant here is serving a three-year sentence as a result of her conviction of the crime of lascivious carriage?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2004.276,2006.539,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.150,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2105.221,2109.633,17-360 says she has to stay there for three years?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2109.633,2110.446,"Well, no."
1968.150,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2145.327,2149.686,This is an extraordinary Chinese puzzle isn't it?
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2149.686,2151.363,Where is the charge?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2151.363,2152.728,It's a little -- pardon me Your Honor?
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2152.728,2159.016,Where is the charge granted in the record indictment or the information or whatever it is?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2159.016,2178.645,"There's an information in the substitute information in the record and the information that's applicable is on page -- well, its right after page 4 and it's called the substitute information."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2178.645,2193.364,"Now, do you read this as making it the crime for girl to be at manifest danger or contract to the habits of vise?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2193.364,2197.244,"That's what falling into habits of vise, yes sir."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2197.244,2201.496,"Well, how do you prove that by the environment or context?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2211.484,2213.34,"It's a danger, yes."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2214.179,2216.981,"She contain, you convict her being in danger?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2216.981,2218.478,"Yes, sir."
1968.150,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2218.478,2220.634,"Well, you have a course of conduct?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2220.634,2225.544,"There's a course of conduct and if the conduct were before the Court, it would be clear that there's more than a danger."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2225.544,2228.957,But would it be clear that's not what the statute say.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2228.957,2229.197,No.
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2229.975,2231.173,Manifest danger?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2231.173,2232.011,"Yes, sir."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2232.011,2238.598,Has the Court ever construed it of being a crime to be in manifest danger to your Supreme Court?
1968.150,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2238.598,2240.275,No.
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2240.275,2241.94,Has it ever construed it at all?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2241.94,2243.126,"No, sir."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2243.126,2245.27,Is there have been in the case to sustain?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2245.27,2248.252,"I -- I don't think there's been a case that's all applicable, no."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2248.252,2252.204,But it's the only case it's ever been in state since its Title of 95?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2252.204,2252.923,"Oh, no."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2259.977,2262.24,How do you know there's been a conviction?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2262.24,2276.12,"I know there's been a convictions because I have been prosecuting for long time and I know that other prosecutors in fact in their brief, they -- the appellant sets forth the use of the statute by prosecutors in the State of Connecticut."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2276.12,2280.132,"But this is not for conduct, this is of being in danger."
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2280.132,2285.841,"Well, I'm saying Your Honor that the case that I'm referring to are all for conduct, although I have to agree with you."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2288.584,2289.889,That's the charge here.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2289.889,2291.135,"Yes, sir."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2291.135,2297.231,And we have to consider it on the basis of whether that's a good statute can do on it.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2297.231,2297.578,"Well, I wouldn't --"
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2297.578,2302.689,And convict somebody of a crime -- do you call it a crime to be in danger?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2302.689,2309.683,"I wouldn't defend the statute at all, Your Honor, if I didn't believe that to mean a criminal."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2314.533,2323.575,"Criminal is a crime then you placed somewhere where you are in danger, do you kept it to do something wrong?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2323.575,2326.39,"Well, I suppose there are degrees of vise Your Honor."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2333.324,2343.743,"But they don't fix in the punishment like penalty or fine or imprisonment, they just put them in jail like put a child -- the parent will put it in the back room."
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2343.743,2344.342,"Oh, well, there's a maximum --"
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2344.342,2350.749,-- or finally take care and see that she'd not have any danger -- being in a danger there after.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2350.749,2355.001,"Well, I don't think we can avoid the penal nature of this."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2357.085,2357.552,I know.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2371.432,2376.283,"Well, she's out of there now anyhow, but the fact --"
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2376.283,2378.885,And why do we have to pass on it is she's out of the --
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2378.885,2383.304,"Well, their point is that she's on parole and the parole continues until --"
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2383.304,2385.699,Do you agree that she's on parole?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2385.699,2387.316,"Yes, she's on parole I think it --"
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2387.316,2389.172,"Then, it's not a moot of course."
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2389.172,2390.969,"I don't claim it's moot, no, but I claim --"
1968.150,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2390.969,2397.005,But you do claim she's on parole on a concurrent sentence which has not in no way been attack.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2397.005,2402.801,"-- I don't think that's technically mootness, but we certainly raise that argument very strongly."
1968.150,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2402.801,2403.939,Yes.
1968.150,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2403.939,2407.053,"Well, we have before us as I understand the two problems."
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2477.578,2483.494,That is correct analysis but I don't think that the sentencing provisions are really not much of the Chinese puzzle.
1968.150,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2531.483,2543.866,I suppose you have in Connecticut specific criminal statutes and ordinances making illegal that sort of criminal conduct --
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2543.866,2544.345,That's correct.
1968.150,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2544.345,2553.507,"The sort hard core conduct that everybody seems to be agreed here is covered by this is also covered by specific criminal statutes, is it not?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2553.507,2559.303,"I think most of the cases that have come up under this would be covered by specific criminal conduct, yes sir."
1968.150,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2592.142,2598.896,What's a juvenile statute -- what's the upper limit on the age for juvenile court proceedings in Connecticut?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2598.896,2606.681,"16 Your Honor, except that between 16 and 18, the adult court can refer them if they think they are amenable to juvenile court jurisdiction."
1968.150,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2606.681,2616.07,So that -- but would this young woman had been -- would the juvenile court of the naval day excise jurisdiction over this young woman?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2616.07,2620.921,Not unless she was referred by the Court that heard this case prior to the Court hearing.
1968.150,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2620.921,2629.652,So that court could have refer her and then she could've been taking care of under the juvenile court statute until she was 21?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2629.652,2634.969,"Yes, that court could have it, but the court had background of reasons why it didn't."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2634.969,2643.951,Do you know whether there have been any convictions to charge with danger of becoming a cigarette smoker?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2643.951,2645.329,"No, Your Honor."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2645.329,2646.814,You mentioned that.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2646.814,2648.119,"Yes, I mentioned that as vise perhaps --"
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2648.119,2649.377,A form of vise.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2649.377,2649.964,"Yes, sir."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2649.964,2653.425,And I presume a lot of people could agree with you.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2653.425,2653.844,But I don't --
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2653.844,2660.491,That's being a form of vise from which a person should be protected.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2660.491,2662.874,"Well, presently isn't --"
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2662.874,2663.473,What?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2663.473,2683.353,"A person presently is not protected from that particular vise by legislation, and this particular kind of vise that we're talking about here we maintain, does protect society and a young lady such as this one by criminal sanctions or queasy criminal sanctions."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2683.353,2696.228,But what I won't getting it is why quite certain cigarettes smoking -- we consider the vise under here for which the person will be sentence when danger becoming a cigarette smoker?
1968.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2696.228,2704.18,"Correction, that's a question."
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2704.18,2705.917,I try to think of the answer Judge.
1968.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2705.917,2708.18,"Oh, I see."
1968.150,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2708.18,2708.779,Mr. Carroll --
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2708.779,2714.109,"I didn't realize that, may I -- excuse me Mr. Justice."
1968.150,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2714.109,2716.732,"Mr. Carroll, -- oh, excuse Chief."
1968.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2716.732,2718.636,He's going to answer Justice Black's question.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2718.636,2722.289,I'm still trying to come up with something to answer that.
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2726.349,2727.774,Has it been in the statute?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2727.774,2729.092,A statute could be pass.
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2730.098,2732.9,I'm not -- pass -- how about this statute.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2732.9,2733.739,Under this statute?
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2733.739,2734.206,Yes.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2734.206,2741.571,"No, because I think that the other words of the statute make it clear that this is criminal vise and habits of vise."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2741.571,2747.739,But which other words in the statute say that couldn't be -- vise.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2747.739,2756.35,"When read in context, it says that to me and I point that out --"
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2756.35,2757.775,I don't see why it couldn't.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2757.775,2760.29,"Well, here's what I said in that respect."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2772.326,2775.26,But that's a separate thought.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2775.26,2775.859,It's a --
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2775.859,2777.643,Or who has committed any crime.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2777.643,2778.781,"Or you know -- yes, sir."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2778.781,2786.087,For the first time of course is being subjected to temptation of falling in the vise such as cigarette smoking.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2786.087,2787.871,"Well, it's a matter of interpretation."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2794.937,2797.964,But the word “vise” is not limited criminal --
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2797.964,2808.122,"Your Honor, it certainly isn't and it applies into much more in aqueous things in cigarette smoking."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2813.069,2817.68,"Well, it will be bad to be charge of being attempted that way, wouldn't it?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2817.68,2821.333,Certainly would but I think that that the only fair construction --
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2821.333,2826.89,"As a matter of fact, you realize or into the vise of having a definite meaning."
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2831.01,2834.351,"Well, I made it clear that it has a very broad meaning, but I also would like --"
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2834.351,2835.968,For you here?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2835.968,2836.327,For everyone?
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2836.327,2836.986,Yes.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2836.986,2844.291,"Broad, broad, but I also like to make it clear that I think the only fair construction of this statute is that its criminal vise it's being --"
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2844.291,2847.585,Why couldn't they write one that's limited to that?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2857.992,2867.813,"Well, if the Court had before the conduct of the person, it could judge couldn't it whether or not that was the type of vise he could constitutionally be proscribed?"
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2867.813,2869.717,"Well, I don't know."
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2869.717,2871.154,I don't mean to ask you the question --
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2871.154,2877.777,"Yes, the sky is the limit under this statute."
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2877.777,2892.088,"Well, I think the statute -- you'd start with the assumption, Your Honor, that the statute should be construe so that if reasonably possible, its constitutionality should be upheld and I don't think that's very difficult with this type of statute."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2892.088,2894.424,But could we do that here?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2894.424,2897.945,"Well, I don't think you should get to that Your Honor."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2899.071,2900.736,"No, we have to get to it."
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2903.538,2904.005,But I think --
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2904.005,2906.999,Unconstitutional vague and --
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2906.999,2907.478,"Yes, sir."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2912.328,2914.846,"Well, what independent state then?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2914.846,2917.002,The conviction under the other statute.
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2917.002,2919.864,"Well, do you mean there's another -- that's the one you were talking to Justice Fortas?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2919.864,2921.721,"Yes, sir."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2921.721,2925.002,That's pretty long way in this.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2925.002,2925.961,That other statute?
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2925.961,2929.003,Yes.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2929.003,2930.608,It's a long way from it sir?
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2930.608,2931.406,Isn't it?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2931.406,2932.604,"No, it's a lot like it."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2932.604,2933.323,It's what?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2933.323,2937.682,"It's a lot like it, its lascivious carriage its call."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2937.682,2939.0,"Oh, it's called what?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2939.0,2941.144,Lascivious carriage.
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2941.144,2941.91,Carriage?
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2941.91,2946.401,"Carriage, demeanor, comportment."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2946.401,2954.485,"What is it against the law, is it a crime to have a lascivious carriage?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2954.485,2959.455,It's a claim to -- the carriage in the sense of --
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2959.455,2960.234,"Excuse me, pardon me?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2960.234,2963.597,-- of comportment or demeanor.
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2963.994,2966.509,"Demeanor, walking for --"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2966.509,2970.342,"Well, it would have to conduct."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2970.342,2971.947,"Well, that's a conduct."
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2971.947,2979.6,Walking is -- lascivious lewd want them type of conduct is what is meant.
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2979.6,2985.875,"Of course, there's somebody want lascivious?"
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2987.971,2996.414,"No, I'm thinking about that in terms of the question, but that statute is under --"
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2996.414,2999.169,But many of them subject to conviction by them --
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,2999.169,3005.085,"There might well be, but that statute is not being attacked here."
1968.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3005.085,3007.001,"Well, this has nothing to do with it."
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,3007.001,3020.115,It does only insofar as it's the sentence arising from it provides an independent state ground for the validity of this conviction in sentence in the other one.
1968.150,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3020.115,3028.379,The only point I have Mr. Carroll was that there are no decisions in Connecticut interpreting the statute.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,3028.379,3028.666,"No, sir."
1968.150,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3029.325,3042.918,"So that in fact, it's up to the trial judge who happens to try the case to decide whether this in vise or not or whether time of the statute or not without any guidelines at all."
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,3042.918,3046.978,"Except that the statute provides, yes sir."
1968.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3046.978,3047.804,Very well.
1968.150,1,25161,george_f_carroll_jr,,3047.804,3050.319,Thank you.
1968.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3050.319,3051.397,Mr. Grosby.
1968.150,2,39320,robert_n_grosby,,3051.397,3055.589,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1968.150,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3103.829,3106.631,"What page is that in the appendix, what page?"
1968.150,2,39320,robert_n_grosby,,3106.631,3108.248,Appendix to our brief.
1968.150,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3116.092,3117.051,How many?
1968.150,2,39320,robert_n_grosby,,3117.051,3119.314,560.
1968.150,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3136.579,3183.91,"What about parole to the sole case, I notice that the opinion of your appellate division sets up and I'm reading -- I'm looking now at pages 14 and 15 of the brown appendix; sets out the rules of the sole case at some length, and says on page 15 the rule stated in the sole case with I think it is precision and particularity were ignored by the appellant in case before us, then goes on to say but we do not rest our decision on that ground alone which would imply to me that the decision is rested alternatively on that ground and that would be inadequate state ground, would it not?"
1968.150,2,39320,robert_n_grosby,,3183.91,3184.377,"No, sir."
1968.150,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3189.653,3194.743,"Well, but that's a matter of Connecticut law whether or not was an error, isn't it?"
1968.150,2,39320,robert_n_grosby,,3194.743,3195.629,"Yes, sir."
1968.150,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3195.629,3196.947,It's not a matter for us?
1968.150,2,39320,robert_n_grosby,,3196.947,3202.264,That's right.
1968.150,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3212.684,3220.456,"Before you get that subject, may I ask you what is the character of this institution that this young woman went to."
1968.150,2,39320,robert_n_grosby,,3228.959,3230.456,It's for women of all ages.
1968.150,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3230.456,3231.654,And of all kinds of crime?
1968.150,2,39320,robert_n_grosby,,3231.654,3232.732,But there is segregation.
1968.150,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3241.522,3243.618,But it is a criminal institution?
1968.150,2,39320,robert_n_grosby,,3243.618,3245.638,"Yes, sir."
1968.150,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3245.638,3261.087,"Appendix B of the appellee's brief seems to set out the legislative history behind the creation of this institution, is it that 1917?"
1968.150,2,39320,robert_n_grosby,,3261.087,3262.405,"Yes, sir."
1968.150,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3262.405,3267.183,As a progressive in light of advance and penology in Connecticut?
1968.150,2,39320,robert_n_grosby,,3267.183,3270.297,"Yes, sir."
1968.150,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3270.297,3281.974,"In practice, is this statute use as a method of convicting women of prostitution?"
1968.150,2,39320,robert_n_grosby,,3281.974,3282.86,I think not.
1968.150,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3288.728,3289.926,That is a crime?
1968.150,2,39320,robert_n_grosby,,3289.926,3293.519,"Yes, sir."
1968.150,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3295.363,3304.705,"Well, what sort of people are caught up under this statute then if they are not prostitutes?"
1968.150,2,39320,robert_n_grosby,,3304.705,3321.04,"Young girls who have been found in parked cars with the young men, young girls who run away from home, those are the situations I dealt with, I've had about four of them and Mr. Harbro has had about four or five of them; one presently on appeal before the Connecticut Supreme Court."
1968.150,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3321.04,3328.945,"Well, most jurisdictions, those are handled by -- under the juvenile court procedures?"
1968.150,2,39320,robert_n_grosby,,3328.945,3330.191,That's true sir.
1968.150,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3330.191,3347.484,"But here, they -- is it customary or unusual for the Adult Courts to refer cases like this under the age of 18 or whatever it is to the juvenile court?"
1968.150,2,39320,robert_n_grosby,,3347.484,3367.305,I think they we've shown in our appendix that only 47 of the 560 or 8.4% are referred juvenile court in the period from 1961 to 1967.
1968.150,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3472.497,3473.635,You mean on apparent sentence?
1968.150,2,39320,robert_n_grosby,,3473.635,3478.186,"Yes, sir."
1968.150,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3478.366,3728.794,Very well.
