1965.396,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,33.15,"Number 396, Hugo DeGregory, Appellant, versus Attorney General of the State of New Hampshire."
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,34.9,38.323,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,361.118,368.373,"The -- those quotations you read by the duty of this Court to balance, is that right?"
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,370.184,370.682,Yes.
1965.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,393.574,397.169,"But the individual has rights under the Constitution he hasn't, doesn't he --"
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,397.169,408.27,"Well, there is the view -- there is the view Mr. Justice that the First Amendment is exactly what it says and cannot be limited but that is not then the majority view of this Court."
1965.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,423.215,425.007,I didn't know that the Court had ever held that.
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,428.801,430.327,"Well, maybe limited."
1965.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,430.878,434.998,"If you have a right under the Constitution, it can't be infringed at all, isn't that right?"
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,434.998,437.889,I think I get what Your Honor is driving at.
1965.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,781.472,784.511,Do we have the full report?
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,784.511,788.632,You have the full report in the files of the Uphaus case.
1965.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,789.137,791.268,That's what we had before us in Uphaus.
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,791.268,792.234,I beg your pardon?
1965.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,792.234,794.746,It seems to me I remember reading a very big thing.
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,794.746,795.853,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1965.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,804.479,805.459,(Voice Overlap) about the section.
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,805.459,811.937,It was that below any bigger.
1965.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,829.601,831.327,"Now, how old was that at the time of the --"
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,831.327,843.692,"That report was dated January 4, 1955 and its content referred chiefly to earlier years going back to the 1930s and in no case running beyond 1954."
1965.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,843.692,847.585,And what was the date of the inquiry in court not before the Attorney General in this Court.
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,847.585,853.303,The date of the inquiry of this inquiry in the court was May of 1964.
1965.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,853.303,855.776,That's about nine years.
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,855.776,862.154,"Over nine years, over nine years after the information in the report."
1965.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,862.154,873.987,"Are you arguing any significance to your case and our decisions last -- it was last term, wasn't it, in the respondent case?"
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,873.987,881.477,I have cited Your Honor the American Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born and the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade cases in my brief.
1965.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,881.477,883.471,Well -- are you arguing staleness here.
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,883.471,884.32,I am Your Honor.
1965.396,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,980.439,984.098,Was it '46 in -- when he was in Massachusetts?
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,984.098,984.86,In Massachusetts.
1965.396,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,984.86,987.61,In '46 and more or less '47.
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,987.61,995.162,And he was alleged who have been a paid functionary in applying '47 and '48 in Massachusetts not in New Hampshire.
1965.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,995.162,998.309,"Now, you say -- when you say alleged you mean that there's a larger report --"
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,998.309,1002.401,"It was contained in the Attorney General's report, yes."
1965.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1002.401,1006.958,"In other words, those are -- are they finding based on some inquiry of the Attorney General?"
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,1006.958,1008.918,"Presumably, yes."
1965.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1008.918,1011.713,Are they findings based on the evidence of DeGregory?
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,1011.713,1012.392,No.
1965.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1012.392,1015.848,On any evidence of anyone who knew DeGregory.
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,1015.848,1017.492,That I don't know Your Honor.
1965.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1036.548,1043.777,"Well and then, in other words, there were some -- it's been said that DeGregory was a functionary of the Communist Party."
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,1043.777,1043.805,"Yes, sir."
1965.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1043.805,1047.599,"It's not at all clear and I suppose that was the basis for these questions, wasn't it?"
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,1047.599,1048.936,"Yes, but when?"
1965.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1053.027,1059.231,"That's where the questions were directed at, to finding out when at all, isn't that correct?"
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,1059.231,1092.186,"Well, in answer to your question, it does come out on page 19 of the transcript of the record, statement of Mr. Gall near the top of the page in which inquiry was made by me as to what period he was inquiring about and he replied or has stated to the Court, Your Honor, based on the information that is in the report covering that period of years which is any period during the period that is reflected in the report."
1965.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1106.454,1111.35,"I thought the question was or the following questions was, “Were you ever or have you ever?”"
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,1111.35,1112.755,"Yes, and --"
1965.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1112.755,1120.486,"Well, that's pretty clear if you -- it's just an ordinary meaning of English words that doesn't say 1954 or previously, that says ever."
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,1120.486,1142.865,That is correct and DeGregory have already testified as to the previous six and a half years and questioned the constitutional authority of the Attorney General to go into the period before unless he had some current activities which would permit him as ancillary to those current activities to go into activities that long ago passed.
1965.396,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1142.865,1149.389,Is there a period of limitations in the Subversive Activities Act?
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,1149.389,1157.384,It is the general New Hampshire's statute of limitations which is six years.
1965.396,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1237.433,1244.697,"Would you read that statement again please, the one you just mentioned?"
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,1244.697,1251.527,There are also presently residents of New Hampshire who are many of the individuals discussed in said report.
1965.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1251.527,1258.497,"I gather that record, that reference then is to the big red report, is that it?"
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,1258.497,1262.363,The record reference is obviously to the big red report of 1955.
1965.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1262.363,1263.366,Not to this record.
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,1263.366,1269.52,There's nothing in this record to show that there are individuals discussed in that report except for appellant.
1965.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1274.636,1282.338,"Was there people who are going to be permitted to absolutely refuse to answer any questions?I suppose you're not going to have very much in any record about anything, are you?"
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,1282.338,1282.642,But I --
1965.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1282.642,1285.617,Except if I refuse to answer.
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,1285.617,1289.927,I point out Your Honor that that was not the appellant's position.
1965.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1318.932,1325.667,What were -- are the questions of -- which are the subject of this contempt commitment here in the record somewhere?
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,1325.667,1336.967,"Yes, they are."
1965.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1380.695,1392.483,A question like when did you join the Communist Party like that you have answer is either to give a date or else I never did join them.
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,1392.483,1393.246,Well --
1965.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1393.246,1397.35,That's not a matter of when because only the witness knows when.
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,1397.35,1410.626,"Alright, but it has been made clear by the Attorney General's own statement that he was investigating the period of 19 -- early 1950s and back rather from the present."
1965.396,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1466.752,1475.365,"Did the appellant answer all of those questions as to the present or current time, all the questions on page 31?"
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,1475.365,1481.838,It is my belief Mr. Justice that this one statement covers every one of those questions.
1965.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1485.653,1487.366,"Now, where is that statement in your brief?"
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,1487.366,1491.111,"Well, I read it -- I read the statement earlier to Your Honor."
1965.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1498.566,1500.248,"Page 3 of your brief, I think."
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,1500.248,1502.173,Page 30 of my brief.
1965.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1507.243,1511.218,"Page 3 of your brief, is it, the statement of the case?"
1965.396,0,28432,howard_s_whiteside,,1511.218,1516.401,"Yes, as you say, page 3 of my brief."
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,1750.531,1757.326,"Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1778.683,1783.188,This complicate the constitutionality as applied to the facts of this case was certainly raisable.
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,1783.188,1783.828,"Yes, that's correct."
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1783.828,1784.123,Is it?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,1784.123,1784.967,That is the only issue --
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1784.967,1790.275,"You're not suggesting that the issues which have been argued by your brother are not before us, are you?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,1790.275,1790.618,No.
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1790.618,1790.884,"No, alright."
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2064.73,2070.208,"If you had all these information, why do you need to ask him about it?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2070.208,2071.205,This is in the past.
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2076.079,2092.587,"He has told you -- he told you in the statement appearing on page 3 of your adversary's brief of the situation as to the present and the immediate past and you have the information about the more remote past, so why do you need to ask him any question?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2092.587,2097.981,"We felt at that time, Your Honor, that he did have information."
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2122.853,2140.055,"You could -- he made the statement as to his present status vis-à-vis the Communist Party that is the absence of any relationship and also, the same situation for the last six and a half years and that you could have cross-examined him about that I suppose, couldn't you?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2140.055,2140.364,"Yes, we could have."
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2140.364,2141.426,"And you didn't, did you?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2141.426,2143.144,"No, we didn't."
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2143.144,2153.659,"And you are now telling us you have the other information about the more remote past and that the question appears to me is to why it was necessary to interrogate him, (Voice Overlap)."
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2153.659,2165.687,We have the broad brushstroke of the past but one of the violations of our law that is only set up in there is destroying any records which belong to the Communist Party.
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2165.687,2168.104,Did you ask him if he had done that?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2168.104,2171.446,"No, that was not asked at that time."
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2171.446,2172.17,So?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2172.17,2177.059,We were more or less precluded by the Court at that time.
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2177.059,2182.882,"Of course, if that's a crime, I suppose he could refuse to answer that on the basis of self-incrimination."
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2182.882,2184.56,"Well, then it's the immunity provision --"
1965.396,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2184.56,2187.951,"But he made -- he made no claim of self-incrimination, did he?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2187.951,2188.123,"No, that question --"
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2188.123,2189.724,That question wasn't asked to him.
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2189.724,2193.257,He was asked if he wish to take the --
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2193.257,2193.581,Immunity.
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2193.581,2196.874,-- immunity provision and he declined to with reference to each question.
1965.396,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2196.874,2209.155,"After -- after the first DeGregory case, did Mr. DeGregory purge himself of the civil contempt?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2209.155,2210.169,"Yes, he did."
1965.396,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2210.253,2214.581,"Now, what was the formal proceeding in which he purged himself?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2214.581,2215.484,"Yes, we went back to the Superior Court."
1965.396,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2215.484,2217.654,And did you ask him some questions?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2217.654,2219.544,We attempted to ask him more questions.
1965.396,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2223.28,2224.959,What justice?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2224.959,2227.13,"Justice of the Superior Court, Justice Marshall."
1965.396,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2227.13,2236.271,"So that you asked him whatever questions were considered pertinent to that particular investigation, is that right?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2236.271,2238.206,"Well, if I might explain it."
1965.396,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2238.206,2240.424,I wish you would.
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2240.424,2243.434,We went to the Superior Court at that time.
1965.396,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2267.719,2271.256,"Well, did you go back administratively and ask questions?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2271.256,2272.218,"Yes, we did."
1965.396,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2272.218,2275.635,Immediately?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2275.635,2276.951,Within two days.
1965.396,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2276.951,2277.95,Within two days.
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2280.335,2280.753,Yes.
1965.396,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2280.753,2282.182,And what happened?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2282.182,2282.971,We're here today.
1965.396,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2284.021,2285.297,Is that this same case?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2285.297,2287.73,"Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1965.396,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2296.315,2300.973,Why do you use the word cross-examine?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2300.973,2305.236,"I use it, I think, because my brother mentioned -- used the term cross-examination."
1965.396,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2305.236,2308.521,"Well, was this a cross-examination?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2308.521,2309.937,Not technically so.
1965.396,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2310.293,2312.672,It wasn't a cross-examination.
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2312.672,2313.346,I used that word.
1965.396,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2316.344,2316.537,He used it --
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2316.537,2317.208,I think I did.
1965.396,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2317.208,2321.324,He used it several times before that and I was going to ask you what --
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2321.324,2321.753,I would call it.
1965.396,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2321.753,2323.729,-- what do you mean by cross-examination.
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2323.729,2326.849,"Well, we asked a certain amount of -- a few questions of the witness."
1965.396,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2337.667,2342.939,"Well, he had not been summoned as a witness and put on the stand by anybody else, had he?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2342.939,2344.277,"No, he hadn't Your Honor."
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2345.782,2348.617,"The questions I gather on page 31 of your brief, are they?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2348.617,2350.543,"Yes, they are 31 and 32."
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2350.543,2355.565,And that's appeared to be -- what might be called direct examination.
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2355.565,2358.797,Yes.
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2358.797,2362.547,"Because he hadn't testified, had he, under it?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2362.547,2363.18,His statement was made --
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2363.18,2365.32,You called him -- you called him and he was your witness --
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2365.32,2365.406,That's correct.
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2365.406,2368.19,-- in an investigation and you asked him questions.
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2368.19,2368.559,That's correct.
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2368.559,2371.746,And those questions appear on 31 of your brief.
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2371.746,2372.263,"Yes, sir."
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2372.263,2376.055,And he refused to answer him or else you covered him by asking you questions.
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2376.055,2376.718,That's correct.
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2376.718,2378.53,"When, where and so on."
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2378.53,2383.335,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.396,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2406.734,2412.551,"Now, what you mean, I gather is, that the witnesses can be called under oath."
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2412.551,2414.329,"Yes, that's correct."
1965.396,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2414.329,2415.322,Not the material.
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2423.597,2423.886,Yes.
1965.396,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2426.332,2431.417,"I think they were in good deal, largely though?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2431.417,2435.156,"With reference to the concept of nexus, there are --"
1965.396,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2435.156,2436.225,With reference to what?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2436.225,2442.257,"The concept of nexus, the relationship of the witness to the subject under investigation."
1965.396,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2690.049,2692.99,May I ask you in that connection.
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2703.334,2703.768,"Yes, it is."
1965.396,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2703.768,2723.696,"By reason of the evidence that you have that six and a half years prior to the term of the examination, DeGregory is connected with Communist Party or was a Communist official or whatever it might be."
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2729.369,2731.974,"If I might explain, I'm not -- not completely."
1965.396,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2760.935,2782.499,"Now, is it your position that if he can investigate subversion that he had legal authority and legal justification for investigating a subversion but he doesn't have to make any showing whatsoever with respect to any particular individual who is called to testify?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2784.114,2793.346,"No, it's not our position that he have to show with reference with particular individual that he has specifically committed a crime or he is --"
1965.396,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2793.346,2796.778,"Well, do you take the position that he does not have to show that?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2796.778,2798.007,"Yes, we do."
1965.396,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2798.007,2820.714,"And so from your point of view, that doesn't make any difference whether DeGregory was connected with the Communist Party or not, that is to say, if the Attorney General have general -- have some reason to believe that he is ought to invest -- he is authorized to investigate the Communist Party, he could call anybody, is that right?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2828.998,2835.732,"He could, providing there with sufficient nexus or relationship of the individual to the subject under investigation."
1965.396,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2835.732,2836.669,That's what I was asking about.
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2836.669,2837.009,Yes.
1965.396,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2837.009,2849.833,"Then you do agree that he has to make some showing of probable cause for inquiring of the particular witness, that's exactly what I'm trying to --"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2849.833,2850.354,Yes.
1965.396,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2850.354,2851.131,-- get in terms of the position.
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2851.131,2852.705,That he does.
1965.396,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2852.705,2869.192,"And the only evidence here, as I understand it, is evidence that DeGregory was a Communist official or whatnot, six and a half years prior to the time that these questions were asked, am I correct?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2869.192,2874.514,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1965.396,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2874.514,2888.222,"Will you suggest, I suppose, that the legislature was entitled to investigate the Communist Party six and a half years ago as the basis for a continued investigation of it, don't you?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2888.222,2890.662,"I'm not sure I fully understand the question, Your Honor."
1965.396,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2890.662,2893.959,"Well, you asked questions having to do with six and a half years ago."
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2905.611,2907.144,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1965.396,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2910.153,2931.216,"Now, what if it -- what if you'd have information on DeGregory that he had been a member of the Communist Party of 1931 and he had said that I have not been -- you had information and he says, “I have not been a member and I'm not a member of the Communist Party now and I have not been a member in the last 30 years.”"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2938.926,2945.139,"Yes, there is and I would think this might be -- very well be the limit because of a nexus factor that --"
1965.396,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2945.139,2946.038,When does that come?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2969.207,2971.099,I don't think there's any specific period.
1965.396,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2987.649,2993.107,"Well, now what you have is a statement when he was a member six and a half years ago?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,2993.107,2998.154,"Well, I think that relates very closely to the problem at hand."
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3006.018,3007.526,Do you hear all the plans?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3007.526,3009.338,"Well, it's accelerated, I think."
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3011.325,3015.676,"Well, it's more of a change, doesn't it?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3015.676,3017.84,Yes.
1965.396,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3017.84,3026.035,What you're really -- I suppose you're really trying to find out whether you have a problem at all with the Communist Party of New Hampshire?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3026.035,3042.773,"I would think -- assume that the legislature would want to know the extent of Communist activities in and affecting the states so that they can either possibly maybe repeal this law or add new laws, change or amend it."
1965.396,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3049.443,3061.529,"If you didn't -- as a fact there for this question, you didn't include any information whatsoever about whether there was or was not a Communist Party operating in New Hampshire at the time the questions were asked."
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3091.773,3095.164,I have to answer by yes or no on this.
1965.396,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3143.778,3146.508,"By the way, what is the world situation?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3146.508,3148.048,In 1960?
1965.396,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3148.048,3149.623,Today.
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3149.623,3151.664,"Well, we have Vietnam problem."
1965.396,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3153.605,3159.295,"At the same time, we have Communist problem today as we had 10 years ago?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3159.295,3160.203,"10 years ago, no."
1965.396,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3162.63,3164.807,Do you think things got worst?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3164.807,3166.704,I think it is.
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3166.704,3181.624,"What about New Hampshire's interest, I mean, what's the State of New Hampshire's interest in the Vietnam problem?"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3181.624,3186.386,"Directly, I would say very little, indirect."
1965.396,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3207.351,3223.201,I thought your argument was awhile ago which is wrong that what you have interested in was the self-preservation of New Hampshire from being destroyed and now you're going to world conditions?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3223.201,3227.101,"Well, self-preservation --"
1965.396,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3227.101,3237.13,Is there any indication for the last six and a half years that you have any Communist in New Hampshire that you know about as the record shows?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3238.381,3242.151,"As far as the records go, there is no evidence as of that."
1965.396,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3242.151,3246.89,"Pretty hard to find and to keep the job going, isn't it?"
1965.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3246.89,3253.624,As if the -- people are not going to be -- are going to be permitted not to refuse to answer all the questions of the subject.
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3255.263,3259.289,But that bear in mind is the problem.
1965.396,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3269.738,3273.766,What is the report last year about how many Communists you had last year?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3273.766,3273.977,Pardon?
1965.396,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3274.741,3282.03,What is the report last year about how many Communists you have been able to detect in New Hampshire last year?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3282.03,3284.425,"Quite frankly, I didn't make the report."
1965.396,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3284.425,3284.985,What?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3284.985,3285.86,I didn't make the report.
1965.396,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3288.043,3297.466,"Well, I imagine that it's a matter of common knowledge, if you reported that you're about to be overthrown last year by the Communists and you have to --"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3297.466,3306.768,"Well, we've -- in light of Justice Brennan's opinion in the Uphaus case we have not made a formal report."
1965.396,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3319.45,3323.037,What's the legislature done about it?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3323.037,3332.716,The legislature has felt that the law which we have is operating well and that they intend to keep it as such.
1965.396,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3332.716,3335.796,And then Machiavelli in '55 of course.
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3335.796,3342.075,"Yes, they did because that's when they made it a continuing operation after '55 and '57."
1965.396,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3342.075,3346.835,You know that that's been -- you did not enact a substantive law.
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3346.835,3348.379,No.
1965.396,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3358.934,3366.687,Would that suggest that your legislature doesn't think there's much of a danger existing in New Hampshire?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3366.687,3378.257,"I wouldn't think so because the nature of the law that I think got blown out of proportion by political problems involved, side issues and personalities as opposed to the actual need of the law."
1965.396,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3378.257,3386.541,"For reindictment what you have said, if I understand, the purpose of you to inform a legislature --"
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3386.541,3386.648,That's correct.
1965.396,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3386.648,3388.083,Perhaps you're investigating?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3388.083,3389.107,That's correct.
1965.396,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3389.107,3400.036,You made in the court's term a rather comprehensive report 7 years ago and (Inaudible) probably continued by the committee.
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3408.357,3412.196,"The prophecy would be, I feel legislatively."
1965.396,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3427.669,3429.355,How many -- may I ask this?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3444.071,3449.507,Possibly half a dozen witnesses or so at that time.
1965.396,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3449.507,3454.941,Was that at the time that DeGregory was called initially or later?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3454.941,3461.43,"I believe the question was directed to -- at the time of the second hearing, 1963."
1965.396,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3461.43,3462.746,That's your answer.
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3462.746,3463.455,Yes.
1965.396,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3463.455,3466.925,Where we find that in the re -- where do we find that in the record?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3466.925,3467.802,"No, you will not find that."
1965.396,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3467.802,3475.259,Is there any record made of that by the committee for the use of the legislature?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3475.259,3477.065,It would be in our file.
1965.396,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3477.065,3478.869,There's no report of any kind?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3478.869,3481.673,"No, there's no written report, no."
1965.396,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3513.842,3521.612,Do you think counsel that the citation of the prosecution derived out of the other states applied here?
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3521.612,3523.592,Not to my knowledge.
1965.396,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3523.592,3528.205,(Inaudible)
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3528.205,3530.052,I believe so.
1965.396,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3530.052,3537.489,Would we be able to assume of the fact that nothing has been done during this last six and a half years.
1965.396,1,40456,r_peter_shapiro,,3548.217,3554.276,"Well, I think you have to look at it from the position as I cited in my brief."
