1965.282,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,14.309,"Number 282, Harry J. Amell et al., petitioners versus the United States."
1965.282,0,21524,david_scribner,,15.84,20.412,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1965.282,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,474.111,476.435,Why does the government want to change it?
1965.282,0,21524,david_scribner,,479.083,483.956,"Oh there is a simple reason is that in the other courts, the government saves money and the employees lose money."
1965.282,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,584.24,597.387,Is it your position that the only difference and result that could happen in this case bar the principles of law since that here that in one the government concedes the statute of limitation and the other one it could not?
1965.282,0,21524,david_scribner,,597.387,598.712,That's a practical question.
1965.282,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,598.712,600.073,But is there any other difference?
1965.282,0,21524,david_scribner,,600.073,611.698,"I don't know of any other substantial difference except that the general -- at doing this is a citing this is an advocate for the position, I would say that is the practical outcome of it."
1965.282,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,661.684,677.89,"Mr. Scribner, in one respect, the Congress has exempted somewhat or excluded seamen from the coverage of Acts otherwise applicable to government employees, hasn't it?"
1965.282,0,21524,david_scribner,,677.89,679.566,Well they've done that in the Clarification Act.
1965.282,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,679.566,680.93,In the Classification Act.
1965.282,0,21524,david_scribner,,680.93,690.122,"Well in the Classification Act, the Classification Act is one that embraces government employees and there are certain exclusions within the Classification Act, however --"
1965.282,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,690.122,692.886,"Then they exclude seamen, why'd they exclude seamen?"
1965.282,0,21524,david_scribner,,692.886,694.467,But they didn't exclude sir.
1965.282,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,735.398,740.43,Well it just says this chapter shall not apply to officers and members of the crew of the vessel.
1965.282,0,21524,david_scribner,,740.43,745.881,The chapter which relates specifically to the manner on which wage rate shall be determined.
1965.282,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,751.477,755.879,"Well it says by the maritime, by practices in the maritime industry."
1965.282,0,21524,david_scribner,,755.879,767.39,"It's determined by the agency, by the governmental agencies involved, the guide that is given them of the prevailing practices of the maritime industry, and --"
1965.282,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,767.39,772.823,"But nevertheless, nevertheless the rules that apply to other government employees as applied to the seamen?"
1965.282,0,21524,david_scribner,,772.823,778.361,"Well if you have them not applying to seamen, you have them not applying to other employees, like wage board employees."
1965.282,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,844.98,860.773,"Mr. Scribner, is it entirely clear that apart from whether the -- which Act applies that the District Court does not have concurrent jurisdiction of the Court of Claims here?"
1965.282,0,21524,david_scribner,,879.632,883.739,"I wish I could be more categorical in my answer on that, I'm puzzled about that."
1965.282,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,914.087,919.539,"Well that's not -- but that's not showing anything before us, is it?"
1965.282,0,21524,david_scribner,,919.539,920.007,Well --
1965.282,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,920.007,926.818,"As I look at the record here, your complaint merely has an aggregate figure --"
1965.282,0,21524,david_scribner,,926.818,927.246,That's right.
1965.282,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,927.246,929.954,"-- in excess of $100,000.00."
1965.282,0,21524,david_scribner,,941.398,943.884,That's right.
1965.282,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,943.884,950.96,"And that motion was based on the proposition that admiralty jurisdiction applies, right?"
1965.282,0,21524,david_scribner,,950.96,952.22,Right.
1965.282,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,952.22,964.061,"Now the order entered by the Court of Claims as I understand it is merely a general order transferring the case to the United States District Court without any specification, right?"
1965.282,0,21524,david_scribner,,964.061,965.429,Right.
1965.282,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,965.429,994.658,"Now the question that occurs to me is, it bothers me, is a possibility that if the District Court has concurrent jurisdiction or rather -- yes if the District Court has concurrent jurisdiction that order, now with the Court of claims, is it possible that that order as such was not erroneous?"
1965.282,0,21524,david_scribner,,994.658,995.327,Well I'd like --
1965.282,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,995.327,1004.615,And that's what I'd -- that's what I'd like your help on because it's obviously significant with respect to our action here.
1965.282,0,21524,david_scribner,,1004.615,1014.195,"On the two phases of the questions that you raise, I would have the following approach."
1965.282,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1114.637,1120.673,"No, but the -- is the petitioner's choice conclusive here?"
1965.282,0,21524,david_scribner,,1135.509,1148.038,"Well I would say that if there is motion or if the court did it sua sponte on the ground of foreign inconvenience for instance or on some other issue, I would imagine that it could be done, but of course that was not what was confronting us."
1965.282,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1178.811,1179.963,Well certain other things have concerns --
1965.282,0,21524,david_scribner,,1179.963,1180.867,-- that happens to --
1965.282,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1180.867,1182.838,-- but it may be a fact of life.
1965.282,0,21524,david_scribner,,1182.838,1184.183,[Inaudible]
1965.282,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1184.183,1197.482,"Mr. Scribner, is there anything in the legislative history of the Suits in Admiralty Act concerning the scope of that Act that would shed any light on our problem here?"
1965.282,0,21524,david_scribner,,1197.482,1198.486,Not on this really.
1965.282,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1269.124,1273.536,Were there extensive hearings on this Suit in Admiralty Act?
1965.282,0,21524,david_scribner,,1273.536,1294.174,"Well there were some hearings, there were no hearings in relation to one of the amendments, but by and large there was a tremendous amount of discussion in Congress on these things, but not a single word that relates to how you should treat this whole body of government employee or how each of us will handle that exactly in the opposite direction and for different reasons."
1965.282,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1346.622,1350.945,Mr. Eldridge.
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1350.945,1354.929,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1965.282,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1447.505,1449.025,Nor does the Court is that what you're saying?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1449.025,1452.773,"I -- that's my understanding, yes Your Honor."
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1452.773,1460.3,What has happened to the cases filed in the Court of Claims prior to 1960 of this nature?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1460.3,1469.506,"Well what happened, it would depend upon whether the seamen were employed upon merchant vessels or public vessels, Justice Black."
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1496.439,1497.111,Well I understood that --
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1497.111,1497.587,Now what --
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1497.587,1499.393,-- I understood you couldn't move to transfer them?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1499.393,1500.32,That's right.
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1564.246,1580.296,"Do I understand then from what you say, prior to 1960 there had been no cases of this kind like these people have filed for wages tried in the Court of Claims that all had been dismissed?"
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1580.296,1583.549,I say the distinction depend whether they were merchant vessel or public case.
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1583.549,1585.559,But I'm talking -- what were these?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1585.559,1592.302,Well that's not clear from the complaint but I would assume they are all public vessels involved.
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1592.302,1594.513,What happened to cases the way it suits the wages?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1594.513,1597.54,The Court of Claims would entertain them prior to 1960.
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1597.54,1599.077,And did they continue?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1601.635,1606.755,"Yes Your Honor, because of their holding and on other line of cases that --"
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1606.755,1607.701,Well whatever it was --
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1607.701,1607.826,Yes.
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1607.826,1611.867,-- how long have they been tried there that way?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1611.867,1626.434,"Well prior to 1960, public seamen employed on public vessels, I don't know how many cases or but just regularly filed their suits in the Court of Claims and the Court of Claims entertained such suits."
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1626.434,1631.253,And do you claim that when they arranged for them to be transferred --
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1631.253,1631.63,Well I --
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1631.63,1637.302,-- to the other court that also made it impossible for them to -- Court of Claims to try them.
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1637.302,1637.504,Yes that --
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1637.504,1639.048,Does that act change the law?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1639.048,1643.969,Yes the change of the law -- another change of the law was made in 1960 Justice Black.
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1643.969,1646.647,Which deprived the Court of Claims of jurisdiction?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1646.647,1647.43,Well --
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1647.43,1648.338,Where is that?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1649.438,1650.736,Yes Justice Black.
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1650.736,1651.827,Which one is that?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1651.827,1663.586,The same statute amended the suits in Admiralty Act so as to encompass public vessel actions and which I think we deal with.
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1693.908,1703.353,"I find Section 1 and 2 and 5, but I don't find Section 3 on --"
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1703.353,1712.771,This is discussed on pages -- beginning with page 18 of our brief Justice Black.
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1712.771,1715.106,18.
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1715.106,1722.007,Through 18 and 19.
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1722.007,1724.01,On your brief?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1724.01,1724.888,Yes.
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1724.888,1727.515,Not in the petition for certiorari?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1727.515,1733.894,No I do not think the 1960 statute was discussed.
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1733.894,1737.522,Where is the Act -- Section 3 quoted?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1737.522,1739.816,Well Section 3 of that Act --
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1739.816,1740.174,That's only what you rely.
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1740.174,1745.084,-- is that Section 2 of the Suits in Admiralty Act quoted on page 2 of our brief.
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1745.084,1745.281,Oh!
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1746.599,1765.262,"No, Section 3 of the 1960 statute was an amendment for Section 2 of the Suits in Admiralty Act, and see the -- before 1960, there's been quite a conflict among the courts as to how to the scope of the Public Vessels Act."
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1832.451,1847.643,"But you say that the Congress changed this long rule, as I understood you, the long rule by Section 2 so that the -- before Section 2 was adopted they could sue for wages in Court of Claims but after it they could not?"
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1847.643,1852.76,What they could if the Court of Claim's construction of the Public Vessels Act was correct.
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1855.918,1862.234,"Well then, are you claiming that the law was always wrong when they sued there that if had been properly raised --"
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1862.234,1875.079,"No, no because the government's position was always that the Public Vessels Act was quite narrow until we've lost several cases in this Court."
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1911.591,1914.978,"I'm asking you these questions, I know nothing about it."
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1914.978,1915.1,Now --
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1915.1,1923.565,"I have no view on it at all, but I'm wondering why if this had been the practice if they could sue for wages in that court before 1960."
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1923.565,1925.387,"Only public vessel seamen, yes."
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1925.387,1936.689,"Well, in this kind of case, in that was the case, why would they have done away with that jurisdiction of the Court of Claims without saying something about it and decide?"
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1936.689,1938.165,Well --
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1938.165,1940.252,Why would they have done it by indirection?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1940.252,1946.377,"What Congress has done away with that jurisdiction in the Suits in Admiralty Act, as this Court held --"
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1946.377,1948.567,Before 1960?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1948.567,1949.572,"Yes, when --"
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1949.572,1951.887,In these particular cases?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1951.887,1952.656,"Well, when it --"
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1952.656,1954.803,This type of case?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1954.803,1959.932,Well in this case it's not clear whether these seamen are employed on public vessels or merchant vessels.
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1959.932,1967.933,"If not clear, we can assume that is a kind of case which this Court had always had jurisdiction without objection by the government."
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1972.874,1978.768,Well one of the reasons was because of this very doubt involved as to where jurisdiction existed --
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1978.768,1980.948,That would have been all the more necessary of the whether they know what they're talking about.
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1980.948,1987.149,Well Congress in 1960 thought that it was ending the matter.
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1991.255,1995.834,"That's alright, but I want to first treat it from the language of what we are supposed to construe --"
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,1995.834,1995.97,Yes.
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1995.97,2002.905,-- to find out where we can find anything there that tells us that this long standing jurisdiction has been abolished.
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2002.905,2008.894,"Well, it's there if you'd bear with me a moment."
1965.282,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2124.778,2135.181,"So you say that -- do you say that by adding -- by expanding the Suits in Admiralty Act, it comes to that very act contracted the Tucker Act under the principles of Johnson."
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2135.181,2136.348,Yes Justice White.
1965.282,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2211.687,2227.943,Well now Mr. Eldridge is there anything in the hearings before the legislative committees or anything said on the floor from which you can take comfort in this position that you're taking today?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2227.943,2228.731,Yes.
1965.282,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2228.731,2230.493,But what is that?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2230.493,2231.053,Chief Justice --
1965.282,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2231.053,2232.687,Where do we find it?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2232.687,2240.562,Well I think in the committee reports which we do cite in our brief refer to the testimony before the committee.
1965.282,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2240.562,2243.487,What was that testimony?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2243.487,2250.309,The amendment to was not -- was instigated by the maritime law association.
1965.282,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2298.294,2299.413,But was there any --
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2299.413,2302.368,So this was the testimony which the committee refers to.
1965.282,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2302.368,2304.205,What did the committee say about that?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2304.205,2313.936,"And the committee said and the committee pointed to all the various cases, and said that we were -- that we want to rectify it, so the Bill in the House contain --"
1965.282,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2313.936,2315.483,Did you quote that -- did you quote that in you brief?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2315.483,2320.531,"Yes that's quoted in our brief, some of the language from the committee report."
1965.282,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2320.716,2326.454,Is that on page 19?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2326.454,2332.396,Yes we have one quote on page -- middle page 19 from the committee reports.
1965.282,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2336.525,2342.093,I don't think that be very quite important in as much as you are urging repeal by implication here.
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2342.093,2343.225,Well --
1965.282,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2343.225,2351.137,"If the statute itself doesn't repeal the -- that portion of the Tucker Act, I would think that you would have to have some rather positive language in the --"
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2351.137,2362.79,Well we think the Suits in Admiralty Act does repeal it and it was just by bringing these seamen into the Suits in Admiralty Act that you deprive them of any remedy under the Tucker Act.
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2362.79,2364.688,Why would you've done that?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2374.437,2394.183,"Well this was the holding of this Court in several cases that if a litigant could sue under the Suits in Admiralty Act, he could not sue under the Tucker Act and I think the whole framework of the Suits in Admiralty Act and the history of the Act shows that this Court's decisions were correct to that effect."
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2396.203,2403.591,Did the admiralty bar or whoever it was suggested this law suggest that they take the jurisdiction away from the Court of Claims?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2403.591,2405.734,Well the admiralty bar wanted to clarify.
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2405.734,2411.473,Did it suggest to take away to – bar the jurisdiction in the previous for the next side and the court of --
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2411.473,2418.865,"Well I think in the one area of the public vessel seamen where it was a maritime claim, the admiralty bar wanted this --"
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2418.865,2429.133,"Now you say wanted, now can we see where they suggested it as the part of the history of this Act that the jurisdiction be taken away from the Court of Claims?"
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2434.44,2438.873,Well I think the admiralty bar was more concerned about the confusion that existed but --
1965.282,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2438.873,2440.838,"Well who proposed the Bill, was it --"
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2440.838,2449.2,"The Maritime Law Association proposed the Bill and as I started to say before, it just contained the transfer provisions when it was in the House."
1965.282,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2449.2,2451.238,Did the government support this Bill or opposed it?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2451.238,2455.456,"Yes, we had really nothing to do with drafting it."
1965.282,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2456.871,2458.824,You certainly wrote a letter to the committee about it.
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2458.824,2459.147,Yes.
1965.282,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2459.147,2460.34,Did you support it?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2460.34,2468.451,"Yes, the first two sections are just the transfer provisions in the House then we were asked to comment on the Bill."
1965.282,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2490.972,2495.265,Was the origin of this specific thing you're relying on was with the Department of Justice?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2495.265,2498.112,We suggested that it ought to be done.
1965.282,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2544.928,2549.368,"This whole thing is primarily is the problem of waiving sovereign immunity, isn't it?"
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2551.032,2563.627,"Yes Justice White, that's I suppose what the Suits in Admiralty Act did and the whole object was to have all maritime claims embraced within the Suits in Admiralty Act."
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2563.627,2575.083,Now where -- where can we find that in the history of this Act that they intended to take away the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims invested all under the Suits in Admiralty Act?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2575.083,2585.711,"Well I think that this quote on -- the committee reports I think state that in this quote we have set forth on page 19 of our brief, Justice Black."
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2610.014,2612.27,Are you talking about that part on page 19?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2612.27,2614.724,"Yes, Justice Black."
1965.282,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2614.724,2625.826,Do I get it Mr. Eldridge that the last determent sequence now was the deletion of the proviso in the Public Vessels Act?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2625.826,2626.966,"No, Suits in Admiralty Act."
1965.282,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2626.966,2627.56,Suits in Admiralty Act?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2627.56,2627.989,Yes Justice Brennan.
1965.282,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2627.989,2631.308,That was the last sequence of --
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2631.308,2633.638,How that 1960 legislation evolved.
1965.282,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2633.638,2634.429,-- now is executed.
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2634.429,2635.526,Yes.
1965.282,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2635.526,2638.778,"And that was a suggestion, you said, of the --"
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2638.778,2640.627,Maritime Law Association.
1965.282,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2640.627,2642.799,And that was accepted by the?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2642.799,2645.927,"Department of Justice and the Department of Commerce, yes."
1965.282,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2652.542,2655.14,You keep saying clarifies but you mean to settle the question.
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2655.14,2657.09,"To settle the question, yes."
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2670.303,2683.852,"I've been unable to find here, I'm sure it's my fault, quotation where you said they stated that they wanted to confer exclusive jurisdiction to try these cases in this other court."
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2683.852,2684.153,Well --
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2684.153,2685.856,Exclusive jurisdiction.
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2685.856,2694.746,-- the word exclusive is right in the second sentence of this quote Justice Black.
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2694.746,2701.18,But now exclusive jurisdiction conferred on the District Court but there was no exclusive jurisdiction --
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2701.18,2701.738,Yes on this --
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2701.738,2703.412,-- because they have been trying them in the Court of Claims.
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2703.412,2708.715,-- only public -- not when it came to the Suits in Admiralty Act.
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2709.074,2712.096,I'm talking about this kind of suit they have.
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2712.096,2713.073,Well the kind of suit --
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2713.073,2714.098,That's all we understood in here.
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2714.098,2730.669,-- they have that it was a -- we don't know whether there are clients or merchant vessel or public vessel because after 1960 it doesn't make any difference (Voice Overlap) and I suppose they did not feel any need to allege one or the other.
1965.282,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2753.928,2757.018,"No, but if you're right, what else is left in this case?"
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2760.545,2760.784,Well this is why the petitioner --
1965.282,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2760.784,2763.183,-- and the effect is what's left --
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2763.183,2774.353,"-- the petitioners are conceding, if I understand their argument although the National Maritime Union isn't here that the Suits in Admiralty Act is exclusive as the case comes under it."
1965.282,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2787.279,2795.005,Are there any non-governmental employees work on public vessel?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2795.005,2799.32,"No, I -- well that's a good question Justice White, we have --"
1965.282,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2799.32,2801.427,"Because if there are, I don't suppose anybody would --"
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2801.427,2814.1,We have our fleet of public vessels operated under operating agency agreements and there's a dispute as to whose employees they are whether they're ours or the operating agents right now.
1965.282,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2814.1,2838.043,"If they weren't the government employees there's no question that their wage claims would be covered by the Suits in Admiralty Act, nor the plaintiff's claim is that no matter what -- no matter what this 1960 amendment did with regards to seaman's wage claim, it didn't reach -- it didn't take the government employees out from under the Tucker Act."
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2838.043,2838.366,"Yes, because --"
1965.282,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2838.366,2844.595,But the only -- the only -- the only basis is the only jurisdictional ground he's got is the Tucker Act.
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2844.595,2845.416,Yes.
1965.282,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2845.416,2850.023,And generally applicable to the government contract claim.
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2850.023,2850.223,Yes Justice White.
1965.282,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2850.223,2856.586,And he says that no matter what 1960 Act did it didn't do this vis-à-vis government employee.
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2856.586,2861.348,He's arguing that his -- these government employees are not encompassed by the Suits in Admiralty Act.
1965.282,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2861.348,2866.952,"Well you see now, that's based on what on some Federal Employees Compensation Act that there was --"
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2866.952,2888.545,"Well, he's relying on -- on this -- this Court's decisions in Johansen and Patterson quoting that the suits that you couldn't -- a government employee couldn't sue for personal injuries because though he shouldn't have a dole remedy, it was covered by the Federal Employees Compensation Act and this Court held that we don't think that --"
1965.282,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2888.545,2888.811,So agreeing --
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2888.811,2891.059,-- there would be a dual remedy for personal injury.
1965.282,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2891.059,2896.303,Agreeing with you about the effect of the 1960 Act doesn't answer this -- doesn't finally answer the --
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2896.303,2897.706,"No, that's what I say --"
1965.282,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2897.706,2899.955,And you've got about three minutes left to give the --
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2899.955,2909.624,Well petitioner's argument is that a government employee seaman's wage claim is not encompassed by the Suits in Admiralty Act as I understand it.
1965.282,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2939.153,2948.931,"But even taking Johansen and Patterson applying the principles, you argue that that would come out on your side because you do have the specific statute dealing with a specific type of client."
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,2948.931,2965.162,"Yes and here of course this Court in Johansen and Patterson held that as between the Compensation Act and the Suits in Admiralty Act both of which the language covers the claim, exclusive jurisdiction should be under the Compensation Act."
1965.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3167.018,3168.091,Would be what?
1965.282,1,30180,john_c_eldridge,,3168.091,3170.906,Barred by the two-year period of limitation.
1965.282,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3248.58,3249.712,Mr. Scribner.
1965.282,2,21524,david_scribner,,3249.712,3251.52,May I have a moment?
1965.282,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3314.617,3325.516,"Do you claim -- do you claim that the Court of Claims has exclusive jurisdiction or the District Court has exclusive jurisdiction of these claims for wages, either one of them?"
1965.282,2,21524,david_scribner,,3325.516,3327.979,It is my position that the Court of Claims has exclusive jurisdiction.
1965.282,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3327.979,3328.567,Exclusive?
1965.282,2,21524,david_scribner,,3328.567,3330.269,"That's exactly right, sir."
1965.282,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3354.566,3356.865,Why do you claim it exclusive?
1965.282,2,21524,david_scribner,,3356.865,3384.426,"Well, it appears to me, although I don't think it's necessary for the -- for a determination in respect to this matter, it appears to me that it was the intention of the Congress to have where admiralty matters were involved, specific admiralty matters were involved that is admiralty law applies and where the vessel would be treated as though it were a private vessel, government vessel treated as though as private vessel."
1965.282,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3384.426,3395.676,"Mr. Scribner, do you say that the Court of Claims couldn't -- let's assume that there were some applicable admiralty principles or a rule, couldn't the Court of Claims apply them --"
1965.282,2,21524,david_scribner,,3395.676,3395.853,Well --
1965.282,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3395.853,3397.343,-- as well as any other court.
1965.282,2,21524,david_scribner,,3397.343,3398.46,Well in the context of --
1965.282,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3398.46,3400.148,Well I mean it couldn't apply them.
1965.282,2,21524,david_scribner,,3400.148,3402.751,I'm sorry.
1965.282,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3469.364,3475.664,"But seamen, I suppose seamen had always been able to sue their employers in admiralty for wages."
1965.282,2,21524,david_scribner,,3475.664,3481.058,"Of course they had certainly, certainly, but under admiralty law."
1965.282,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3533.502,3548.168,"Mr. Scribner, Mr. Eldridge referred to certain seaman's wage statutes as possibly applicable in some of these cases brought by government employees for wage claims."
1965.282,2,21524,david_scribner,,3562.736,3566.676,I think categorically there are absolutely none.
1965.282,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3628.824,3631.821,"Excuse me, but this is important to me."
1965.282,2,21524,david_scribner,,3657.196,3665.124,"Yes indeed, there's a same comprehensive plan that we see -- that we suggest was considered by this Court in Johansen-Patterson cases."
1965.282,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3665.124,3667.016,So that they're totally separate.
1965.282,2,21524,david_scribner,,3667.016,3669.002,"That's right, and in fact they are."
1965.282,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3669.002,3672.814,And if I understand Mr. Eldridge he contests that statement.
1965.282,2,21524,david_scribner,,3672.814,3675.157,Well I think that's a fact.
