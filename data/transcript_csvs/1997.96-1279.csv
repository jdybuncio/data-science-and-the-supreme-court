1997.96-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.326,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-1279, George C. Rogers v. The United States."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,10.628,13.79,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,55.678,60.34,"Well, when you say an incomplete verdict, you don't mean that the verdict formed was incomplete, do you?"
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,60.34,68.664,"What we mean is that the jury... what the jury found, the elements that the jury found do not constitute a crime, that the jury did not render a verdict on every element."
1997.96-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,68.664,75.089,Let's take a look and... are you saying that the form of the jury verdict didn't comply with law?
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,75.089,79.203,"Well, in the sense that every element of the offense charged was not included."
1997.96-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,79.203,84.897,"Well, but that isn't in the form of a jury... that isn't in an ordinary jury verdict, that they find every element of the offense, is it?"
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,87.098,88.359,That is true.
1997.96-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,88.359,90.18,"And that was done here, was it not?"
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,90.18,95.015,"Yes, except that it was done in the context of jury instructions that did not instruct the jury--"
1997.96-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,95.015,101.647,"Well, yes, but that's a little different than saying the jury rendered a flawed verdict in the sense of some defect in the form of the verdict."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,101.647,104.608,--Our contention is not with respect to the actual form.
1997.96-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,141.234,146.025,"In Sullivan the failure wasn't to give an instruction about reasonable doubt, was it not?"
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,146.025,146.746,"--Yes, it was."
1997.96-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,146.746,151.529,"And there, one could say that the jury had not found anything the way it should have."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,151.529,161.106,"Actually, in our view the error in this case provides an even clearer example of the type of error that cannot be subject to harmless error scrutiny than was present in Sullivan."
1997.96-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,193.189,197.66,"Well, I have trouble with your present articulation of the question, too."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,218.274,218.875,"No, no."
1997.96-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,218.875,225.02,"What happened here was, there isn't an instruction on one element."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,227.901,228.501,Yes.
1997.96-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,232.222,236.325,"And what's the specific crime that we're talking about here, the possession of a silencer?"
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,236.325,237.457,Of an unregistered silencer.
1997.96-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,237.457,238.367,Uh-huh.
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,238.367,250.105,"And in particular, what Staples would require in combination with the knowing possession requirement is that the defendant must knowingly possess an object, and at the time that the defendant knowingly possesses it--"
1997.96-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,250.105,255.139,"And you say that that can never be a harmless error, the failure to instruct?"
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,255.139,266.886,"--If the trial court fails to instruct the jury on an element of the crime, and the jury's findings on the other elements do not necessarily encompass the element that was omitted--"
1997.96-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,266.886,272.941,"Well, what if it's clear from the evidence that the defendant says, yeah, I had a silencer."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,274.01,275.763,--In that particular--
1997.96-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,275.763,277.293,Harmless error possible?
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,277.293,278.304,--It would depend.
1997.96-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,300.457,318.179,"Well, the plain error doctrine as enunciated in Olano refers back to the Atkinson case and says you don't reverse if the reversal would seriously... unless it would seriously affect the fairness and integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,327.836,328.617,--I--
1997.96-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,328.617,332.418,"You know, that's what harmless error's all about, is technical things like that."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,332.418,335.142,"--I would like to answer your question, Mr. Chief Justice, in two ways."
1997.96-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,402.505,414.643,"Your rule would carry over to the States, too, I suppose, so that any failure on the part of a State court to charge on some element of a crime would be Federal constitutional error."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,414.643,419.396,If the jury does not find the element that was omitted--
1997.96-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,419.396,422.027,"Well, ordinarily juries don't find special verdicts."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,426.541,437.08,"--It is certainly true that a jury generally will enter a general verdict, but it is a general verdict that is predicated upon the jury's instructions that tell the jury what the elements are."
1997.96-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,437.08,439.161,So what is your answer to my question?
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,444.272,451.188,"It would affect State cases, but it would only do so if the jury does not find that element."
1997.96-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,451.188,453.449,"Well, you're not answering my question."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,461.506,462.335,It would not.
1997.96-1279,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,474.083,478.387,"Mr. Rubinstein, you're not making any distinction between Federal trials and State trials."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,478.387,478.788,--I'm not.
1997.96-1279,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,478.788,485.42,"So whatever the rule is for the Federal trials you're saying, whatever you're arguing here in the Federal trial would apply to the State trial as well."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,512.979,516.772,In addition to the type of error that we are dealing with in this case?
1997.96-1279,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,516.772,517.203,Yes.
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,517.203,524.266,Essentially it would be a situation where the right to the jury trial itself has been denied.
1997.96-1279,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,524.266,530.589,"Yes, well, if you could be specific about that, and I gave the two standard ones and added the one you're urging."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,532.56,545.019,"As far as I am... I am only prepared in this case to suggest that... and I realize that the category of errors that this Court has regarded as essentially being immune from harmless error scrutiny are limited, and we accept that."
1997.96-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,545.019,560.9,"May I ask you... you're saying where the essence of the right to a jury trial is denied and, of course, the principal purpose of the jury is to resolve disputed issues of fact, and is it equally important to have the jury pass on an undisputed issue of fact, where everybody agrees what the facts are?"
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,560.9,561.641,"Yes, it is."
1997.96-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,561.641,562.329,And why?
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,562.329,580.172,"And the reason is that as this Court indicated, for instance, in Estelle v. McGuire, where a defendant concedes an element, the prosecution's burden of proof remains the same, and where a defendant admits an element through testimony the weight of that testimony is for the jury to decide."
1997.96-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,581.463,592.7,"Yes, but it's not merely an admission which, sometimes admissions are more probative than others, but it's also the... as counsel agreed that the facts... as I remember the record here, that the facts are that he in fact knew that it was a silencer."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,592.7,593.411,--Yes.
1997.96-1279,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,603.517,621.859,"I take it that interstate commerce, which is a jurisdictional requisite to many Federal crimes, and I think can be called an element of the offense, has to be charged and considered by the jury in every case, even though it was obvious that interstate commerce is involved."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,621.859,639.109,"I would say the answer is yes, assuming that the defendant objects to... assuming that there is a failure to instruct on the interstate commerce element, it would only be subject to the rule that we are talking about if the defendant timely objects to the trial court's failure to instruct on that element, and--"
1997.96-1279,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,639.109,640.841,"And defenses, the same thing?"
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,651.869,652.861,--I would think so.
1997.96-1279,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,690.064,704.272,"Mr. Rubinstein, what if the defendant at his arraignment said... the judge said, well, how do you plead, and he said, I plead not guilty, except that I perfectly well knew that this object that they're talking about was a silencer."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,707.996,718.273,"That apparently is an open question within the circuits, and I know that there is... it is a conflict right now as to whether or not a defendant can partially plead guilty."
1997.96-1279,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,718.273,740.246,"Well, the... I mean, I guess it's obvious the theory is that the trial is held to resolve issues which are joined, and that issue is not joined in the hypothesis that I give, so I would suppose there was a pretty good argument there for the propriety of removing that from the jury's consideration."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,740.246,759.97,"If it were permissible to plead to an element in accordance with Rule 11, and all of the normal safeguards are provided to the defendant, that the defendant is waiving his or her right to a jury trial as to that element, and if such a plea were permissible, I think that since we are talking about it--"
1997.96-1279,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,759.97,768.724,"Then the same thing would be true here, I suppose, if he stands up at a later point and says, look, I know about that."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,805.819,807.101,--Let me answer that in two ways.
1997.96-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,818.929,829.645,"I was surprised to hear you concede the point that a... that Justice Souter began with that a trial is held, in criminal cases at least, only to resolve those issues that are joined."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,829.645,830.607,--I--
1997.96-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,830.607,837.079,"I mean, suppose the defendant comes in and says, I am pleading not guilty, Your Honor, but of course I committed the crime, does that mean you don't need a trial?"
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,837.079,839.762,"--Absolutely not, and I did not mean to concede--"
1997.96-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,839.762,840.341,You still need a trial.
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,842.812,850.349,"--Absolutely, and it is our position that if the defendant pleads not guilty, it makes no difference whether the defendant concedes an element."
1997.96-1279,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,867.741,882.569,"Suppose there are two counts, as there were in this case, submitted to the jury and under the law each count requires knowing that it's a silencer, but as to count 1 the judge instructs that that's not an issue, and as to count 2... but then he's convicted on both counts."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,886.934,894.128,It would depend... if the jury could not have found the elements of... on one count without also finding--
1997.96-1279,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,894.128,894.678,"Well, they--"
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,894.678,895.647,--Let me rephrase that.
1997.96-1279,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,895.647,908.036,"--Suppose they found there was a silencer on one count which was rather minor so far as the sentence is concerned, but then as to the major count the judge instructs knowledge is not... this is not for you to consider, what result there?"
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,908.036,915.933,In that case the jury will have found that the defendant knowingly possessed an item that he knew to be a silencer.
1997.96-1279,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,915.933,921.455,"Well, but they haven't considered the whole crime, pursuant to your earlier discussion."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,927.149,940.758,"In that context, and I think that this Court's decision in Pope is instructive on that, that if the jury could not... if the jury actually did make the finding of fact that would be necessary to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt--"
1997.96-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,940.758,942.47,"No, but that's on the same count."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,947.252,947.502,--Right.
1997.96-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,947.502,948.424,"See, Pope, it was all one count."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,948.424,956.539,"Yes, I understand that, but if no rational jury could have found what they did find as to count 2 and not find it at the same time as to count 1--"
1997.96-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,956.539,957.49,That wouldn't impeach the verdict.
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,958.692,959.45,--Yes.
1997.96-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,980.875,986.368,Could we look at the instructions so that I see specifically what you're finding fault with?
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,990.902,992.332,--The--
1997.96-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,992.332,993.453,Joint appendix.
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,993.453,1008.012,"--The particular jury instruction that was given is at page 104, and it is the instruction from the trial court that it is not necessary for the Government to prove that the defendant knew that the item described in the indictment was a firearm, which the law requires."
1997.96-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1008.012,1019.49,"But over on the next page, in 105, the court instructed that the firearm, the term firearm includes a silencer."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1031.909,1037.873,What that instruction means is that the defendant must knowingly possess an object which the law defines as a firearm.
1997.96-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1045.868,1055.884,"In Staples, but in Staples, now we had a situation where a machine gun... it wasn't clear whether it was a machine gun or a rifle."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1059.407,1060.487,Actually--
1997.96-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1060.487,1063.799,"We don't have the same problem with a silencer, do we?"
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1063.799,1065.381,"--I think you do, and--"
1997.96-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1065.381,1066.09,Why?
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1066.09,1072.735,"--All of the circuits that have considered the question have held that Staples does apply to silencer possession offenses, the Seventh Circuit and the Ninth Circuit both."
1997.96-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1072.735,1074.838,"Well, why isn't there some difference there?"
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1088.826,1089.658,I'll give you an example.
1997.96-1279,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1113.343,1114.744,"Well, you might think it's a grenade launcher."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1228.501,1232.182,"Let me answer your question, Justice Breyer, in two steps."
1997.96-1279,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1241.569,1245.032,Did not concede that it was not ambiguous.
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1245.032,1247.623,What they conceded was that it was removed.
1997.96-1279,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1247.623,1257.4,"Fine, and I say, you can say that if you're prepared to say that the reason it was removed is because the instruction was capable of two possible understandings."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1257.4,1261.092,I would take issue that it is ambiguous.
1997.96-1279,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1270.559,1271.58,What are the words that do that?
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1271.58,1272.031,--under the law.
1997.96-1279,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1272.031,1272.992,What are the words that do that?
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1272.992,1290.614,"At page... at page 104 the Government... I mean, sorry, the judge said, it is not necessary for the Government to prove that the defendant knew that the item described in the indictment was a firearm which the law requires to be registered."
1997.96-1279,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1290.614,1291.682,Which the law requires to be registered.

1997.96-1279,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1339.916,1340.377,That's... that's the very--
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1340.377,1340.958,--it had been omitted.
1997.96-1279,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1340.958,1343.418,--You've now put your finger on just the point that's bothering me.
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1385.048,1400.095,"To answer your question, I believe that the fact that petitioner's counsel is... or the defense counsel is obligated to object, and that ultimately it is for the appellate court to decide whether the element has been omitted, provides the safeguard that would prevent all ambiguous instructions from being subject."
1997.96-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1410.964,1422.572,"--Mr. Rubinstein, the question presented in this case is whether a district court's failure to instruct on an element of an offense is harmless error where at trial the defendant admitted that element."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1425.945,1427.064,--The Government never--
1997.96-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1427.064,1428.977,--in its opposition to the petition for certiorari?
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1435.75,1438.033,--The Government has not taken that position.
1997.96-1279,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1444.845,1451.741,"Well, they actually stipulated that the machine gun count was reversible for this same flaw, did it not?"
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1451.741,1462.169,"--They also confessed error with respect to the machine gun count as well, and ultimately, as Justice Scalia pointed out, the question presented assumes that in fact the element was omitted."
1997.96-1279,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1462.169,1482.502,"Still, if that... I mean, I'd worry about lawyers reading an opinion that upheld you in light of the instruction that was actually given, and even if that weren't so, I'm still worried about my basic problem, finding something in the Constitution that says that this kind of ambiguity, or something a little less ambiguous, could never be harmless error."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1486.776,1490.877,And it is not our contention that it would never be harmless error.

1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1532.505,1541.341,What we have... what we believe to be the case is that he did admit that when he was shown the object he could identify it as a silencer.
1997.96-1279,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1541.341,1552.187,"I mean, you could say about a gun, but a silencer is... you might think, oh, yeah, there's a gun registration law, guns have to be registered, but you wouldn't automatically say that about an accoutrement."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1552.187,1555.469,We're not suggesting that he... that petitioner had to know it had to be registered.
1997.96-1279,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1559.333,1561.223,"Well, what did he... what are you contending he did have to know?"
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1574.552,1574.993,--Right.
1997.96-1279,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,1585.649,1591.143,--Mr. Rubinstein.
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1607.174,1608.263,Yes.
1997.96-1279,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,1619.272,1620.952,That's not what we held in Staples.
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1628.997,1629.968,"Correct, and in this case--"
1997.96-1279,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,1629.968,1631.93,Not that it was a firearm.
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1631.93,1632.721,--Right.
1997.96-1279,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,1636.775,1638.117,"No, no, the characteristics that make it a machine gun."
1997.96-1279,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1638.117,1644.451,"--All right, and in this case what that would... Staples would require is that the person knew it was, in fact, a silencer."
1997.96-1279,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,1644.451,1654.546,"Well, the item as charged, what I don't understand is that, what must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt is that the defendant knowingly possessed the item as charged."

1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1693.782,1696.564,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1727.773,1731.626,And you might add in there that he asked for the instruction to be given and it was denied.
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1734.117,1734.508,He did.
1997.96-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1734.508,1736.299,Okay.
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1746.316,1752.04,The question is ultimately whether he was subjected to some kind of procedural unfairness.
1997.96-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1772.182,1783.4,That depends on whether you consider it to be an ipso facto unfairness not to have a jury pronouncement that you committed all the elements of this crime.
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1821.335,1826.819,"--Well, I think there is an important distinction, Justice Scalia, between a total and a partial deprivation of any constitutional right."
1997.96-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1869.596,1875.53,Sullivan differs from this case in that there was a jury finding of the element.
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1885.618,1898.086,"That is one distinction, but there is also another, which is that in Sullivan the error spanned the entire trial and affected the entire jury deliberations, and the Court does distinguish between total and partial deprivations of a Sixth Amendment right."
1997.96-1279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1898.086,1906.542,"Mr. Nuechterlein, what is it that the Government concedes was error in the instruction here that we're talking about on the silencer?"
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1906.542,1910.512,The failure to give the jury an instruction on the Staples element.
1997.96-1279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1910.512,1912.385,"Well, be more specific."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1916.557,1922.631,The judge should have said that you must find that the defendant knew that his silencer was a silencer.
1997.96-1279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1922.631,1924.203,I've never heard... look--
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1940.975,1942.147,It is true that--
1997.96-1279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1942.147,1943.797,And that's not correct?
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1943.797,1946.148,--There is some ambiguity in this instruction.
1997.96-1279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1959.758,1965.922,"I just am trying to find out what it is the Government says that's missing, instead of just being ambiguous."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1977.279,1986.856,"--Well, there actually was similar language in count 2 also, but the difference is that in count 2 the district court also explicitly said... let me get the exact language."
1997.96-1279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1986.856,1991.941,It explicitly says that you don't have to know it was a firearm within the meaning of the statute.
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1991.941,1992.451,Right.
1997.96-1279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1992.451,1997.344,"And that's the instructions he wanted, but that is not the instruction that Staples requires."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2004.781,2010.072,I think we have assumed for the purposes of this case that he did request that instruction.
1997.96-1279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2010.072,2013.315,You made a lot of assumptions in order to have us decide a very important question.
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2013.315,2017.667,"No, I think we have addressed this issue by giving petitioner the benefit of the doubt."
1997.96-1279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2017.667,2017.957,Right.
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2017.957,2026.693,"This was an ambiguous instruction, and he did... if you read through the colloquy he did ask for what appeared to be the Staples element, and the district court did deny that request."
1997.96-1279,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2026.693,2032.247,"But that might be redundant, and certainly what Justice Thomas just read doesn't even seem ambiguous."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2058.924,2075.197,"It is possible to construe that assumption... it's possible to construe that instruction as telling the jury that it had to find that he possessed the item and that he knew that he possessed the item, but it is also possible for the jury, given his subsequent instruction, to find that he was telling them that he might have thought that the item was a pipe."
1997.96-1279,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2075.197,2085.034,"So in other words, if you charge the defendant with robbing a federally insured bank, or with robbing a bank, you also have to instruct and by the way, you know that a bank is a bank."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2088.774,2091.616,I'm not following your question.
1997.96-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2091.616,2093.569,Maybe a Federal bank is a better example.
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2110.529,2111.019,I--
1997.96-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2111.019,2113.411,"At least ambiguous, and maybe less than that."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2113.411,2119.124,"--I think it is ambiguous, and we have briefed this case on the assumption that he was denied the right that this Court--"
1997.96-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2119.124,2120.216,"Rightly so, in my view."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2120.216,2123.399,--thought he was denied when the Court granted certiorari.
1997.96-1279,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2123.399,2132.725,"The Moats case, which you cite at the outset of your brief, I think somewhat unfairly, you later explain I think quite accurately."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2138.817,2148.132,"Moats was not an instructional error, but it does support the general principle that a defendant is uniquely ill-positioned to claim on appeal that he was denied--"
1997.96-1279,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2148.132,2150.165,"Well, but it's not an element, it's not instructional error."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2155.369,2169.689,"--I don't think you have to overrule them, but what you do have to do is, at least in this context, curtail the principle that there is some important relationship between harmless error analysis and the underlying fairness of the defendant's trial."
1997.96-1279,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2183.355,2184.457,"Yes, but Mr.... I'm sorry."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2185.609,2186.257,--That was my answer.
1997.96-1279,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2186.257,2195.675,"In the normal question when we apply a harmless error analysis, we ask, can it be found beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the verdict."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2248.709,2250.941,I don't think I do agree with that proposition.
1997.96-1279,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2279.73,2298.764,"That it was a directed verdict, I mean, that's the strongest... to put their case in the strongest terms, you can't direct a verdict in a criminal case, and the way you have agreed that this case is shaped presents that question."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2338.481,2351.109,"I don't think that this case would be different if there had been a directed verdict on this element so long as the jury was able to assess all the other elements that he did not admit under oath, and so long as the jury played an essential role, but the important point is this."
1997.96-1279,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2351.58,2357.354,"Is that because the element was admitted, or because the element is somehow trivial compared to the other elements?"
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2357.354,2361.275,"--It is because the element was admitted, and I think the important point is--"
1997.96-1279,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2361.275,2361.775,Admitted.
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2361.775,2363.909,"--Admitted, and I think the important point is that this is--"
1997.96-1279,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2363.909,2370.481,So that you could direct a criminal... a verdict of guilty if the defendant admits all the essentials of the crime.
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2370.481,2370.812,--No.
1997.96-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2374.685,2379.189,"Nine-tenths, 9 out of 10 elements you can direct a verdict on, is that it?"
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2379.189,2379.929,I think--
1997.96-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2379.929,2381.76,"I mean, you know, how close do we slice this?"
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2381.76,2386.041,--So long as the jury plays an essential role in the determination of guilt or innocence--
1997.96-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2386.041,2386.442,I see--
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2386.442,2387.553,--and so long as the jury--
1997.96-1279,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2387.553,2388.355,--Essential as to what?
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2402.085,2405.417,--I think the public perceives that the jury has a very important role to play.
1997.96-1279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2424.773,2449.349,"Mr. Nuechterlein, when I practiced, and perhaps things have changed, when a judge directed a verdict he sat up there on the bench and told the jury, now, stand up, I'm going to... you know, this is not for you to deliberate, I'm going to direct you how to return, so either the jury was handed a piece of paper and they handed it back and did exactly what the judge... that, to me, was the judge directing a verdict, not omitting an element in the chart."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2451.731,2452.391,--That is correct.
1997.96-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2475.648,2497.251,"When there's a mandatory conclusive presumption, the jury comes in with a finding that that element was met pursuant to the presumption, and when you say certain conditions are met, the conditions are that that... either some other finding would have inevitably led to that, or that it have been admitted, but the jury would have come in with a finding, nonetheless."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2497.251,2515.283,"But I think that that finding, Justice Scalia, is an empty formalism, because the jury has been told that it must conclude that that element has been satisfied if it finds that the predicate element has been satisfied, so there is... from a juror's perspective there is absolutely no distinction between a mandatory conclusive presumption and the omission that occurred in this case."
1997.96-1279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2515.283,2520.138,"Mr. Nuechterlein, can I ask you to comment on a rather broad point that is troubling me about this case."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2556.52,2557.442,That is not it at all.
1997.96-1279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2568.568,2573.002,You thought it was so clear that even though some of us are troubled by the instruction you didn't even want to point it out to us.
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2573.002,2585.751,"--No, we didn't think it was clear, but where there is a deep ambiguity and the jury can reasonably construe that ambiguity against the need to find the element, we thought that this case was an appropriate vehicle for addressing the question presented the petitioner raised."
1997.96-1279,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2585.751,2587.063,Mr. Nuechterlein--
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2619.907,2623.638,In the ordinary case also the defendant doesn't admit that element.
1997.96-1279,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2623.638,2630.854,"So if you have a murder case and you forget to say that they have to find that there was a victim, you see, I mean, that would seem a serious problem."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2630.854,2632.604,Right.
1997.96-1279,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2632.604,2633.916,So you agree in that case.
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2696.367,2697.258,I think the standard is--
1997.96-1279,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2697.258,2698.157,That one or some other.
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2698.157,2701.78,--if the defendant admits the element under oath then the jury is not instructed on that element.
1997.96-1279,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2702.901,2719.181,"Well, even if he... in other words, if he admits, under oath, I murdered the victim, and what the judge does is walk in and say to the jury, jury, is the defendant guilty or not guilty, and the jury says, of what, they think to themselves."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2721.253,2729.42,"Well, I think that, you know, Justice Breyer, is a total deprivation of his right to a jury trial, and again I think that is distinct from the sort of case that you have here."
1997.96-1279,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2729.42,2737.467,"But then you're not agreeing with proposition 1 that... you're saying that... you're saying there is no omission, no omission of an element."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2737.467,2738.537,What I'm saying--
1997.96-1279,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2738.537,2743.351,That wouldn't be subject to harmless error no matter how central the element if a person admits it.
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2743.351,2746.313,--Centrality is not an important part of our test.
1997.96-1279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2765.685,2770.129,"Well, part of your discussion with Justice Breyer I think is fairly academic."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2785.779,2794.385,"I think it does, and the... it is also the case that where the jury has not addressed an issue like that it may very well be that the error is not harmless."
1997.96-1279,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2813.028,2813.696,Mr. Nuechterlein--
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2830.188,2834.28,"That is the limiting principle on our general theory of this case, but that's--"
1997.96-1279,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2834.28,2843.797,"What does the defendant's having admitted the element as opposed, say, to 10 witnesses having testified to it, have to do with that?"
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2843.797,2849.062,"--I... again, I think it comes down to your question of procedural fairness, which is what the harmless error doctrine is all about."
1997.96-1279,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2870.414,2893.201,"Mr. Nuechterlein, I don't... taking those two central elements of fairness and substantial activity by the jury in reaching the verdict it does render, I don't know why we shouldn't... if those are of such significance I don't know why we shouldn't change our standard for harmless error review in a very essential respect."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2960.935,2965.277,I think that the difference is with respect to the first of those that you identified.
1997.96-1279,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2985.96,2994.906,"It's not in a case in which a stipulation is involved, and yet if a stipulation of fact is involved and nothing more, we don't say sufficiency of the evidence is enough."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2994.906,3003.652,I actually think that a defendant's sworn testimony on an issue within his peculiar knowledge should be more binding on appeal than a stipulation would be.
1997.96-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3003.652,3006.964,"Mr. Nuechterlein, can I ask about the sworn testimony here."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,3024.427,3024.746,What he--
1997.96-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3024.746,3025.447,He was shown a silencer.
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,3053.577,3059.121,--His account of why he knew that silencer was a silencer is inconsistent with a rational jury's determination that--
1997.96-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3059.121,3064.613,"Ah, so we now do not have a precise admission of the very element that has to be proven."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,3064.613,3065.164,"--No, we do, and in fact--"
1997.96-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3065.164,3071.288,"But something which makes it almost incredible that that element didn't exist, but nonetheless not a precise admission of that element."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,3071.288,3075.7,"--It is a precise admission of that element, because no rational juror... and one--"
1997.96-1279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3075.7,3101.198,"We have an interesting little colloquy here, because it seems that several colleagues of mine have different points of view on the question presented, first whether there was really error here, and second whether it was really an admission and, of course, the question presented is whether a district court's failure to instruct the jury on an element of an offense is harmless error where at trial the defendant admitted that element."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,3102.679,3103.981,--The defendant did admit this element.
1997.96-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3113.855,3114.436,I knew it when?
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,3118.769,3119.458,--No.
1997.96-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3122.122,3123.361,--Right after his arrest.
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,3123.361,3123.712,Yes.
1997.96-1279,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3123.712,3128.484,"You're saying his admission was, if I had that, I knew what it was."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,3162.628,3181.971,"Well, I... I mean, I think that it is always the role of a reviewing court to determine what the facts of the case are, and there is no particular impediment in determining that he testified about some... about his own state of mind, which is an issue within his peculiar knowledge, and that he did so under circumstances where there was no question about whether he was telling the truth."
1997.96-1279,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3223.227,3228.252,"Mr. Nuechterlein, just a couple of clarifications."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,3271.942,3274.473,Does the Government concede--
1997.96-1279,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3274.473,3281.165,That the failure to instruct that the silencer was a firearm is an error?
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,3281.165,3284.008,--I don't think that's the error.
1997.96-1279,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3285.059,3287.911,That's the error that the court of appeals found.
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,3287.911,3300.96,I had understood the court of appeals to find that the error in this case was that he did not find... that the district court did not instruct the jury that it must find that the firearm possessed the characteristics that made it a firearm within the meaning of the statute.
1997.96-1279,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3300.96,3303.582,I think he knew that.
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,3303.582,3305.064,"Yes, that he knew that."
1997.96-1279,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3305.064,3313.199,"So your answer is, the Government does not concede that the failure to give a particular instruction was in error."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,3313.199,3313.74,That is--
1997.96-1279,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3313.74,3314.881,That that was--
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,3342.378,3342.778,--Yes.
1997.96-1279,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3346.431,3355.516,"No, whether Staples requires that there be an instruction that the silencer was a... that he knowingly possessed a firearm under the act."
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,3358.218,3367.274,--The error in this case was the district court's failure to tell the jury that it had to find... I guess I'm just not understanding your question.
1997.96-1279,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3376.671,3380.044,And you think that the court of appeals says that in this opinion?
1997.96-1279,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,3380.044,3381.564,That's how I understood the court of appeals opinion.
1997.96-1279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3381.564,3382.836,"Thank you, Mr. Nuechterlein."
1997.96-1279,2,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,3387.098,3389.308,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.96-1279,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3415.127,3416.747,"Thank you, Mr. Rubinstein."
