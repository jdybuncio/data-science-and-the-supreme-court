1971.71-123,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,43.037,"We will hear arguments next in 71-123, National Labor Relations Board against Burns International and Burns against the Board in Number 198."
1971.71-123,0,37058,norton_j_come,,46.623,51.321,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.71-123,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,115.162,140.785,"Mr. Come if –- perhaps this question is a little bit too early, but if you will bear in mind now certainly when you want, if Burns have not employed any of the Wackenhut people, they employed 27, I think some such figures, they have not employed any, would you contend they were a successor employer because they moved in and performed the same function?"
1971.71-123,0,37058,norton_j_come,,140.785,174.59,"I would say the fact that they -- well, as I will develop further to continuity of the employing enterprise is the test and among the factors that are very crucial there is the complement of the workforce and had they not employed for nondiscriminatory reasons, the Wackenhut employees, that would be a big factor for holding that they were not a successor."
1971.71-123,1,25420,gordon_a_gregory,,1577.011,1580.565,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.71-123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1718.322,1724.153,"Well, not in the service situations."
1971.71-123,1,25420,gordon_a_gregory,,1729.561,1743.594,"Well, Your Honor if I understand the question, I had understood that in for example the Board’s decision in maintenance, the physical acquisition of assets was not essential to a finding of successorship nor was privity --"
1971.71-123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1743.594,1750.433,"I know, but there was a deal that was -- was there a deal there between the predecessor and the successor?"
1971.71-123,1,25420,gordon_a_gregory,,1750.433,1752.12,Not in the Maintenance Incorporated.
1971.71-123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1752.12,1755.581,What about in the Government contract cases?
1971.71-123,1,25420,gordon_a_gregory,,1755.581,1762.623,"In annual maintenance, I do not believe there was privity or an understanding between the successor or predecessor in that case."
1971.71-123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1762.623,1777.417,And what about the Board decisions in Government contract cases where you – where -- on Government bids one person replaces another and the successor is held not to be bound?
1971.71-123,1,25420,gordon_a_gregory,,1777.417,1777.644,Yes.
1971.71-123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1784.245,1786.761,"Well, it did not overrule any prior cases, did it?"
1971.71-123,1,25420,gordon_a_gregory,,1786.761,1788.075,"No, it did not overrule Burns."
1971.71-123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1816.896,1838.9,What would you say if Burns had a collective bargaining agreement with another union that gave the other union the bargaining rights with respect to any of its installations in California and then with the one who has bid with Lockheed?
1971.71-123,1,25420,gordon_a_gregory,,1838.9,1843.618,"Well, that was asserted below Your Honor and rejected --"
1971.71-123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1843.618,1847.186,"I know it was rejected, but let us assume that it was true."
1971.71-123,1,25420,gordon_a_gregory,,1847.186,1865.273,This I would say would be one of the numerous factors to determine whether or not initially there was a successorship involved and whether the collective bargaining agreement of the predecessor bore a reasonable relation to that predecessor.
1971.71-123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1888.442,1892.379,"Well, was the wage scale of Burns actually lower than Wackenhut?"
1971.71-123,1,25420,gordon_a_gregory,,1892.379,1892.762,Yes.
1971.71-123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1906.831,1910.214,And was that wage rate higher than Burns’ other establishment?
1971.71-123,1,25420,gordon_a_gregory,,1910.214,1910.915,Yes it was.
1971.71-123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1919.609,1926.799,"Well, what would you say if the Burns, if the wage rates that Wackenhut had been lower than the Burns rate?"
1971.71-123,1,25420,gordon_a_gregory,,1926.799,1938.989,"Had they been lower, the employees would have been stuck with them, they had negotiated them and Burns could then pay those wages at that particular facility if in fact they were a successor."
1971.71-123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1938.989,1949.967,But you would not -- what you -- do you suppose -- I suppose the union would have objected but I am not sure the employees would have objected if they had been included in the Burns’ bargaining unit?
1971.71-123,1,25420,gordon_a_gregory,,1949.967,1972.551,"Perhaps not, Your Honor, but a companion case with Burns was the (Inaudible) Division wherein the union desired not to be bound by a collective bargaining agreement where there had been a change in ownership and the Board has indicated that the rule set forth in Burns would apply equally to unions as well as employers and I submit that is correct Your Honor."
1971.71-123,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1972.551,1979.225,"Well, except that Florida as I understand, it has given itself a little leeway in the Emerald Maintenance case, is that correct?"
1971.71-123,1,25420,gordon_a_gregory,,1979.225,1979.942,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.71-123,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1979.942,1997.422,"If in other words the wage rights that Wackenhut was paying were lower as a result of the fact that Wackenhut was a failing company or some other extraordinary reason, the Board has held that this Burns’ doctrine will not be applicable, has it not?"
1971.71-123,1,25420,gordon_a_gregory,,1997.422,1998.654,Yes it has.
1971.71-123,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2043.556,2066.731,"Mr. Gregory that language, successors and assigns, is that language historically had been the kind of language used to describe successors in this context or is that standard, lawyers work in contract in documents of all kind?"
1971.71-123,1,25420,gordon_a_gregory,,2066.731,2070.179,Mr. Chief Justice in my opinion it is standard.
1971.71-123,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2128.165,2132.033,"So there is a continuity factor from the standpoint of the employer too, is there not?"
1971.71-123,1,25420,gordon_a_gregory,,2149.475,2161.855,"If I understand the question Your Honor, Burns I do not believe would be any worse off in that situation unless you are alluding to the American Federation of Guards and (Voice Overlap)"
1971.71-123,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2161.855,2166.082,"Well, I am speaking to this particular union."
1971.71-123,1,25420,gordon_a_gregory,,2194.993,2198.506,I do not believe they would Your Honor.
1971.71-123,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2234.688,2247.491,"Would your position be the same if five or six or seven of the employees of Burns has gone over to Wackenhut, it is better if 20 or some?"
1971.71-123,1,25420,gordon_a_gregory,,2247.491,2248.999,Yes it would be Your Honor.
1971.71-123,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2250.559,2253.76,And how about none -- how about if there were no employees?
1971.71-123,1,25420,gordon_a_gregory,,2253.76,2279.904,"Well, I believe that was the situation in Monroe-Sander for example decided by the Second Circuit where the possible, either refusal to employ or transfer to the -- a new location or to the successor in turn might be either an unfair labor practice or as I understand Wiley, a breach of the collective bargaining agreement or a matter of subject to arbitration."
1971.71-123,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2368.862,2371.309,Thank you Mr. Gregory.
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2372.338,2375.528,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.71-123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2629.447,2643.465,"Mr. Gregory, do you contest the decision that the Union was the bargaining agent?"
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2643.465,2646.264,"We do, upon the takeover, yes."
1971.71-123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2654.398,2656.654,"Now, do you have to win on that?"
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2656.654,2660.012,"We do not have to win on that for the contract question, no."
1971.71-123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2660.012,2660.674,Why not?
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2672.414,2675.177,That is right.
1971.71-123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2677.289,2683.862,When -- if it is a successor how can we say that the -- that Burns is not bound?
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2683.862,2699.256,"Because Mr. Justice White, Section 8 (d) of the National Labor Relations Act very precisely proscribed certain powers to the Labor Board."
1971.71-123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2715.247,2725.555,"I know but the -- by becoming a successor, the employer agreed?"
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2725.555,2728.807,"In what regard, Mr. Justice?"
1971.71-123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2733.135,2735.275,"He became a successor voluntarily, didn't he?"
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2735.275,2735.924,That is correct.
1971.71-123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2740.21,2744.55,He says I voluntarily want to be a successor?
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2744.55,2751.226,"Alright, but the law for 35 years to that time was that a successor was not obligated to honor the agreement."
1971.71-123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2751.226,2752.862,Even though he was obligated to bargain with (Voice Overlap)?
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2752.862,2754.154,"To bargain, yes sir."
1971.71-123,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2761.418,2766.535,And the parties by saying successors and assigns could not make that?
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2766.535,2767.116,Of course not.
1971.71-123,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2797.77,2807.917,"Well, the Second Circuit opinion that we are reviewing here held that your client was a successor and had to bargain, but that it was not bound by the contract bid?"
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2807.917,2810.438,"That is correct, Mr. Justice, that is correct."
1971.71-123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2810.438,2812.955,And you petitioned for a cert on the first part?
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2812.955,2815.452,"On the first part, on the successorship part."
1971.71-123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2815.452,2818.123,You say you are not obligated even to bargain?
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2818.123,2832.01,That is correct because this small facility operation was not an employing industry as that term should be applied in order to have stability.
1971.71-123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2879.348,2897.448,"Well, if it were clear in events that it refer -- that in a situation like -- is that in a transaction like Burns engaged in that you are (a) going to have to bargain and (b) honor collective bargaining contract then I do not know what confusion there would be?"
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2905.404,2907.148,"Well, they could not interchange employees."
1971.71-123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2922.477,2923.555,I do not understand that.
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2923.555,2934.104,"Well because if over here, this Job A, you have Union X and over at Job B, you have Union Y and you have Union shop agreements with both of them and require a union membership within 30 days."
1971.71-123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2942.13,2942.845,"Well, that is true."
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2954.884,2968.71,"We think it is in this small, narrow area of service industry Mr. Justice and that is why I am not -- we are not trying for a principle of law here that will stop the general rule of successorship and the obligation to bargain."
1971.71-123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2980.776,2982.601,You mean requiring you to bargain?
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2982.601,2985.042,Requiring you to bargain as opposed to the agreement.
1971.71-123,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3016.882,3022.496,Does it not involve (Inaudible) your right to shift these men from place to place?
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3022.496,3025.383,Yes.
1971.71-123,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3025.412,3035.269,"Well, I would submit that on your hypothetical on the plant and maybe if you try to shift in the union it might have a good grievance?"
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3035.269,3038.02,"Well, it depends on the collective bargaining, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1971.71-123,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3038.02,3040.274,That is what you -- you just do not want to agree with it?
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3040.274,3040.85,No.
1971.71-123,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3069.085,3071.763,How broadly the service industry in your mind?
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3071.763,3077.517,I am thinking particularly of a maintenance contractor and the guard service primarily.
1971.71-123,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3102.273,3111.117,"How about in the Lockheed Company if a machine is conscious of customers and knows, does that take Lockheed out?"
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3111.117,3111.811,No.
1971.71-123,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3115.527,3117.309,It has to go through the grievance procedure?
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3117.309,3119.106,And it goes through the grievance procedure.
1971.71-123,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3134.088,3138.539,I agree with (Voice Overlap) this great difference of the service industry?
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3138.539,3155.722,And we submit that there is a difference because of the -- primarily of the interchange in the integration and the fact that you are operating at hundreds and hundreds of different locations in the same general area and every location becomes a bargaining unit.
1971.71-123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3160.754,3172.296,"Well, I take it that the Board indicated that you could -- that it would be a wholly different case if you would decide it to bring it on -- bring in your own employees, had not hired any of the Wackenhut employees?"
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3172.296,3176.77,"Well, Mr. Come did not say that exactly."
1971.71-123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3232.884,3242.6,Will you have to -- will they have to be required with some sort of possibility to be almost (Inaudible)?
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3242.6,3244.633,Yes.
1971.71-123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3326.43,3334.208,"In Wiley, if the arbitrator had ultimately decides that the successor was bound?"
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3334.208,3335.687,No problem with that.
1971.71-123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3337.357,3344.205,The Act does not prohibit a successor from being bound by a pair of contract that he never agreed to?
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3344.205,3358.53,Section 301 and the policy created by this Court that it favors arbitration as the method of resolving these disputes is not circumscribed by Section 8 (d).
1971.71-123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3364.363,3377.436,(Inaudible) but the successor was bound by everything in the contract even though he never agreed and even though he never agreed to those?
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3377.436,3404.351,"That is correct and that we feel is with -- in the interest of following the policy of promoting arbitration and using arbitration as the manner in the means of resolving these disputes, but let the arbitrator who has as Mr. Justice Douglas has said that the person who has most competence in this area, who has the knowledge of the law to shop, let him be the one who decide that."
1971.71-123,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3456.24,3458.706,What is the caption of that case and I guess (Voice Overlap)
1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3458.706,3471.056,"The caption of the case is National Labor Relations Board versus Interstate 65 Corporation, DBA Continental Inn, before judges Weick, Celebrezze and Peck."
1971.71-123,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3471.056,3472.738,"Interstate, what is it called?"

1971.71-123,2,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3480.531,3486.958,"Thirtieth, Number 71-1198 in the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit."
1971.71-123,3,37058,norton_j_come,,4685.033,4685.833,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.71-123,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4685.833,4691.455,"Just what does the Court opinion means, this under contract?"
1971.71-123,3,37058,norton_j_come,,4691.455,4694.612,I refer you to appendix 10.
1971.71-123,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4694.612,4695.361,"Yes, that is what I am looking at."
1971.71-123,3,37058,norton_j_come,,4695.361,4702.622,"In which the Board says, we find therefore that Burns is bound to that contract as if it were a signatory thereto."
1971.71-123,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4708.254,4712.22,"But 8 (d) is not an independent unfair labor practice, is it?"
