1998.97-1230,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.022,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 97 1230, the City of West Covina v. Lawrence Perkins."
1998.97-1230,0,21133,david_d_lawrence,,10.506,13.241,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1998.97-1230,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,140.075,142.867,Because he didn't have the warrant number.
1998.97-1230,0,21133,david_d_lawrence,,164.641,171.975,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't believe the record is clear that the warrant number or the absence of it really prevented the respondents from obtaining the return of the property."
1998.97-1230,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,171.975,177.849,"But whether that's so or not, it would make it easier if you had the warrant number to look up."
1998.97-1230,0,21133,david_d_lawrence,,177.849,179.041,It might.
1998.97-1230,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,224.85,242.323,"Well, Mr. Lawrence, I... that's all well and good and it may not violate the Constitution to do what the city did, but like Justice Ginsburg, I wonder why the city doesn't want to help its citizens by giving them the information that would be useful, like a correct warrant number."
1998.97-1230,0,21133,david_d_lawrence,,257.802,261.995,"--Your Honor, the record does not show that it is a policy of the city not to provide a search warrant number."
1998.97-1230,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,281.857,290.062,"But if you have the number, as I understand it, it's the Federal practice they leave you a copy of the warrant so you have it, just a copy of the warrant, right there."
1998.97-1230,0,21133,david_d_lawrence,,290.062,291.625,That's correct.
1998.97-1230,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,292.185,299.019,All it takes is a piece of carbon paper and it seems so simple and would avoid snafus like this.
1998.97-1230,0,21133,david_d_lawrence,,299.019,305.514,"--But, Your Honor, the record also shows that the warrant number was not the only way to access that information at the courthouse."
1998.97-1230,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,330.99,349.572,Do you think that the Ninth Circuit in this case erred in a principle of law that it stated or was its error simply an improper application of a correct principle of law?
1998.97-1230,0,21133,david_d_lawrence,,349.572,353.625,I believe it was an error of law.
1998.97-1230,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,353.625,356.708,And what was that error of law?
1998.97-1230,0,21133,david_d_lawrence,,356.708,363.481,The error of law is that notice is required in the postdeprivation Parratt Hudson context.
1998.97-1230,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,367.036,370.288,"Well, is notice required that there has been a seizure?"
1998.97-1230,0,21133,david_d_lawrence,,370.288,371.319,--Pardon me?
1998.97-1230,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,371.319,375.131,Does the State have to give notice that a seizure has occurred?
1998.97-1230,0,21133,david_d_lawrence,,375.131,377.933,That's one of the issues in our brief.
1998.97-1230,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,384.768,387.771,"Well, I guess we could turn this into a Fourth Amendment case."
1998.97-1230,0,21133,david_d_lawrence,,411.786,422.292,--I agree that there are... there are cases where a person might be unaware that a property right has been affected and that some sort of notice in that context might be appropriate.
1998.97-1230,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,425.735,435.431,"But even... you know, even where you realize your property has been taken, if you come home and find your house has been ransacked, you still want to know who did it."
1998.97-1230,0,21133,david_d_lawrence,,435.431,436.152,Absolutely.
1998.97-1230,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,438.423,461.498,"Well, what if the city... if it... if we were in a predeprivation situation and the city wanted to take property of the... the person, the citizen, now you agree that due process would require giving some notice to the person of the State's or the city's intention to take their property."
1998.97-1230,0,21133,david_d_lawrence,,461.498,463.439,--Generally I would agree.
1998.97-1230,1,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1014.582,1026.372,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1998.97-1230,2,38327,patrick_s_smith,,1614.868,1620.104,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1998.97-1230,3,21133,david_d_lawrence,,3359.356,3361.528,If I could make a couple of points.
1998.97-1230,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3423.601,3426.101,"Thank you, Mr. Lawrence."
