1986.85-1798,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,0.0,3.868,"Now, that concept must stop short of private litigants who merely ask the state courts for relief win at trial and then ask that the judgments in their favor be duly recorded, because if the state action concept reached that far then every state court proceeding would automatically become a target for a federal injunction and the 1983 exception would then utterly swallow the anti-injunction rule."
1986.85-1798,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,87.422,91.074,"Mr. Tribe, let me ask you where this goes."
1986.85-1798,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,113.673,116.208,"--No, I think they would have preferred New York."
1986.85-1798,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,116.208,117.158,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1986.85-1798,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,117.158,120.327,"Whoever they sued, I think there is a more fundamental problem."
1986.85-1798,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,150.479,156.383,"So you're not saying... your basic argument is not that this is not a state actor, but that there is no state action here?"
1986.85-1798,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,156.383,160.585,"--Well, in the background of the case, in enacting its laws Texas acted."
1986.85-1798,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,225.86,234.431,"Well, this is very close, though, to Lugar versus Edmondson Oil, isn't it, in terms of asking what's under color of state law?"
1986.85-1798,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,237.668,237.801,--Justice O'Connor--
1986.85-1798,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,237.801,242.62,--it seems to me that this is a pretty close relative of Lugar.
1986.85-1798,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,242.62,250.226,"--It's a distant relative of Lugar, I think, Justice O'Connor, because in Justice White's majority opinion in Lugar care was taken--"
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1292.68,1297.001,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1395.515,1404.603,Does this argument go to the fact that there would have been or was a due process violation by requiring this bond?
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1404.603,1404.903,"Yes, it does."
1986.85-1798,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1419.53,1424.517,"Well, Mr. Boies, I guess that doesn't answer their priority argument, though, does it?"
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1437.742,1447.549,"Justice O'Connor, I think it does answer the priority issue, because under Texas law the reason for the priority is to assure collectibility."
1986.85-1798,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1535.655,1542.094,"Well, what if other people, after Pennzoil got its judgment, got similar judgments against Texaco?"
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1546.813,1547.479,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1798,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1566.208,1569.143,"Well, it may not have been raised, but that's what most priority statutes are for."
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1578.683,1584.986,"But I would urge the Court to consider two facts in this particular context, Your Honor."
1986.85-1798,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1616.291,1619.576,"And this is an argument directed to the merits, I take it?"
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1619.576,1629.015,--This goes as part of the Court of Appeals' consideration that there was fair ground to litigate the issue of the due process.
1986.85-1798,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1629.015,1641.006,Is the view of the Court of Appeals then that a bond statute that may be perfectly fair in 99 percent of the cases can be enjoined in the rare case where it feels it's unfair?
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1641.006,1666.723,"I think it is the view of the Court of Appeals that there is at least fair grounds to litigate that, where you have a bond that is unnecessary and impossible to achieve, for all the reasons both the district court and the Court of Appeals indicate, and would have the kind of effect that this bond would have, it can be enjoined on an as-applied basis."
1986.85-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1666.723,1669.139,"I don't why you put the ""unnecessary"" in there."
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1671.675,1684.851,"I think the argument if it were just impossible, Justice White, would not be nearly as strong as where it is both impossible and unnecessary."
1986.85-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1684.851,1686.601,"Well, I know, but you'd still be making it."
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1700.445,1701.528,"Well, the impossibility--"
1986.85-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1701.528,1703.813,Without going... and that it would precipitate bankruptcy.
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1703.813,1707.848,--I think the impossibility was an important part of the Court of Appeals' decision.
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1728.797,1732.666,But where do you get jurisdiction in White Plains?
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1732.666,1739.736,"Justice Marshall, I think that that's a question I clearly want to address."
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1739.736,1741.522,I hope so.
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1741.522,1754.329,"Under 1983, under Section 1983, if there is state action certainly there was jurisdiction for the court to entertain this claim."
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1774.909,1776.695,"Well, could you have filed it in Anchorage?"
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1776.695,1780.563,--Could this case have been filed in Anchorage?
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1780.563,1781.03,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1781.03,1782.265,I think--
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1782.265,1787.633,And then go from there to Honolulu while you're at it.
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1787.633,1791.954,"--I don't think so, Justice Marshall."
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1791.954,1792.704,"Well, what's the difference?"
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1795.156,1800.774,"Well, one of the differences was, Your Honor, of course, New York was the home of--"
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1800.774,1801.476,You admit you're shopping?
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1802.276,1804.595,"--We don't, Your Honor."
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1841.235,1842.268,Is that in the record?
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1842.268,1843.053,--What?
1986.85-1798,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1845.589,1848.457,Are factors like that mentioned in the venue statute?
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1859.563,1865.217,"No, but where the injury occurred typically is, Your Honor."
1986.85-1798,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1865.217,1868.769,"Well, you say the injury occurred in New York, rather than Texas?"
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1868.769,1877.524,"Well, New York was the situs where all of the transactions took place, and indeed the Texas court was applying New York law to this case."
1986.85-1798,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1877.524,1885.714,"Well, but the injury your client suffered was the refusal of a Texas court to relieve the bond requirement under Texas law, wasn't it?"
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1885.714,1891.551,"And the injury would certainly have occurred in Texas, Your Honor, I agree with that."
1986.85-1798,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1897.772,1903.842,And so you say you could file this action wherever you could find Pennzoil doing business?
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1903.842,1909.18,I think it is conceivable under the venue statutes that other places could have been chosen.
1986.85-1798,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1927.541,1939.265,"Mr. Boies, can I ask you a question, if your three elements, your necessity, impossibility, and so forth, justify this extraordinary relief."
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1959.642,1962.88,I do not believe that the size of the company has anything to do with it.
1986.85-1798,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1962.88,1971.2,"So that any time a litigant who is having a great deal of difficulty posting appropriate security could make comparable allegations, it has a 1983 claim?"
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1971.2,1978.104,"I think that where you have the combination of impossibility and lack of need, that is true."
1986.85-1798,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1978.104,1982.722,"It could make the allegations an is entitled to a hearing on those allegations, that's what I really should say."
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1982.722,1985.258,Assuming that he makes out a prima facie case.
1986.85-1798,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1985.258,1990.245,"Word for word the same as yours, except we're a grocery store and we own some vacant land out in Iowa."
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1990.245,1995.398,And if the same allegations could be made--
1986.85-1798,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1995.398,1998.767,We will go into bankruptcy if we have to pay this judgment.
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,1998.767,1999.367,--entitled to go into court.
1986.85-1798,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1999.367,2001.135,That we can't sell the farm that fast.
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2001.135,2013.11,"It's a little more than that, Your Honor, because although the size of the company doesn't I think determine the rule of law, the size and the amount of judgment here does have something to do with the impossibility."
1986.85-1798,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2013.11,2016.395,"Well, size relative to the amount of assets you can readily accumulate."
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2016.395,2019.014,There are two elements to impossibility.
1986.85-1798,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2023.633,2024.335,Right.
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2024.335,2030.572,The other is the size of the judgment relative to the worldwide bonding capacity.
1986.85-1798,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2033.072,2041.844,"Well, in my hypothetical I just have bonding companies don't particularly want to do business with us based on just this Iowa asset."
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2044.213,2060.739,"--Right, and I think that if you have just the situation where you have a bonding company that doesn't want to do business with this farm or small business, you may not have the lack of need that you do in a case such as this."
1986.85-1798,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2060.739,2066.643,"No, they say in due course we can liquidate this assets, we go into bankruptcy and there'll be plenty of money to pay the judgment."
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2068.109,2075.581,I think that there's a strong argument that many of the same policies that underlie the Court of Appeals decision would apply there.
1986.85-1798,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2086.954,2090.757,"Well, the plaintiff alleges absolute impossibility in each case and then he's got to prove."
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2090.757,2091.841,"--Then he's got to prove it, yes."
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2145.074,2145.393,And you litigate.
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2149.278,2150.928,--But when they try to--
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2150.928,2151.713,Isn't that right?
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2151.713,2153.463,--Under Texas--
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2153.463,2154.415,Or are you just going to pay it?
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2154.415,2168.472,"--Well, under Texas law there is no opportunity to litigate it unless you bring in state court what we did in federal court, an independent action to try to stop them from doing that."
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2168.472,2170.258,"Well, why didn't you do that?"
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2170.258,2173.293,"We chose, Your Honor, the federal forum."
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2173.293,2177.328,"Well, why didn't you use the federal forum in Texas?"
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2180.38,2182.399,"Yes, Your Honor, we did."
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2223.856,2228.558,The venue statute on injunctions clearly gave you that right?
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2235.229,2235.898,No.
1986.85-1798,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2244.104,2245.27,The general venue statute?
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2245.27,2249.056,"--The general venue statute, to choose whether we came into New York or Texas."
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2255.043,2255.843,That's right.
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2255.843,2258.026,But if you assume that we had a 1983 claim--
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2258.026,2260.561,Can you survive here without the 1983 claim?
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2260.561,2263.163,"--No, Your Honor, I don't believe we can."
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2263.163,2265.299,"Well, how do you get under it?"
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2265.299,2283.66,"I think we get under it, Your Honor, as they did in Lugar, by demonstrating that what you have is state action in terms of the attachment under the bond, either the execution under the bond provision or the attachment under the lien."
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2283.66,2291.266,"Do you really think 1983 was passed to protect multi-million dollar, billion dollar corporations?"
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2291.266,2304.824,"Your Honor, I think 1983 was passed to protect important civil rights, and I believe that those important civil rights, as this Court has repeatedly held, include rights of property as well as other civil rights."
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2304.824,2309.561,That it only applies to a multi-billion dollar corporation.
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2311.844,2312.38,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2312.38,2317.132,"You said that's the basis, because it's so much money involved."
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2326.42,2332.324,"No, Your Honor, we're not arguing that and if I have made that argument I apologize."
1986.85-1798,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2344.484,2347.184,Let me just interrupt you right there.
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2369.366,2374.186,I think there are two aspects of it.
1986.85-1798,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2393.065,2395.75,Why not?
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2395.75,2414.878,"Because I think that if what you are attacking, if what you're trying to do is attack the underlying merits of the judgment and in effect do what Pennzoil counsel says we're trying to do, which is sidetrack and stop the state proceeding, Your Honor--"
1986.85-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2414.878,2419.246,At least the district court judge must have agreed with something.
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2419.246,2429.186,"--Yes, although even our original complaint, Your Honor, only asked for an injunction on the timing of enforcement."
1986.85-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2462.788,2464.74,"What is your second safeguard, in answer to Justice--"
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2464.74,2495.342,"--The second safeguard is the fact that we think it is going to be an unusual case where you are going to have a clear case that the bond is not necessary and a clear case where the bond would be truly impossible to post and, third, a case where execution or putting on liens would have such great difficulty and cause such irreparable injury."
1986.85-1798,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2495.342,2504.198,--Wouldn't the ability to post the bond depend to some extent on whether or not the party had a deep pocket?
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2504.198,2514.673,"It would, Your Honor, in relationship, certainly, the size of the pocket to the size of the judgment."
1986.85-1798,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2516.223,2520.208,Does 1983 jurisdiction depend on the size of the pocket?
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2520.208,2521.66,--It does not.
1986.85-1798,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2528.83,2533.217,"Well, to a certain extent, the shallower the pocket the more need for a bond."
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2533.217,2536.919,"Precisely, precisely right, Your Honor."
1986.85-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2553.548,2559.702,You'd put them right into bankruptcy in the effort of collecting your judgment.
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2559.702,2561.652,That sometimes happens.
1986.85-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2561.652,2564.569,Without any 1983 problem at all?
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2564.569,2566.771,"I think that's right, Your Honor."
1986.85-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2578.996,2591.506,So it certainly in your mind doesn't raise any due process problem if the size of the bond that the state law requires is impossible to meet by the defendant?
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2591.506,2593.023,I think it does--
1986.85-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2593.023,2595.125,Unless you have this other aspect to it?
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2595.125,2597.66,"--I think it does raise issues, Your Honor."
1986.85-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2675.474,2679.877,Did you submit in that letter or in any filing down there any constitutional issues?
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2679.877,2684.579,We did not expressly assert the constitutional--
1986.85-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2684.579,2685.446,"Well, or impliedly?"
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2685.446,2697.756,"--Well, we raised the question that we were going to, unless some relief was granted, be driven into bankruptcy, and that the security was not needed."
1986.85-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2731.076,2736.128,"Can I ask you, Mr. Boies, suppose there just weren't any remedies there."
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2739.266,2751.907,"Your Honor, I don't think that it would be a Younger case because, as this court in Middlesex points out, there are three steps that you have to go through to determine whether or not Younger is applicable."
1986.85-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2754.526,2757.561,"Well, there was."
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2758.394,2764.465,"Well, I think that footnote 9 in the Trainor case suggests that this is not a proceeding."
1986.85-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2764.465,2765.465,"Well, assume there is a proceeding going on down there."
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2767.667,2767.9,Right.
1986.85-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2774.554,2775.52,And that's what you really--
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2775.52,2781.041,And we really say that there is no vital or important state interest.
1986.85-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2783.16,2785.778,--Although enough to trigger 1983.
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2785.778,2792.848,"--There is state action to trigger 1983, but the state interest--"
1986.85-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2792.848,2793.381,All right.
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2793.381,2795.383,--has to be in the proceeding.
1986.85-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2795.383,2795.917,Right.
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2795.917,2799.252,Mr. Tribe properly identifies what that proceeding is.
1986.85-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2803.573,2805.223,"Well, the interest is to enforce the judgment, he said."
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2805.223,2806.275,Yes.
1986.85-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2818.583,2819.449,Would be a Younger abstention case.
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2819.449,2820.566,--would be a Younger abstention case.
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2820.566,2824.153,Is your state action the action of the court?
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2824.153,2827.522,"No, Justice Marshall."
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2827.522,2827.939,"Well, what is it?"
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2829.739,2836.044,The state action would be the action of the sheriffs and the abstract personnel.
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2836.044,2837.694,But they're not before your court.
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2840.912,2842.364,"No, they're not, Your Honor."
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2854.506,2856.874,Without Lugar are you lost?
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2856.874,2861.16,"--Well, I wouldn't say that we were lost."
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2867.914,2869.599,"Well, suppose Lugar was distinguished."
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2871.467,2872.933,"I don't think we would be lost, Your Honor."
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2872.933,2874.769,"Well, what else would you have."
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2874.769,2875.619,It would depend on how it was distinguished.
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2875.619,2877.121,What else would you have?
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2877.121,2884.608,I think what we would have if Lugar were distinguished is that we would have the fact of the state action.
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2885.977,2892.214,"Your state action is an appealable order, right?"
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2892.214,2901.237,--I would say state action would include something even if it were not directly appealable.
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2901.237,2905.022,"But it is in this case, it is an appealable order?"
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2911.109,2917.746,"I think, with respect, Justice Marshall, that's not right."
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2975.868,2983.022,"You mean an action of a state court is not appealable to any court in the state, right?"
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2983.022,2985.324,Excuse me?
1986.85-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2985.324,2986.759,"Because if not, it's appealable here."
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,2986.759,2996.365,"The judgment on the merits ultimately will be appealable here, Your Honor."
1986.85-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3154.317,3160.305,"Mr. Boies, I take it that if you win in this case you won't be back in court on 1988?"
1986.85-1798,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3161.84,3165.291,"Thank you, Mr. Boies."
1986.85-1798,1,20629,david_boies,,3165.291,3166.66,Thank you.
1986.85-1798,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3166.66,3169.043,"Mr. Tribe, you have eight minutes remaining."
1986.85-1798,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3169.043,3172.897,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-1798,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3286.385,3288.987,"Well, that's really the Rooker-Feldman line of cases, isn't it?"
1986.85-1798,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3288.987,3292.206,"Well, there is a relationship, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-1798,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3327.981,3336.318,"Yes, but I wonder if your point under the Rooker-Feldman Act isn't perhaps stronger than your 1983 state action."
1986.85-1798,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3336.318,3339.187,"Well, we think it's certainly as strong, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1986.85-1798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3439.451,3447.974,It would be a Younger case any time you went into federal court to try to block the enforcement of a judgment.
1986.85-1798,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3447.974,3451.176,"--If you're trying to block the enforcement of a judgment, we think that's right."
1986.85-1798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3451.176,3452.143,Right across the board.
1986.85-1798,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3452.143,3458.547,"But ordinarily you wouldn't get the federal court to reach the Younger issue, because 2283 would be a bar."
1986.85-1798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3462.499,3463.482,"Well, I know, if you accept that."
1986.85-1798,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3467.236,3468.336,That's true.
1986.85-1798,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3507.961,3508.811,Why not?
1986.85-1798,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3508.811,3513.364,"Well, because it's not in our interest to see them driven into bankruptcy, Justice Stevens."
1986.85-1798,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3513.364,3514.564,Don't you just want to get paid?
1986.85-1798,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3514.564,3519.184,"We want to get paid, but we don't want to have the world come crashing down."
1986.85-1798,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3526.172,3529.89,"If you're that reasonable, maybe you could have settled this dispute and not taken our time."
1986.85-1798,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3530.492,3535.278,--I think efforts... I'm told efforts have been made about that.
1986.85-1798,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3591.113,3595.665,He says it's only impossible if the judgment exceeds the bonding capacity of the whole world.
1986.85-1798,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3595.665,3598.684,"--Well, it's only impossible in a metaphysical sense."
1986.85-1798,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3647.298,3650.717,"Thank you, Mr. Tribe."
