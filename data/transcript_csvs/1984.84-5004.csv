1984.84-5004,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.034,We will hear arguments next in Ball against United States.
1984.84-5004,0,33598,jo_s_widener,,56.918,74.99,"May it please the Court, I am here this morning on behalf of Truman Lewis Ball to ask the Court to vacate one of his convictions and one of his sentences under the cases of United States against Batchelder and Blockburger against the United States."
1984.84-5004,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,267.608,275.776,"Ms. Widener, the government says you didn't make these arguments in the Court of Appeals, and therefore we shouldn't consider them."
1984.84-5004,0,33598,jo_s_widener,,275.776,280.418,"Your Honor, we would argue that we did make these arguments."
1984.84-5004,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,303.281,307.535,I don't think anyone doubts you appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.
1984.84-5004,0,33598,jo_s_widener,,311.997,314.889,"Yes, Your Honor, they were exactly the same as we are making hare."
1984.84-5004,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,446.168,449.08,Isn't that really the first and last question?
1984.84-5004,0,33598,jo_s_widener,,467.079,469.052,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that is true."
1984.84-5004,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,626.894,632.598,"Ms. Widener, does conviction alone constitute punishment?"
1984.84-5004,0,33598,jo_s_widener,,632.598,638.023,"--Yes, Your Honor, we say that conviction alone does constitute punishment."
1984.84-5004,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,659.144,674.137,"Well, has this Court specifically held that a second conviction with a concurrent sentence is to be treated as punishment for purposes of the double jeopardy clause?"
1984.84-5004,0,33598,jo_s_widener,,674.137,677.928,"Your Honor, I could find no specific holding as to that effect."
1984.84-5004,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,701.913,712.58,"Well, I think in our Ohio against Johnson case, last spring, I thought we said there could be two convictions so long as there weren't two punishments."
1984.84-5004,0,33598,jo_s_widener,,712.58,738.138,"Your Honor, we would argue that a second conviction in this case is an additional punishment on Mr. Ball, and because of the effect of his concurrent sentence here, he is also suffering additional punishment, and very realistically may suffer an extra year on his punishment."
1984.84-5004,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,738.138,748.193,"If you are arguing sentencing, there is no doubt, at least in my mind, that you are correct, but to say that the conviction as well amounts to a punishment I think is more debatable."
1984.84-5004,0,33598,jo_s_widener,,748.193,776.092,"I think that under the cases of Sylburn against Ohio and Street and that line of cases in which the Court looked to whether or not there were adverse legal consequences of convictions, I believe the Court has said that these consequences do exist, and in this case, this man is a man who is not well educated."
1984.84-5004,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,827.875,846.708,"Perhaps even if your Blockburger analysis is right, the answer is, he may not be sentenced on both convictions, but he can be convicted on both of them, and in that case your argument that he couldn't convince people that he shouldn't have had two convictions would be true because he ought not to be able to convince people that he shouldn't have two convictions."
1984.84-5004,0,33598,jo_s_widener,,846.708,868.563,"Well, Your Honor, I would, I guess, fall back on the argument that since Congress has not told us specifically what to do in this situation, it has not told us when this conduct violates those two statutes, whether we should convict or sentence under both."
1984.84-5004,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,906.168,916.413,"As I read the government's brief, they are really arguing a sort of harmless error without calling it that."
1984.84-5004,0,33598,jo_s_widener,,946.402,947.194,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-5004,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1003.051,1007.364,"Well, we will wait to see what your friend has to say about that when his turn comes."
1984.84-5004,0,33598,jo_s_widener,,1049.921,1062.329,"--Well, I certainly should have, Your Honor, because we do argue that these convictions themselves were a problem."
1984.84-5004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1064.72,1066.022,"Well, you can't punish them."
1984.84-5004,0,33598,jo_s_widener,,1072.965,1076.789,"--But Your Honor, there is a real--"
1984.84-5004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1076.789,1084.673,The question the government may have to elect which to proceed on before trial.
1984.84-5004,0,33598,jo_s_widener,,1084.673,1086.155,--I beg your pardon?
1984.84-5004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1086.155,1092.968,Are you arguing that the government should have to elect which statute to proceed under before trial?
1984.84-5004,0,33598,jo_s_widener,,1092.968,1095.011,"No, we are not arguing that."
1984.84-5004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1098.223,1106.62,"When does the limitation on the conviction come, when the judge instructs the jury and you tell the jury you can only convict on one of these?"
1984.84-5004,0,33598,jo_s_widener,,1106.62,1108.101,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-5004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1108.101,1109.443,Is that what you think should happen?
1984.84-5004,0,33598,jo_s_widener,,1109.443,1118.709,"Under Melanovich, or indeed, if he does not instruct the jury that way, he should not allow two convictions to be imposed on these two statutes."
1984.84-5004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1118.709,1123.06,Because you think that is the intent of Congress?
1984.84-5004,0,33598,jo_s_widener,,1123.06,1124.342,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1984.84-5004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1140.592,1159.395,"Well, assuming you are right, but there are still concurrent sentences, and you must at least convince us that the two convictions instead of one will have an adverse consequence on your client."
1984.84-5004,0,33598,jo_s_widener,,1159.395,1180.358,"Well, Your Honor, I believe that the convictions will have, because of the concept of recidivism statutes, where he now under this record has at least his third conviction because of this excessive conviction."
1984.84-5004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1192.915,1201.983,"On that basis, the whole concurrent... that approach would undermine the entire concurrent sentence doctrine, if there ever was one."
1984.84-5004,0,33598,jo_s_widener,,1201.983,1203.412,"Well, Your Honor--"
1984.84-5004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1203.412,1206.314,Because your argument would almost always be true.
1984.84-5004,0,33598,jo_s_widener,,1206.314,1212.209,"--Well, certainly under these facts it is true in this particular case."
1984.84-5004,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1295.203,1302.298,"I can see how you could reimpose a sentence, but I don't see how you could reimpose a conviction if it were vacated."
1984.84-5004,0,33598,jo_s_widener,,1304.209,1305.771,"Yes, Your Honor, that's what I mean."
1984.84-5004,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1308.753,1318.179,"That is hardly much solace to the government, that they have a chance to try the person again for something which he has already been convicted of."
1984.84-5004,0,33598,jo_s_widener,,1318.179,1342.737,"--Of course, in most situations that is not going to arise, however, because the court under the concurrent sentence doctrine determines one sentence is valid before they determine not to look at the other sentence, so the chance of having the first sentence that has already been determined to be valid reversed is very minimal."
1984.84-5004,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1371.154,1374.206,Very well.
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1376.196,1392.697,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to first briefly discuss our waiver argument with reference to the colloquy that Justice Rehnquist had with my opponent."
1984.84-5004,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1392.697,1393.678,"Would you raise your voice a little, Mr. Pincus?"
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1393.678,1394.349,I am sorry.
1984.84-5004,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1436.067,1439.32,May I ask you a question about that?
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1442.331,1444.001,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-5004,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1444.001,1446.052,And the Court of Appeals did not do that.
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1448.824,1449.445,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-5004,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1449.445,1454.359,So then isn't the issue of whether the second sentence should be vacated something we rust decide?
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1455.147,1461.972,"Well, Your Honor, the relief that is requested here and the thrust of petitioner's argument--"
1984.84-5004,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1461.972,1462.653,"They ask that you set aside the conviction, right."
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1462.653,1463.094,--is the conviction.
1984.84-5004,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1480.224,1495.215,"I understand that she asked for that, but it is true that she also makes the argument that the second sentence on which he is on probation is a burden that would be set aside if we went farther... if we did what the Court of Appeals was asked to do."
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1495.996,1497.405,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-5004,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1515.148,1521.01,"Well, do you think that putting him on probation on the second sentence complies with the mandate of the Court of Appeals or does not?"
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1521.01,1530.246,--We think that the concept of being on probation while someone is in prison is a difficult one.
1984.84-5004,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1535.57,1542.615,"But don't you think in kind of a real world sense, would he not be better off if he were not on probation on the second sentence, if it were just not there?"
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1543.895,1559.455,"--Of course, we think there would be no difference if the second sentence was a committed sentence rather than suspended in favor of probation, and we think that under the mandate, the petitioner could move under Rule 35 for an alteration of the sentence to make it--"
1984.84-5004,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1559.455,1560.777,--What happens when probation is revoked?
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1565.259,1570.983,"--Well, he could serve the whole sentence from scratch, but we--"
1984.84-5004,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1570.983,1577.328,If that happened then the revocation of probation would cause him to serve a longer period of time in the penitentiary than the one sentence.
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1577.328,1596.849,"--But we think that the District Court couldn't order that longer sentence under the Court of Appeals mandate, that the clear import of the Court of Appeals decision was that the petitioner not serve more than three years in prison, and that any result vis-a-vis the suspended sentence that had that effect would be improper."
1984.84-5004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1607.027,1615.692,"Well, what possible interest does the government have in sustaining both convictions?"
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1615.692,1625.87,"Your Honor, as we say in our brief, the government's interest is not very great with respect to the convictions in this case."
1984.84-5004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1639.378,1648.965,"Well, I thought... you agree that Congress didn't intend to have... for a defendant to be punished under both statutes."
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1648.965,1652.448,"Yes, well, we didn't intend cumulative punishment."
1984.84-5004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1653.977,1670.2,"Well, would you say it would satisfy all the interests you had if the judge... would you object to an instruction by a judge to a jury that you can convict under one of these statutes but not under the other... but not under both?"
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1670.2,1676.084,"Well, Your Honor, I think we would object."
1984.84-5004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1676.084,1678.214,Why would you object?
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1681.857,1683.377,"Well, there may be--"
1984.84-5004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1683.377,1690.342,What possible interest do you have in having a sentence imposed under both statutes if they must run concurrently?
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1690.342,1694.814,"--Well, part of the problem is that our position depends upon the facts of the case."
1984.84-5004,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1707.262,1707.743,That is a different problem.
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1720.201,1728.917,"Yes, Your Honor, and we feel that there is no harm to the defendant if there is an additional conviction where it carries no adverse consequences."
1984.84-5004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1728.917,1731.499,Let's assume it did carry some adverse consequences.
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1755.235,1758.748,"In this case, we contend that they are nonexistent."
1984.84-5004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1763.619,1765.72,"If we disagree with you, then you lose the case?"
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1771.046,1774.887,"--Well, the adverse consequences also would have to rise to the level of multiple punishment."
1984.84-5004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1797.012,1798.402,"If you have two sentences, you have two sentences in this case."
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1800.485,1803.456,"Your Honor, because the defendant will be serving--"
1984.84-5004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1803.456,1804.315,You've imposed two sentences.
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1806.836,1810.409,--But the defendant won't be serving any additional time in prison.
1984.84-5004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1810.409,1817.625,"That may be so, but he has still got two sentences, and two sentences have adverse consequences outside this proceeding."
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1847.913,1849.706,In a successive prosecution.
1984.84-5004,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1849.706,1850.876,Yes.
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1850.876,1851.987,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-5004,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1851.987,1857.571,"Well, then, why doesn't that answer the question here that has been posed by several Justices?"
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1857.571,1862.894,"I am sorry, Your Honor, the multiple punishment question?"
1984.84-5004,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1862.894,1866.617,"No, the multiple prosecution for the same conduct."
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1866.617,1872.1,"Well, because in your hypothetical--"
1984.84-5004,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1872.1,1878.064,Do you concede the same conduct is the basis of each of the charges?
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1878.064,1887.81,"--Yes, Your Honor, but in this case both of the counts were tried in one prosecution, so there is no successive prosecution problem."
1984.84-5004,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1892.372,1908.334,"Mr. Pincus, your brief on Page 19, the fourth paragraph, gets me... do you still agree with that language, that you don't object to this, that you don't object to the plan that the petitioner has put forth?"
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1908.334,1934.972,"Well, Your Honor, our problem is, we wouldn't object if the district judge in this case had, after the jury returned its verdict, vacated one of the convictions subject to the condition that if the unvacated conviction was ever overturned, the first conviction would be reinstated."
1984.84-5004,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1962.27,1965.521,"Well, you agree this is additional punishment?"
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1965.521,1967.021,"No we don't, Your Honor."
1984.84-5004,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1969.164,1974.826,Does the government in this case distinguish between conviction and sentence?
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1974.826,1988.827,"Our view of punishment, Justice Rehnquist, is additional time in prison or an additional fine, the facts that have been relied upon in this Court's cases discussing the cumulative punishment rule."
1984.84-5004,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1994.992,1999.424,"I don't think you understood my question, at least gathering from the way you are answering."
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2015.144,2015.605,--No.
1984.84-5004,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2017.685,2023.199,You don't ever get to the question of whether a second sentence might require no additional time in prison.
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2027.841,2029.063,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-5004,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2029.063,2032.536,"Mr. Pincus, what about the recidivist statutes?"
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2032.536,2034.827,"Well, Your Honor, the two recidivist--"
1984.84-5004,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2034.827,2039.071,"Under a recidivist statute, if you had two convictions, you go."
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2041.972,2042.622,--Your Honor--
1984.84-5004,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2042.622,2044.234,You wouldn't consider that punishment?
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2044.234,2059.613,"--Well, most recidivist statutes adopt the rule that the two statutes cited by the petitioner adopt, which is that if the two convictions are imposed in a single proceeding, they count as only one conviction for the purposes of the habitual offender statute."
1984.84-5004,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2066.656,2069.248,Does that cover all recidivist statutes?
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2071.411,2075.474,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe it covers all of them, but I think it covers most of them."
1984.84-5004,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2075.474,2076.075,I didn't think so.
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2085.993,2097.339,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think that he would have a problem, because I don't think that that it is still any prejudice that he has incurred right now from the two sentences."
1984.84-5004,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2097.339,2099.901,I take it... excuse me.
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2103.243,2107.024,"Yes, Your Honor, two concurrent sentences."
1984.84-5004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2107.024,2112.42,"The government's interest, I take it, is in maintaining the conviction."
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2121.674,2123.116,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-5004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2123.116,2128.079,So you don't really mean that the concurrent sentence would have to stand.
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2128.079,2134.874,"No, our concern is not with petitioner's concurrent sentence."
1984.84-5004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2134.874,2148.311,"So if the District Court, after a jury convicts on both sentences, says I will enter a sentence on one of the counts and suspends sentence on the other, you would be satisfied?"
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2148.311,2149.873,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-5004,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2149.873,2162.572,"Counsel, I take it you take the position then that the double jeopardy clause just doesn't speak to the question at all of double convictions as opposed to punishments--"
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2162.572,2163.662,Yes.
1984.84-5004,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2163.662,2166.025,--when they are handled in the same prosecution.
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2168.066,2168.975,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1984.84-5004,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2170.317,2180.654,"All right, so then is it simply a matter of legislative intent whether there should be two convictions?"
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2180.654,2184.836,"There could be a question on legislative intent, although--"
1984.84-5004,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2184.836,2186.556,Is that what we would look to?
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2186.556,2189.538,"--Yes, Your Honor, I think you would, although--"
1984.84-5004,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2189.538,2196.033,"And what does Batchelder tell us about that, in your view, with respect to these two statutes?"
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2196.033,2208.492,"--Batchelder teaches that there are two separate statutes that can be independently applied, and we think that if that was Congress's intent, that would indicate the two convictions would be appropriate."
1984.84-5004,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2208.492,2213.193,"It did speak in terms of the prosecution making a choice, however."
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2220.65,2240.131,"Your Honor, that portion of Batchelder speaks to the argument that was raised is that case that the government could not choose to elect between the two statutes because of the different penalty provisions, and this Court rejected that argument and said the government was free to choose."
1984.84-5004,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2244.616,2257.682,"Mr. Pincus, in the light of your answer to an earlier question, it seems to me that the government has refined the position it has taken on Page 19 of its brief, where you say,"
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2269.31,2278.777,"Well, Justice Rehnquist, except that the petitioner's request is that there be a bar on the entry of two convictions."
1984.84-5004,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2278.777,2281.559,Are you saying you have no objection to that?
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2281.559,2291.026,We have no objection to the District Court... to Justice White's suggestion that the District Court enter sentence on only one of the convictions.
1984.84-5004,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2291.026,2294.879,I don't think you are getting the distinction between conviction and sentence.
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2352.455,2355.958,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-5004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.958,2357.838,I don't know how you ascertain that.
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2364.015,2376.871,"Your Honor, we think that does end up splitting hairs, but that is one of the reason why we think that the petitioner... the remedy requested by the petitioner just isn't appropriate."
1984.84-5004,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2385.587,2397.365,"Just in terms of the practical consequences of a conviction, we had a case argued a short while ago where a man on his employment application answered no to whether he had been convicted of a felony, and he was later discharged because he made a false answer."
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2406.14,2408.431,--I think he would have to put two.
1984.84-5004,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2408.431,2412.605,"And that might not be... that would not be prejudicial at all to him, I don't suppose."
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2412.605,2415.898,"Your Honor, it might be prejudicial."
1984.84-5004,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2430.847,2445.217,"Well, in any event, when you say the double jeopardy clause... when you talk about multiple punishments, you are just talking about legislative intent, aren't you?"
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2447.317,2466.17,"The legislative intent is the inquiry, Justice Rehnquist, but in order for there to be... for the double jeopardy clause to supply a remedy, if you will, there has to be some kind of a double punishment that it would reach."
1984.84-5004,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2482.591,2501.513,"I thought in Alvernaz and Missouri against Hunter, we finally dispelled the notion that there was a double jeopardy inquiry under the Constitution, where you are talking about a decision on the part of the legislative body to impose multiple punishments for different offenses."
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2503.463,2507.367,"Yes, Your Honor, we agree with that."
1984.84-5004,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2507.367,2510.639,"Well, then, why do you refer to the double jeopardy clause?"
1984.84-5004,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2510.639,2533.234,"Because in order for that clause to provide a remedy, there has to be some... even if there is a deviation from what Congress intended, there still would have to be some kind of a multiple punishment in order for a petitioner, for the petitioner in this case to rely on a clause as supplying some kind of an affirmative remedy."
1984.84-5004,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2604.49,2605.372,Very well.
1984.84-5004,2,33598,jo_s_widener,,2606.951,2608.544,"Just a few things, Your Honor."
1984.84-5004,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2664.32,2666.691,"Thank you, counsel."
