1970.5714,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,45.09,"We will hear arguments next in Number 5714, Jenness against Georgia."
1970.5714,0,38249,peter_e_rindskopf,,47.258,50.602,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1970.5714,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,179.394,189.23,"There’s no requirement, is there Mr. Rindskopf that the signatures need to come from a specified number of counties or anything such as that?"
1970.5714,0,38249,peter_e_rindskopf,,189.23,199.869,"No Mr. Justice Stewart, we do not have any distribution problem except insofar as for example in a congressional candidate, the signatures must come from persons --"
1970.5714,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,199.869,201.094,That should come from the district?
1970.5714,0,38249,peter_e_rindskopf,,201.094,201.354,-- in the district.
1970.5714,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,201.354,207.645,"Or they have to come from the constituency, but the Governor was having the statewide constituency, the --"
1970.5714,0,38249,peter_e_rindskopf,,207.645,209.358,"That’s correct, anywhere in the state."
1970.5714,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,209.358,210.964,Anywhere in the constituency?
1970.5714,0,38249,peter_e_rindskopf,,210.964,211.293,"Yes, that’s right."
1970.5714,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,211.293,218.511,"In other words, for the gubernatorial candidate, they could’ve all come from Fulton County, for example."
1970.5714,0,38249,peter_e_rindskopf,,218.511,221.177,"They could have all come from Fulton County, that’s correct."
1970.5714,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,221.177,228.651,"The candidate for congressional seat wouldn’t need anything like 80,000 signatures on the petition, would he?"
1970.5714,0,38249,peter_e_rindskopf,,228.651,243.155,"No Mr. Chief Justice, in the two districts with which we are concerned, which are the congressional districts which to divide the City of Atlanta, the fourth and fifth, the numbers were 10,000 and 11,000."
1970.5714,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,243.347,254.975,"Mr. Rindskopf, as I remember in Williams against Rhodes, the figure was 15% of actual votes cast, am I correct on that?"
1970.5714,0,38249,peter_e_rindskopf,,254.975,255.502,That’s correct.
1970.5714,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,257.079,259.962,And here it is 5% of the registered voters.
1970.5714,0,38249,peter_e_rindskopf,,265.428,284.719,"As we have attempted -- as we have shown in our brief at page 8 and page 9, in Georgia, the number of voters is generally about 50% of the number of registered voters, or it has been in the last two gubernatorial elections."
1970.5714,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,294.861,297.788,"Incidentally, is a write-in permissible in Georgia?"
1970.5714,0,38249,peter_e_rindskopf,,297.788,304.775,Write-ins are permissible.
1970.5714,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,305.284,310.932,Your answer to Justice Blackmun would be what that which is the easier?
1970.5714,0,38249,peter_e_rindskopf,,310.932,322.194,"Well, the 5% here comes out to slightly less than the 15% in Ohio. It comes out to about 10% by the Ohio standard."
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,1688.446,1694.025,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1970.5714,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1882.797,1892.528,Your opposition has brought out the fact the 5% figure though is at the high point in comparative figures with other states.
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,1893.814,1896.37,"Yes sir, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1970.5714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1991.349,1995.716,"Mr. Castellani, why did you pick this method?"
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,1995.716,1995.859,This --
1970.5714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1995.859,2005.581,Why did the State of Georgia at this late date want number two to pick the 5%?
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,2005.581,2021.375,"Well sir, the first -- the late date was 1943, secondly this method was because 49 of the 50 states depend upon nominating petitions as an alternative in one form or another."
1970.5714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2026.891,2035.097,"Well, anything happened in Georgia that suddenly made them realize this in good way of doing it?"
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,2035.097,2038.015,"Justice Marshall, I’m not a Georgia historian."
1970.5714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2039.958,2044.403,"Well, can you answer the 5% question?"
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,2044.403,2045.028,No sir.
1970.5714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2046.356,2050.297,Well what is the state’s interest in the 5%?
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,2050.297,2060.887,"Well the state’s interest in 5% it seems to me, and I realized that this Court has looked at an awful lot of election cases and you have had the interest thrown at you."
1970.5714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2131.997,2146.755,"I recognize your answer for the general question, but I am still left in a point why 5, instead of 1 or 11/2, 2, 3, 4?"
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,2146.755,2152.402,And I say there are no legislative materials that I have been able to find that would indicate why five.
1970.5714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2152.402,2157.19,"But you said that before this one, you adopted this you looked at other states."
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,2160.136,2162.009,"Yes, there are other states with five, yes sir Mr. Justice --"
1970.5714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2162.009,2166.795,How many?
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,2166.795,2169.328,"I don’t remember, I think it’s three or four plus several --"
1970.5714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2169.328,2170.699,Why in a great difficulty in saying --
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,2170.699,2171.269,-- territories.
1970.5714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2171.269,2173.473,I was trying to get in line with the other states.
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,2175.782,2176.285,Oh we did.
1970.5714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2177.768,2177.908,Why?
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,2177.908,2179.127,Because I attempted to show before --
1970.5714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2179.127,2182.624,What’s so peculiar in Georgia that you need 5%?
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,2182.624,2187.621,"Well, they made the figure 5%, and again I can’t say why they chose 5%."
1970.5714,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2248.01,2254.576,"Mr. Castellani, I hope I’m not repeating anything Mr. Justice Marshall asked you because I couldn’t hear his question."
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,2268.667,2275.616,"I had a guess and unfortunately I did not prepare myself on this point, and I apologize, I probably should have."
1970.5714,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2302.989,2309.128,"So your suspicion is that Georgia moved in the direction of liberality, rather than in the opposite direction?"
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,2309.128,2310.356,"Yes sis, yes sir."
1970.5714,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2325.677,2339.178,"Mr. Castellani, in you recital of possible interests of the state, you did not mention that one, sometimes included, the possible fraud on the voters."
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,2376.941,2377.159,Yes sir.
1970.5714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2405.235,2420.217,"Mr. Castellani, is it true that the primary case, the white primary case that Georgia came around 44’, and prior to that time there wasn’t but one party in Georgia?"
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,2420.217,2421.759,Which white primary case Mr. Justice --?
1970.5714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2421.759,2423.792,King Jay.
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,2423.792,2425.114,I’m not familiar with that case sir.
1970.5714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2425.114,2432.268,The case that opened up the white primary to let Negro Republican to vote in the white primary.
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,2437.026,2441.476,"Again I said, I’m not familiar with the history of Georgia around 1944, so I --"
1970.5714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2441.476,2444.227,Could this have been to keep out third party?
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,2445.579,2447.377,Could it have been to keep out third party?
1970.5714,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2447.377,2449.738,Yes.
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,2449.738,2450.966,I can’t say.
1970.5714,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2472.038,2476.178,"Well for a while it not only kept out third parties, it kept out second parties did it?"
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,2476.178,2481.64,"Yes sir, but I’m not so sure that the law is the instrument in which kept out even --"
1970.5714,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2481.64,2481.939,No.
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,2481.939,2482.721,-- any of the second party.
1970.5714,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2483.346,2487.063,The fact was that there was the same as just a single party.
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,2487.063,2499.695,"Yes sir, because the second ground on which these nominating petition laws are challenged are that they violate this freedom of association right that has been recognized by the Court in Williams versus Rhode."
1970.5714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2558.599,2562.223,What’s it take to the amount of petition?
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,2562.223,2569.653,This is the method under consideration of 5% as we called the petition method as opposed to primary method.
1970.5714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2569.653,2571.687,Would you say the number they have?
1970.5714,1,38961,robert_j_castellani,,2571.687,2572.613,Yes sir.
1970.5714,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2772.332,2784.161,I think we’ll suspend now and let you begin right after lunch Mr. Rindskopf.
1970.5714,2,38249,peter_e_rindskopf,,2788.611,2794.591,"I just have the briefest of points, Your Honors."
1970.5714,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2874.668,2876.163,You’re speaking now of the general election.
1970.5714,2,38249,peter_e_rindskopf,,2878.2,2880.267,That is correct.
1970.5714,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2896.302,2907.525,You care to comment on the state’s interest in terms of preventing fraud on the voters by use the same or similar names of candidates?
1970.5714,2,38249,peter_e_rindskopf,,2907.525,2908.974,Yes I do.
1970.5714,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2939.667,2941.371,"Sometimes that is in Georgia, isn’t it?"
1970.5714,2,38249,peter_e_rindskopf,,2941.371,2943.563,Sometimes.
1970.5714,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2956.479,2958.081,But the party nominee with what?
1970.5714,2,38249,peter_e_rindskopf,,2958.081,2962.731,The Democratic Party nominee usually wins the election.
1970.5714,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3002.91,3004.168,Thank you Mr. Rindskopf.
