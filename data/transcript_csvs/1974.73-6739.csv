1974.73-6739,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,55.3,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-6739, Costarelli against Massachusetts."
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,58.882,64.644,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-6739,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,341.787,356.651,"Mr. Hagopian, what if your client had been initially tried in the District Court on the same charge he wasn't acquitted and then he was tried again in the District Court and found guilty and you wanted to raise the claim of double jeopardy."
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,360.826,361.97,Yes.
1974.73-6739,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,362.414,365.731,"Well, then why can't you raise your jury trial claim here?"
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,365.731,369.145,"Well, that of course is a very complicated question."
1974.73-6739,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,413.151,426.705,"But then you could have I suppose under those circumstances after making your point in the Superior Court claiming the right to jury trial, they rule against you, at least brought it here from the Superior Court on the ruling on that motion rather than just from the District Court."
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,426.705,427.891,"Yes, that's quite correct."
1974.73-6739,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,452.055,456.389,"But if your answer to my question is right, he wouldn't have had to suffer a second trial."
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,463.611,464.536,"No, that's not correct."
1974.73-6739,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,492.21,506.033,"Well, what you're saying then is that, although he can appeal from the final judgment of District Court, had he taken the state proceedings a step further, gone into the Superior Court and made his motion, he couldn't appeal from there."
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,506.033,516.907,"That -- unless he's completed the trial in the Superior Court, then he would have to go to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court because the Superior Court is not the highest state court within the meaning of those words."
1974.73-6739,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,541.78,543.287,Is that pending now?
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,543.287,549.431,"Yes, it is and the Chief Justice of Superior Court has stated those proceedings pending the disposition of this case."
1974.73-6739,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,549.431,552.582,Does that go up on the record and made in the District Court?
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,552.582,565.837,"Well, the only record that technically goes up, a complaint is filed in the District Court, if he's found guilty, that record and the disposition that goes on the District Court goes up to the Superior Court."
1974.73-6739,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,578.155,585.231,What goes up to the Supreme Judicial Court on your motion for extraordinary relief?
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,585.231,592.312,"If you bring a motion for extraordinary belief -- relief in the Supreme Judicial Court from proceedings in the District Court, nothing goes up."
1974.73-6739,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,597.123,601.106,The complaint is just like a complaint in a trial court?
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,601.106,601.57,No.
1974.73-6739,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,612.4,614.833,Just like a writ of prohibition or mandamus.
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,616.101,617.385,That's right.
1974.73-6739,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,620.305,637.149,"Suppose when you get to the court of general jurisdiction on the appeal of trial de novo but I don't use it with any meaning at all, and you say this Court doesn't have jurisdiction to try me, that the Court passes on its own jurisdiction?"
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,637.149,639.017,"I'm sorry, your Honor, I didn't understand that question."
1974.73-6739,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,639.017,643.443,The Court doesn't have jurisdiction to try me?
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,643.443,644.951,The Superior Court?
1974.73-6739,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,644.951,645.795,Yes.
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,645.795,647.64,The Superior Court in Massachusetts --
1974.73-6739,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,647.64,655.459,Suppose the motion is made that the Superior Court does not have the right to try me because the Court is without jurisdiction.
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,655.459,662.79,"Well, I don't think that the fact that he did not have a jury trial in the District Court affects the jurisdiction of the Superior Court."
1974.73-6739,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,662.79,665.291,I didn't say one word about jury trial.
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,669.167,675.117,"Well, I suppose you could make it Your Honor but I don't know why it should be denied because it's the only thing that --"
1974.73-6739,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,675.117,677.996,"Suppose it is denied, could you appeal it?"
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,677.996,681.0,"Not without going through a trial, Your Honor, no."
1974.73-6739,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,681.388,694.98,"You mean, in Massachusetts, you make a point that this Court is without jurisdiction because the judge is six-years-old, and thereby on the jury is dead that that can't be appealed?"
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,694.98,701.141,I don't believe there are any procedures in the Massachusetts system that allow piecemeal adjudication of the issue of jurisdiction.
1974.73-6739,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,701.141,704.253,Jurisdiction is not piecemeal.
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,704.253,717.804,"I understand that from a federal viewpoint, Your Honor to a certain extent but I don't believe Massachusetts, if there is remedy for getting into an Appellate Court other than going through a trial in the Superior Court."
1974.73-6739,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,717.804,720.736,"At this time, I'll take your word for it --"
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,720.736,721.963,"I believe that's correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-6739,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,721.963,728.537,Of course you would be in the Superior Court only because you as the defendant had invoked its jurisdiction.
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,728.537,728.883,Well--
1974.73-6739,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,728.883,734.258,It would be kind of an odd thing to go in there and invoke its jurisdiction and file a motion to say it doesn't have jurisdiction.
1974.73-6739,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,734.258,736.156,Did you invoke its jurisdiction there?
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,736.156,736.847,"Well, Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-6739,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,737.258,739.938,I thought you said they made you file --
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,739.938,740.689,"Pardon, Your Honor?"
1974.73-6739,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,740.689,747.029,I thought you said they made you file this motion in the Superior Court.
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,747.029,749.608,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe I said that."
1974.73-6739,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,791.234,800.856,"Let me ask you a question, is there any way in the Massachusetts system whereby Mr. Costarelli could have bypassed the District Court?"
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,800.856,802.183,No there is not Your Honor.
1974.73-6739,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,843.889,852.037,"But if you just go across that file and take your appeal, the proceeding is annulled."
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,852.037,853.932,"Well, that's not true, Mr. Justice White."
1974.73-6739,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,853.932,855.212,"Well, now --"
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,855.212,857.258,There are collateral consequences that are very serious.
1974.73-6739,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,857.258,860.095,De novo -- it's a de novo matter.
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,860.095,864.225,It's a de novo matter but there are collateral consequences that are attached.
1974.73-6739,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,874.75,880.809,"When you go to the Superior Court, what happens to the judgment --"
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,880.809,884.628,"Well, technically in terms of fiction, it's vacated."
1974.73-6739,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,884.628,887.5,Well then it's no longer important.
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,887.5,889.695,That's not strictly true because of the fact that you --
1974.73-6739,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,889.695,891.22,You told me it was vacated.
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,891.22,896.994,"Well, it is but if you default in the Superior Court, it is then imposed."
1974.73-6739,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,896.994,906.563,"This is within your power to annul that judgment by going, by invoking the Superior Court proceedings."
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,906.563,908.697,That's correct but there's a great deal of difference when --
1974.73-6739,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,908.697,912.549,You may not have to plead guilty to get the default to get there.
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,914.284,916.305,You mean in the District Courts in Massachusetts?
1974.73-6739,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,916.305,916.57,Yes.
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,916.57,916.937,"Well, you must have --"
1974.73-6739,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,916.937,919.025,You default.
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,919.025,920.218,You can't default.
1974.73-6739,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,922.894,928.675,"Well, awhile ago you told me (Inaudible)?"
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,928.675,932.496,"No, I am sorry Your Honor."
1974.73-6739,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,944.087,947.259,"I understand you viewed it on the District Court, what if he just doesn't show up."
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,949.215,949.381,You can't default.
1974.73-6739,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,949.381,951.423,"They say, well, you can't default."
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,953.142,953.775,That's correct.
1974.73-6739,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,953.775,956.094,--- so you do have to expose yourself to the state's evidence?
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,956.094,957.076,That's correct.
1974.73-6739,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,957.076,961.78,And then it may not be much of a trial but --
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,961.78,967.555,"Well, there are serious consequences because if you remain silent, and the Government puts their witnesses on and then --"
1974.73-6739,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,967.555,969.281,You're going to be found guilty?
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,969.281,970.156,"Well, it's more than that."
1974.73-6739,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,980.953,984.736,"Well, it's true of a preliminary hearing too though isn't it?"
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,984.736,986.667,"Yes, as a matter of fact, that's true."
1974.73-6739,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1019.127,1025.046,"There's another side of the coin and that is if you stand mute and hear the state's evidence, you know what the state's case is."
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,1025.046,1030.373,And the difficulty with that is that the Massachusetts system attaches collateral consequences to that judgment.
1974.73-6739,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1042.65,1047.637,I thought you just admitted to Mr. Justice White that you could nullify that entire effect?
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,1047.637,1057.981,"You can't nullify the collateral consequences you see because of the fact in the Massachusetts procedure, the statutes that empower the registrar say to yank your motor vehicle license."
1974.73-6739,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1090.568,1094.647,When does the judgment of District Court become annulled?
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,1097.328,1098.797,That's the end.
1974.73-6739,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1099.585,1100.584,Then what happens?
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,1100.584,1102.369,The Government has no more trials.
1974.73-6739,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1103.471,1106.544,How does nothing happen -- nobody divulges anything?
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,1106.544,1107.341,That's correct.
1974.73-6739,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1107.341,1109.724,"Wait a minute, is this being found innocent in the District Court?"
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,1109.724,1111.122,"Yes, the District Court."
1974.73-6739,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1111.122,1114.437,I think Mr. Justice White asked you suppose you're found innocent in the Superior Court.
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,1114.437,1126.656,"Well, then yes, then you are declared innocent and then the registrar has to give you your license back but you see, it's that intervening time between the District Court and the Superior Court that is the nub of the matter."
1974.73-6739,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1126.656,1132.628,Do you say the judgment basis in fact --
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,1132.628,1136.352,"Well, let me say this."
1974.73-6739,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1157.723,1159.904,It's very much like an appeal in that sense.
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,1159.904,1162.577,"It is, it exactly is."
1974.73-6739,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1318.401,1324.539,You don't suggest I take it that -- this is a subjective question.
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,1341.21,1342.408,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-6739,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1377.924,1386.193,"But if the state did give the jury trial in the first instance, all they'd need to do is have a review on the record if they provided any review at all, is that possible?"
1974.73-6739,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,1386.193,1386.849,That's correct.
1974.73-6739,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1394.887,1396.626,Mr. Mills.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,1396.626,1399.076,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-6739,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1671.993,1674.01,I didn't get the beginning.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,1677.349,1679.713,When the appeal is claimed Your Honor.
1974.73-6739,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1679.713,1680.892,When it's claimed?
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,1680.892,1689.624,Yes.
1974.73-6739,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1689.624,1694.308,Is that a peculiar area of Massachusetts so to speak of claiming an appeal?
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,1699.351,1701.484,"As far as I know, Your Honor."
1974.73-6739,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1710.825,1716.092,What are the collateral consequences your friend was discussing?
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,1716.092,1724.306,"Well, the collateral consequences Your Honor I suggest, this point has also been raised in the amicus brief of the Massachusetts Defenders Committee."
1974.73-6739,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1803.779,1814.749,"May I suppose -- does that suggest that particularly in this case where whatever you call it, a proceeding is now pending in the Superior Court?"
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,1814.749,1832.622,"We do not know that of record Your Honor, however, what we do know of record is that at the time that this particular appellant who was a defendant in the Boston Municipal Court on the day that he was found guilty in the Boston Municipal Court, the record indicates that he claimed an appeal."
1974.73-6739,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1838.325,1845.843,Does your argument on finality rest at all in this case on the fact that he did claim an appeal?
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,1845.843,1848.793,"No, Your Honor, the option is available to this --"
1974.73-6739,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1848.793,1849.891,Whether he did or not?
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,1849.891,1850.6,Whether he did or not.
1974.73-6739,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1850.6,1855.677,You could still say the District Court judgment is not final for purposes of 1257?
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,1855.677,1873.202,"Yes, Your Honor because he had available to him under Massachusetts law, a redetermination and I equate redetermination somehow with the fact that it has not been fully determined if it is subject to redetermination."
1974.73-6739,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1873.202,1882.572,"Mr. Mills, what do you understand his federal constitutional issue is here?"
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,1882.572,1893.569,His issue here Your Honor is whether or not he was deprived of a federally protected constitutional right when he was not provided with a jury in the first instance at the District Court.
1974.73-6739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1893.569,1898.819,How does he ever raise that up through the Massachusetts system?
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,1919.441,1932.988,"Your Honor, that question was explicitly noted by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in a September 1974 decision which has been submitted to this Court as an amendment to the appellant's original jurisdictional statement."
1974.73-6739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1932.988,1936.77,"Again, how does he bring this to the -- before the Superior Court."
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,1940.924,1940.979,Correct.
1974.73-6739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1940.979,1948.467,"If he's tried there with a jury and found guilty, then what does he claim in the Superior?"
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,1950.492,1953.398,"Well, he wouldn't be presenting it to the Superior Court, Your Honor."
1974.73-6739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1958.053,1969.194,"So when he's convicted in the Massa -- in the Superior Court, he then appeals and says, this conviction is invalid because why?"
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,1969.194,1972.021,"Well, I don't think that he would say the conviction was invalid."
1974.73-6739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1981.624,1981.839,Yes.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,1981.839,1995.456,The defendant in the Superior Court would file a motion to dismiss the complaint at the Superior Court level because the case was improperly there because he was not afforded a jury trial in the first instance.
1974.73-6739,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1995.456,1997.224,But he took the case there?
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,1998.137,1999.295,"Yes, he did Your Honor."
1974.73-6739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2029.094,2033.833,"What will he say if say, he's found guilty after jury trial in Superior Court?"
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2040.307,2051.056,He says that it was error for the Superior Court to not grant his motion to dismiss because he was entitled to a jury trial in the first instance and he did not receive it.
1974.73-6739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2053.463,2060.856,"The state comes back as it is but now you've been given a jury trial, you've been found guilty, you're just claiming an error for which there is no remedy."
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2060.856,2065.123,I suggest that's hypothetical Your Honor and contraindicated by the --
1974.73-6739,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2065.123,2072.801,Was this ever a fact in what has happened under your procedure that someone's been convicted without a jury in the District Court?
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2083.565,2087.44,It has not happened to my knowledge and I believe we would know.
1974.73-6739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2087.44,2092.021,Let's assume that that procedure just weren't open in the Massachusetts courts.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2111.873,2113.687,I suggest Your Honor that if the Massachusetts --
1974.73-6739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2113.687,2117.191,"But if that is right, I don't think you may not have much to your finality, are you?"
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2117.191,2131.47,"Well, if the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has suggested in its opinion of Whitmarsh versus the Commonwealth that that is an available vehicle for a plaintiff similarly situated then I suggest --"
1974.73-6739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2131.47,2133.591,That suggestion is --
1974.73-6739,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2133.591,2134.519,Where is that case?
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2137.218,2141.282,"September of 1974 Your Honor, Whitmarsh versus Commonwealth."
1974.73-6739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2141.282,2150.472,"We have any way of sending this back to anybody to find out whether you or your adversary are right, have we?"
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2156.089,2157.358,"Yes, this is not the Whitmarsh case."
1974.73-6739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2157.358,2163.514,"I know, but have you have an intervening -- as I understand it, Whitmarsh has been decided since this judgment?"
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2163.514,2164.36,"Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-6739,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2164.36,2164.86,This brief.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2171.707,2174.517,And we claim that it is adequate Your Honor.
1974.73-6739,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2176.114,2185.289,"Well, You're saying then that you would make the same argument in the Massachusetts Court of Appeals that he is making here now on the merits?"
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2185.289,2187.171,"I'm saying that that is possible, Your Honor."
1974.73-6739,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2187.171,2190.09,"Yes, that it would be open to it anyway."
1974.73-6739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2190.09,2190.934,That's important.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2193.44,2212.671,"I say that it's open to him and if futility were a principle of finality, then perhaps finality would be defeated because as a matter of fact in law, the Supreme Judicial Court has since the filing of the jurisdictional statement in this case considered this constitutional issue twice in two different courts."
1974.73-6739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2212.671,2217.306,"Well yes, we're the ones to decide finality."
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2217.306,2221.962,Correct Your Honor and that's why I say if utility were and which it is not.
1974.73-6739,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2221.962,2238.441,"What are the circumstances in which the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts could take the case directly from the District Court to said in passing under some circumstances, is it a certiorari jurisdiction or a certiorari before judgment?"
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2238.441,2250.037,There is a procedural vehicle which is General Law Chapter 211 Section 3 under which this particular question has reached the highest Massachusetts Court twice.
1974.73-6739,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2275.56,2278.745,What procedure was followed in Whitmarsh?
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2278.745,2305.881,"In Whitmarsh Your Honor, it was an interlocutory petition seeking the extraordinary relief powers in our highest Appellate Court under General Laws 211 Section 3 and the Court while noting that the vehicle for relief was improperly invoked, nonetheless, briefly gave its opinion as to the determination of the constitutional issue."
1974.73-6739,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2305.881,2308.961,Isn't Whitmarsh the critical case here?
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2311.004,2317.556,"No, Your Honor, not with respect to an argument on this Court's jurisdiction under Section 1257."
1974.73-6739,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2317.556,2322.391,"Of course, it's here before us, Whitmarsh has been --"
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2322.391,2324.412,"No, Costarelli is before this Court."
1974.73-6739,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2324.412,2325.529,"Well, Whitmarsh is too."
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2328.417,2329.009,"Oh, correct."
1974.73-6739,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2359.927,2367.68,"Let me repeat my first question, are you not relying on what you call your Supreme Judicial Court?"
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2375.57,2376.953,With respect to jurisdiction?
1974.73-6739,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2376.953,2379.926,"With respect to Costarelli's case in jurisdiction, yes."
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2379.926,2382.813,I don't believe so Your Honor.
1974.73-6739,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2550.635,2558.033,"Wasn't there too -- in Largent too though, are you asking us to overrule Largent?"
1974.73-6739,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2558.033,2558.377,Yes.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2558.377,2566.786,"No, I don't fully underst -- to the extent that I read Largent, it seems to be opposite to the position that I argue to you today."
1974.73-6739,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2587.71,2599.492,"Well, it sounds to me as if what you're contending for might leave open the possibility that if a defendant could get review on writ of prohibition or writ of mandamus."
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2623.398,2629.329,"If Largent says what I believe it says Your Honor, it would be a significant departure."
1974.73-6739,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2629.329,2638.696,"And your position, would at least acceptance of your position here, would at least require the Court to modify or explain some of the language in Largent at the very least."
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2638.696,2640.292,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-6739,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2640.292,2642.425,You would be able to agree with that would you?
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2642.425,2644.473,"Or to be made more explicit yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-6739,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2644.473,2656.583,"Because Largent said that if there's no review on the record in any other state tribunal, then it's final for purposes of coming here isn't that basically what it said?"
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2656.583,2658.21,"I believe it does, yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-6739,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2658.21,2665.908,"And in this case, there is no review on the record in any other Court of Massachusetts."
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2665.908,2666.342,"Correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-6739,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2666.342,2669.5,On a District or Boston Municipal Court proceeding.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2669.5,2671.219,"Of the record, you are correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-6739,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2672.041,2675.665,Why don't you just answer that there is more than that -- there is more than review of the record.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2687.673,2698.989,Largent disturbs the Commonwealth Your Honor because it seems to explicitly establish a rule which cannot be complied with in this case and we suggest that a mechanical application --
1974.73-6739,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2698.989,2701.523,Then it can be more than complied with.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2714.727,2717.803,"If Largent requires a record, there is no record here Your Honor."
1974.73-6739,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2721.469,2724.541,I have a little trouble with this wiping the record clean.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2724.541,2725.147,"Excuse me, --"
1974.73-6739,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2725.147,2729.943,I have a little trouble with your broad statement of wiping the record clean.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2734.316,2735.19,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-6739,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2735.19,2738.167,Then the record is wiped clear.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2739.055,2740.34,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-6739,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2740.34,2742.303,Can he go to Europe next week?
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2742.303,2743.038,"I didn't hear you, Your Honor."
1974.73-6739,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2743.038,2745.482,Can he go to Europe next week.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2745.482,2746.61,No.
1974.73-6739,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2746.61,2748.198,So it isn't clean is it?
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2748.198,2750.183,"Yes, the record is clean."
1974.73-6739,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2759.613,2760.363,At his option?
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2764.69,2770.769,"Three other options, yes Your Honor."
1974.73-6739,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2770.769,2772.703,Going to jail being one of them.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2772.703,2775.369,"The language -- yes, Your Honor it is."
1974.73-6739,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2789.197,2792.497,But you do admit that he is still held under charges.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2792.497,2799.915,"He is still a criminal defendant, subject to process and subject to further involvement in criminal proceedings in Massachusetts."
1974.73-6739,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2799.915,2803.55,"Would you object to in other words, again be put in jeopardy?"
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2803.55,2804.897,"Yes, I would Your Honor."
1974.73-6739,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2804.897,2806.247,You object to that word?
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2806.247,2807.035,"Yes, in view of this --"
1974.73-6739,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2807.035,2808.792,But is he already in jeopardy?
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2808.792,2810.626,"He is, he remains in jeopardy."
1974.73-6739,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2810.626,2813.708,From the first one?
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2813.708,2815.401,"No, he is -- yes, he is again in jeopardy Your Honor."
1974.73-6739,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2815.401,2821.71,"Well, I thought you said it was wiped away, take it or leave it, one or the other."
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2821.71,2823.592,I suggest that it is wiped away Your Honor.
1974.73-6739,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2824.389,2827.431,So there is a second jeopardy.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2828.759,2831.937,Not if second is equivalent with double Your Honor.
1974.73-6739,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2831.937,2837.776,"Well, have you ever heard of an appeal where you had a trial by jury?"
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2840.12,2848.008,Perhaps this is inappropriately labeled under Massachusetts procedure as an appeal but I would suggest that the particular name or denomination --
1974.73-6739,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2848.008,2852.418,Is it a trial de novo?
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2852.418,2853.634,"It is a trial, Your Honor."
1974.73-6739,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2853.634,2855.178,It's a trial.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2859.079,2860.907,Two adjudications Your Honor.
1974.73-6739,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2860.907,2865.833,Two trials?
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2865.833,2871.957,There are two trials.
1974.73-6739,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2936.344,2945.125,(Inaudible) this point with this question about having a trial by jury on appeal.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2952.051,2952.073,Correct.
1974.73-6739,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2952.073,2955.025,You just don't get juries in appellate courts.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2955.025,2955.899,"Correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-6739,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2955.899,2960.704,Except in Massachusetts and how many other states.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2960.704,2965.168,"We could call it in de novo states Your Honor, we have suggested that there are eight in the brief."
1974.73-6739,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2965.168,2967.191,Eight.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2973.163,2974.554,We do not know Your Honor.
1974.73-6739,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2974.554,2975.859,There are several.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2975.859,2976.44,The interaction of the --
1974.73-6739,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2976.44,2978.305,Was Rhode Island one?
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2978.305,2980.024,Rhode Island no longer is one --
1974.73-6739,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2984.616,2986.088,Several others.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2986.088,2987.898,There are others but the --
1974.73-6739,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2987.898,2989.838,One right close to you.
1974.73-6739,1,21268,david_a_mills,,2989.838,2991.299,"Yes, it is close."
1974.73-6739,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3107.541,3110.468,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Hagopian?"
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3110.468,3120.851,"Mr. Chief Justice, the Massachusetts Defenders Committee filed a brief that I received last Friday and I would like to ask leave of Court to file a reply brief to that brief."
1974.73-6739,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3124.385,3130.588,I was wondering there was just -- Mr. Mills just referred to an amicus brief and I don't --
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3130.588,3133.931,It probably hasn't even got here Your Honor and I'm opposed to its --
1974.73-6739,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3133.931,3135.813,It hasn't been circulated.
1974.73-6739,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3135.813,3137.413,Was that in the amicus brief?
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3137.413,3138.204,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-6739,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3138.204,3141.187,Was there permission to campaign?
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3141.187,3149.297,I assented to it at that time Your Honor but -- yes I did but I didn't assent to it being delivered here after oral arguments or the time of oral arguments.
1974.73-6739,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3156.301,3162.293,You may respond to it and your friend may comment on the response if you wish --
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3162.293,3163.557,Could I have leave to file a written response to that?
1974.73-6739,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3163.557,3166.794,Yes.
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3166.794,3168.802,A couple of small points --
1974.73-6739,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3168.802,3173.688,"What do you want, five days, seven days,10 days?"
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3173.688,3178.205,"Your Honor, this is an informer's propers case and I have to send those down to Washington."
1974.73-6739,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3182.856,3187.345,You may submit a typewritten form if you like in response.
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3187.345,3187.504,"Oh, fine."
1974.73-6739,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3187.504,3189.913,I take it you're not going to file an extensive brief.
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3189.913,3190.832,That's correct Your Honor.
1974.73-6739,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3194.421,3198.239,Very well.
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3198.239,3208.087,"One thing I would like to mention to Mr. Justice White, there is a procedure in Massachusetts called submitting to a finding of facts in the lower Court which is equivalent to what you mentioned."
1974.73-6739,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3224.836,3235.756,Is there a way that that you could raise in the Superior Court the question that -- the federal questions you want us to --
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3235.756,3238.389,I would suppose the double jeopardy issue certainly could be raised.
1974.73-6739,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3238.389,3239.647,How about the jury trial?
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3239.647,3242.126,"Well, it depends upon whether it's a reversible error."
1974.73-6739,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3249.009,3254.844,Here you are in the Superior Court and you're taking a case there for a trial de novo.
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3254.844,3255.283,Yes.
1974.73-6739,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3255.283,3263.108,Now is there some way to present to the Superior Court have rules on --
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3263.108,3268.124,"Other than a motion to dismiss on the grounds of double jeopardy, the answer is no."
1974.73-6739,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3272.413,3281.514,"-- out here in the jury trial in the Superior Court, can you present the question that you want us to adjudicate here?"
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3281.514,3282.017,"Well, I suppose --"
1974.73-6739,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3282.017,3285.959,It will up those to the higher court of Massachusetts just like to present the case.
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3285.959,3297.723,"Sure, the only grounds you could allege in the highest court in Massachusetts is that the trial judge in the Superior Court made a mistake when he denied my motion to dismiss on the grounds of double jeopardy."
1974.73-6739,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3297.723,3300.653,Would they entertain that in the courts around here?
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3300.653,3301.934,Certainly.
1974.73-6739,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3316.702,3324.203,"But if it's mooted in the Massachusetts Courts, why isn't it mooted here and if it's not mooted here, why is it mooted in the Massachusetts courts?"
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3324.203,3332.297,"It's not mooted here because of the fact that in Costarelli's case, the Chief Justice of the Superior Court has stayed the trial de novo."
1974.73-6739,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3334.721,3338.087,"But you say if he hadn't stayed them, then you have no case here."
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3338.087,3338.962,Absolutely.
1974.73-6739,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3338.962,3345.784,"I know but if the answer to you isn't here, Massachusetts courts would be just what you say they are."
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3350.691,3351.528,The issue of mootness yes.
1974.73-6739,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3351.528,3354.408,That is if you could present the issue in the lower courts.
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3354.408,3354.702,That's correct.
1974.73-6739,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3354.702,3356.28,We can have it suppose to rule on.
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3356.28,3356.905,That's correct.
1974.73-6739,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3356.905,3358.277,Then why didn't you?
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3358.277,3360.088,"Well, I have in Costarelli's case."
1974.73-6739,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3363.105,3364.924,Why is the judgment final?
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3371.534,3386.303,"Because of the fact that that is a collateral means of reviewing that judgment in the District Court of Massachusetts, it's a collateral means, a man should not have to suffer a second trial to review the error that was made in the District Court and that is the nub of Section 1257."
1974.73-6739,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3394.642,3405.491,"There is no -- there is no trial de novo procedure available in Largent, that was wholly federal habeas and they said federal habeas was not available to raise the constitutional question to solve this."
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3405.491,3406.421,"I believe in Largent, they said --"
1974.73-6739,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3406.421,3407.96,There is no other place it could go.
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3407.96,3413.999,I believe that there were collateral remedies open in the Texas system in Largent in which he could've raised the issue collaterally.
1974.73-6739,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3413.999,3416.071,That may be so but the court didn't have.
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3416.773,3419.997,"Oh, I believe this Court mentioned it in this -- in its opinion."
1974.73-6739,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3431.095,3436.329,Notice the fact that over a federal question where it switches to federal remedies just when he may --
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3436.329,3459.878,"It says it but this Court stated, it says the possibility that the appellant might obtain release by a subsequent and distinct proceedings and one not in the nature of the review of the pending charge, in the same or a different Court of a state does not affect the finality of an existing judgment or the fact that this judgment was obtain in the highest state court available to the appellant."
1974.73-6739,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3470.826,3479.841,"But in Largent, the state proceeding left the judgment final and in effect and here you have a very ready remedy."
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3479.841,3482.067,"Well, that remedy was taken under compulsion."
1974.73-6739,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3488.523,3494.183,"Well, that's like saying supposing you don't appeal from the Superior Court of Massachusetts to the Supreme Court, you've got to."
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3494.183,3498.117,I submit to you that that is an entirely different matter.
1974.73-6739,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3506.811,3522.765,"Well, there's a certain irony in your case and in your opponent's case because the more you make the thing look like an appeal, the worse of you are in the jurisdictional basis but the better off you are in the constitutional merits."
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3532.298,3535.197,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-6739,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3535.197,3535.959,Thank you.
1974.73-6739,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3544.977,3545.99,Thank you.
1974.73-6739,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3545.99,3546.6,Thank you gentlemen.
