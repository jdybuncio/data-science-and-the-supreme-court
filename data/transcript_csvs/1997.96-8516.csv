1997.96-8516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.206,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-8516, Kenneth Eugene Bousley v. United States."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,8.257,11.81,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-8516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,66.664,72.919,"In other words, this is just really a somewhat standard argument that the Rule 11 colloquy was inadequate?"
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,72.919,78.082,"Your Honor, it's not... no, I wouldn't say that, Your Honor."
1997.96-8516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,80.092,85.907,"Well, I take it that even pre Bailey you would have this same objection."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,87.529,91.292,"That's correct, the argument would be the same."
1997.96-8516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,115.826,137.782,"Well, but then that goes to the next argument that the law has changed in your view, et cetera, but if this were pre Bailey, and Bailey had never been on the books, would you... you would still say, I take it, that the plea was inadequately counseled and that the colloquy under Rule 11 was inadequate."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,137.782,140.293,"--Yes, Your Honor, certainly the colloquy was--"
1997.96-8516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,140.293,141.753,"Because they talked about possession, not use."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,141.753,172.875,"--That's correct, but again, in order for a guilty plea to be valid, it must be knowledgeable and it must be intelligent and when the crime is explained as something other than what the statute actually describes, the plea cannot be intelligent or knowing, because the defendant is not aware and because the presentation does not comply with the statute, so it's more than just a Rule 11 violation."
1997.96-8516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,173.205,183.64,"Well, I think that's a conventional argument and that the plea bargain and the fact that he had the indictment, the plea... he signed the plea agreement, did he not?"
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,183.64,184.832,--He did sign the plea agreement.
1997.96-8516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,184.832,186.491,And that adequate... and that sets forth use.
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,186.491,186.822,No.
1997.96-8516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,187.493,188.184,It did not?
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,188.184,190.215,The plea agreement uses the word use.
1997.96-8516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,200.991,203.693,"Well, it says count 2 charges that defendant was using a firearm."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,203.693,207.336,"--That's correct, Your Honor, but it's... use is merely the label for the crime."
1997.96-8516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,214.462,217.264,"Well, the statute doesn't talk about active employment."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,217.264,217.514,"--No, but it--"
1997.96-8516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,217.514,223.168,"So that the plea agreement, at least, was in terms of the statute, as was the indictment, of course."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,223.168,224.937,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-8516,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,242.118,243.3,"Well, may I ask you this."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,257.7,266.334,"It was couched in terms of possession, Your Honor and the notion of active employment was not referred to at all during this proceedings."
1997.96-8516,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,272.468,289.231,"And isn't it the case here that all participants, the judge, the prosecutor and the defendant, all of them in fact understood that the crime was possession, availability of guns and not active use, and that's what the judge explained to the defendant?"
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,289.231,290.621,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1997.96-8516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,301.888,317.499,"Now, if he hadn't been told this, but was... by the court but was advised to that effect by his lawyer and had his own misimpression as to what the law meant, would you have a solid case?"
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,317.499,320.263,"I think that would be a much harder case, Your Honor, than the one we have here."
1997.96-8516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,351.372,357.085,But you can't demand that the trial judge do more than nature allows.
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,372.476,373.157,--Well--
1997.96-8516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,373.157,376.18,"But here, the court did its best on the basis of the current law."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,376.18,381.422,"--Well, Your Honor, I have to disagree with the notion that this was the current law."
1997.96-8516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,403.105,417.437,"But a decision by this Court, you know, it is... it speaks finally to what the law means, but it doesn't simply change the legal world that existed 3 years before, where several courts of appeals may have said exactly the opposite."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,417.437,428.463,"--That's correct, Your Honor, but what it does do is create a class of defendants who are in prison for acts that Congress has never made into a crime, and--"
1997.96-8516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,428.463,430.393,"Well, it seems to me that's an important substantive argument."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,449.667,463.134,"--Well, I understand your point, Your Honor, and I would say that in order to test the validity of the plea, the appropriate standard ought to be what the statute actually says."
1997.96-8516,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,465.465,465.756,May I interrupt?
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,469.769,473.052,"--The law at the time, Your Honor, was what section 924(c) says."
1997.96-8516,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,473.052,473.312,Yes.
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,477.374,478.515,"No, Your Honor."
1997.96-8516,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,478.996,480.426,Didn't we squarely hold that in Rivers?
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,480.426,482.319,"--That's exactly right, Your Honor."
1997.96-8516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,487.692,498.879,So you wanted this district judge to instruct in the Rule 11 colloquy contrary to the holding of the court of appeals of the circuit in which he sits?
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,498.879,499.63,Well--
1997.96-8516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,499.63,508.065,"That's what you want these... I guess each district judge would have to just sit back and figure out what he thinks the law is, never mind what his court of appeals says."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,508.065,518.41,"--Actually, Your Honor, what we're pointing out here is that in these unusual situations, when a Bailey case happens... and they don't happen very often."
1997.96-8516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,527.897,546.82,"Well, they won't happen very often in the future, because we will be very, very reluctant to set aside a longstanding misinterpretation by the court of appeals if the consequence is going to be that every guilty plea rendered during that period is invalidated."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,559.339,565.551,"Certainly, Your Honor, if there had been many of those, but the fact is there have not been many."
1997.96-8516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,567.063,587.196,"But we... one of the reasons we grant certiorari on a statutory question is there's a difference of opinion among the courts of appeals, so many of the criminal statutes we decide are here solely because one court of appeals takes one position and another court of appeals takes another, so it's not as if this is going to be limited to the Bailey type situation."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,587.196,591.34,"Well, except for this, Your Honor, and this is an important distinction."
1997.96-8516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,606.02,609.813,"Well now, most statutes have several elements, you know."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,623.791,627.102,"Well, I... no, Your Honor, I'm not saying that one element is more critical than the other."
1997.96-8516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,634.987,647.276,"Well, why do you say this... this particular element, possession, that sort of thing, is critical, whereas there are other elements of the crime, too, the intent with which you have to do it."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,647.276,647.837,--Yes.
1997.96-8516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,649.607,650.518,So they're all critical?
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,650.518,655.601,"Well, I can't say whether they're all critical until I would see them, Your Honor."
1997.96-8516,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,655.601,661.926,"Well, isn't it true that that would be... of every essential element... imagine the case going to trial."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,665.886,667.118,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-8516,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,667.118,674.825,"--So one is no more or less important than the other, but it's what the law calls an essential element, something the jury must find."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,674.825,685.29,"What makes up the crime when you put them together, and I would distinguish this from the situation where a court determines, for example, that an affirmative defense might or might not be recognized."
1997.96-8516,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,708.705,721.905,"Well, if your rule is that the plea is involuntary if he doesn't know all of the correct elements, all of the correct definition of the elements of the crime, then it seems to me the district judge doesn't have much to do."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,721.905,724.196,"--Well, except, Your Honor, what--"
1997.96-8516,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,724.196,725.408,So I hope we can get beyond this.
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,741.099,759.7,"--The invalidity of the plea on the basis of the inaccurate description would, I believe, fit within the second question, although it's not specifically described there, so Your Honor is correct in that regard."
1997.96-8516,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,760.491,768.936,"Mr. Smith, there... this petitioner took an appeal, did he not, after the guilty plea?"
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,768.936,769.607,"--He did, Your Honor."
1997.96-8516,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,769.607,781.934,"And he was convicted not only of this 924 charge, use of a firearm, but also of a substantive drug offense."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,781.934,782.834,"Yes, that's correct."
1997.96-8516,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,782.834,786.687,"The appeal was from the conviction of the substantive drug offense, I take it."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,786.687,787.308,"Yes, it was."
1997.96-8516,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,787.308,795.313,And the petitioner did not appeal from the 924(c)--
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,795.313,796.064,Correct.
1997.96-8516,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,796.064,797.353,--conviction and sentence.
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,797.353,797.714,That's correct.
1997.96-8516,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,797.714,815.936,"So presumably that was waived, and at the time he chose not to appeal, assertions were being made all over the country by defendants that 924(c) did not... was not a mere possession statute."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,824.071,824.662,"Correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-8516,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,824.662,826.324,So it was waived.
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,826.324,827.233,"Well, I--"
1997.96-8516,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,827.233,829.316,"Now, is he stuck with that waiver?"
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,829.316,845.286,"--I would argue that he did not waive it, but if it were determined that he did based on Your Honor's position, I would argue that he should not be stuck with that for three important reasons."
1997.96-8516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,901.952,910.748,"Mr. Smith, I think we often apply the doctrine of procedural default when its consequence is to exclude a claim of actual innocence."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,912.959,919.965,"With this case, however, it's different, Your Honor, in that what we're speaking here about is the critical element of the crime."
1997.96-8516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,923.227,924.379,It's no different.
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,935.884,936.765,--That's... that's--
1997.96-8516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,936.765,950.164,"--and you know, if it hasn't been raised on appeal, and he says I'm innocent, and this witness would have shown I'm innocent because one of the crucial elements of the crime didn't exist, we would say, well, you should have... you know, we have a trial system and you have to play by the rules."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,950.164,966.114,"--It's quite different, Your Honor, however, when the actual element of the crime is one that's never been enacted by Congress, and which forms the basis for the petitioner's imprisonment, is something that's never actually been a crime at all, and that's the situation that we have here."
1997.96-8516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,966.114,972.128,But in the hypothetical I gave you he is going... gone to jail for doing something that Congress did not say is a crime.
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,972.128,973.45,I--
1997.96-8516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,973.45,980.335,"Because one of the elements that Congress prescribed was not... you know, he was not given a chance to deny it."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,980.335,996.174,"--The difference, however, Your Honor, is that as a matter of process and procedure here it's clear that the district court was applying the improper element from the very beginning and the explanation was improper from the very beginning."
1997.96-8516,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,996.174,1008.483,"Yes, but the defendant could have taken the position, as many defendants all across the country were doing at that time, that the statute meant something else, and he could have preserved his right to challenge that throughout."
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,1019.809,1021.231,I'd say two things.
1997.96-8516,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1077.476,1079.419,What about the other side of the bargain?
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,1098.64,1109.129,I would not agree with the notion that it should be reopened because there has been a full blown hearing at which there was an opportunity to present all the relevant facts.
1997.96-8516,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1116.883,1129.591,"But didn't the Government say, in this very case, that the reason we didn't appeal on the drug part of the... at least in part was that we had this defendant on the 924(c) charge?"
1997.96-8516,0,35136,l_marshall_smith,,1129.591,1131.382,"So the Government says now, Your Honor."
1997.96-8516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1144.751,1145.961,"Thank you, Mr. Smith."
1997.96-8516,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1148.194,1155.44,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-8516,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1183.078,1190.094,"Mr. Dreeben, it seems to me that you exaggerate the extent to which Bailey makes this a unique case."
1997.96-8516,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1236.345,1251.004,"Justice Scalia, that has, in fact, been the practice that the lower courts have followed when this Court has rendered a decision that cuts back on the reach of a Federal criminal statute as compared to the view that had prevailed in the lower courts."
1997.96-8516,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1251.004,1252.204,Let me put it this way.
1997.96-8516,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1262.392,1271.857,"That issue has not been litigated in that fashion, Justice Kennedy, so I can't say that there are a huge number of cases that address it in one way or the other."
1997.96-8516,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1271.857,1283.006,"To take the example that again the Chief Justice gave, I think it was in Ratzlaf that we held the defendant had to have knowledge of the banking regulation."
1997.96-8516,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1298.026,1317.729,"Well, by and large, Justice Kennedy, the lower courts, when confronted with guilty pleas that were entered under a serious misunderstanding of the law, have left the defendant out of the plea subject to the inquiry that we think is critical in this case, which is whether the defendant can establish that, under the correct interpretation of the law, he is actually innocent."
1997.96-8516,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1317.729,1323.632,So they'll all have to go back and reconstruct a factual situation that may have occurred years ago.
1997.96-8516,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1328.154,1342.354,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, we have taken a position that we think balances the fundamental interest in obtaining convictions under a correct understanding of the law with the interests in finality that we share with the courts."
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2236.446,2239.268,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-8516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2273.78,2275.643,May I ask you to comment on Henderson v. Morgan?
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2275.643,2291.022,"--Henderson v. Morgan involved a case where the petitioner originally was charged with first degree murder and then, without ever having been recharged, pleaded guilty to second degree murder."
1997.96-8516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2298.318,2302.521,What was the reason this Court gave for saying that the plea was involuntary in that case?
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2302.521,2305.902,--Because he wasn't apprised of the charge that he was pleading guilty to.
1997.96-8516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2305.902,2308.506,He wasn't apprised of one of the elements of the offense.
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2308.506,2310.166,"Well, it was the offense itself, Your Honor."
1997.96-8516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2318.049,2326.966,And that's the reason the Court said that there was a violation of due process of law in that he did not plead voluntarily because no one told him of one of the elements of the offense.
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2326.966,2327.617,No one told--
1997.96-8516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2327.617,2330.148,And we set aside a State conviction on a guilty plea.
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2330.148,2340.416,"--But that's a completely different case here, and let me explain what this defendant knew, because the Government seems to think it's very important what this particular petitioner's understanding was, and that's what Henderson said."
1997.96-8516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2345.249,2345.449,Right.
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2348.491,2350.642,"Well, I wouldn't go that far, but--"
1997.96-8516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2350.642,2351.463,That's what the opinion says.
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2351.463,2369.164,"--But here, this defendant was charged both with possession of originally 7 pounds of meth... methamphetamine, and with the possession, or with the use of five guns during and in relation to his trafficking in those drugs."
1997.96-8516,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2468.138,2480.435,"Mr. Walsh, you're explaining things that went on behind the scenes, but the scene itself in the courtroom was a judge asking the defendant, do you know what you were charged with?"
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2512.968,2533.391,"And at page 28 of the colloquy, Your Honor, the defendant starts to quarrel with the court about what access he actually had to these guns, and the court explains, if you want a resolution of the gun issue and its relation to the drug issue and whether you used the gun, you have a right to ask for a jury determination of that."
1997.96-8516,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2533.391,2534.482,Where did she say use the gun?
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2534.482,2538.296,"Well, she talked about the relationship of the gun to the drugs."
1997.96-8516,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2538.296,2542.287,She had in her mind that the crime was possession and proximity.
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2546.441,2554.335,"She said, I want you to understand that if you want to contest whether the guns are related to your drug trafficking you can go to trial to do that, do you understand."
1997.96-8516,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2554.335,2557.226,"Yes, related to the drug trafficking, and that's what she explained to him."
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2557.226,2559.089,"Well, that's--"
1997.96-8516,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2559.089,2560.779,Possession and proximity.
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2560.779,2562.021,--Which--
1997.96-8516,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2562.021,2563.591,Not active use.
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2563.591,2565.934,"--Well, I think that's semantical difference, Your Honor."
1997.96-8516,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2567.494,2568.556,Semantical difference?
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2589.717,2597.744,"--If the ultimate issue is whether this defendant knew what he was charged with, clearly the indictment in this case charged him with use, and that's how it's different from Henderson."
1997.96-8516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2607.742,2620.67,"Well, it surely does raise the constitutional... Henderson squarely holds, if you do not advise the guilty... the man before he pleads guilty of all the elements of the offense, the plea is involuntary, and that's what happened there, and that's what happened here."
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2620.67,2627.643,"--Well, in addition, Henderson failed to explain the state of the law at the time that the fellow pleaded guilty."
1997.96-8516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2628.615,2631.577,"Yes, but the state of the law at the time here is what we say it is."
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2633.898,2639.121,"--Well, I... the district judge can't explain the law in terms different than the law of the circuit in which he sits."
1997.96-8516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2639.121,2640.092,He certainly can.
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2645.736,2646.297,Well--
1997.96-8516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2646.297,2648.067,We squarely held that in the Rivers case.
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2648.067,2650.29,"--Well, that... well, I don't know that that was a holding--"
1997.96-8516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2650.29,2654.091,We said there the statute always has the same meaning.
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2662.158,2669.642,"--But whether that trumps the rule that the defendant takes the law as he finds it when he decides to plead guilty is a different question, and also--"
1997.96-8516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2669.642,2672.103,It's not the law as he finds it.
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2673.505,2676.868,"--Well, then that opens up Pandora's box for--"
1997.96-8516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2676.868,2689.066,"You see, in Henderson the defendant was incorrectly advised by his counsel as to what the law was, and he acted on his advice of counsel and pleaded to a crime that had not been charged."
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2689.066,2691.447,"--But in Broce, in Brady, and the--"
1997.96-8516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2691.447,2692.757,Those are not elements of the offense.
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2692.757,2713.79,"--Well, those are misinterpretations of the legal consequences of the plea, and when the defendant decides to take his chances with a guilty plea and save as much as 10 or 12 years off a drug sentence by pleading guilty to a crime that he may not be guilty of by his own acknowledgement in the record... people plead guilty for a lot of different reasons."
1997.96-8516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2739.686,2742.738,It's not a question of miscalculating the consequences of his actions.
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2748.362,2748.763,"--Well, he--"
1997.96-8516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2748.763,2750.215,--by either the court or his counsel.
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2750.215,2752.716,"--Well, he was advised by the terms of the indictment."
1997.96-8516,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2759.471,2761.532,"Well, but that... isn't that really an equivocation?"
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2785.909,2786.62,That's correct.
1997.96-8516,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2786.62,2786.847,All right.
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2910.838,2911.719,"Well, no, Justice Souter."
1997.96-8516,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2918.134,2920.946,"For trafficking... for trafficking in drugs, that's right, and that--"
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2920.946,2921.257,--and who use guns--
1997.96-8516,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2921.257,2923.968,--But that's... but he's not being locked up here for trafficking in drugs.
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2923.968,2925.19,"--Well, he is in part."
1997.96-8516,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2925.19,2930.103,"To the extent that we are concerned with his lock up, we're concerned with his lock up for the firearms offense."
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2930.103,2936.317,And certainly Congress could have made mere possession in connection with a drug trafficking offense--
1997.96-8516,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2936.317,2936.768,But it didn't.
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2937.947,2952.146,"--It didn't yet, right, but it did provide for an enhancement in the guidelines, so that conduct is recognized as reprehensible, because it gets him two extra levels on his sentence if he's found with guns, even if he's not charged under 924(c)."
1997.96-8516,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2952.146,2964.794,So you're saying the Government... I don't... I think you're saying that the Government's interest is sufficiently weighty because we can more or less equate a guidelines enhancement with conviction for a separate crime.
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2965.775,2969.719,"No, but we can take that into account in seeing whether that's conduct that the Government has the right to punish."
1997.96-8516,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2969.719,2971.429,"It's about 3 years difference, isn't it--"
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2975.022,2976.713,"2-1/2 or 3, yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-8516,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2980.897,3000.429,"May I ask you just one question also on a procedural line, because I understood your brief to make no distinction, as I thought our cases had, in the so called Teague bar between a procedural issue... I think Teague itself uses the word procedural."
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3000.429,3002.902,--Constitutional rules of procedure.
1997.96-8516,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3002.902,3006.054,"Procedure... of procedure, and something that is substantive."
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3021.953,3030.949,"Well, to the extent that the Teague progeny have been developed to date, I would agree that there has not been a case like this."
1997.96-8516,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3043.277,3047.05,But we never... don't talk about what the crime is as being a new rule.
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3068.854,3075.87,"Well, under Teague a new rule is one that's not dictated by precedent, and Bailey clearly was not dictated by precedent."
1997.96-8516,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3078.41,3086.357,"So are you urging that we extend... I mean, you've been candid in saying we haven't... we... that Teague itself uses the word procedural."
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3086.357,3087.086,--Absolutely.
1997.96-8516,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3149.167,3164.657,"Would you distinguish a case like... post Lopez, suppose somebody... direct appeal time is over, applies under 2255 to be released because he was convicted of the crime of carrying a gun within X distance of a school?"
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3164.657,3168.608,"--Well, I think as far as procedural default is concerned I would have the same analysis there."
1997.96-8516,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3172.332,3181.949,"Well, do you distinguish these two cases, or do you say they're saying too bad, you entered a plea, even though the Supreme Court said that that's not... that can't... not only it's not a crime, but can't be a crime?"
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3181.949,3197.93,"--Well, as far as if a statute is held unconstitutional the Blackledge Menna exception might... might... give that particular petitioner the right to set aside the guilty plea, but that's... Blackledge and Menna don't apply to this situation."
1997.96-8516,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3197.93,3216.82,"How do you deal with the argument made by the Solicitor General's Office that if there... there is, despite the waiver, a gateway for somebody who comes in with a colorable claim of actual innocence?"
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3216.82,3222.955,"Well, that would be a novel application of the doctrine of actual innocence, Justice O'Connor."
1997.96-8516,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3245.408,3258.428,"If this defendant had gone to trial and been convicted, would you be here making this same argument, or would you say under these circumstances that person could come in with his claim of actual innocence?"
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3258.428,3259.86,"--Well, he'd--"
1997.96-8516,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3259.86,3260.699,No guilty plea.
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3261.42,3267.344,"--He'd have a better claim, but still, this isn't actual innocence at the bottom."
1997.96-8516,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3297.924,3301.508,"Well, I think at bottom it's a little more than that."
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3316.676,3317.126,--Right.
1997.96-8516,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3317.126,3332.426,"Was the reason that he did that because there was an extant body of jurisprudence or understanding that statutory interpretations are not retroactive to final judgments, or was this... do you think this was just the assumption of the law?"
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3332.426,3343.203,I think he just felt that there were certain primary personal rights that were so fundamental that they're beyond the ability of Congress to proscribe.
1997.96-8516,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3343.203,3351.719,"Neither side has a great case for us on that, on the substantive point of retroactivity of statutory reinterpretations."
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3351.719,3352.099,That's correct.
1997.96-8516,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3355.02,3359.024,"You mean, all those books in my office, this thing has never come up?"
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3359.024,3381.048,"--Well, some of the lower courts have refused to apply decisions like Bailey retroactively, relying on the Davis case, but the Davis case is a total... that's a total misapplication of Davis, which was not a retroactivity case at all but a cognizability case, and to that extent, to that analysis we think he's just wrong."
1997.96-8516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3381.048,3382.168,"Thank you, Mr. Walsh."
1997.96-8516,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3387.641,3388.741,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
