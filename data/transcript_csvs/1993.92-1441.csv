1993.92-1441,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.678,"We'll hear argument next in No. 92-1441, Harold E. Staples v. the United States."
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,41.62,43.962,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1441,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,123.854,125.604,You say certainly he did not?
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,125.604,126.675,"--Certainly, he did not."
1993.92-1441,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,126.675,127.795,"Well, the jury thought otherwise."
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,127.795,131.208,Prior to this criminal prosecution.
1993.92-1441,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,131.208,131.879,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,132.58,154.134,"Mr. Staples believed what he possessed... possessed what he believed to be... and the undisputed evidence, testimony of three other witnesses at trial, was that this legal semiautomatic weapon, operated only in semiautomatic mode prior to government seizure and test fire in January of 1990--"
1993.92-1441,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,154.134,158.506,"Well, now, counsel, I am somewhat concerned about--"
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,158.506,159.197,--Excuse me.
1993.92-1441,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,159.197,173.386,"--the argument in your brief, and apparently one you're going to make here, that we have before us this issue of whether the defendant actually knew it was automatic."
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,181.924,189.648,"Justice O'Connor, I would disagree to the extent that the jury was precluded from considering whether or not the weapon was a machinegun."
1993.92-1441,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,201.986,203.936,"Well, I thought the jury had to find that it was a machinegun."
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,210.221,212.885,"--They had to find it was a firearm, and technically--"
1993.92-1441,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,212.885,221.611,"And the firearm was defined in this instance, under this statute, as something that fires automatically with a single pull of the trigger."
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,221.611,222.369,"--That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1993.92-1441,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,225.3,229.795,And that was the finding and the court of appeals did not upset that.
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,232.416,239.9,"--When the trigger was pulled on this gun, the weapon fired multiple shots with a single trigger pull."
1993.92-1441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,249.307,256.132,"And if it were shown that this defendant knew of... of that capability, of that operational feature, then there wouldn't be really a case here."
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,256.132,257.492,--That's correct.
1993.92-1441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,257.492,258.083,All right.
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,258.083,265.479,There are approximately 70 million law abiding gun owners in this country who Congress has consistently sought to protect.
1993.92-1441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,383.49,403.684,"When you talk about fair play, counsel, you're not suggesting that if this statute, in fact, said all you have to know is that you have a gun and the gun, in fact, has to be of a certain type... that that's what this statute said, that's fair play?"
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,403.684,408.206,"--Justice Ginsburg, I'm not sure I'm understanding your question."
1993.92-1441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,408.206,417.994,I was thinking what you said... you're interpreting a statute and you say... said that the statute requires that the defendant know he possessed a machinegun.
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,423.267,423.968,That's correct.
1993.92-1441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,423.968,439.508,"If the statute, in fact, said defendant must know he has a gun, the gun must be a machinegun, period, that that would be fair play, that you wouldn't... you're not raising a constitutional point."
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,439.508,440.237,No.
1993.92-1441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,451.346,452.636,I don't believe I authored that decision.
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,452.636,453.487,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
1993.92-1441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,453.487,455.989,"I think it was Judge Silberman, was it not?"
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,455.989,456.69,"Right, you're correct."
1993.92-1441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,457.599,459.812,And I believe that Justice Thomas concurred in that.
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,459.812,460.48,That's correct.
1993.92-1441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,481.444,485.267,If there's an ambiguity.
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,485.267,486.358,--If there... that's correct.
1993.92-1441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,520.139,521.53,"Well, do they say that in our drug laws?"
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,529.235,529.816,No.
1993.92-1441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,562.688,567.67,But doesn't Congress say what drugs are unlawful?
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,567.67,570.482,"Yes, certainly they do."
1993.92-1441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,572.174,581.309,"So why isn't this case more like the drug case, particularly the Balint case, than it is like the Food Stamps case."
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,588.816,591.037,"I would agree with you, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-1441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,612.21,618.215,And don't... don't some drugs have lawful uses too?
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,618.215,623.076,"--Certainly, prescription drugs, or... if that's what the Justice is referring to."
1993.92-1441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,625.149,633.204,"Well, one could even lawfully possess marijuana in connection with treatment of certain forms of cancer, is that not so?"
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,633.204,634.526,--That is... that is correct.
1993.92-1441,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,663.074,664.484,I don't quite understand what the Second Amendment has to do with the case.
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,665.305,675.673,"Only in that it allowed Congress... it supports a constitutional basis to allow Congress... which Congress has relied on, let me rephrase that."
1993.92-1441,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,689.05,690.98,The militia is.
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,690.98,692.583,"--Exactly, that's correct."
1993.92-1441,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,692.583,693.304,It is.
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,694.974,695.625,No.
1993.92-1441,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,698.177,701.249,"Well, we mentioned earlier about the lawful uses of articles of this kind."
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,703.69,710.986,"There are approximately, my understanding would be, about 140,000 registered machineguns."
1993.92-1441,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,713.478,714.028,I know.
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,736.822,746.92,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't stand before this Court to be a firearms expert, but I do believe that there are competitions involving machineguns, and there are other... are other uses for them."
1993.92-1441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,751.872,757.225,Is your point machineguns or is your point semiautomatic rifles?
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,757.225,757.936,--This case--
1993.92-1441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,757.936,764.711,"Which, due to some defect, may turn into machineguns, which is what you... what you say is the situation here."
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,764.711,766.331,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1993.92-1441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,766.331,768.702,"And there are many more than 140,000 semiautomatic rifles."
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,768.702,769.423,"That's right, there--"
1993.92-1441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,769.423,770.926,Many hunters use semiautomatics all the time.
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,773.627,774.706,--That's right.
1993.92-1441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,782.213,789.519,I suppose that a pistol... would a pistol that had that defect become... would an automatic pistol that had that defect become a machinegun?
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,789.519,791.46,--You mean a semiautomatic pistol?
1993.92-1441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,791.46,792.301,A semiautomatic pistol?
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,792.301,799.857,"It's my understanding that any semiautomatic pistol, sport rifle, shotgun, has the capability--"
1993.92-1441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,799.857,802.829,"If it fires more than one round with a pull, it doesn't matter how long the barrel is, it becomes a machinegun."
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,802.829,810.143,"--If it fires more than one shot with a single pull of the trigger, it becomes a machinegun under the strict liability theory."
1993.92-1441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,836.843,837.925,"Well, that's not quite accurate."
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,848.534,849.515,I--
1993.92-1441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,849.515,857.569,"Wasn't this weapon an automatic weapon as originally designed, and it had been modified to prevent the automatic feature of it from operating?"
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,857.569,861.172,--If you're referring to the stop on the switch--
1993.92-1441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,861.172,861.97,Exactly.
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,861.97,877.772,"--The... when this... the testimony at trial has been consistently, from the seller all the way through, of this AR-15 sport rifle, as of when my client purchased it at the gun show, it was manufactured with M-16 internal parts."
1993.92-1441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,908.365,910.736,"In which case you wouldn't be making this argument, if your client had bought one of those."
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,910.736,911.677,"--Well, with one exception."
1993.92-1441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,922.035,923.696,No I realize that.
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,935.215,937.606,"--You are correct, primarily because at trial--"
1993.92-1441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,937.606,941.229,"Well, I suppose I didn't understand your answer to Justice Scalia's question."
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,953.505,954.356,--That's correct.
1993.92-1441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,954.356,959.218,So it was not manufactured as a machinegun within the meaning of the act.
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,959.218,960.56,That's correct.
1993.92-1441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,961.671,964.244,Only if there's a defect does it become... does it acquire that characteristic.
1993.92-1441,0,28872,jennifer_l_de_angelis,,964.244,964.872,--That's correct.
1993.92-1441,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1153.67,1165.788,"You may proceed, Mr. Feldman."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1165.788,1171.594,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.92-1441,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1208.707,1218.715,"Mr. Feldman, now, just to clarify for us, you agree that this weapon was manufactured as a semiautomatic?"
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1218.715,1219.104,Yes.
1993.92-1441,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1220.125,1223.688,"And as manufactured, it would not fall within the definition of a machinegun?"
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1223.688,1226.289,"--At least... yes, yes."
1993.92-1441,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1235.805,1264.255,"Now, if... if the modifications of a weapon were... were strictly internal so there was nothing on the exterior that would alert a possessor about the change, and if you had a defendant who simply didn't know that the weapon had been modified internally when it was purchased, that person would be liable under your theory, I guess."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1264.255,1264.805,--That's correct.
1993.92-1441,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1276.383,1276.984,"Yes, I just want to--"
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1276.984,1277.693,But in our view--
1993.92-1441,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1277.693,1288.99,"--I want to understand how far your theory goes, and it would go so far as to hold someone who was absolutely unaware of the modification liable."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1288.99,1289.541,"--Yes, that's correct."
1993.92-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1340.659,1341.81,"Mr. Feldman, I don't understand your argument."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1345.463,1346.625,"No, it doesn't say that."
1993.92-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1370.47,1375.423,"But narcotics are different from... from a semiautomatic rifle, which are very common."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1375.423,1376.794,That's true.
1993.92-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1378.076,1381.577,Narcotics may not be different from a machinegun that looks like a machinegun.
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1381.577,1383.019,--Well--
1993.92-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1383.019,1385.991,"It's something when, you know, you're presented with it, you say, gee, this is a machinegun, what's this doing around here."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1395.057,1401.549,"--That's true, and... but I think the same thing would have been true of drugs at the time they enacted the Harrison Narcotics Act."
1993.92-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1449.483,1467.896,"Well, it was, except that in the narcotics example, I suppose it's true to say that Congress did not draw a line between... sort of down the middle in the class of dangerous narcotics and say, well, we'll... we'll prohibit or regulate some and leave others free."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1501.099,1504.601,I guess I'd respectfully disagree with that.
1993.92-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1540.875,1551.673,"Well, I'm still... I guess maybe I'm going to move aside a little bit from the... from attacking the historical analogy, and just go to the merits of applying the interpretive rule here."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1575.708,1576.469,Well--
1993.92-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1576.469,1580.472,"So just on the analytical point, I think you've got a hurdle to jump here."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1580.472,1584.796,"--I think... well, I guess I do think the historical point is important."
1993.92-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1627.753,1653.649,"Well, does the... does the argument, then, in this case, come down to the fact that if you're dealing with a machinegun, that's fair to say, something which is manufactured as a machinegun, sold as a machinegun, anyone sort of buying it could reasonably be assumed... or possessing it, could reasonably be assumed to know that it was a machinegun, but that the argument doesn't wash in the case of a gun which, at least to external appearances, is not a machinegun."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1653.649,1657.302,"--Well, there have... as I said, there have been courts that have taken that view."
1993.92-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1665.718,1670.082,"To this act, that it falls within this very dangerous category of regulated weapons."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1670.082,1671.802,--I--
1993.92-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1671.802,1675.385,"In other words, we've got a category of dangerous weapons which are not regulated."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1722.244,1722.785,--Right.
1993.92-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1735.995,1743.601,"Well, they may have... they may have done that on the assumption that we were going to apply this rule, which we're having difficulty applying, or at least I'm having difficulty applying."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1754.728,1766.218,"--I guess, well... I think, actually, the way I would put it would be that the burden is on... would... the burden would be on petitioners to show that even though Congress didn't include... it's not their failure to act positively."
1993.92-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1775.514,1777.624,"Well, while keeping... while keeping their silence on mens rea."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1777.624,1778.563,Right.
1993.92-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1801.43,1823.013,"But I... I think... I guess what's... I guess what's bothering me is that I don't see in the drug situation an analogy to this fact about the gun situation: In the gun situation, there has been a continuing political contest for further back than I can tell, about the appropriateness of regulating guns."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1839.975,1843.117,"Well, I mean, I guess I'd make two points in response to that."
1993.92-1441,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1898.097,1904.821,Is there any circuit other than... any circuit other than the D.C. Circuit that has gone for the defendant in?
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1904.821,1913.736,"--The D.... as we read the cases, the only... the D.C. Circuit is the only... is the one that created the conflict in the circuits on the issue in this case."
1993.92-1441,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1929.436,1946.086,"Couldn't one rank this gun, based on the defendant's expert testimony, that this was a defect, and so bracket the defective gun with the internal modification, rather than the external modification?"
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1946.086,1948.529,"Well, I suppose... one could accept that."
1993.92-1441,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1967.482,1968.463,"Well, of course--"
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1971.906,1973.746,"I don't... no, I don't think so."
1993.92-1441,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1991.507,1992.919,"Well, isn't it a question of law as to what is a machinegun and what isn't?"
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1992.919,1993.638,Right.
1993.92-1441,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1994.369,2000.914,"Well, is it your position that a defective firearm that fires multiple rounds is or is not a machinegun?"
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2000.914,2005.676,--If it... if it fire... if it fires multiple rounds.
1993.92-1441,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2012.641,2013.973,"Can you tell me where you're reading from, please?"
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2013.973,2016.115,"--Actually, it's excerpted on page 4 of our brief."
1993.92-1441,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2016.115,2016.963,Thank you.
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2016.963,2024.869,"Any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot automatically more than one shot without manual reloading."
1993.92-1441,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2035.949,2037.558,So the Government's position is that unless--
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2037.558,2040.901,--That type of... this is a capability that this weapon has.
1993.92-1441,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2040.901,2049.266,--So the Government's position is that there's a machinegun involved if it shoots most of the time or some of the time as fully automatic?
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2049.266,2057.36,"I hesitate to depart too far, because I think it has to have the general capability of shooting more than once with a single pull of the trigger."
1993.92-1441,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2058.743,2064.867,"If the statute is ambiguous, isn't that an argument for requiring specific knowledge of its characteristics, as opposed to strict liability?"
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2064.867,2072.922,--I don't... in the... in the... I guess I don't see the ambiguity.
1993.92-1441,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2075.342,2077.355,"Well, it seems to me we've just stumbled onto one."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2077.355,2079.576,"--I don't... actually, I don't think it's an ambiguity."
1993.92-1441,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2100.58,2103.222,"And the Government has the burden of proof on that, I take it."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2103.222,2103.823,--That's right.
1993.92-1441,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2103.823,2106.724,And the jury must be instructed as to that.
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2106.724,2107.295,That's right.
1993.92-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2122.453,2126.356,"Well, was the jury instructed on the... on a defensive defect here?"
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2127.768,2129.579,I don't recall... I actually don't recall the specific--
1993.92-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2129.579,2137.714,"Well, you said a moment ago that the jury rejected the theory that, in fact, this was a merely defective gun, and I didn't... I didn't understand that that issue was put to the jury."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2137.714,2138.866,--The--
1993.92-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2138.866,2144.849,"In fact, I don't... as I understood the instructions, the jury wouldn't have had any occasion even to take that issue up."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2144.849,2150.663,"--The jury was instructed that... was instructed, I think, in terms of the definition of machinegun that I read to you, as I recall."
1993.92-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2150.663,2151.203,Yes.
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2151.203,2152.996,So it was instructed on what a machinegun is.
1993.92-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2152.996,2165.194,"And under that definition, as I understand the instructions, if the jury found that on one occasion one pull of the trigger shot more than one round, that that... that would qualify as a machinegun."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2165.194,2166.905,"Well, I don't think--"
1993.92-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2166.905,2173.001,"And the jury was not instructed, as I understand it, that in... in the generality of cases this particular gun had to function in that way."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2181.245,2181.856,"--Again, I don't recall."
1993.92-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2185.579,2188.621,"Well, then we can't... we can't say that the jury rejected the theory of defect in this case."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2188.621,2196.138,"I think what you can say is that the jury concluded that the gun was an automatic gun, as defined by... an automatic gun as defined by the statute."
1993.92-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2198.018,2199.868,"Well, I agree with you, but that's not... that's not the point."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2210.175,2215.479,"--Well, I have to say the court of appeals didn't rule, as I recall, on any theory... on the theory of defective weapon."
1993.92-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2216.77,2227.797,"No, I'm not addressing the court of appeals, I'm just addressing your argument, and you were making the argument a moment ago that the jury had rejected the theory of defect, and I don't see how it did... you can make that argument based on the instructions."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2227.797,2233.882,"--Well, let me go... as far as the theory of defect goes, I don't understand exactly what the theory of defect is."
1993.92-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2243.429,2244.567,"Well, regardless--"
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2244.567,2245.208,And that... that--
1993.92-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2245.208,2249.952,"--Regardless of what the theory of defect is, the jury did not reject a theory of defect."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2253.153,2258.957,"--I guess... I don't mean to fight the premises here, but I think--"
1993.92-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2258.957,2260.239,You're doing... you're doing a good job.
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2260.97,2261.761,--Perhaps.
1993.92-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2322.052,2326.386,"Mr. Feldman, can I ask what the Government's theory of mens rea requirement is?"
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2335.511,2336.701,That's correct.
1993.92-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2336.701,2341.513,"Ordinarily, we will read in a requirement that you have to know you're violating the law."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2341.513,2342.464,That's correct.
1993.92-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2342.464,2345.036,"Now, what... what makes this different?"
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2345.036,2346.918,I would say there's about three factors.
1993.92-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2368.371,2372.244,All registration and recordkeeping requirements do not have a scienter.
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2372.244,2391.599,"I think where Congress... we would be comfortable with the rule that where Congress doesn't specify otherwise, and where it's dealing with highly hazardous threats to the community and imposes a registration and recordkeeping requirement, that in those circumstances a very weak scienter requirement of the sort that was given to the jury here is appropriate."
1993.92-1441,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2391.599,2400.694,"Well, Mr. Feldman, does the Government want to concede that you ordinarily read in a requirement that you must know you're violating the law in every criminal statute where Congress is silent?"
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2404.985,2406.307,"Yes, that's correct."
1993.92-1441,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2406.307,2407.118,"Well, then--"
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2407.118,2407.697,And I didn't mean to concede that.
1993.92-1441,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2407.697,2413.133,"--Well, but it's... then, it seems to me, you're giving a different answer to me than you gave to Justice Scalia a moment ago."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2413.133,2413.643,I'm sorry.
1993.92-1441,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2430.354,2435.676,"Well, but that's a different... it's one thing to say the defendant must know the facts that make his conduct illegal."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2440.211,2440.628,--Right.
1993.92-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2445.203,2446.463,I meant... I meant the former.
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2458.681,2459.703,That's right.
1993.92-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2460.644,2462.525,But you say that's not the case here because--
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2462.525,2463.965,--Because--
1993.92-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2463.965,2470.379,"--Machineguns are dangerous and this act looks like another act that we've held doesn't have a recordkeeping requirement, and this is a... doesn't have such a requirement."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2475.651,2481.845,--I mean I guess... I guess what I would add to that is that the primary determinant should be what Congress' intent was.
1993.92-1441,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2487.06,2494.925,"Do most recordkeeping acts have prison sanctions for up to 10 years, which is what this is?"
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2494.925,2497.407,"--That is a stiff sentence, I'll agree."
1993.92-1441,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2512.329,2522.785,"Well, it seems to me that implicit in the argument that it's a registration, a regulatory act, is also the assumption that the penalty is... is not too severe."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2524.595,2526.848,--It's true that it is a severe penalty.
1993.92-1441,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2564.883,2587.367,"Mr. Feldman, remind me of your answer to Justice Souter's question about the difference between drugs, where one would say drugs are dangerous, and guns where, for the most part, Congress hasn't regulated, so it's only a special category that's registered?"
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2594.613,2597.614,I think there's... there's really distinctions on both sides of that.
1993.92-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2666.492,2667.183,Mr.--
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2682.393,2683.524,"No, that's not our position."
1993.92-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2684.716,2685.114,Oh.
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2685.114,2686.115,--is you do have to know it's a gun.
1993.92-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2687.097,2687.828,Why is that?
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2687.828,2689.067,--The position we have--
1993.92-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2689.067,2690.299,Why is that?
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2690.299,2703.597,"--Because I think in draws the line that the Court has drawn between items xx apparent xx re entirely innocent, such as... such as Food Stamps xx type of conduct at issue in United States Gypsum--"
1993.92-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2703.597,2706.51,"Is that the way the drug law is interpreted too, that you appeal to?"
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2714.675,2715.456,"--In Bailant, that's not what they said."
1993.92-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2715.456,2716.307,I didn't think it was.
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2716.307,2725.323,"In Bailant they didn't address what you... what the... what the Court held in Bailant was that you... it rejected petitioner's position in this case, which is you don't have to know that what you possessed was opiates or cocaine."
1993.92-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2725.323,2725.884,Right.
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2725.884,2727.374,They... The Court didn't go into what you do have to know.
1993.92-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2727.374,2728.075,"No, but if--"
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2728.075,2728.716,And to some extent--
1993.92-1441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2728.716,2734.68,"--I think if you're going to appeal to Bailant and the drug cases, you have to say it really doesn't even matter whether he knows it's... it's a... he owns a gun."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2734.68,2742.494,"--I think that it's reasonable that... I think the question of what you do have to know is... well, it's one that they didn't address in Bailant."
1993.92-1441,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2761.848,2762.967,"Well, isn't it true that all the courts of appeals have done that."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2766.11,2768.113,"Yes, as far as I'm aware."
1993.92-1441,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2768.113,2773.255,"Do you happen to know, as a matter of history, what precipitated the enactment of the '34 act?"
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2773.255,2774.726,I... it was--
1993.92-1441,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2774.726,2776.488,You didn't live in--
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2776.488,2778.618,--There was testimony about Dillinger I believe.
1993.92-1441,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2778.618,2780.591,"--You didn't live in Chicago then, I guess."
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2780.738,2780.591,Yes.
1993.92-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2781.269,2819.177,"Is it fair to say... we could argue about the facts of application, but is it fair to say that your interpret... the Government's interpretative rule for finding what Congress probably intended, or imputing an intent to Congress, does require, for your position to prevail, that we conclude that the... that the... that the defendant understand that what he was possessing was... was an object within a class of highly dangerous objects which it is reasonable to suppose the Government would regulate?"
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2819.177,2820.665,I--
1993.92-1441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2820.665,2821.797,Is that the general premise?
1993.92-1441,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,2821.797,2825.029,"--That would be one formulation, yes."
