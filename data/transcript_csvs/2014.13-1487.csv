2014.13-1487,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.91,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 1314-87, Henderson v. The United States. Mr. Ortiz."
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,7.91,21.235,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case asks whether the felon in possession statute prevents the court from ordering the government to transfer firearms in its possession that are owned by a felon to a suitable third party."
2014.13-1487,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,35.425,43.935,Why isn't -- is that enough for your client? He wants to sell the firearms to -- the government is willing to let a licensed firearms dealer sell them for him?
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,43.935,44.93,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-1487,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,55.395,67.93,"Did -- I didn't -- I thought that before the district court there was only first, his friend, then his mother, and then another friend."
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,76.05,84.375,"Your Honor, you can see the references on page 71, 170, 132 and page 195 of the joint appendix."
2014.13-1487,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,103.595,113.67,"But that doesn't mention anything about a gun dealer, and he had been quite specific about the persons to whom he wanted the guns transferred."
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,113.67,126.49,"Well, Your Honor, the -- in the -- in the Miller case, which he cites there for the proposition that a sale would be an appropriate remedy, the sale was through -- license -- one of the possibilities was sale through a licensed gun dealer."
2014.13-1487,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,126.49,141.67,"Is there any point in the references that you made where he said to the court, ""I would like these guns to be consigned to a licensed gun dealer""?"
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,141.67,151.415,"He, twice, Your Honor, did not -- he did not mention the word licensed gun dealer, but he said transfer for sale, did not limit it to any particular person."
2014.13-1487,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,166.82,170.53,Wasn't he on a futile mission in this circuit?
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,170.53,173.02,"Yes, Your Honor, he was on a futile mission in this circuit."
2014.13-1487,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,173.02,181.515,"Because this circuit had already ruled that any kind of sale by anyone was prohibited, because he was a felon."
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,181.515,183.31,"That is clear, Justice Sotomayor."
2014.13-1487,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,183.88,193.71,"And when he went up on appeal, he cited the Brown case to the court -- to the circuit court, which had held that a court-ordered sale was okay."
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,193.71,194.52,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-1487,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,194.52,204.345,"And despite him citing the Brown case, the Eighth Circuit continued with its own precedent and said no one can sell it, not even the court."
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,204.345,207.79,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-1487,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,226.97,232.37,I would have thought -- I would have thought you would oppose the notion that that would be an adequate -- adequate relief.
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,239.065,240.05,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-1487,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,265.61,279.555,"How do you -- how does one tell -- let's take the two people -- two friends that you opposed -- suggested transferring them to, or his wife so they could stay within the family."
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,290.24,294.94,"Your Honor, it's up to the district court to hold a hearing on the issue."
2014.13-1487,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,339.92,343.71,And under what statutory rule or authority does the court hold that hearing?
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,343.71,350.1,"This is under its traditional equitable principles or authority, Your Honor."
2014.13-1487,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,350.1,357.57,Is there a black-letter case you can cite for the proposition that the court has this general equitable authority?
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,357.57,358.68,"Well, Your Honor --"
2014.13-1487,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,358.68,362.77,Because I'm wondering if the government wants to sue under the Tucker Act or something.
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,363.495,363.9,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-1487,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,403.94,407.245,And 41(g) is too much of a stretch?
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,407.245,411.91,"No, Your Honor, we believe that Rule 41(g) would also work here."
2014.13-1487,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,441.43,445.055,But it's not just return; right? It's return the property to the movant.
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,445.055,445.41,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-1487,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,445.41,447.62,So how does this fit under 41(g)?
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,447.62,454.05,"Well, it's a kind of complicated transaction under Rule 41(g), Your Honor."
2014.13-1487,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,470.48,478.62,He's asking for the stick and the bundle that's called ownership and -- and the funds from the transfer.
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,478.62,479.35,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-1487,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,535.95,550.11,"Just so I understand the scope of your position, you say that the district court has discretion to figure out, you know, whether a particular person whom your client or someone else wants to sell the gun to is an appropriate recipient of the gun."
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,571.385,576.695,"That would be required, Your Honor, although there might be some argument about the particular gun dealer."
2014.13-1487,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,583.26,584.64,"I'm sorry, would you repeat that?"
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,584.64,584.95,Sorry.
2014.13-1487,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,600.26,622.24,"Can I ask you a question about your argument that a district court would have the discretion to prevent the transfer of a gun from the convicted felon to a third party who has some acquaintance with the convicted felon? A friend, let's say."
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,643.74,644.56,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-1487,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,644.56,668.245,"So why should the situation -- and that would be true even though he is a friend of the convicted felon, and there might be some risk that he would allow the convicted felon to use the firearm. So why should the situation be different when the district court is considering whether the firearm can be transferred from the convicted felon to this individual?"
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,668.245,669.705,It shouldn't be any different.
2014.13-1487,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,669.705,683.07,But I thought you understood -- I though you were saying that the district court would have the discretion to prevent that transfer if the district court thought there was some risk that this individual would allow the convicted felon to have access to the firearm.
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,683.07,704.295,"If, in its hearing, the district court is not -- insufficiently convinced that there is independence between the owner and the transferee, it might, as an exercise of its exercise of its equitable discretion because it is a question of equity, refuse the direct transfer and put it up for -- put the firearms for sale through a licensed gun dealer."
2014.13-1487,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,704.295,710.11,And then that individual could go to the licensed firearm dealer and buy exactly the same gun.
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,710.11,710.8,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-1487,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,710.8,712.92,So I don't see how the two positions are --
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,712.92,726.735,"Well, at -- at the extreme -- at the extreme, Justice Alito, imagine a situation where someone in this position is proposing transfer to an unindicted drug kingpin, something like that."
2014.13-1487,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,771.96,780.69,And who -- who makes the arrangement? Who selects the gun dealer and makes the arrangement for the consignment? Does the court do that --
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,780.69,781.47,I believe --
2014.13-1487,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,781.47,784.68,-- or does Henderson do it?
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,784.68,795.105,"In the cases where the district courts have -- or the courts below have taken this approach, Your Honor, it's usually a matter of negotiation between the government and the felon."
2014.13-1487,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,795.105,795.6,"And, Mr. --"
2014.13-1487,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,795.6,802.07,"Well, I would assume it ought to be the gun owner's first preference."
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,821.65,822.82,"That would be the normal, Your Honor."
2014.13-1487,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,828.79,849.05,I think Justice Alito's question is basically why would the district court have equitable power to turn down any named buyer so long as it is an actual buyer.
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,867.25,880.75,"Justice Sotomayor, the district court shouldn't have that power unless the public interest, which is always a concern in equity, would be violated by it, and those cases would be few and far between."
2014.13-1487,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,891.74,903.725,"And, Mr. Ortiz, why is it required that the court arrange for some transfer, whether to a gun dealer or otherwise? Is it principles of equity that require that? Is it something else?"
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,903.725,907.495,"Well, Your Honor, there's no statutory bar to it."
2014.13-1487,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,907.95,908.04,Right.
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,908.04,909.22,-- principles of equity and there's no --
2014.13-1487,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,909.22,919.31,"There -- there's no statutory bar, but I guess I'm asking a further question because you said in response to my earlier question it's not just discretionary, it's required, you know, at least to a gun dealer."
2014.13-1487,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,924.11,926.38,"Well, that requirement has several sources."
2014.13-1487,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,961.605,968.465,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. O'Connell."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,968.465,988.325,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If a convicted felon selects a recipient of his firearms and negotiates the terms of a transfer but then relies on someone else to deliver the firearms, he still has the power and intention at a given time to exercise dominion and control over those firearms, which amounts to constructive possession."
2014.13-1487,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,988.325,995.33,"Where did it -- the ability to sell something depends upon ownership, not possession."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1012.375,1042.58,"The definition of constructive possession, which everybody agrees is included within the word ""possession"" in 922(g), is when a person has the power and intention at a given time to exercise dominion and control over the property, either directly or through others. And it's our position that if he is selecting the recipient, excluding others from receiving it, and negotiating the terms of the sale, that he has the power and intention at that time to exercise dominion and control over those firearms. We've cited some papers --"
2014.13-1487,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1042.58,1047.3,But he doesn't -- he doesn't have much control when the government is holding them.
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1058.45,1058.88,Right.
2014.13-1487,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1075.96,1081.05,But do you think that the -- the person can pick the firearms dealer?
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1081.05,1082.04,Yes.
2014.13-1487,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1082.9,1088.23,"Well, then your -- your position is internally contradictory, right? You think he can pick the firearms dealer."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1093.42,1096.26,"I -- I don't think so, and let me explain why."
2014.13-1487,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1121.3,1124.58,"Well, then suppose his friend comes forward and says, I don't really intend to possess this."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1127.36,1133.425,"Well, I think there's -- so as I was saying, there's a question over who sells it. We think the FFL."
2014.13-1487,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1164.99,1181.73,"Why -- well, why do you say that constructive possession only consists of being able to decide where they go? Why isn't it constructive possession to be able to decide who gets them for later transfer? Why doesn't -- why isn't that an exercise --"
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1181.73,1182.015,I think --
2014.13-1487,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1182.015,1183.935,-- of -- of dominion over them to some extent?
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1183.935,1191.56,"I think it's harder to say that you're exercising dominion and control over something by saying, I want to get rid of these and please -- please do it."
2014.13-1487,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1191.56,1193.79,I want so-and-so to sell them.
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1212.57,1226.02,"If he is just -- if there is just a party that's appointed to sell the firearms for him, and we -- we have to get rid of them somehow, and so we think the best way to do it is to give them to a licensed firearms dealer. And -- and, Justice Scalia, you know --"
2014.13-1487,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1226.02,1227.26,I'm not saying it doesn't make sense.
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1243.34,1256.1,We -- it -- it's just more -- it's -- it's harder to say he's exercising dominion and control when they are just being given to a neutral third party who's going to sell them in an arm's-length transaction to the entire universe of buyers that are eligible to --
2014.13-1487,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1256.1,1257.23,I don't think it's harder at all.
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1263.535,1265.51,We think you can draw a distinction.
2014.13-1487,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1288.65,1298.38,"What if -- what if he wants to donate them to someone? He wants to donate them to the Texas National Guard? Could he do that? I mean, the -- the Federal firearms dealer doesn't help you there."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1298.38,1299.185,No.
2014.13-1487,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1300.83,1302.32,"No, I mean, no, he can't do it or --"
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1302.32,1303.0,He cannot.
2014.13-1487,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1311.5,1316.905,"To the Federal government he says, I -- I'm sorry about the conviction. I want to give these to the Federal government. Can he do that?"
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1316.905,1317.37,"Well, I --"
2014.13-1487,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1317.37,1318.955,I -- I guess that's what he's doing.
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1318.955,1320.615,He -- he -- he's not.
2014.13-1487,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1327.26,1331.68,"Why isn't that exercising dominion and control? I mean, he says, I'm not going to propose anything."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1335.82,1338.52,"The reason why is because we already have them, frankly."
2014.13-1487,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1345.475,1346.895,"Well, lucky you. (Laughter.)"
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1346.895,1347.365,Right.
2014.13-1487,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1350.02,1383.225,"Ms. O'Connell, can I ask why -- why it is that we're looking at it in terms of the sale? I mean, this is -- this constructive possession question, it would seem to me to make a lot more sense to ask the person who's going to end up getting it, is there a chance that the original owner can control what that person does with it. In other words, you know, I give it to my wife, I give it to my best friend, and I'm really in a position where I'm controlling the use of the firearm. And that seems to me to make perfect sense, not the question of, like, who controls the sale mechanism."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1383.225,1397.52,"I -- I agree with you, Justice Kagan, that it makes perfect sense to look at whether the felon has control over the person that gets the firearms, but I think there's a separate time period that we need to look at during the sale to determine whether he's exercising dominion and control over the --"
2014.13-1487,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1397.52,1413.525,"Where does all this come from? I mean, to me, when somebody uses the word ""constructive X,"" that just means it's not X and -- and it's a way of pretending that it's X when it isn't. So I start with that and say what you're worried about here -- of course, he doesn't have any possession of it."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1448.175,1455.34,"I think, Justice Breyer, that we are not pulling our constructive possession position out of thin air."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1455.34,1456.9,If there are --
2014.13-1487,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1456.9,1461.25,"-- things like that, and I don't understand any piece of it that has something in that like it."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1461.25,1477.45,"We have -- the cases we've cited -- I want to draw your attention to the cases we've cited on pages 25 and 26 of our brief that involve convicted felons who are out in the world and they are negotiating sales of firearms. And they are saying, Hey, buyer, do you want to buy this firearm? Let's negotiate the terms."
2014.13-1487,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1484.26,1484.35,Okay.
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1508.19,1517.57,"Those cases, though, are not concerned with we -- we want to double check on who the buyer is and see if that buyer is going to be subject to the convicted felon's control."
2014.13-1487,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1521.96,1533.18,"But that seems to me very different than the situation here, Ms. O'Connell, because in that case, what the gang leader has is a situation where somebody else is holding a gun for him and he can say anything to that person."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1558.565,1569.56,I don't -- I don't think that any of the cases that I was just referring to involve situations where the convicted felon has control over the person that's receiving the gun.
2014.13-1487,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1584.07,1587.415,"Yeah, but he doesn't -- he doesn't have to get anybody to approve the buyer."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1606.36,1633.66,"We -- we acknowledge that because the guns are in our possession and the Petitioner needs a court order in order for them to go somewhere, that the court is exercising, also, some control over the weapons; but by reserving this right to nominate somebody to receive them, the convicted felon is also exercising control over the weapons. I'll point out that in the Petitioner's opening brief when he described the main attributes of possession, he said the right to control and the right to exclude."
2014.13-1487,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1643.61,1644.42,"Well, the reality is --"
2014.13-1487,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1644.42,1645.01,Is this --
2014.13-1487,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1645.01,1651.78,"The reality is that the world is not going to know the guns are there, so -- but there's no exclusion."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1676.245,1683.79,"Well, I think because -- I don't -- I don't know that it's true that any other person could just come in and ask for the firearms."
2014.13-1487,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1685.11,1691.9,"Well, you're saying the court is the one who decides whether the person who's nominated is appropriate or not."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1691.9,1692.415,Right.
2014.13-1487,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1701.19,1706.685,"But what is it you want to have happen; that is, the gun was taken away from him."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1706.685,1707.13,Yes.
2014.13-1487,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1707.13,1708.87,He can't possess it anymore.
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1723.705,1728.57,We think it should go to a Federal firearms licensed dealer for a sale.
2014.13-1487,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1755.005,1762.64,But the idea -- the idea that it should be sold through a Federal firearms dealer is a late idea.
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1767.575,1768.29,Right.
2014.13-1487,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1775.71,1782.555,"Well, what did you anticipate -- what was your position before you changed it here in this Court about what should happen to the guns?"
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1782.555,1802.22,"I mean, I think in the Eleventh Circuit, Federal law enforcement officers that have these guns and are trying to decide what to do with them when they get the request coming in from the felons were -- were certainly under the impression that Howell controlled and that they certainly couldn't give it to somebody that was selected by the convicted felon, but also that they couldn't sell it."
2014.13-1487,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1802.36,1805.68,Has the Federal government ever used these guns?
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1805.68,1806.66,"No, and if we --"
2014.13-1487,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1806.66,1821.88,"Not these particular ones but guns that were forfeited by a convicted felon and someone who couldn't sell them to anyone, at least until you changed the position and said they could sell them to a firearms dealer? They just sat around gathering dust?"
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1821.88,1828.77,"They -- they do, because we don't -- if the opinion is affirmed, if there's, you know, nothing to do with these guns, we don't gain title to them."
2014.13-1487,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1885.29,1885.77,"Well, that wouldn't --"
2014.13-1487,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1885.77,1919.74,"But the same trap that you're -- I'm a little bit upset at your brief, frankly, because in that circuit, he couldn't know that there was any permissible sale, because that circuit had said none. And so to come back and say to us that we should leave it in their discretion as to whether it should go to a -- a Federal -- a federally licensed firearms dealer seems as if the government has set a trap for a pro se litigant."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1919.74,1922.16,We are -- we are certainly not trying to do that.
2014.13-1487,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1943.24,1944.79,That's not -- that's not going to get it done.
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1955.78,1959.655,We do not think the Unclean Hands Doctrine applies in this case.
2014.13-1487,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1979.93,1986.37,"Is that going to be your -- your position -- I mean, because I'm getting away from the -- what I call the legal mumbo-jumbo."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2060.48,2064.095,"Yeah, I think that's -- that is a perfectly fine solution."
2014.13-1487,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2087.39,2088.99,Is this Federal license --
2014.13-1487,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2088.99,2109.51,"Sold -- that is -- is it the government's position that it's the licensed firearm dealer or -- in effect, forfeited to the government? Is there any other transferee in the government's view that would be appropriate?"
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2109.51,2110.15,No.
2014.13-1487,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2119.6,2127.855,"But it would have to be sold, but the sale would be -- or the consignment would be to a licensed dealer."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2131.51,2135.935,I'm -- I'm rejecting his ability to decide who to sell it to.
2014.13-1487,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2170.6,2187.1,"Can he select the FFL? Can he select the Federal -- I mean, you know, suppose the government says we want it sold by a firearms dealer in San Francisco and he says, what? You know, they don't sell any guns in San Francisco."
2014.13-1487,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2191.95,2194.675,Can -- can he pick the firearms dealer?
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2194.675,2201.25,"What we have said is yes, he can -- the district court has to figure out who's going to sell these firearms."
2014.13-1487,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2226.51,2228.105,Justice -- Justice Alito.
2014.13-1487,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2228.105,2246.385,"Well, what would happen if someone is on trial for a felony and has in -- in his house a number of firearms and then the person is convicted? So what -- how can that person deal with the firearms in the house without exercising constructive possession in your view?"
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2246.385,2258.22,"So, this is probably the one scenario where somebody like -- I don't know that he couldn't have made arrangements beforehand, but we don't really expect him to because he could be holding out hope he's going to be acquited."
2014.13-1487,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2308.04,2310.03,"Well, then why can't we do that here?"
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2310.03,2316.52,"Well, because that -- that is not the type of -- a petitioner who pleads guilty is not in that position."
2014.13-1487,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2321.02,2342.915,"I mean, your whole argument -- the reason I took it that the government wants this firearm thing, firearm dealer, is they say, look, there are a lot of guns and these guns should be safe and we're afraid he'll give them to a friend, and we're afraid maybe the gang boss will get them, and the only safe thing to do is really the firearms dealer. Okay."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2355.13,2355.53,No.
2014.13-1487,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2355.53,2358.03,As long as he gets them out of his possession.
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2358.03,2358.85,I think if he --
2014.13-1487,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2358.85,2375.92,"Are you going to say he has to give them to a firearms dealer? This is very complicated, more so than I ever thought, and it seems to me that it might best be worked out by lower courts under the principle that we don't want these guns back in the hands of either his control or people who might misuse them."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2375.92,2393.96,"I think if he is a person who pleaded guilty, and so he -- he had advance knowledge that he was about to become somebody who couldn't possess firearms, including constructive possession where he couldn't exercise dominion and control over them, then he should be required to -- to get rid of those firearms before he pleads guilty."
2014.13-1487,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2406.58,2415.58,"Can you tell me -- it's not this case, but suppose -- somewhat like Justice Alito's hypothetical -- a man's living at home with his wife."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2429.445,2440.53,"There is a whole body of case law on that, Justice Kennedy, where the -- the answer is can the convicted felon exercise dominion and control over the firearms in -- in their location."
2014.13-1487,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2449.8,2453.19,But the mere fact that his wife has them is not enough --
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2453.19,2453.62,Right.
2014.13-1487,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2453.62,2455.315,-- for constructive possession.
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2455.315,2455.76,Right.
2014.13-1487,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2455.76,2463.08,"But you say that in this context, the mere fact that a friend of his would have them is enough for constructive possession."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2463.08,2463.45,Yes.
2014.13-1487,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2463.81,2464.39,Why is that?
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2464.39,2468.155,Because he is the one that is selling the firearms to the friend.
2014.13-1487,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2476.26,2480.535,"Ms. O'Connell, I think it's implicit in what you're saying, but I just wanted to make it clear."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2489.75,2490.66,That's correct.
2014.13-1487,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2522.705,2529.76,"Would you agree that the Unclean Hands part, that should not remain the law of the circuit?"
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2529.76,2530.505,Right.
2014.13-1487,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2530.505,2534.64,So we should -- we should address that and reject it?
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2534.64,2535.515,Yes.
2014.13-1487,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2558.36,2560.83,But you have to file for forfeiture in those situations.
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2560.83,2570.36,"Well, what I'm saying is, if we miss those deadlines or something like that, we would reserve the right in a derivative contraband case to make an unclean hands argument --"
2014.13-1487,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2570.36,2601.255,"What about just forgetting the words ""dominion"" and ""constructive"" and just look to the word ""possession"" and say that that sometimes includes control? And what you want to prevent is that he disposes of these arms in a way that allows him, possibly, to control them in the future or control them now in a way that likely puts them in the hands of bad people for the future. Now, that way, all we have to do is look at the word possession."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2627.77,2633.75,"Justice Breyer, I think your -- your second part we would go a little bit further under the government's theory."
2014.13-1487,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2650.88,2654.235,"I know, that's the part that it's hard for me to accept."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2654.235,2654.92,Well --
2014.13-1487,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2654.92,2661.96,Because you're willing to allow that control in the case that Justice Alito put where he was convicted and it's in his house.
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2681.375,2684.59,If you are going to reject that kind of control --
2014.13-1487,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2684.59,2685.585,What bad will happen?
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2685.585,2708.65,"-- then we would just ask that the Court, you know, make clear in its opinion that a district court acting in equity is not required to accept the convicted felon's choice or direction about where he wants the firearms to go, and that, instead of having to broker that transaction between a convicted felon and his friends, that the Court say, you know --"
2014.13-1487,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2708.65,2711.05,"That might be another way to do it, you know."
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2715.19,2729.255,"And I don't think, you know, even if you don't think that it's bad to have firearms go to necessarily anybody or maybe there's a very good person that the convicted felon knows and wants to have it, the line is drawn when you become a convicted felon."
2014.13-1487,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2729.255,2733.01,Would the firearms dealer charge a commission for selling these guns?
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2733.01,2734.13,Yes.
2014.13-1487,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2734.13,2735.425,And who would pay that?
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2735.425,2739.12,It would -- it would come out of the -- the sale price.
2014.13-1487,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2739.12,2753.274,"So that if the -- if the convicted felon could sell this without going through a dealer for a certain amount, then that person would lose the commission by having it sold through a firearms dealer?"
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2753.274,2754.575,Yes.
2014.13-1487,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2770.905,2773.55,You can finish your sentence.
2014.13-1487,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,2773.55,2787.725,"There's Montana -- or State v. Fadness, one of the Montana Supreme Court cases, includes a fact scenario where the person wanted to designate their father to sell them and the court said, I'm not required -- the father has no plan to sell them, I'm going to give that, the felon said."

2014.13-1487,2,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,2791.61,2808.99,"Your Honor, just four very quick points: First, on the question of whether Mr. Henderson asked with sufficient particularity for relief, please remember that he was proceeding pro se. And second, the law is clear that post-conviction motions for return of transfer of property are treated as civil actions."
2014.13-1487,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2817.745,2825.67,"You started off -- you were going to give us five pages in -- in the record, and you only got to two of them, I think."
2014.13-1487,2,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,2825.99,2827.0,"Oh, right."
2014.13-1487,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2827.0,2834.985,Just in case I'm unfortunate enough to get assigned this opinion. (Laughter.)

2014.13-1487,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2933.39,2945.97,"Mr. Ortiz, you do understand -- I thought it was clear from what the government said earlier, that it's waived any claim -- that you waived the request for this relief."
2014.13-1487,2,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,2945.97,2946.64,No --
2014.13-1487,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2946.64,2948.905,So that's not at issue. You think there's still --
2014.13-1487,2,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,2948.905,2949.66,Your Honor --
2014.13-1487,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2949.66,2955.65,-- they're going to go back down and say that you're not entitled to the relief because you didn't ask for the right relief?
2014.13-1487,2,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,2955.65,2957.06,That's unclear.
