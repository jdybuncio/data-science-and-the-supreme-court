1996.95-1478,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.438,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-1478, Jay Printz, the sheriff of Ravalli County, Montana... is that the correct pronunciation of Ravalli?"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,10.438,11.259,"Ravalli, yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1478,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,11.259,15.702,"And United States v. Richard Mack, the sheriff of Graham County, Arizona."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,17.534,19.885,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,65.704,68.024,"May I ask a preliminary question, please?"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,68.024,69.907,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,69.907,73.59,You represent both Sheriff Printz and Sheriff Mack?
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,73.59,74.489,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,74.489,80.022,Sheriff Mack lost the election for sheriff of Graham County in the last election?
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,80.022,80.463,That's correct.
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,82.774,83.605,What date?
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,83.605,85.897,"--I believe it's January 1, Your Honor."
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,85.897,91.59,"Mm-hmm, and will the case likely become moot as to Sheriff Mack on that date?"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,91.59,102.399,"Well, I note that the successor in office has been identified to the Clerk, and I believe that this matter will be addressed further in the future, but I don't think it will be moot."
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,110.182,110.773,Mm-hmm.
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,110.773,121.32,"And Sheriff Mack may also be employed by a police department in the same county and, as such, would continue doing the same kinds of duties that are at issue here."
1996.95-1478,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,121.32,125.453,"Well, but he wouldn't be a CEO then, would he--"
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,129.086,131.59,A chief law enforcement officer.
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,131.868,138.413,"He would continue to be a chief law enforcement officer as defined by the statute here, and therefore he would be in a position of conducting the checks."
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,138.413,152.073,And would you mind telling us where in the record we can find the evidence about the extent of the burden on the sheriffs departments in enforcing this law?
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,152.073,152.611,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,152.611,155.894,Is there some reference to the record where we can find--
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,155.894,176.157,"In both cases there were affidavits, and then there was a hearing with testimony, and I would refer Your Honor in the Printz, the petition, the appendix to the Printz petition for cert, the affidavit... I'm sorry."
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,202.235,206.137,"--Maybe you can file that with the Clerk later, the references, please."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,206.137,206.687,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,206.687,212.171,Would you like to summarize for us what it showed in your view as to the extent of the burden?
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,212.171,213.673,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,213.673,223.26,"How many applications are filed in theses two counties, and how much time of the deputies is required to deal with it."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,223.26,223.418,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1478,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,257.922,260.894,"Well, it would be rather strange to have one-and-a-half on patrol, wouldn't it?"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,261.245,262.694,--That's just an average Your Honor.
1996.95-1478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,280.866,289.121,"Well, do you think that that's determinative here, how extensive the incursion upon the officer's duties are?"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,289.121,290.914,"No, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-1478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,290.914,295.716,"I mean, would the statute be constitutional as to those officers who didn't take a large proportion of their time--"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,295.716,296.797,Not at all.
1996.95-1478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,296.797,297.387,--and unconstitutional as to others?
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,297.387,298.057,Not at all.
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,325.676,335.083,"Well, has Congress imposed a burden on these chief law enforcement officers to report, or some State official to report on traffic fatalities, for example?"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,335.083,338.265,"Your Honor, that comes under the spending power."
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,349.162,351.161,In exchange for receiving the highway funds.
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,351.161,351.712,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,351.712,353.023,Is that... excuse me.
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,369.894,393.32,"As far as we could determine, the statutes we looked at that were prominently cited by the Government... the one that you mentioned, the fatalities reporting, and then the reporting the missing children relates to the National Crime Information Center, which is a voluntary system of record reporting between the Federal Government and the States... and we haven't found an instance where there was not some nexus with receipt of a grant or some other--"
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,393.32,396.011,Inducement to--
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,396.011,397.423,--Inducement that would be under the spending power.
1996.95-1478,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,397.423,397.992,"--Now, did--"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,407.349,437.318,"In our view that clearly comes under Article VI, the special duty of State judges to hear Federal causes of action and to do other things that Congress passes that relate to the Article VI provision and Congress, under Article I, section 8, is empowered to enact a uniform rule of naturalization, and we interpret those early naturalization statutes as being under that provision and then being applied through the State judiciary through Article VI."
1996.95-1478,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,437.318,444.832,"Well, you don't think that under the uniform rule of naturalization that Congress could compel State sheriffs to make background checks of aliens, do you?"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,444.832,450.168,"Absolutely not, because the sheriff is not a State judge, and Article VI refers explicitly to State judges."
1996.95-1478,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,450.168,458.042,"Yes, so... but I don't think a whole lot turns, then, on the power of Congress to pass uniform rules of naturalization."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,462.974,487.501,"And the State judges have to apply that through Article VI, so I think the clearest example of the early Congress that applies here was the same day that Congress passed the Tenth Amendment they passed a resolution that the States would be encouraged to enact legislation authorizing State local officials, rather, to keep Federal prisoners in their jails."
1996.95-1478,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,493.345,502.952,"Mr. Halbrook, the Government in its brief on page 31 has a footnote 21 citing several laws."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,513.297,515.618,I don't know whether all of them do.
1996.95-1478,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,532.421,551.082,"Well, my question is, are you saying that there's nothing like this, that in every case there's either something explicit in the Constitution, like the obligation of State courts that you get from Article VI, or extradition?"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,560.0,577.271,"Well, I think there may be some of these laws... for example, I believe there's one cited here about underground storage facilities, where the States are supposed to inventory and report underground storage facilities and frankly, Your Honor, I was not able to find a specific item in that statute that related to the spending power."
1996.95-1478,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,581.823,582.454,May--
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,582.454,592.589,"But in terms of precedents for this law that we have here, I think the law in New York v. United States was one that was on all fours with the laws here in terms of the--"
1996.95-1478,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,592.589,595.48,--May I ask not about precedent but just about your theory of the case?
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,614.745,617.807,"--Justice Stevens, we find no power in the Constitution just to do that."
1996.95-1478,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,617.807,626.813,"Well, the power... I suppose the argument would be the power is to regulate commerce, and they're trying to improve safety on the highways and all the rest of it by getting this data, but you'd say that the Commerce Clause doesn't authorize that."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,626.813,633.825,"It would authorize commerce to be regulated, but it would not authorize the immersion of the States--"
1996.95-1478,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,633.825,634.637,Requiring information to be provided by the States.
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,634.637,638.44,"--to do that kind of reporting, and I'd like to point out that this reporting--"
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,638.44,643.643,Couldn't Congress do it under this spending help they give the States for the road systems?
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,643.643,645.155,--That's the way they do that--
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,645.155,645.576,Yes.
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,645.576,646.013,--now.
1996.95-1478,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,647.646,654.83,"Mr. Halbrook, the obligation, as I understand it, on the part of the law enforcement officers is to use reasonable efforts."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,655.41,655.911,That's correct.
1996.95-1478,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,655.911,656.802,Do whatever's reasonable.
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,667.408,668.49,"No, Your Honor."
1996.95-1478,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,691.855,710.058,"Do you think it would be open to a court, to this Court to construe that reasonable effort criterion as one which turns on the law enforcement officer's own view of what in relation to all of his other responsibilities, and in relation to his resources, is reasonable?"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,712.549,719.712,"To some extent, perhaps, because the language is there, but I think that there's a vanishing point or an ending point."
1996.95-1478,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,730.2,733.302,"Well, unless he is the judge of reasonableness."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,741.697,744.729,"I don't think he is the sole judge, because--"
1996.95-1478,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,744.729,747.091,"No, but I'm asking you to assume my hypothesis."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,754.627,761.67,"--We would have no case if it was totally optional, and I think your hypothetical would be equivalent to changing shall to may."
1996.95-1478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,761.67,762.892,"Well, that isn't optional."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,782.103,782.544,Well--
1996.95-1478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,782.544,783.195,Wouldn't I?
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,783.195,786.097,"--As I... I agree with you, and as I understood the question--"
1996.95-1478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,786.097,791.811,"So therefore your answer should be, we would continue to have a case because it would, indeed, continue to compel the State officers to do something."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,791.811,797.033,"--As I understood the question, there will be no duty at all, and if there is any--"
1996.95-1478,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,797.033,797.924,"No, that wasn't the question."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,810.831,811.372,--Well--
1996.95-1478,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,811.372,812.784,"On that hypothesis, would you have--"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,812.784,813.883,"--I would still have one problem left, I think."
1996.95-1478,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,813.883,814.264,--Okay.
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,814.264,818.377,Which is the perception of the sheriff as not being a law-abiding sheriff.
1996.95-1478,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,837.88,855.331,"Well, he would have... and I think your point is well-taken, but would that... would that place him in the position that the opinion in the New York case, for example, described as being essentially an agent or employee, as it were, of the national Government to carry out a national Government policy?"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,868.941,878.985,"--Well, I think it would still come under the prohibition on requiring a State to administer a Federal regulatory program in the sense that there's got to be some kind of minimal requirement."
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,878.985,886.632,"Well, of course, in this situation are there not criminal penalties for someone who doesn't follow the requirements of the statute?"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,886.632,887.781,"Your Honor, the--"
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,887.781,901.382,"So it would be a jury that would be interpreting, presumably, whether the sheriff had reasonably performed the requirements under the statute and could result in a criminal punishment, as I read the statute."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,901.382,907.256,--The statute broadly says whoever violates 922(s) is subject to incarceration.
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,907.256,907.667,Right.
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,907.667,926.537,"And the... one district court held that that meant exactly what it said in the Mack case, that that was a threat of criminal prosecution when the law was first enacted and, in fact, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms spokesman on this law said that there were criminal penalties that applied to law enforcement officers."
1996.95-1478,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,942.929,944.139,And what is your position?
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,944.139,946.68,My position--
1996.95-1478,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,946.68,948.242,Do the criminal penalties apply to your client?
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,948.242,949.304,--It says whoever.
1996.95-1478,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,952.436,958.619,"Is that your position that it does apply, that you're taking the position before us that your clients are subject to the criminal penalties?"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,958.619,973.407,"What I have to say, because I represent real clients here, is that if the Government says they don't apply and... the criminal penalties don't apply and these are my clients, I'm going to agree with the Government, because I do not want my clients subject to a court ruling saying that criminal penalties apply to conduct."
1996.95-1478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,973.407,975.2,"And that's a reasonable enough position, isn't it?"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,986.186,986.737,Right.
1996.95-1478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,986.737,992.752,"--this law, and there are a lot of provisions in the statute that require the Secretary to conduct rulemaking, that require the Secretary to do this or that."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1002.408,1005.839,"Well, I think you have to look at each statute and what the criminal penalties say, but in this case--"
1996.95-1478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1005.839,1008.032,Is that a reasonable way to interpret this?
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1008.032,1009.461,"--Well, Your Honor it says--"
1996.95-1478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1009.461,1010.172,"That, you know, we're going to go after the sheriffs?"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1010.172,1014.755,"--It says dealers shall do certain things, and then it says CLEO's shall do certain things."
1996.95-1478,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1022.701,1032.537,"But I take it your position here, as you announced it a moment ago, is the Justice Department says those penalties don't apply to the sheriffs and that's your position here too, is that correct?"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1032.537,1060.766,"Well, I have to say, frankly we're in a dilemma, because we're faced with the language of the statute, which is clear enough, and when we went into this litigation we asked for preliminary injunctions protecting our clients from criminal prosecution, and then the Justice Department came up with a memorandum saying that we're not going to interpret the law in that way, so we certainly would like to preserve in essence these letters of immunity that our clients are not pros--"
1996.95-1478,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1060.766,1066.71,"But as I understand your brief, your... in your view the statute would be equally unconstitutional whether it has the criminal penalties or not."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1066.71,1067.331,"--Oh, absolutely."
1996.95-1478,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1067.331,1069.041,"So why are we fussing about this issue, I wonder."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1070.782,1073.726,"We think there's other... I mean, the Government has said--"
1996.95-1478,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1073.726,1074.885,Except you have to answer questions that are put.
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1076.437,1084.11,--The Government has clearly argued that they could bring the sheriffs into court on mandamus or injunction actions if they don't enforce these laws.
1996.95-1478,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1084.11,1105.635,"There's something of a paradox in this whole area, is there not, in that if you prevail it means that you 1) have a huge Federal bureaucracy, or 2) withdrawal of funds, perhaps funds well in excess of what... the funds that you would really expend in this area."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1113.27,1114.88,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1996.95-1478,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1122.226,1125.738,I'm assuming a complete revision of the act.
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1125.738,1137.696,"--Well, not even then, because by November of 1998 there is to be on line the permanent Brady act provisions under which the Federal Government will undertake these functions."
1996.95-1478,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1143.691,1143.941,Yes.
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1143.941,1146.552,"--background checks, and all of our Tenth Amendment problems go away with that."
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1146.552,1160.432,"Well, wouldn't they go away as well if the Government offered money to chief law enforcement officers to administer the program, and you would have an option whether to accept the money and administer it or not."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1160.432,1161.701,As long as the option was there--
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1161.701,1163.884,You wouldn't be here under those circumstances.
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1163.884,1164.914,"--We would not be here, absolutely not."
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1167.345,1174.161,"Now, do a lot of chief law enforcement officers around the country comply voluntarily with this act?"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1174.161,1176.892,"Well, I don't know how the word voluntarily would--"
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1176.892,1177.984,"Well, they are complying."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1177.984,1179.363,--They are complying.
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1179.363,1181.146,Like 40 States or more?
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1181.146,1185.077,"Actually, the Brady act, the provisions we're talking about only apply in about half the States."
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1185.077,1185.518,Mm-hmm.
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1185.518,1187.07,Maybe 24 States.
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1187.07,1189.221,"Some of them have enacted their own program, so--"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1189.221,1189.822,Some States--
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1189.822,1190.112,--that's sufficient?
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1190.112,1190.773,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1194.644,1196.417,And some are complying without protest.
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1196.417,1199.726,"--Well, I'm not sure what you mean."
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1206.601,1207.212,Yes.
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1207.212,1217.638,"And then, as far as compliance, I'm not sure how much compliance there is, even in the States where... even on the part of the law enforcement personnel who support this law."
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1232.479,1235.33,"It says States as well, does it not, records?"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1235.33,1239.313,--All available State and local records.
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1239.313,1239.644,Yes.
1996.95-1478,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1239.644,1240.475,May I ask you a question?
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1260.748,1261.459,"No, Your Honor."
1996.95-1478,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1261.459,1261.737,That would not.
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1261.737,1262.428,Not as--
1996.95-1478,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1262.428,1266.232,"That's just the question that I have, actually."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1274.319,1276.85,"--A statute that's based on highway funding, yes."
1996.95-1478,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1276.85,1287.616,"It's not... I just see they're setting up a task force, and they say in the task force... what it says here is every Federal, State, and local law enforcement shall report each case of a missing child under age 18."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1287.616,1288.857,To the NCIC.
1996.95-1478,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1288.857,1289.278,"Yes, right."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1289.578,1290.059,"Yes, right."
1996.95-1478,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1290.059,1294.643,"Not whether you take money, you don't take money, so I take it you're saying that's unconstitutional, too."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1294.643,1299.356,"Well, I interpret that as being based on NCIC."
1996.95-1478,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1299.356,1301.857,I don't see anything here that says you have to do it only if you take money.
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1301.857,1305.2,"Your Honor, when you look at the other provisions establishing the NCIC--"
1996.95-1478,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1305.2,1309.493,"Then if it says you only have to do it if you take money, then I'm not right."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1322.91,1323.701,--Correct.
1996.95-1478,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1323.701,1324.871,That's the issue.
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1368.771,1370.192,"In our Constitution, Your Honor--"
1996.95-1478,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1370.192,1371.093,Where does it say that?
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1371.093,1379.619,"--It says that the President shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed, and it provides for a Federal executive branch to execute the laws that Congress passes."
1996.95-1478,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1379.619,1389.415,"And why is that more respectful of State rights to set up, let's say, a Federal police service than to say the local police service has to report a few things?"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1389.415,1390.125,Well--
1996.95-1478,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1390.125,1396.177,"In other countries they think the opposite, and so what I'm looking for is history or language that says why it is here the opposite."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1396.177,1407.856,"--Because of the text of the Constitution and the intent of the Framers we've rejected the so-called New Jersey plan under which the Federal laws would be executed by State and local officials, and that's the plan that we have."
1996.95-1478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1408.837,1414.15,"Of course, when the Federal Government executes the laws the Federal Government also has to pay for their execution, right?"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1414.15,1415.151,They pay for it--
1996.95-1478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1415.151,1424.348,"So if you vote for a massive regulatory program you also have to vote for the taxes at the Federal level, which makes Federal representatives less popular back home."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1424.348,1425.297,--And it--
1996.95-1478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1425.297,1432.893,It's much easier if you allow the... impose an obligation on the States to do it and the State legislators can take the heat by raising the taxes.
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1432.893,1441.488,"--It's also clear in terms of political responsibility who's responsible for enacting the law and executing the law, and that's something that's broken down here."
1996.95-1478,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1450.074,1452.755,"Let me follow up on an earlier answer you gave, Mr. Halbrook."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1484.786,1490.339,"Well, in the Voting Act cases, we've got the Fifteenth Amendment and we've got several other amendments that relate to voting rights."
1996.95-1478,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1490.339,1497.294,"But here you have the Commerce Clause, which certainly gives general authority over things that move in commerce, and there's no challenge here on that ground."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1497.294,1499.746,"Well, these are not commercial records they would be looking at."
1996.95-1478,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1510.054,1513.203,"No, but you're saying it would be unconstitutional to require that challenge."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1514.585,1515.396,Yes Your Honor.
1996.95-1478,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1516.285,1517.116,"Well, take criminal--"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1517.116,1517.677,--authorization would be.
1996.95-1478,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1517.677,1522.202,"--Just take criminal records, for example, not necessarily tied to commerce."
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1537.651,1548.759,"Access from a police department, perhaps, but by the same token, there's no constitutional power that the States would have to require the Federal Government to share their records, but it's the kind of thing that comes under cooperative federalism where--"
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1548.759,1550.56,That's an extreme position.
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1577.528,1577.798,--Absolutely that is why we're here.
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1577.798,1579.27,"Yes, but you're changing your position--"
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1588.497,1589.238,Your Honor--
1996.95-1478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1589.238,1589.936,--would be allowed.
1996.95-1478,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1592.649,1594.341,--That's a hypothetical question.
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1705.223,1711.238,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1478,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1735.004,1738.356,"Well, can the State require the Federal Government to do something?"
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1738.356,1739.115,"No, and--"
1996.95-1478,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1739.115,1740.546,Why doesn't it work in reverse?
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1740.546,1743.498,"--Because of the Supremacy Clause, I think, Justice Kennedy."
1996.95-1478,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1744.279,1757.347,"Well, but there's a Federal design here, and the question is whether or not it is consistent with the political relation that subsists between the citizens to have one Government interfere with another."
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1757.347,1770.127,"--The Supremacy Clause resolved that issue, Justice Kennedy, where Congress is acting as it is here, fully within the core of one of its enumerated powers."
1996.95-1478,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1828.453,1844.716,"Well, suppose that the Congress had said that because we have an emergency here and we're not up and running, that for 5 years gun permits, gun transfer forms will be processed by the House of Representatives in their field offices, in their home offices."
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1862.338,1870.836,--Congress may not be saddled with a duty of executive branch Government.
1996.95-1478,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1870.836,1872.496,It saddles... it saddles--
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1872.496,1872.726,I agree with that.
1996.95-1478,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1872.726,1873.287,--All right.
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1873.287,1873.608,But--
1996.95-1478,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1873.608,1881.041,And that is because there are some very basic notions of accountability that underlie separation of powers.
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1893.419,1899.734,"--Well, I... it is not the case that Congress is ignoring the principles of federalism, Your Honor."
1996.95-1478,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1915.355,1918.478,"Well, my hypothetical was a rather strange hypothetical--"
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1918.478,1918.938,"--Well, I understand that."
1996.95-1478,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1918.938,1919.239,--I will admit.
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1919.239,1926.844,"Yes, I understand that, Justice Kennedy, and it's a fair one, but it is important to realize the extent to which this is a law that applies to--"
1996.95-1478,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1926.844,1952.25,"Well, let me ask you whether you think that under the constitutional framework we have, which preserves States as sovereign entities, the Congress can pass a law mandating that every State administer Congress' welfare plan without offering financial assistance and an option to the States to do that?"
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1990.585,2014.512,"--Justice O'Connor, Congress can impose upon State and local government officials the responsibility for assisting in the execution of a Federal program as long as, first, it does not implicate the serious concerns of State sovereignty and political accountability that are identified in New York--"
1996.95-1478,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2014.512,2023.447,"Well, don't you think it does when Congress says, we're passing this law and setting a national standard for health care, or welfare--"
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2023.447,2024.448,--I think--
1996.95-1478,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2024.448,2032.193,"--or highway safety, and passes it off to the States directly to administer those programs, not giving them an option, not funding it."
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2034.854,2035.124,--I understand that.
1996.95-1478,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2056.208,2059.942,And this is just a smaller version of that example--
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2059.942,2060.429,I--
1996.95-1478,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2060.429,2060.76,--is it not?
1996.95-1478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2060.76,2065.184,Let me put a hypothetical where it wouldn't put the states in the position of making any policy.
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2085.578,2086.746,--My answer is that that--
1996.95-1478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2086.746,2088.75,No policy judgments left to the States.
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2088.75,2094.893,"--My answer is that such a statute would not, as you define it, violate the principles of sovereignty and accountability set out--"
1996.95-1478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2094.893,2095.893,The answer is yes.
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2095.893,2096.985,"--Now... yes, exactly."
1996.95-1478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2097.657,2102.047,Because you think that it is... and this is what the Government's brief says.
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2128.275,2133.079,"--Because, for the reasons this Court sets forth in New York v. United States."
1996.95-1478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2133.079,2135.491,New York v. United States gave the States an option.
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2147.868,2149.348,What Congress--
1996.95-1478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2149.348,2151.0,That would have been purely executive action.
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2154.631,2168.642,"--What Congress has done here is, I think, Justice O'Connor, not a smaller version of that large program, because they have been careful to take responsibility for the policy choices and then for the administrative policy choices."
1996.95-1478,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2176.257,2183.221,"Well, I think Justice Scalia has addressed that point in exploring whether taking away the policy choices saves it."
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2183.221,2184.3,--Yes.
1996.95-1478,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2184.3,2198.552,"The notion that the Federal Government can just commandeer State and local government totally to administer some federally enacted program, all the details of which are spelled out, is the question."
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2198.552,2201.334,I think it is important to note what Congress cannot do.
1996.95-1478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2237.906,2243.119,Also you would say there was some difference between wartime and peacetime as to congressional authority.
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2243.119,2245.032,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-1478,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2325.796,2327.456,"They can do that with the environment, can't they?"
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2343.298,2344.069,"--Well, under the--"
1996.95-1478,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2344.069,2363.209,"So what's the principle of federalism that says they can do that but asking a police officer to report a missing child, or asking a police officer to report a safety statistic, or to look something up in a computer, suddenly is a violation of the Tenth Amendment, but imposing hundreds of billions of dollars of costs, as Congress does in many laws, is not?"
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2364.461,2368.014,--I don't believe there is any principle.
1996.95-1478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2368.014,2370.685,I don't believe there's any such unfunded mandate.
1996.95-1478,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2372.556,2373.618,I know... mandates in... I'm not saying here.
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2374.516,2374.807,Well--
1996.95-1478,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2374.807,2376.519,--that there is a thing called unfunded mandates--
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2376.519,2377.338,"--Yes, but--"
1996.95-1478,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2377.338,2378.6,--that the States complain about.
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2378.6,2386.414,"--Justice Breyer, those are often unfunded within the context of some other provision where the courts... where the States ostensibly have a choice."
1996.95-1478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2387.245,2390.889,"If you don't do it, we'll do it, and the States do it simply to avoid having the Federal--"
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2390.889,2391.24,--Well--
1996.95-1478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2391.24,2391.911,--But you don't have to do it.
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2392.528,2393.199,--That's correct.
1996.95-1478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2393.199,2393.97,--we'll send the Feds in.
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2393.97,2414.005,"Those are not constitutionally impermissible, but if Congress were to pass the Perfectly Clean Air Act of 1998 and say to the States, you've got to have 99-44/100 percent pure air by the year 2000, Congress gets all the credit, and the States are then forced to choose between adopting mandatory car-pooling, or exorbitant gasoline taxes."
1996.95-1478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2470.683,2473.853,"Only governmental duties cannot be imposed, is all he's saying."
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2476.704,2477.425,Well--
1996.95-1478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2478.597,2480.818,It can get information--
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2480.818,2481.259,As Justice Stevens--
1996.95-1478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2481.259,2489.804,"--It can get information from the... from a Government just as it can get information from an individual, but to require a Government to perform governmental functions is something else."
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2489.804,2514.031,"--Well, this... it would be, Justice Scalia, in the sense of New York v. United States, if those governmental functions were the kind of policy impositions that Congress was imposing with the Low Level Radioactive Waste Act at issue in New York, that forced the States to undertake the hard policy choices that Congress, in fact, made here."
1996.95-1478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2526.108,2529.181,No unpleasant policy choices are left for the local government.
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2552.356,2566.424,The only policy choice that I think you could honestly call a policy choice that Congress requires the chief local law enforcement officers to engage in here is one that creates the flexibility of the Brady act.
1996.95-1478,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2574.088,2575.821,"Well, why isn't that enough of a policy choice to create the problem?"
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2585.318,2588.43,--We do not... we do not take the position that it is voluntary.
1996.95-1478,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2588.43,2617.678,"--Right, so that the local law enforcement officer has got a real policy choice, number 1, in choosing between his Brady act responsibilities and whatever other local law enforcement abilities he's got, and number 2, I suppose even independently of that, he's at least got an initial policy choice to make about how intrusive an investigation is reasonable enough, and I would suppose that that latter decision could be politically a very explosive one in some communities."
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2622.531,2632.178,Because the kind of policy choice that he's making... if you... I have to agree that you can call anything a policy choice.
1996.95-1478,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2649.238,2673.565,"Well, that may be fine, but the people who are being investigated I don't think either know or much care that there may be a BATF memo, and the... to the extent there is flexibility it's the local officer's choice and, to the extent that he is even exercising guidance from BATF in his relationship to his constituents, he is still being placed, in effect, in the position of a policymaker."
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2673.565,2702.773,"--This is, I think, a difficult point in the case, but I think it is a policy choice so limited and so beneficial in its flexibility... that is, rather than saying you must check a certain number of records, what the Brady act says is, we're going to give you flexibility to make the kind of choice you have to make already, of how you allocate your resources."
1996.95-1478,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2708.427,2730.142,"Well, but it has to be done in 5 days, and so the local county has some massive prison escape, or riots going on, and the sheriff can't send his deputies out to deal with that because he's only got 5 days to apply, and doesn't the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms take a position in the memo that the criminal penalties do apply to these sheriffs?"
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2734.205,2753.016,"--Justice O'Connor, first of all, the... it is emphatically the case that where there's a prison breakout the sheriff has the discretion to do no, zero, Brady act checks where it's not... where... this is entrusted to his sound discretion."
1996.95-1478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2761.953,2767.007,--Doesn't the reasonableness include the amount of funding that the county gives the sheriff?
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2778.104,2782.396,--He is required to make some judgments.
1996.95-1478,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2799.488,2809.362,"Well, what about a situation in which the county says, as a footnote to the budget, not a penny of the sheriff's budget is going to be spent doing Brady act investigations."
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2809.362,2812.135,--That--
1996.95-1478,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2812.135,2815.277,It seems to me the point of political accountability at that point is directly on the sheriff.
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2815.277,2827.095,"--Justice Souter, when the State says you may not do any Brady act checks, or you may not spend a penny doing Brady act checks, that statute is preempted under the Supremacy Clause by the Brady act."
1996.95-1478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2851.671,2868.262,"What if the board of supervisors from one of these counties says, you know, you're doing a lot of stuff for us already, and go ahead and do the Brady act stuff, but put it at the bottom of the list, and then as... it turns out, in fact, that they put it at the bottom of the list and they never get to it."
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2868.262,2878.27,--If there are... this is a law that is entrusted to the sound discretion of the law enforcement officer.
1996.95-1478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2878.27,2880.801,"Well, and the way they exercise their discretion--"
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2880.801,2881.332,My--
1996.95-1478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2881.332,2884.564,--is they obey the board of supervisors and put the Brady act stuff last.
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2884.564,2894.728,--My answer would be that it would not be reasonable to make an a priori determination going forward that this was always the last matter to be done.
1996.95-1478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2917.035,2928.342,"Well, we don't ordinarily decide constitutional questions... I mean, are we going to say to someone who raises a First Amendment claim, gee, plenty of other people have obeyed this law, and here you are complaining about it?"
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2929.414,2930.453,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-1478,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2950.237,2964.757,"Well, but I suppose the answer to that is, as the Constitution recognizes, that each branch of the Government, State and Federal, has to make a certain cost-benefit choice, and if Congress wants to have some huge program, I suppose it can pay the political cost for it."
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2964.757,2982.198,"--In this case the... given the fact that you have, for example, 56 FBI field offices, one for every 30 counties, it would be extraordinarily inconvenient, as well as inefficient, and the relevant records are where local law enforcement is."
1996.95-1478,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3026.356,3029.639,So federalism is now being used to ensure uniformity.
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3032.43,3057.355,"--Federalism is being used here, Justice Kennedy, to mitigate in this case the effects of the enormous interstate mobility in handguns by ensuring that there is some effort made to see which illegal buyers are doing so before guns are sold."
1996.95-1478,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3058.807,3063.56,Would you agree with me that this is a very rare exercise of Federal power?
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3068.702,3069.273,--I think that observation--
1996.95-1478,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3069.273,3077.668,--And it's surprising how often the Federal Government tells the State... or how rarely it tells a State you must do something.
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3077.668,3079.16,"--Justice Kennedy, yes."
1996.95-1478,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3079.16,3081.521,As opposed to the fact that you shouldn't do something under the Supremacy--
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3081.521,3085.145,I agree with that observation and I think that in a sense it cuts both ways here.
1996.95-1478,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3100.704,3104.387,--So if it is necessary and proper in carrying out--
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3104.387,3105.028,Where it's necessary and proper.
1996.95-1478,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3105.028,3105.859,--If it is necessary and proper.
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3105.859,3106.678,If it is necessary and proper.
1996.95-1478,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3106.678,3107.649,If it is--
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3107.649,3108.5,Yes.
1996.95-1478,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3108.5,3119.929,"--necessary and proper on occasion to impose minor duties, but not take over whole programs and implementation of enormous kinds of welfare programs or whatever, what's the distinction?"
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3140.581,3141.132,Well--
1996.95-1478,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3141.132,3147.046,"How do you interpret the Necessary and Proper Clause to get there, in light of the Tenth Amendment interests, et cetera?"
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3147.046,3170.29,"--I take your question to be, where you have a law such as this that does not implicate the concerns of sovereignty and accountability, what happens if the number of those duties expands so greatly that it begins to inhibit the ability of the States to carry out their functions, unlike this law, which builds in the flexibility to carry out State functions."
1996.95-1478,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3180.158,3181.027,"But... well, my particular question is--"
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3181.027,3195.316,"--the standard will be, Justice Breyer... the standard will be whether you have so seriously interfered with the ability of the State to carry out its own functions, in light, perhaps, of whether it's the war power or some other very serious national emergency that is causing you to do it."
1996.95-1478,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3202.773,3204.372,"--General Dellinger, may I ask--"
1996.95-1478,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3204.372,3205.814,"--Mr. Dellinger, may I ask you one basic question?"
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3219.291,3225.486,"--It may, Justice Stevens, with respect to the Civil War amendments, which, I think as the Chief Justice has noted, were designed as a--"
1996.95-1478,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3225.486,3225.977,All right.
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3225.977,3226.888,--as a limit on it.
1996.95-1478,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3271.936,3279.302,"But what Congress has done here is say local police officers are available throughout the country also, and therefore we can regulate--"
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3279.302,3288.658,"--Justice Kennedy, I think it is significant that it's not merely their availability, but the fact that they were uniquely well-situated."
1996.95-1478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3338.56,3341.853,"--A Federal system is often inefficient, is all that you're saying."
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3342.772,3343.643,Sometimes--
1996.95-1478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3343.643,3346.695,That's why not many countries in the world have it.
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3346.695,3347.507,--Sometimes--
1996.95-1478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3347.507,3350.648,"It's a lot easier to do everything, you know, by command from--"

1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3358.894,3359.204,Yes.
1996.95-1478,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3359.204,3375.553,"--before you finish if you could just address the severability question, because you said something before about, if you... if it was voluntary it wouldn't work, because everybody would buy their guns in a place that doesn't participate."
1996.95-1478,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3375.553,3380.538,Thank you for allowing me to say that it doesn't work as well--
