1974.73-1424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.074,"We will hear arguments first this morning in 73-1424, Serfass against the United States."
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,14.861,17.667,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,31.657,36.146,"Very well, Mr. Dower."
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,36.146,54.908,"Please Your Honors, this matter appeared before the Court having granted a petition for writ of certiorari on the petition of David Serfass to review the record of the Third Circuit which had reversed a decision of the United States District Court for the middle district of Pennsylvania."
1974.73-1424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,330.572,335.551,Help me back up a little bit if I may Mr. Dower.
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,346.999,350.394,"Yes sir, I'm sorry, not a finding of guilt, he could have made determination."
1974.73-1424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,350.394,351.642,Determination.
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,351.642,353.851,He could have terminated the case which is what he did.
1974.73-1424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,353.851,357.171,"Well, now, but could he have made a determination that the man was guilty?"
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,357.171,357.962,No sir.
1974.73-1424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,357.962,361.444,And that there was no necessity of going on with the trial?
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,361.444,364.372,"No sir, he could not have made a finding of guilty."
1974.73-1424,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,631.843,648.085,"Well, is there difference in the language in the bills make much difference Mr. Dower, isn't it clear from the bill that was enacted that Congress meant to authorize appeals in all cases unless appeal would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause?"
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,648.085,651.527,I don't think so Sir.
1974.73-1424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,774.337,775.86,"They don't quite go that far, do they?"
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,775.86,777.165,"Repeatedly, in their brief, they do."
1974.73-1424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,777.165,781.21,"Well, Jeopardy would attach as soon as the jury was in panel too."
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,781.21,783.593,"Well, this would be included within from that trial."
1974.73-1424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,783.593,785.47,That's not a complete trial.
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,785.47,788.359,"No, sir, they quite --"
1974.73-1424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,788.359,798.717,When did jeopardy in the sense of exposure to a judgment of guilt begin under this motion?
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,798.717,804.908,I'm not so sure sir that that is the import of all the cases.
1974.73-1424,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,843.986,849.587,Except that you can't go to jail without it?
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,849.587,867.454,"Well, again Sir you are -- as I understand your question or comment, unless a man has been exposed to being held guilty, he is not been in jeopardy and this I submit Sir is not in the holding of this Court as recently as Sisson."
1974.73-1424,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,888.352,894.712,Like what?
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,894.712,906.13,All the cases sir reached so hard as did the majority in this Court to find that the determination made by court was an acquittal.
1974.73-1424,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1166.12,1184.299,"Well, Mr. Dower, I gather that your basic submission is that what happened here since the disposition of motion was made on the basis of the file and other evidence that as you say it represents what would have been the Government's entire case that the jury being convened in the case trial."
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,1184.299,1184.507,Yes sir.
1974.73-1424,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1184.507,1191.882,That this should be treated as a functional equivalent of an acquittal even though you concede that could not have been any judgment of guilt.
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,1191.882,1192.948,We argue that but -- (Voice Overlap)
1974.73-1424,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1192.948,1194.89,"Well, it's that right?"
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,1195.568,1197.613,"Yes, in our brief we are arguing in that fashion."
1974.73-1424,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1197.613,1198.62,But aren't you still arguing?
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,1198.62,1214.6,"No, I'm going to be on that Sir and I'm saying that let's not confine ourselves to labels of acquittal in order to find that jeopardy has existed because this is what has caused so much trouble at least to my analysis."
1974.73-1424,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1274.151,1276.179,Demurrer of the evidence.
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,1276.179,1276.774,I beg your pardon?
1974.73-1424,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1276.774,1280.811,A demurrer of the evidence that succeeded and had the effect on the acquittal?
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,1280.811,1282.093,"Yes, sir it would have."
1974.73-1424,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1282.093,1283.087,In the old practice?
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,1283.087,1297.872,"Right sir and also Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Marshall, a demurer to the evidence if sustained, would not run the risk -- well, a demurrer to the evidence with common law would not have run the risk of finding of guilty."
1974.73-1424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1300.452,1312.555,"The consequence of what you're arguing though is that in these circumstances, this motion in itself becomes the trial of the case."
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,1315.323,1318.613,"Insofar as the discharge of the defendant is concerned, yes."
1974.73-1424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1318.613,1322.637,If the defendant is successful it has the effect of being in trial of the case?
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,1322.637,1323.178,Yes sir.
1974.73-1424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1323.178,1338.364,"Now, is it not true that under the federal statutes in order to have the jury waived trial in the criminal case, you must have the consent of the prosecution, the defense and the court?"
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,1338.364,1340.098,Yes sir.
1974.73-1424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1340.098,1356.256,"Now, do you think that statute is any barrier here or the party is just slipped sideways into a trial on the merits without having consented to submit the issue on the merits to the court?"
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,1356.256,1365.785,"No sir, the whole import of Rule 12 (b) (1) is to take a look at these things at the very beginning of the proceeding."
1974.73-1424,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1388.825,1397.325,But you said the moment ago that your hypothesis is that double jeopardy was when the fact-finding process begins.
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,1402.061,1413.919,"No Sir, under Rule 12 (b) (1) if it's -- and 12 (b) (4), it's necessary to support the motions to dismiss, you can file an affidavit or the court can hold a hearing."
1974.73-1424,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1413.919,1426.417,"But on a motion like that can the judge who hears the motion find facts rather than simply decide whether as a matter of law, there's anything to support the Government’s case?"
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,1426.417,1433.061,"Yes sir, as occurred in this case, Judge Sheridan found the facts in the Selective Service file."
1974.73-1424,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1438.878,1441.515,But then it isn't just a question of law?
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,1441.515,1442.33,Oh no sir.
1974.73-1424,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1464.236,1467.126,I confess to some confusions Mr. Dower.
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,1479.714,1480.508,Yes sir.
1974.73-1424,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1480.508,1486.516,And that he appraised that for sufficiency to get to the jury?
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,1486.516,1487.147,Alright sir?
1974.73-1424,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1487.147,1489.468,And he concluded that it was insufficient?
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,1489.468,1490.01,Yes sir.
1974.73-1424,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1490.01,1491.867,"And therefore, he dismissed the indictment?"
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,1491.867,1492.996,Yes sir.
1974.73-1424,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1492.996,1495.959,And now you say there's some fact-finding involved to that?
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,1495.959,1501.417,In his consideration of the Selective Service file which is the entire Government’s case.
1974.73-1424,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1501.417,1509.367,Is that really a conclusion that those facts do not amount to a sufficient evidence to convict?
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,1512.918,1515.752,Would have to have the facts before him Sir before the district judge --
1974.73-1424,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1515.752,1521.09,"Well, if he has got the facts that -- what does he find that that is the file?"
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,1521.09,1523.736,"No Sir, these facts are not on the docket."
1974.73-1424,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1529.149,1538.271,I understood this order it said that I conclude that the motion to dismiss is legally correct.
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,1540.11,1552.048,"Yes sir, but this was in consideration of the entire Selective Service file which came into him by stipulation rather than impaneling a jury and then having stipulation or having the Government offered."
1974.73-1424,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1552.048,1554.721,And he made a finding of fact?
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,1554.721,1558.415,His decision is based on the facts which he found from the Selective Service file.
1974.73-1424,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1558.415,1561.472,And his finding was a conclusion.
1974.73-1424,0,26877,harry_a_dower,,1574.807,1596.849,"Yes Sir, but he had to find the facts first which were not a part of the judgment rule in the common law sense were not a part of the indictment and these were the things that were necessary for him to determine before he could reach his conclusion that this evidence that which the Government had would not be sufficient to convict."
1974.73-1424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1636.996,1644.026,"Well, Mr. Korman."
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,1644.026,1646.594,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1424,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1923.898,1931.85,"Well, that's not quite true when you come to the twice being put in jeopardy, is it?"
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,1945.537,1949.298,"That perhaps would depend, I would assume on how the trial ended."
1974.73-1424,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1949.298,1949.683,Well.
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,1949.683,1954.035,"For example, there was in this trial because the jury was unable --"
1974.73-1424,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1954.035,1967.054,"By hypothesis in my question he has been put in jeopardy once, he's gone through all through a trial, a fair due process trial, the jury has deliberated and they have returned of verdict of not guilty upon which judgment was entered."
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,1968.927,1970.452,"No, he could not."
1974.73-1424,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1970.452,1979.587,"So, being put in jeopardy doesn't really mean that at least when you're talking about the second being put in jeopardy, doesn’t really mean which is (Voice Overlap), does it?"
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,1979.587,1982.628,"Well, I would think -- perhaps I answered too quickly."
1974.73-1424,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1986.505,1987.652,He could be indicted again and --
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,1987.652,1988.8,"Yes, I would --"
1974.73-1424,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1988.8,1991.81,At the expense of having to hire a lawyer to defend the same?
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,1991.81,1996.005,"Well, I would think it shouldn’t be done and probably would be done but I think (Voice Overlap) --"
1974.73-1424,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1996.005,1997.992,Do you think that constitutionally it can be done?
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,1997.992,2010.709,I think it could but I don't think it's the burden and expense of going to trial against which he is protected and the bar of the --
1974.73-1424,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2010.709,2013.054,Could even be arraigned?
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2013.054,2018.102,"Well, I would assume that he would have an arraignment, a valid defense the indictment on which he could move to dismiss."
1974.73-1424,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2018.102,2029.012,"Well, doesn't the double jeopardy provision stand for the proposition that if a person is once been put in jeopardy and that’s the hypothesis of my question that he can't ever be charged again?"
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2032.603,2039.86,It's not that broad if he's been put in jeopardy and the trial was ended in a conviction or an acquittal.
1974.73-1424,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2051.737,2053.893,Then it would be perfectly constitutional to so?
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2053.893,2067.13,"Well, I don't -- it gets after a while, it would not be proper for him to be tried and therefore I assume from that that it would not be proper for him to be indicted and therefore you would have a valid defense to the indictment."
1974.73-1424,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2067.13,2068.649,That's quite clear.
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2079.678,2086.123,"I don't follow that part of Your Honor's question, all of the things that happened to the defendant in this case."
1974.73-1424,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2086.123,2099.307,"Now, after a person has once been put in jeopardy and that led to a clear-cut verdict of conviction or acquittal?"
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2099.307,2108.582,"No, what I meant to imply by the latter part of my talk that protection of the Double Jeopardy Clause is not absolute, is that a person can be tried on an indictment."
1974.73-1424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2130.638,2136.873,"What you really mean is that for the two jeopardy, is one is different from the other?"
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2136.873,2137.571,I don't --
1974.73-1424,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2137.571,2139.081,Yes.
1974.73-1424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2141.24,2144.806,The same word means two different things.
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2144.806,2161.261,"I don't know that it means two different things, I think it means the same thing, it means trial and in one instance where the jury has been unable to reach a verdict after a full and the Governments had a full and fair crack of the appellee, I am confused with the words Your Honor quoted in (Inaudible) case."
1974.73-1424,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2182.139,2212.197,"I take it that what you're saying if it were transposed into a civil context instead of criminal is that if a suit were had on a civil case and it results favorable to one of the parties, there is nothing to prevent the losing party from bringing a suit again on the same issues that he has to assert the defense of res judicata in order to stop it."
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2212.197,2212.759,That's correct.
1974.73-1424,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2212.759,2215.874,And the same thing as through an indictment.
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2236.388,2239.435,That's correct.
1974.73-1424,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2239.435,2256.154,"Now, you're not suggesting that or are you suggesting that the constitutionality of the second indictment can't be determined in any other way and by a judicial proceeding in which Double Jeopardy is asserted and decided?"
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2256.154,2264.832,"Well, I would think that if the event happened that is the second indictment were brought the defense would be to dismiss that indictment on the grounds of Double Jeopardy."
1974.73-1424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2733.367,2741.688,"Mr. Korman, as Mr. Dower corrected there's no dispute, that that’s all the evidence would have been produced at the trial?"
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2741.688,2745.011,That's correct in all Selective Service cases as Your Honor may be aware of --
1974.73-1424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2745.011,2746.418,Which means this case?
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2746.418,2747.67,Yes.
1974.73-1424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2748.11,2751.594,"So, what good is a trial in this case?"
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2751.594,2760.861,"Well, I would think for example from the -- and may not be any good, as long as the judge adheres to his position, and would dismiss that there were a trial --"
1974.73-1424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2760.861,2763.064,"Well, is he wrong in his position?"
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2763.064,2769.045,He was found to be wrong by the Court of Appeals and that determination is not even challenged here.
1974.73-1424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2784.159,2802.287,And if the -- Mr. Serfass or what his name is – he decided that he would go to trial and he would put on the evidence everything that he is in good shape as long as he is before that judge.
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2802.287,2803.795,That's correct.
1974.73-1424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2804.202,2806.292,"So, why didn't that end the case?"
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2806.292,2808.902,"Well, it's the end of --"
1974.73-1424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2808.902,2810.75,"He would have been acquitted, wouldn't he?"
1974.73-1424,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2810.75,2815.043,"Well, I assume that the judge would have done the same thing and that's what's problem in Mr. Price' case."
1974.73-1424,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3049.334,3051.236,Thank you Mr. Korman.
1974.73-1424,2,26877,harry_a_dower,,3053.496,3056.717,I will be brief Sir.
1974.73-1424,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3094.921,3116.585,"Well, is there any power you know of even in a true Double Jeopardy case as to which no one would disagree that is a verdict of acquittal if an irresponsible jury as I suggested before a grand jury re-indicted."
1974.73-1424,2,26877,harry_a_dower,,3121.737,3122.291,Yes sir --
1974.73-1424,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3122.291,3132.287,Is there any other way to deal with that indictment except to go in and assert the claim of Double Jeopardy and have it?
1974.73-1424,2,26877,harry_a_dower,,3132.287,3137.76,"First time it would occur sir, I know of no other way than to go and to move to dismiss the indictment."
1974.73-1424,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3147.982,3167.77,"Suit against the prosecutor or any other suit -- he might have a suit whether it’s a good one or not, he might conceivably have a suit against members of the grand jury and again you would have a question of whether it was any good but there’s nothing automatic that stops a second indictment, does that?"
1974.73-1424,2,26877,harry_a_dower,,3167.77,3169.73,"No sir, except the integrity of prosecutor's office."
1974.73-1424,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3169.73,3172.273,The integrity of the people on (Voice Overlaps)?
1974.73-1424,2,26877,harry_a_dower,,3172.273,3174.344,"Yes sir, I must concede that."
1974.73-1424,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3174.915,3179.074,Or for their Intelligence if they were ill informed?
1974.73-1424,2,26877,harry_a_dower,,3179.074,3182.51,I would rather relay on their integrity Sir.
1974.73-1424,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3182.51,3187.474,But they might simply make a mistake.
1974.73-1424,2,26877,harry_a_dower,,3187.474,3196.845,"Alright, it's inconceivable that a person could get to that position being so ill informed but sure within the ambit of what is conceivable --."
1974.73-1424,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3196.845,3208.375,That is the grand jury might not be informed by the prosecutor that the man had been previously tried and acquitted and then you’d have perhaps various kinds of proceedings against the prosecutor?
1974.73-1424,2,26877,harry_a_dower,,3208.375,3210.376,I should hope so.
1974.73-1424,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3290.312,3291.316,Thank you Mr. Dower.
