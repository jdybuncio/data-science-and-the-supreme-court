2012.11-1274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.022,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-1274, Gabelli and Alpert v. the Securities and Exchange Commission."
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,9.939,14.574,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,89.824,90.324,Mr. Liman.
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,121.778,125.747,"--Your Honor, I think there are two answers to that."
2012.11-1274,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,169.29,170.456,Excuse me.
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,190.953,199.059,"--For -- for crimes, the general word that is used is time period from the violation."
2012.11-1274,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,199.059,199.425,Right.
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,209.681,217.854,"Your Honor, it indicates that Congress is using accrual as it is understood at common law."
2012.11-1274,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,270.721,277.742,"Mr. Liman, I understand your argument, but I have a fundamental difficulty, okay?"
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,334.681,354.059,"--Justice Sotomayor, let me give you the precise answer to that, which is that in this case where the government is seeking a penalty, it is not acting on behalf of underlying investors, and the recovery is not one that is brought by way of damages or disgorgement."
2012.11-1274,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,354.059,359.629,It's acting as a sovereign to protect what it thinks is an ordered society.
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,364.617,370.021,"Your Honor, I think that is the articulation that the government would have to make."
2012.11-1274,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,453.758,477.29,"Mr. Liman, what you suggested, when we talked about the discovery rule, is that it has a basis in the notion that a defendant with unclean hands who has committed deceptive conduct preventing the plaintiff from understanding that he or it has a cause of action, you know, shouldn't be entitled to the benefit of a statute of limitations."
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,493.716,497.335,"Justice Kagan, I've got two answers to that question as well."
2012.11-1274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,583.56,586.443,How did the government take it out?
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,602.704,605.889,"--That's not correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.11-1274,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,658.024,666.194,"--Mr. Liman, finishing up a point you were just on previously, what's your position with respect to fraudulent concealment?"
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,673.367,679.203,"Your Honor, I think you could and should conclude that if you reach that issue."
2012.11-1274,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,681.805,682.789,But tell me about--
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,682.789,685.424,Our theory doesn't require you to come to that conclusion.
2012.11-1274,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,685.424,687.307,--This is -- it's nice for you to say that.
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,703.053,723.049,"Your Honor, in the -- using the same type of theory and the same methodology that the Court employed in the RICO context in the Claire case and in the Rotella case, one can read the statute, I think you have to read the statute, here to say that “ accrue ” means accrue."
2012.11-1274,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,750.867,767.059,"Mr. Liman, you acknowledge that a civil action could be brought beginning from the time when the injured plaintiff discovers the fraud, right?"
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,767.059,768.678,That's--
2012.11-1274,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,768.678,775.899,So you're really not arguing for what you might call a total statute of repose.
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,799.348,804.684,"--Your Honor, respectfully, we think that's not odd at all."
2012.11-1274,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,833.021,833.388,Sure.
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,839.842,841.043,"--That's -- that's not correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-1274,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,841.043,841.576,No?
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,841.576,847.947,Under Title 28 1658(b) the 5 years runs from the time of the violation.
2012.11-1274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,857.053,860.521,"Mr. Liman, how does it work with a disgorgement remedy?"
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,869.444,886.072,"We are not challenging the disgorgement in front of this Court, and if this Court reverses the Second Circuit that issue will remain in the case and the SEC's claim for disgorgement will remain, and that's really been the way--"
2012.11-1274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,886.072,889.874,But you don't apply -- you don't say it's too late for them to sue for disgorgement?
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,889.874,899.313,"--2462 applies exclusively with respect to penalties, fines and forfeitures."
2012.11-1274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,902.332,905.234,So is there any statute of limitations on disgorgement?
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,905.234,906.919,There is none.
2012.11-1274,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,906.919,908.436,Does it apply to Social Security?
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,910.354,916.175,There is a Social Security statute that--
2012.11-1274,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,916.175,918.477,Does this statute apply to Social Security?
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,918.477,918.794,--Yes.
2012.11-1274,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,918.794,920.377,Does it apply to Veterans Affairs?
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,921.762,922.962,I don't know about Veterans Affairs.
2012.11-1274,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,922.962,924.447,What about Social Security?
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,924.447,927.399,"Social Security, there is an underlying statute--"
2012.11-1274,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,927.399,928.882,I'm asking about this statute.
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,929.601,930.801,--The answer is yes.
2012.11-1274,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,943.909,944.309,Defense Department?
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,944.309,947.496,It does apply to a number of Defense Department statutes.
2012.11-1274,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,948.729,950.146,Antitrust?
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,950.146,952.931,--I'm not sure on antitrust.
2012.11-1274,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,963.505,963.973,"FTC, you don't know?"
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,963.973,964.473,"FTC, yes."
2012.11-1274,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,964.473,968.476,"It does apply to FTC, okay."
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,974.713,999.412,"One of the notable features, Justice Breyer, is that if you look across the U.S. Code, the government makes a point of saying: Well, Congress uses penalty -- acknowledges that Congress has used penalty when -- the word “ penalty ” when the Congress has -- I'm sorry, it has used the word “ discovery ” when Congress has wanted the statute to--"
2012.11-1274,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,999.412,1003.565,"Mr. Liman, I'm a little confused in your answer to Justice Scalia."
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,1027.931,1029.015,"--No, Your Honor."
2012.11-1274,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1029.015,1034.002,So are you just arguing that under this statutory scheme there is no application of the discovery?
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,1034.002,1045.992,This -- this Court has held in the Lampf case that Bailey and Holmberg do not apply to securities fraud case.
2012.11-1274,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1045.992,1048.178,Because of the alternative language of 5 years.
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,1048.178,1052.88,"Well, in Lampf it was 1-year and 3-year."
2012.11-1274,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1052.88,1053.496,Right.
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,1053.496,1058.95,"And in the Merck case, the Court made clear that the 5 years was the statute of -- the statute of repose."
2012.11-1274,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1058.95,1060.716,That's what I thought those involved.
2012.11-1274,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1060.716,1061.466,"Medicare, Medicaid?"
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,1061.466,1063.485,Yes.
2012.11-1274,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1063.485,1078.178,"It is true, though, isn't it, that Justice Scalia pointed to an anomaly that could easily exist in other contexts, because this isn't only a statute about securities violations."
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,1092.837,1093.254,Yes.
2012.11-1274,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1093.254,1094.706,"--the 5 years, but the government could not."
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,1094.706,1095.739,"Yes, Justice Kagan."
2012.11-1274,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1134.931,1142.87,"And I take it that your view would be that a case like Exploration, it's different than this case because it does have a natural start date; is that the idea?"
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,1142.87,1144.889,"Number one, it does."
2012.11-1274,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1243.385,1268.62,"In a civil -- in a civil action brought by an injured investor or private party, can that plaintiff, the injured investor, the private party, in the ordinary course plead and rely upon an earlier government determination that there had been a violation and so that that's presumptive showing of liability?"
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,1268.62,1270.687,Your Honor--
2012.11-1274,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1270.687,1279.424,"In other words, the SEC makes an investigation, find a violation; can a private investor then rely on that as a presumptive showing of liability?"
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,1279.424,1280.809,--Yeah.
2012.11-1274,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1288.398,1289.164,"No, not the allegation."
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,1290.681,1292.266,Absolutely.
2012.11-1274,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1292.266,1294.385,But then under your rule.
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,1296.252,1298.004,"No, that's not correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-1274,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1312.764,1330.641,"But if the government's statute of limitations runs out and the private investor is on his own, then the private investor doesn't have the advantage that exists in other cases of reliance on an SEC finding as a presumptive showing of liability."
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,1330.641,1338.479,"--Your Honor, that -- that -- our argument only applies with respect to penalty."
2012.11-1274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1450.302,1463.478,"Are there no statutes, Mr. Liman, that say the claim accrues when the injury is discovered, that use both, both terms?"
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,1463.478,1464.912,"I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.11-1274,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1466.364,1474.953,"Are there no statutes that use both terms, “ accrues ” and “ discovery ”?"
2012.11-1274,0,46755,lewis_j_liman,,1483.809,1513.578,"There are statutes that use that kind of language, and that's precisely our point, because it reflects that Congress recognizes the difference and could, if Congress wanted, provide that a claim for the violation of the IAA or for any other statute accrues when it is discovered."
2012.11-1274,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1519.082,1519.899,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1524.903,1528.17,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2012.11-1274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1563.058,1568.462,I don't think the common law held that it didn't accrue.
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1586.007,1590.577,"Justice Scalia, I don't want to fight about it too much because from the government's perspective, it doesn't matter--"
2012.11-1274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1590.577,1592.344,"Well, you are making the argument, so you ought to fight about it."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1592.344,1593.363,--It doesn't matter how it's labeled.
2012.11-1274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1607.004,1609.122,"And never in a criminal case, right?"
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1619.561,1620.813,"--No, not in--"
2012.11-1274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1620.813,1621.78,Not a single one.
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1621.78,1622.632,"--Well, no."
2012.11-1274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1630.369,1649.014,"Now, that's the question, because I certainly agree with Justice Scalia that this is not an SEC statute, this is not a securities statute; it is a statute that applies to all government actions, which is a huge category across the board and it's about 200 years old."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1751.712,1762.87,"--Justice Breyer, most or many of the penalty claims that are being brought under Section 2462 and other penalty statutes don't deal with fraud or concealment, and I grant you that it is--"
2012.11-1274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1762.87,1765.556,All I'm asking you for is one case.
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1765.556,1770.293,"--So in -- it's a problem of fairly recent vintage, to be sure--"
2012.11-1274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1770.293,1772.827,"No, it is not a problem of fairly recent vintage."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1813.47,1816.838,--And I guess what I want to tell you is there aren't cases out there one way or the other.
2012.11-1274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1823.677,1828.748,You'd expect that -- you'd expect there to be some cases in a couple of hundred years.
2012.11-1274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1828.748,1829.881,"No, I haven't found one."
2012.11-1274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1829.881,1833.133,"Fraud is nothing new, for Pete's sake."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1833.133,1834.183,"--Justice Scalia, it's not that--"
2012.11-1274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1834.183,1846.46,This is brand-new assertion by the government that -- tell -- is there much difference between the rule you are arguing for and a rule that there is no statute of limitations?
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1846.46,1847.693,--Absolutely there is.
2012.11-1274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1869.123,1875.71,"Well, but that ignores the point that has been raised, is that this statute does not just apply in the SEC context."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1883.649,1889.537,"There are cases from the 1980s and 1990s dealing with concealment, and in our view the justification is the same for concealment as fraud."
2012.11-1274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1889.537,1895.94,"I mean, we are asking the same question, but in 30 seconds I am going to conclude there is none."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1932.899,1943.521,"Justice Breyer, I don't think there is anything on either side of the ledger, I will be very upfront, other than the Maillard case, which I think even courts at the time, an exploration company, the court of appeals recognized--"
2012.11-1274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1943.521,1946.723,It's not a matter of there being nothing on either side of the ledger.
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1964.335,1973.976,"--Justice Scalia, there were very few civil penalty actions in which -- that involved fraud or concealment, in which the government would have needed to invoke it, or did invoke it and was rebuffed by courts."
2012.11-1274,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1983.581,1999.608,"This a very modern problem, but how about the statute of Elizabeth, which talked about penalties as being a criminal sanction but permitted private individuals, not the government, to seek the penalties and keep it."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2008.899,2012.101,"--Well, if this were a criminal penalty, the government agrees--"
2012.11-1274,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2012.101,2015.386,Even though private parties could keep the money back then.
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2015.386,2016.086,--That's right.
2012.11-1274,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2027.627,2028.777,Could I move you to another issue?
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2053.845,2058.13,"--Justice Sotomayor, discovery is playing itself out in cases like these in district courts."
2012.11-1274,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2070.02,2078.643,"Well, if they fail there, don't you think that they are going to also fail because they are not going to be able to look at your records to figure out exactly what you knew or didn't know?"
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2078.643,2079.326,"--No, not invariably."
2012.11-1274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2087.38,2098.021,"So it depends really on how many enforcement officers the SEC has, is it reasonable for them to have been aware of the particular item in some publication."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2148.87,2152.607,"--Mr. Chief Justice, they can't point to a single case where it has been difficult here, and it hasn't been difficult--"
2012.11-1274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2152.607,2153.841,--They can't point to a single case?
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2153.841,2156.743,--Where it's been difficult in order to make that determination.
2012.11-1274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2158.428,2161.38,So you think it's significant if you can't point to a single case?
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2161.38,2167.534,"--Well, I think there are -- where you should expect those cases to exist, yes."
2012.11-1274,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2167.534,2177.557,"Are there cases discussing whether or not a government agency has been diligent in pursuing a fraud, a fraud investigation?"
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2199.136,2200.938,"Justice Kennedy, not just this statute."
2012.11-1274,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2213.846,2215.532,What about the question that Justice Kennedy just asked?
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2227.489,2230.024,"I don't think so, Justice Alito."
2012.11-1274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2243.599,2250.438,The False Claims Act example you give is indeed a private plaintiff kind of a case.
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2250.438,2251.288,That's--
2012.11-1274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2251.288,2254.64,"Yes, you can say the government, having been cheated, should have known it was cheated."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2275.72,2276.253,--No.
2012.11-1274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2288.313,2288.88,But my question is broader than that.
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2292.515,2295.467,I don't think it applies in the context of a civil penalty.
2012.11-1274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2296.784,2297.669,Are you sure of that?
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2300.121,2304.739,"--I can't say that I focused on it specifically, but I think if the Petitioner said--"
2012.11-1274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2304.739,2306.274,"Well, it's an important issue in this case surely."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2314.797,2323.367,"--Justice Scalia, I don't -- Petitioner certainly couldn't claim that this civil penalty should have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, or that they are entitled to a constitutional right to counsel."
2012.11-1274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2328.938,2345.149,"The reason would be that the -- you know, once you start talking about applying this to Social Security, for example, or to Medicare, for example, or to DOD, for example, you have somebody who did commit some fraud and they kept the money."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2407.973,2408.79,Absolutely.
2012.11-1274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2423.417,2423.883,That's right.
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2423.883,2429.22,This Court has never privileged a private lawsuit above a Government enforcement action in a securities context--
2012.11-1274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2429.22,2431.172,This is not the securities context.
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2437.159,2445.848,"--But even in that context, imagine if there's a private right of action, the private plaintiff will be able to recover damages and the Government will not--"
2012.11-1274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2445.848,2449.983,"Yes, because you have two people who are hurt, where two people have been hurt."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2496.714,2499.733,"--Just imagine the opposite, which is far more dangerous."
2012.11-1274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2518.11,2521.562,"--That's correct, you have a fraud and you can't put them in jail either, but you can get your money back."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2521.562,2528.216,But the reason there's no private right of action in those contexts is in part because government agencies can seek civil penalties.
2012.11-1274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2541.189,2549.729,"And the reason -- the reason there's no private action -- right of action is not because the Government could seek civil penalties, it's because Congress hasn't provided a private right of action."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2549.729,2554.449,"That's right, because it thought that the agencies could seek civil penalties and that was sufficient."
2012.11-1274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2554.449,2555.133,"Oh, no, you can't--"
2012.11-1274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2555.133,2566.674,"But it didn't -- it didn't necessarily think, and that's why we have a case, that they could seek civil penalties 10 years later, 18 years later, however long, so long as they were busy doing other things and didn't have a chance to know."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2566.674,2567.024,No question.
2012.11-1274,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2572.495,2573.911,And it is a generous period.
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2608.084,2614.672,"--Justice Ginsburg, there was a lot of back and forth between the parties, document exchanges, they wanted to make additional submissions."
2012.11-1274,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2626.545,2628.914,"But, Mr. Wall, I'll go even further than Justice Ginsburg."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2666.872,2668.658,"Justice Kagan, I don't think that's fair."
2012.11-1274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2717.139,2729.363,"--Well, if all that's true, and this is a point I want you to -- I'm not sure I am right about this point, but remember your banking case now, we're sounding like that, I thought -- doesn't the doctrine of fraudulent concealment still apply?"
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2738.553,2740.088,"That's right, but that--"
2012.11-1274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2740.088,2740.738,All right.
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2748.943,2749.776,"--But Justice Breyer, that's--"
2012.11-1274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2749.776,2750.376,--or once a year.
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2763.203,2764.786,"--Justice Breyer, I want to be clear."
2012.11-1274,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2777.528,2779.396,"Well, perhaps I've missed something."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2788.318,2789.018,I -- I--
2012.11-1274,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2789.018,2795.591,"I mean, for purposes of presenting the statute of limitations issue that's before us."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2795.591,2804.447,"--I don't think the petitioners are disputing it here, but I think Mr. Liman acknowledged earlier that if pressed, his arguments could be leveraged to get rid of the concealment doctrine, too."
2012.11-1274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2804.447,2806.397,He didn't concede that there was fraudulent concealment.
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2814.053,2816.186,"Oh, no, no, not -- I didn't -- I'm sorry, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-1274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2818.755,2819.707,I thought it was the opposite.
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2828.478,2830.778,"This is a fraud case, not a concealment case."
2012.11-1274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2830.778,2831.764,Am I right when I say that?
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2831.764,2832.114,Yes.
2012.11-1274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2854.796,2858.915,"Except that concealment is sort -- you know, it's sort of a self-starter."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2886.315,2905.478,"--Justice Scalia, for 300 years, English and American courts looking at this problem have said where the defendant's misconduct, be it fraud or be it concealment of a non-fraud, but where the defendant's deception prevents a plaintiff from knowing that he, she or it has a cause of action, equity suspends the running of a statute of limitations."
2012.11-1274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2907.078,2917.72,"And for 300 years, that has been said only with respect to civil actions, not with respect to the government's attempt to exact a penalty."
2012.11-1274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2917.72,2918.67,That's correct.
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2918.67,2920.822,"--Justice Scalia, this is a civil action."
2012.11-1274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2922.69,2928.511,"I assume that we are on the same ground, but I don't know that you have -- I mean, I'm worried about your giving up the fraudulent concealment."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2931.061,2934.582,If I gave up anything on fraudulent concealment--
2012.11-1274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2934.582,2934.965,"No, no, no."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2936.482,2937.284,--I want to be very clear.
2012.11-1274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2937.284,2963.065,"If we were to say -- if we -- if the Court were to hold, it seemed to me, and this is again tentative to get your response, but if the -- if the Court were to hold the discovery doesn't -- rule doesn't apply, there's nothing in that that says equitable -- equitable tolling doesn't apply, nothing in that that says equitable estoppel doesn't apply, nothing in that that says fraudulent concealment doesn't apply."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2967.569,2968.919,"Well, all the same arguments are going to apply."
2012.11-1274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2969.553,2970.921,"Oh, not the equitable estoppel."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2970.921,2971.255,"--Oh, sure."
2012.11-1274,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2971.255,2978.009,"Equitable estoppel, the person comes in and says: Oh, yes, I'll tell you all about what I did, but by the way, I won't assert a statute of limitations defense, I promise."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2983.329,2989.149,"Justice Breyer, petitioners in a future case would be back here saying: The text of the statute says nothing about equitable estoppel."
2012.11-1274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2994.12,2997.572,"And you will say nonsense in that future case, won't you?"
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2998.172,2999.94,--That's -- I'll be as right then as I am now.
2012.11-1274,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3023.49,3026.174,"Mr. Wall, why is it that you don't you have any cases?"
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3042.434,3043.969,There are -- that's right.
2012.11-1274,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3077.524,3088.082,"But what you're running up against is a skepticism, that, you know, the government, which has not asserted this power for 200 years, is now coming in and saying we want this."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3091.467,3094.236,--There are just very few cases on it.
2012.11-1274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3154.107,3162.213,"Counsel, you made the point earlier that it would be very odd that it's only the sovereign that doesn't benefit from the discovery rule when other people can."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3191.565,3200.838,"No question in the typical case, but what equity has always said is in cases of fraud or concealment the defendant is not entitled to repose until there is discovery of the fraud."
2012.11-1274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3210.127,3217.281,Would you agree that when we're talking about the interests in repose that the one plaintiff that we should be particularly concerned about is the government?
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3217.281,3225.704,--I don't think that there's a basis for separating as between private damages lawsuits and civil penalties.
2012.11-1274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3231.29,3232.207,What about criminal penalties?
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3234.992,3235.678,--Justice Scalia--
2012.11-1274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3235.678,3237.844,"Incidentally, what makes something a civil penalty?"
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3245.617,3247.486,"--Justice Scalia, two very important things."
2012.11-1274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3264.762,3267.731,What makes a penalty a civil penalty?
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3267.731,3268.9,In Hudson v. United States--
2012.11-1274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3268.9,3272.601,"I mean, a penalty is a penalty as far as I'm concerned if the Government's taking money from me."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3272.601,3279.421,"--Justice Scalia, the Court walked through in Hudson v. United States the test for denominating a civil from a criminal penalty."
2012.11-1274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3283.64,3284.825,That's nice.
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3284.825,3287.092,"Here, there is no question that this is a civil penalty."
2012.11-1274,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3299.335,3302.954,"That isn't my point, that it is criminal."
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3308.775,3323.617,"Justice Scalia, the Court has always said that whether the penalty is civil or criminal carries with it a different set of legal rules or norms, and no party has ever successfully come into court and said, well, it may be civil, but it's a little criminal-like, so I should borrow from the criminal context."
2012.11-1274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3323.617,3324.8,What about the Halper case?
2012.11-1274,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3324.8,3335.592,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think Hudson overruled Halper in large part, and no one here has asked this Court to label this a criminal penalty."
2012.11-1274,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3342.846,3344.131,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1274,2,46755,lewis_j_liman,,3346.816,3350.102,Just a few points in rebuttal.
2012.11-1274,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3365.377,3365.944,I'm sorry.
2012.11-1274,2,46755,lewis_j_liman,,3366.461,3368.729,--I believe it's Commissioner against Ackerly.
