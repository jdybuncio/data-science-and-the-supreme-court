1999.98-1828,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.912,"We'll hear argument next in No. 98-1828, Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. the United States, ex rel., Jonathan Stevens."
1999.98-1828,0,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,20.723,26.436,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1828,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,39.711,42.129,We asked you to brief the additional issue.
1999.98-1828,0,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,45.132,45.608,Thank you.
1999.98-1828,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,120.482,132.209,"But I guess we've had some form of qui tam suits authorized by Congress since the earliest days, haven't we?"
1999.98-1828,0,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,132.209,136.919,"--We have, Your Honor, and I think, Justice O'Connor, the--"
1999.98-1828,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,136.919,145.662,"And perhaps authorizing them in... in circumstances where the relator would not have an injury in fact, as we know it."
1999.98-1828,0,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,145.662,151.744,"--Some circumstances, and I think that the key part of your question, Your Honor, was in some form."
1999.98-1828,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,158.908,159.917,The early statutes?
1999.98-1828,0,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,159.917,168.552,"--The early statutes in the first Congress, and if I've got my sort of head count correct, I... we've counted about 17 statutes."
1999.98-1828,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,177.452,181.312,Because the relator would have suffered an injury in fact?
1999.98-1828,0,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,181.312,184.317,"--Well, there's a couple of ways it plays out."
1999.98-1828,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,218.81,227.999,Is the fact that this qui tam relator entitled to some portion of the recovery at the end of the day... does that make it a sort of bounty?
1999.98-1828,0,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,227.999,238.713,The fact that this qui tam relator is entitled to something I think that... that that... that is a bounty which gives this relator an incentive to sue.
1999.98-1828,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,250.449,270.341,"The bounty... the bounty cases you were referring to I take it are cases in which the... the suit may be initiated by the... or was the suit initiated by the bounty receiver or it's just that if he brought the matter to the attention of the Government, the Government would sue, and at the end of the suit he'd get a bounty?"
1999.98-1828,0,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,270.341,279.675,"In that first group I was talking about... I think there's five in this category... they would bring the attention... bring it to the attention of the Government, the Government would sue, and there would be a... a bounty at... at the tail end."
1999.98-1828,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,279.675,280.319,Right.
1999.98-1828,0,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,280.319,283.891,"There... there were, of course, a small number of cases--"
1999.98-1828,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,283.891,284.403,There were some.
1999.98-1828,0,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,284.403,293.807,--and our count is three... where it would appear that... that the individual could bring the claim into court himself or herself.
1999.98-1828,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,298.519,300.401,But there was a common law background too.
1999.98-1828,0,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,315.932,317.707,--There is that common law background.
1999.98-1828,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,381.764,384.288,"Well, the common law doesn't... doesn't necessarily prove anything."
1999.98-1828,0,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,403.143,408.367,"Certainly, Your Honor, and... and of course, obviously, we have to look at the time of the Convention."
1999.98-1828,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,408.367,424.587,"But if there actually was a qui tam statute enacted by, say, the First Congress, that would be some indication that the First Congress, which had a number of members from the Constitutional Convention in it, thought that a qui tam statute met the requirements of Article III."
1999.98-1828,0,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,424.587,428.62,"No, Your Honor, I... I don't think that's the case, and this is... this is the reason why."
1999.98-1828,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,453.046,459.268,"Well, unless it shows that our irreducible minimum isn't consistent with the understanding of the Framers."
1999.98-1828,0,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,464.595,467.519,"No, Your Honor, obviously they hadn't."
1999.98-1828,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,496.7,502.641,Didn't the First Congress also pass the statute that was stricken down in Marbury v. Madison?
1999.98-1828,0,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,502.641,503.424,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-1828,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,503.424,506.656,"I guess they hadn't read Marbury v. Madison either, had they?"
1999.98-1828,0,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,507.469,510.799,"Absolutely, Your Honor, and that was... that was not the... the only one."
1999.98-1828,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,526.131,536.817,"Mr. Malley, may I just go back with a technical question to your... your point earlier that until the action was filed, the qui tam plaintiff has no greater interest than... than any taxpayer?"
1999.98-1828,0,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,560.536,568.476,"Well, I think... I think that not without violating the Eleventh Amendment, Your Honor."
1999.98-1828,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,568.476,570.866,"Well, what does the statute provide?"
1999.98-1828,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,570.866,585.53,"The statute... the statute provides that while the Government takes over the action, that... that the... the relators still can make a claim for the portion of recovery."
1999.98-1828,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,585.53,588.397,Let me ask you another question.
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,598.409,599.287,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-1828,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,599.287,600.073,Do you know?
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,600.073,614.012,"But the point... the point really that... that I think is... is urgent in this case... that is, that... is that this relator cannot... cannot have it both ways."
1999.98-1828,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,623.481,634.861,"Well, let's talk about that because I think we've injected you into this whole issue that you've been talking about after the... the petition was filed."
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,642.103,643.791,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1999.98-1828,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,670.225,674.181,"Okay, but this is... this is on interlocutory posture, is it?"
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,674.181,674.799,It is.
1999.98-1828,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,674.799,680.741,And normally we wouldn't take jurisdiction over the interpretation of the statute I guess.
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,680.741,684.657,"Normally you certainly wouldn't, and particularly in the case where it's an unrelated issue."
1999.98-1828,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,695.024,698.611,"We didn't answer it, but suggested that we hadn't decided it."
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,698.611,720.009,"--Exactly, Your Honor, and I think that... I think that... that in all likelihood, if I can just speculate, the reason for that was to leave open the option in... in those circumstances where the issues are inextricably intertwined and where... it might not be meaningful to... to answer the... you know, the... the central question without answering the other."
1999.98-1828,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,786.412,797.011,"I... I can... I can accept that as a possibility, but... but not perhaps going to the statutory issue."
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,812.231,817.008,"No, certainly, Justice Scalia, I did not mean to suggest that the Court has to go to that issue."
1999.98-1828,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,837.458,845.608,But certainly... certainly we also have a... a practice we don't go to constitutional issues if we don't have to.
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,859.339,868.099,"And... and we're... I guess what I'm saying, Your Honor, is we would be happy if the Court addressed this case on any of the three issues."
1999.98-1828,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,869.196,887.303,"I... I understand that, but... but just... just to get the record straight, do you know of any case where, in order to avoid a constitutional issue, we have ignored a jurisdictional question and jumped straight to the statutory question in order to avoid the constitutional question which was a jurisdictional one?"
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,887.303,887.639,No.
1999.98-1828,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,890.11,891.167,Because there is none.
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,891.167,899.165,"--And I... and I certainly wouldn't suggest that, you know, the Court, you know, has... has to go that direction."
1999.98-1828,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,899.165,902.287,Many of our jurisdictional questions are constitutional questions.
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,902.287,904.486,"Absolutely, Your Honor, and the Eleventh Amendment--"
1999.98-1828,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,904.486,913.135,"Yes, but on Eleventh Amendment jurisdiction, we usually ask whether there's a clear statement or not first, and if no clear statement, then we don't... don't reach the Eleventh Amendment issue."
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,914.293,918.972,"--That... that has been the practice, of course, as... as stated in the... in the Will case."
1999.98-1828,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,918.972,920.943,"And this is much the same thing, isn't it?"
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,920.943,921.519,And... and--
1999.98-1828,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,921.519,922.842,The same kind of statutory question.
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,923.644,931.357,"--On the other hand, this Court has indicated its... its preference to go to jurisdictional issues as a threshold matter."
1999.98-1828,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,934.223,937.463,One thing we know for sure is you only have half an hour to argue.
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,939.235,944.172,"Thank... thank you for that segue, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.98-1828,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1003.57,1010.548,"Is... is there an argument here that whatever the force of your position is, it has been... it has been waived contractually?"
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,1040.559,1052.334,"I... I don't think so, Your Honor, and... and the reason for that is that... that under the Edelman decision, mere participation in a Federal program is... is not... is not enough."
1999.98-1828,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1052.334,1055.773,"Well, but this is... this is a step beyond mere participation."
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,1069.205,1090.312,"Well, of course, there wouldn't be any... just looking at it from a... you know, a contract standpoint, what was the meeting of the minds, well, certainly in the context of a... of a False Claims Act statute which is... is to be interpreted, which of course doesn't define the term person, and much... must be interpreted--"
1999.98-1828,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1090.312,1094.823,"Well, we assume... we assume we've got over the person issue in order to get to the Eleventh Amendment issue."
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,1094.823,1095.356,"--No, but--"
1999.98-1828,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1095.356,1098.616,"So, we'll assume that person does include the State."
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,1098.616,1109.617,"--Well, even if we assume that, Your Honor, the... the... how could there be a meeting of the minds?"
1999.98-1828,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1130.294,1141.34,"Yes, but I think the point of my question was that the statute provides, in fact, for a... a remedy at the behest of exactly the kind of plaintiff that we have here."
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,1155.385,1164.534,"Well, I would say, Justice Souter, that... that... that if it was clear under the clear statement rule and that that... the False Claims Act--"
1999.98-1828,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1164.534,1166.54,"Yes, but that's a... that's a rule... that's a rule of legislation."
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,1168.928,1183.979,"--But... but under the Pennhurst case, Your Honor, the... the Congress must make its intention clear and manifest if it... if it intends to impose a condition on the grant of Federal monies upon a State."
1999.98-1828,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1183.979,1193.141,"And you say the... the uncertainty about what person means would... would be, in effect, to the failure to... to make its position--"
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,1193.141,1200.073,Certainly... certainly that and also the effect that would... that would... that would be involved in... in the Eleventh Amendment.
1999.98-1828,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1200.073,1201.569,--Did... did the respondent rely on--
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,1204.4,1206.919,"No, Your Honor."
1999.98-1828,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1218.445,1222.852,Did the... did the respondent raise the contractual point as a alternate ground for affirmance?
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,1222.852,1223.995,"--No... no, Your Honor."
1999.98-1828,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1223.995,1227.241,"What did the contract say, by the way?"
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,1235.355,1248.459,The contract... the agreement under which we entered into this arrangement required that the State of Vermont submit to a range of... of remedies.
1999.98-1828,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1295.457,1306.454,"Do you think that if the State can't be a defendant, it also can't be a plaintiff, or would you make a distinction between those two?"
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,1306.454,1313.542,"--I... I think there is a distinction between the two, Your Honor."
1999.98-1828,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1377.551,1378.697,"Mr. Malley, can I just interrupt for a second?"
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,1387.964,1392.742,"--We... we do not... we do not assert that, Your Honor, and--"
1999.98-1828,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1392.742,1394.985,"I know, but what's your answer to the question?"
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,1398.417,1404.59,"--We... we do not... we do not believe, given the plain statement of... of the meaning--"
1999.98-1828,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1404.59,1405.196,The answer is no?
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,1405.196,1406.798,--the State... the State could bring that.
1999.98-1828,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1406.798,1407.446,The answer is no.
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,1411.901,1413.598,"No, Your Honor, we have not."
1999.98-1828,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1419.006,1432.446,"Do we have any indication of how many of these False Claims Act suits the United States itself has initiated against States, if any, as distinguished from the qui tam?"
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,1432.446,1439.887,"I do not have that number in mind, Your Honor, but... but my distinct impression is it is... it is precious little."
1999.98-1828,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1548.136,1549.489,"Very well, Mr. Malley."
1999.98-1828,2,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,1549.489,1549.901,Thank you.
1999.98-1828,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1549.901,1551.377,"Mr. Olson, we'll hear from you."
1999.98-1828,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1551.377,1557.067,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1828,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1581.682,1588.921,"You're counting... you're counting those... those situations where the suit is not brought by the individual, but he just gets a bounty?"
1999.98-1828,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1588.921,1589.959,"--Yes, and this Court--"
1999.98-1828,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1589.959,1591.525,"Well, I don't consider that qui tam."
1999.98-1828,4,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,1592.446,1609.157,"In Marcus v. Hess, this Court in 1943, construing the earlier 1805 case, said that those cases that gave a common informer award were to be construed as including the right to bring the action to recover that reward by the qui tam relator."
1999.98-1828,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1654.435,1658.297,--Are you addressing the Eleventh Amendment question or the statutory question right now?
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1658.297,1671.656,"--We are addressing... I'm addressing the Eleventh Amendment issue because the... because we're... our argument, as we've articulated in the brief, is that the Eleventh Amendment issue has to be considered based upon the fact that this is a claim that belongs to the United States."
1999.98-1828,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1671.656,1676.571,"Well, I trust you will get to the statutory question somewhere in your argument."
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1676.571,1677.821,"Well, I will do that at any time."
1999.98-1828,5,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1709.409,1714.029,"Well, but that could apply... that could apply in the case where there's a suit against a private contractor and the State has some records."
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1714.029,1722.544,"No, but it... it specifically defines in those three terms... in 3733, there's only one way to read the conjunction of those three terms."
1999.98-1828,5,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1734.76,1740.842,"But it just says in 3733, definitions, for purposes of this section."
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1740.842,1741.242,"--Yes, but--"
1999.98-1828,5,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1741.242,1745.379,I... I didn't see that it extended to the whole act.
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1745.379,1755.67,--But... but section... that same definition section includes a definition of false claims law to include section 3729 through 3722.
1999.98-1828,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1755.67,1757.394,"Well, that's anything but a clear statement--"
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1757.394,1759.072,It seems to me it's a very clear statement.
1999.98-1828,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1770.167,1776.949,"--Well, are you saying then that Congress extended it to the States sometime recently or in 1860, whenever it was passed?"
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1776.949,1794.863,"--We contend that it is... it is unclear with respect to the 1863 version, but it is quite clear with respect to the 1966 amendment which removed the first section which defined a person not in the service of the military and... and eliminated that section, put in a new section which said--"
1999.98-1828,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1794.863,1798.911,It's only by virtue of the amendment that your... your position would prevail.
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1798.911,1802.639,--We think it's considerably stronger with respect to the amendment in 1866.
1999.98-1828,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1802.639,1803.145,"Well, if there... if--"
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1803.145,1803.684,And I think it's--
1999.98-1828,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1803.684,1805.546,"--Just a minute, Mr. Olson."
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1825.19,1828.094,"--I think the case is quite weak, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1999.98-1828,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1828.094,1830.025,"Well, can you answer my question yes or no?"
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1830.025,1834.918,"I think that we could make a very good argument, but possibly not persuasive to this Court."
1999.98-1828,5,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1871.99,1877.859,"I don't understand how the CID section... I mean I see that it helps you, but it seems far from conclusive."
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1901.306,1921.502,"It... I... I thought that was a difficult construction to make at first, Your Honor, until I read the statutes carefully together, including all three of the definitions, the definition of false claims law, which is in (l)(1), the false claims law investigation in (l)(2), and the definition of the word person in (l)(4)."
1999.98-1828,5,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1930.868,1931.371,I see.
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1931.873,1943.07,--and... and if you... and if you put it together with the Senate Judiciary Committee report which was quite clear that the Senate was assuming that States were persons under the statute as it was... being adopted--
1999.98-1828,5,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1943.07,1956.259,"--The... the report they say, which is I think correct, that that's in a background section and that that report purports to be telling what the human being who wrote that report thought the law was before these amendments."
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1976.659,2009.875,"--It seems to me all of this put together, including the Senate report, including the fact that this is an action by the United States to protect the property of the United States against fraud against the United States, and you don't... this Court has held you don't need that so-called plain statement with respect to whether or not claims by the United States can be brought against States, and the interest of the United States in protecting its property from fraud, all of those put together, it strike me make a very persuasive case that the statute intended to include States as persons."
1999.98-1828,5,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2021.645,2027.902,"Wouldn't they... if they had flagged it as a change, they would have gotten a lot of testimony from States I guess who might have been opposed to it."
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2027.902,2029.76,--Or States who might have been in favor of it because--
1999.98-1828,5,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2029.76,2030.38,"Yes, they might have."
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2030.38,2036.801,"--because States have been bringing cases under the... under the False Claims Act, as... as the discussion heretofore has indicated."
1999.98-1828,5,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2036.801,2043.624,"When... when a person writes in a background section this is the law, we're not making a change, then it tends to pass unnoticed."
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2043.624,2058.701,"Well, it... it... if standing alone, that might be the case, but standing in conjunction with the fact that the Senate and the Congress of the United States specifically defined the word person to include the State in section 3733."
1999.98-1828,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2076.577,2079.418,Your position seems to require quite a few props.
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2079.418,2086.33,"Well, the fact is it... I don't think it requires quite a few props, but it has quite a few props, and that makes it doubly persuasive."
1999.98-1828,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2129.78,2131.469,Not all of which goes to the United States.
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2144.228,2157.819,"--The... we... in the case of Arizona v. California, the Court talked about whether an intervenor who would not change the outcome of a case would make any difference with respect to Eleventh Amendment issues."
1999.98-1828,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2166.71,2168.189,But this isn't an intervenor.
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2171.127,2172.072,--He initiates the suit.
1999.98-1828,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2172.072,2181.112,"And... and it seems to me, when... when all you have before you is that person, the question is who is the real party in interest as to that person's suit."
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2184.636,2190.419,"There is only one cause of action, Justice Scalia, under the statute and that's in favor of the United States."
1999.98-1828,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2206.098,2210.248,"Well, if... if you say there is only one cause of action, then I'm not sure that helps you."
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2219.036,2219.412,Because of--
1999.98-1828,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2219.412,2225.142,"--and if any of... if any of the cause of action is not by the United States, it seems to me maybe the whole thing falls."
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2243.108,2255.175,"--As I... as I read this Court's Eleventh Amendment decisions, the... the party who receives the primary benefit of the action is perceived to be the real party in interest."
1999.98-1828,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2270.671,2277.827,--What... what cases... maybe just one or two... do you rely on for that... for that real party in interest proposition that--
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2277.827,2282.973,"--Well, there are several."
1999.98-1828,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2284.333,2284.57,--Yes.
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2286.582,2290.399,"--One is Kansas v. the United States, which is at 204 U.S.--"
1999.98-1828,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2290.399,2294.326,"It involves who the defendant is, who's the real party in interest as far as the State is concerned."
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2294.832,2306.466,"--And there are other cases, and I can't give you the name of the case, but there are cases cited in the brief in which the same test was applied with respect to questions of sovereignty irrespective of whether--"
1999.98-1828,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2306.466,2310.19,Those... those are original jurisdiction cases that have nothing to do with the Eleventh Amendment.
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2310.19,2313.145,--Some of the cases cited were original jurisdiction cases.
1999.98-1828,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2315.556,2318.684,"Well, what are the Eleventh Amendment cases that... that you rely on?"
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2321.94,2326.524,"Those are cited in the brief, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and I can't give you the names of those."
1999.98-1828,5,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2326.524,2339.764,"Why... why is it that the United States, under your rule, can bring an action on behalf of an employee under the Fair Labor Standards Act without an Eleventh Amendment violation?"
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2342.701,2353.022,"The fundamental difference in those cases are those cases are brought by... in the case where it's brought by the United States, it is brought to enforce the laws of the United States."
1999.98-1828,5,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2364.446,2370.184,"If... if the United States brings an action for an employee under the Fair Labor Standards Act, who is the real party in interest under your test?"
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2370.184,2377.373,The United States remains the real party in interest because the United States' fundamental interest in that case is to enforce the laws of the United States.
1999.98-1828,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2377.373,2385.218,But the whole name of actions comes from the Latin which says who on his own behalf as well as on the part of the king.
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2388.589,2388.968,There is no--
1999.98-1828,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2388.968,2392.805,--it indicates that the suit is brought on behalf of the individual bringing the suit.
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2392.805,2398.739,"--There is no question, Justice Scalia, and we're not denying the fact that the relator in these cases has an interest in the outcome of the case."
1999.98-1828,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2400.284,2401.587,I didn't say interest in the outcome.
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2404.336,2407.596,--In the name of the United States to enforce a--
1999.98-1828,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2407.596,2409.338,And also on behalf of the king.
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2411.199,2411.669,"--Well, that's correct."
1999.98-1828,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2411.669,2412.83,That's what these actions are.
1999.98-1828,5,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2416.285,2428.636,"To vindicate... but to vindicate the fundamental interests of the United States and to protect the broader interest of the United States in deterring... not just redressing, but also deterring fraud against the United States."
1999.98-1828,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2448.456,2449.366,The purpose of treble damage--
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2455.714,2471.935,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1828,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2536.916,2539.597,Is it commonplace for the United States to assign its claims?
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2539.597,2550.052,"The United States does not commonly assign its claims, but the qui tam mechanism has been around since 1790 and operates in very much the same way."
1999.98-1828,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2550.335,2552.081,Let me ask this other question.
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2560.103,2561.869,--It has done it on a few occasions.
1999.98-1828,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2595.006,2600.705,"Well, I mean, if it is a straight assignment, suppose the United States just assigns a claim to Smith, a claim against a State."
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2603.9,2608.321,--I'm just... my point here simply goes to the Article III point not the... not the Eleventh--
1999.98-1828,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2608.321,2609.589,"Yes, but I mean, can you have it both ways?"
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2609.984,2610.32,--No.
1999.98-1828,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2622.66,2622.895,--All right.
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2626.751,2632.774,"Well, because a qui tam action is... is a hybrid form of action that has been in existence since the beginning of the Nation."
1999.98-1828,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2638.387,2645.121,"Your view would be for purposes of standing, an assignment; for purposes of Eleventh Amendment, not an assignment."
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2646.71,2648.736,"--Well, we're... we're not... we're not saying it's literally an assignment."
1999.98-1828,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2680.585,2695.816,"--Yes, but... but that... that would... that would only cover the situation where all the... all the qui tam plaintiff gets is... is his own recovery and nothing is... is then credited to... to the United States."
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2695.816,2696.786,"No, I don't think that's correct."
1999.98-1828,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2713.533,2714.581,You need standing.
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2720.362,2723.105,"Well, there is only one... there is only one judgment in a qui tam case."
1999.98-1828,6,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2825.053,2828.16,"--Well, that's... that's not quite as clear as you make it I think."
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2833.163,2834.435,"Yes, if there is a qui tam action."
1999.98-1828,6,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2878.081,2882.958,"Well, what... what was the law before those amendments as to States?"
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2882.958,2887.363,We... we think that the law probably did apply to the States because there was no clear statement requirement.
1999.98-1828,6,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2899.621,2901.49,"Well, Marcus against Hess didn't amend the statute--"
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2901.49,2902.069,"No, no."
1999.98-1828,6,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2902.514,2903.433,--at least not purportedly.
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2903.433,2903.707,Right.
1999.98-1828,6,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2912.626,2924.858,"Well, if it were revamping the statute, why... why are you so dependent on something called a background report that, as Justice Breyer says, can probably better be read for describing existing law?"
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2924.858,2926.867,"Well, this is the reason why I think it's specific."
1999.98-1828,6,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2943.89,2944.582,It might.
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2944.855,2946.936,--but... but also said any person.
1999.98-1828,6,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2956.248,2963.071,But we... we've had cases saying that person... the use of the word person doesn't ordinarily include States.
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2963.071,2965.386,--But that's typically where there is a private interest at stake.
1999.98-1828,6,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2973.667,2977.352,"Well, but here... well, let's... let's get back to the... the relator."
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2981.428,2982.473,The--
1999.98-1828,6,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2982.473,2984.296,--until the time the suit is filed--
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2984.296,2984.996,--The relator... there is--
1999.98-1828,6,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2984.996,2986.66,--that's different from the ordinary taxpayer?
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2986.66,2991.362,"--There is no prior injury to the relator, but there certainly is a prior injury to the United States."
1999.98-1828,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3019.795,3026.798,"Gives him a personal right to... to his portion of the recovery, but that's... we don't do standing in gross the way you're describing it."
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3035.181,3035.452,--Well--
1999.98-1828,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3035.452,3036.44,--namely the United States.
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3036.44,3046.157,"--Well, in citizen suit cases, it's... it's not at all unusual for the plaintiff to be able to bring the suit because of a personal injury to the... to the... to the private plaintiff, the private citizen."
1999.98-1828,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3067.043,3069.065,All of the relief awarded benefitted that person.
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3071.193,3086.366,"--Well, again, there is a single, unitary judgment out of which the... the... in a way the United States and the relator in that way could be looked at as joint tenants, and a... and a joint tenant is typically empowered to protect the interests on behalf of both tenants."
1999.98-1828,6,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3086.366,3087.041,Mr. Kneedler--
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3087.041,3094.898,"These are just analogies, but I think they show why a single judgment in which one person has an interest was enough to give a... a concrete stake."
1999.98-1828,6,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3095.211,3110.38,"--Would you adopt in any way as a fall-back position that the False Claims Act includes the State as a person if the United States is bringing the suit, but does not include the State as a person if a private individual is bringing the suit?"
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3110.38,3129.496,"Well, we certainly think if the Court were to conclude that... that a clear statement is required that's not for the relator... that wouldn't be true for the United States, and I... but that would... that would come under 3730, not the definition of person but who could bring a cause of action under 3730(a) or (b) which distinguished the Attorney General and... and the private relator."
1999.98-1828,6,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3134.698,3142.629,Because you did say in your brief one of the reasons the United States has a large stake in this is that the United States itself couldn't sue under the False Claims Act.
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3142.629,3159.067,"Right, and we think that... we think that's a particular reason why the idea that the statute should be saved by construing States not to be persons, it would be an odd sort of saving of... saving construction to deprive the United States of suing States when States receive 250 billion a year now."
1999.98-1828,6,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3159.067,3159.485,"Well, but that's--"
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3166.602,3180.251,"No, but Congress specifically determined in 1986 that those other remedies were inadequate and that the False Claims Act measures, including the provisions for informers to bring information to the United States or to... to file suit were critical to ferret out and... and redress."
1999.98-1828,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3180.251,3180.809,But that's the very point.
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3203.692,3204.403,But that... that--
1999.98-1828,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3204.403,3208.738,"So, the latter should be left to the political process or other methods, not this one."
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3209.491,3215.458,--But that... that concern does not go to the question of whether the United States itself should be able to bring a False Claims Act--
1999.98-1828,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3215.458,3215.773,"No, no."
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3240.181,3244.634,"--But again, your concern goes I... I thought primarily to the question of the qui tam provision."
1999.98-1828,6,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3281.273,3288.357,--There... there the... the finding was that the plaintiff was... was not the real party in interest.
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3288.357,3301.564,"--But because there was a... a private party that stood behind the State that... that stood to benefit, and here we have very much the same thing, that although the relator brings the suit, he first of all brings it in the name of the United States to recover for the United States."
1999.98-1828,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3360.681,3363.938,It still remains a suit by the United States in your view.
1999.98-1828,6,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3363.938,3367.531,--It's a suit both by the... it's a hybrid by the United States and by the relator.
1999.98-1828,6,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3367.531,3369.351,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
1999.98-1828,7,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,3371.939,3375.661,"Thank you, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1828,7,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3401.067,3406.425,Why can't you assign a claim to someone who has no prior injury and they can bring a... they can bring the claim?
1999.98-1828,7,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,3409.823,3413.321,"Assignments... assignments certainly are a possibility, Your Honor."
1999.98-1828,7,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3414.009,3415.167,"Well, he said look at this like an assignment."
1999.98-1828,7,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,3415.167,3418.405,--But this... this is... it's certainly not like an... an assignment.
1999.98-1828,7,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3455.258,3459.665,What about his example of a joint tenancy where two parties both have an interest in a unitary judgment?
1999.98-1828,7,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,3461.355,3464.172,--A joint... a joint tenancy--
1999.98-1828,7,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3464.172,3466.108,"He said it's comparable to a joint tenancy, yes."
1999.98-1828,7,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,3466.108,3467.802,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
1999.98-1828,7,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3467.802,3468.607,A partial assignment.
1999.98-1828,7,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,3468.607,3477.885,"In... in that... in that instance either joint tenant has his or her own specific property interest, and when that's infringed upon--"
1999.98-1828,7,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3477.885,3478.141,That's right.
1999.98-1828,7,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,3481.923,3486.549,"--But it... but... but up until the time this suit was filed, there was... there was no injury."
1999.98-1828,7,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3500.238,3504.976,"Well, you're not suggesting an assignee could never sue if... if the assignee had never been injured."
1999.98-1828,7,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,3504.976,3505.482,"--No, Your Honor."
1999.98-1828,7,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3507.64,3516.517,"Well, if the Government had assigned the claim in toto to the relator, I suppose the relator could sue without any trouble and clearly have standing."
1999.98-1828,7,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,3516.517,3519.438,"Well, except for the Eleventh Amendment, yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-1828,7,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3519.438,3521.689,I'm not sure you could partially assign claims anyway.
1999.98-1828,7,32042,j_wallace_malley_jr,,3529.652,3534.769,Let me just underscore one... one other point and that's the need for the plain statement rule here.
1999.98-1828,7,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3565.976,3566.782,"Thank you, Mr. Malley."
