1994.94-558,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,14.412,"We'll hear argument now in Number 94 588... 558, United States v. Ray Hays, consolidated with Number 94 627, Louisiana v. Ray Hays."
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,15.821,18.543,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-558,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,84.146,88.588,"What do you mean, General Ieyoub, about, what is a majority minority district?"
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,88.588,98.406,"--Your Honor, I think a majority minority district is a district that will give minorities a fair opportunity to elect representatives of their choice."
1994.94-558,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,98.406,101.137,"Well then, it's almost self defining, isn't it?"
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,114.175,119.629,"Your Honor, I do not know of any independent definition."
1994.94-558,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,134.359,141.104,"Well, so that perhaps is the definition, that the district has a majority of a minority population."
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,141.104,141.762,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,166.8,177.326,"The assumption being that unless a minority is in a majority, they don't have a fair opportunity to get one of their members elected in Louisiana, an acceptance of, essentially, racial voting."
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,177.326,179.469,"--Your Honor, because of--"
1994.94-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,179.469,188.624,You acknowledge that in Louisiana you don't have a chance of being elected unless you're elected by a majority of your race.
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,188.624,194.369,"--Your Honor, the history that we have, the voting history in the State of Louisiana is an indication--"
1994.94-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,194.369,195.168,You accept that.
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,206.547,218.834,"--Your Honor, we will accept the reality that a black has never been elected to a legislative seat or to a congressional seat unless it was from a majority minority district in the State of Louisiana."
1994.94-558,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,224.038,231.412,"And if you accept that fact, do you draw these districts in order to perpetuate that practice?"
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,231.412,232.844,"--No, Your Honor."
1994.94-558,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,233.215,235.034,Or to try and eliminate it?
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,235.034,249.865,--We try to draw the districts... we try to draw the districts in such a way as to give a fair opportunity to minorities to elect their candidates with the hope that soon we will not have to consider race in this situation.
1994.94-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,249.865,253.658,You think this will help society to get away from considering race.
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,253.658,254.367,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,254.367,265.723,"By intentionally drawing the districts according to race, and having people run on the basis of race, presumably, in these racial districts, you think we're going to eliminate this terrible state of affairs in Louisiana, that people vote by race."
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,265.723,266.545,I think that--
1994.94-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,266.545,268.147,You're going to eliminate it rather than entrench it.
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,268.147,270.487,"--I think, Your Honor, that it can eliminate it."
1994.94-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,283.946,292.582,"How are you sending that message when you draw a district on the basis of race, and when you come up and acknowledge that you don't have a fair chance of getting elected in Louisiana unless people of your race vote for you?"
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,292.582,297.766,"--Your Honor, we send that message because this is a district that only gives a fair opportunity."
1994.94-558,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,369.201,372.264,"General, may I just be clear on one fact?"
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,388.445,389.476,"--No, Your Honor."
1994.94-558,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,389.476,394.248,"And no black had ever been elected, ever?"
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,394.248,396.85,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-558,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,421.878,430.981,"Well, was... is District 4 the most compact majority minority district that could be drawn outside New Orleans?"
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,430.981,433.835,"Yes, Your Honor, it is the most compact."
1994.94-558,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,459.482,465.045,But wasn't the old Eighth District deliberately gerrymandered just to keep Representative Long in office?
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,465.045,479.584,"Your Honor, there was evidence that was... that it was drawn in such a way as to assist Congressman Gillis Long into being elected, but obviously it was never challenged in any court."
1994.94-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,479.584,481.264,And that's going to be our criterion.
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,489.321,502.879,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that the Court has struck down, but political considerations can be taken into consideration when drawing... when redistricting."
1994.94-558,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,502.879,504.662,What case did that?
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,515.256,516.616,"That is my mistake, Your Honor."
1994.94-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,525.994,529.597,So that's going to be our criterion as to whether this district is too weird.
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,540.924,541.465,"No, Your Honor."
1994.94-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,556.204,557.225,You didn't stick to the old district.
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,570.724,576.367,"There's no question, Your Honor, that the legislature considered race in trying to form a majority minority district."
1994.94-558,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,576.367,577.719,"That is, indeed, how the district was formed."
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,585.183,599.023,"To some extent, Your Honor, but not so dramatically that one could say it was a dramatic departure from past redistricting principles, and certainly District 4 does not look that much stranger than the old District 8, which was a majority white district."
1994.94-558,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,599.023,600.333,The original one did.
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,610.66,615.754,"Well, Your Honor, in some cases District 4 is actually more compact than the old District 8."
1994.94-558,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,634.656,638.828,"But that represents quite a change from, what was it called, Act 42?"
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,638.828,642.661,"Yes, Your Honor, it does represent quite a change from Act 42."
1994.94-558,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,656.549,664.126,"General, may I go sort of behind your present argument to what I understand your brief to say and raise a question about that?"
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,686.399,686.69,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-558,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,686.69,709.254,"I have been assuming, and you correct me if I'm wrong, that just as you would try to define bizarre by what is traditional, that you would probably argue, and I guess I have assumed, that what is sufficiently compact for the Gingles test probably has the same sort of historical criterion."
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,714.627,715.648,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-558,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,715.648,717.989,Here's the problem I have with the argument.
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,779.9,793.69,"Your Honor, I think that initially one can look at the particular configuration of the district and make a determination, at least looking at it, whether or not the configuration is bizarre."
1994.94-558,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,793.69,822.589,"No, but your argument was... I realize that's what we're all going to do in the first instance, but I thought your argument was that whether we ultimately classify it as bizarre or not is going to depend on whether it departs significantly from what had been produced by non... we assume nonracial districting in the past, so that we may start out by looking at it, but ultimately what we're going to do on your theory is, is to ask, is this like what we used to do?"
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,822.589,824.43,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-558,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,847.195,849.877,"All right, but then how do we solve the problems that are bothering me?"
1994.94-558,0,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,863.815,880.676,"Well, Your Honor, if it's bizarre... if you say that it is bizarre, and strict scrutiny applies, then I think you have to look at the compelling State interest, and then whether or not it's narrowly tailored, or the plan is narrowly tailored to satisfy that compelling State interest."
1994.94-558,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,894.406,895.726,"Thank you, General Ieyoub."
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,898.217,920.653,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-558,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,952.183,960.587,"Well, General Days, let's suppose that the evidence discloses... and remove it from this case for a moment."
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,982.992,995.601,"I think it, as this Court had addressed it in Shaw v. Reno, there would have to be a showing of the bizarreness of the district, otherwise what would happen is courts could justify--"
1994.94-558,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,995.601,1011.362,"Well, of course, the extreme appearance of a district boundaries might be strong evidence of just that, that the predominant or sole purpose was to draw it along racial lines."
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1017.116,1023.66,"--Justice O'Connor, we don't read Shaw v. Reno to authorize that type of inquiry."
1994.94-558,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1033.185,1035.298,You think it's a purely visual test?
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1035.298,1037.709,"No, I don't think it's a purely visual test."
1994.94-558,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1051.027,1053.5,But only looking at the shape of the district.
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1053.5,1061.114,Only looking at the shape of a district I think does not provide the type of information that we believe this Court was seeking.
1994.94-558,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1061.114,1062.704,"Well, what I'm trying to get at perhaps is the same thing I think--"
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1062.704,1062.975,Yes.
1994.94-558,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1062.975,1063.626,--Justice O'Connor was trying to get at.
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1081.196,1089.431,"Well, under those circumstances I think the case would move into strict scrutiny and the State would have to show a compelling interest for doing what it was doing."
1994.94-558,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1089.431,1093.354,So bizarreness by... is not an essential ingredient of a claim.
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1093.354,1106.805,"I think it is, because prior to Shaw v. Reno, and as I indicated I don't think Shaw v. Reno changed the law, it was not possible to set out an equal protection claim unless one could show that there was some injury."
1994.94-558,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1113.719,1132.1,"Well, you agree that in the Shaw v. Reno context it is a violation of the Constitution to draw a district with the predominant purpose of composing it on the basis of one race, or substantially one race."
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1132.1,1134.882,"With respect, Justice Kennedy, I don't think that's what Shaw v. Reno says."
1994.94-558,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1143.317,1149.402,"But that itself, I take it, is the evil that the constitutional protection is designed to prevent."
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1149.402,1151.225,"That is correct, that Shaw v. Reno--"
1994.94-558,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1151.225,1156.708,"And if that is so, why should it be confined just to districts with an irregular shape?"
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1156.708,1161.239,--Because I think this Court's prior precedent dictates that.
1994.94-558,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1165.031,1168.094,"Other than the precedent, what would be the explanation for that?"
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1168.094,1176.749,--The explanation would be that Shaw v. Reno did not create a new cause of action that rejected prior causes of action.
1994.94-558,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1193.15,1197.324,"In your view, why should that be a constitutional violation under Shaw?"
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1197.324,1209.061,"Because this Court did not change the prior law, and what the prior law said, what this Court recognized, was that race is something that is always a part of the redistricting process."
1994.94-558,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1212.793,1214.594,But then it seems to me that the Chief Justice is right.
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1223.93,1253.549,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, I think what this Court recognized in Shaw v. Reno and other cases, as I was about to describe, was that race is a consideration along with other criteria in the redistricting process, so if what you're saying, Justice Kennedy, is that whenever a State uses race as one of the considerations in the redistricting process, it's automatically moved over into strict scrutiny."
1994.94-558,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1311.118,1314.792,"General, I don't think the question has been whether they use it at all."
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1319.667,1322.459,"I understand that, Justice."
1994.94-558,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1322.459,1329.414,"you know, whether that's the basis on which the district was drawn, and I thought that that had been conceded here, that these are not hypothetical questions you're getting."
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1342.25,1383.667,"Well, but Justice Scalia, we can talk about whether the State satisfied strict scrutiny, but the point I think that is very important to make in terms of the process is, it's not merely a matter of shifting burdens, it is that even with a completely regular traditional district with no deviations whatsoever, the standard that the district court used, namely, where race conscious redistricting is involved it is not necessarily unconstitutional but always subject to strict scrutiny, is a very powerful and I think very disruptive and incorrect way of looking at the districting process."
1994.94-558,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1383.667,1398.487,"Don't you think a distinction can be made between situations where race is one of a lot of factors that's considered in districting and situations in which race is the determinative factor, where you set out to create a majority minority district?"
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1399.598,1402.651,"The distinction can be made, but I think the process is important."
1994.94-558,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1426.316,1447.721,"But General Days, isn't it the case here that it's conceded the endeavor was to create a majority minority district, and I think you answered Justice O'Connor's question by distinguishing Reno v. Shaw from simply endeavoring to create a minority majority district."
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1447.721,1448.041,Yes.
1994.94-558,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1448.041,1449.401,And you cited precedent.
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1462.23,1473.547,"Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg, and that's what I meant when I said that we did not understand Shaw v. Reno to repudiate prior precedent, and in UJO, five justices of this Court very clearly said--"
1994.94-558,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1473.547,1475.948,UJO was a badly splintered Court.
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1475.948,1495.833,"--It was badly splintered, but Mr. Chief Justice, I think one can find in that opinion a recognition that in the limited circumstance where the State was trying to respond to a denial of preclearance by the United States Attorney General under the Voting Rights Act, that what New York did there was consistent with the Constitution."
1994.94-558,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1500.656,1501.005,In your view--
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1515.004,1515.785,--That's correct.
1994.94-558,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1515.785,1523.44,"My problem is, why isn't that also going to function for reasons raised in my question as a last cut?"
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1544.984,1547.525,"Well, let me take the second part of that."
1994.94-558,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1569.839,1574.494,So Shaw and Reno basically is just one entrance gate to equal protection.
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1575.305,1576.324,That's absolutely correct.
1994.94-558,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1604.263,1608.165,Would there be an opportunity to justify it on avoiding section 5?
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1608.165,1620.023,"I think there would be a possibility under section 5, and there would also be a possibility of justifying it under the Fourteenth Amendment, because the compelling interest that the State has put forward here--"
1994.94-558,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1620.023,1621.885,It simply is the State's autonomous effort to... yes.
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1621.885,1633.933,"--That's correct, and therefore there is obviously a connection between a bizarreness finding and a section 2 defense, but not between bizarreness and some of the other claims that are made."
1994.94-558,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1633.933,1658.169,"General Days, speaking of section 5, in preclearing does the Department of Justice assume that unless the legislature of the State creates a majority minority district where it is possible to do it, that otherwise there... you would assume discrimination on the part of the State?"
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1658.169,1658.907,"No, that's not the position."
1994.94-558,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1667.252,1672.858,"Well, I guess we'll get into that more in the next case, but let me ask you one other thing."
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1672.858,1673.196,Yes.
1994.94-558,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1673.196,1679.882,"The plaintiffs in this case did not live in District 4, is that right?"
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1679.882,1681.634,That's correct.
1994.94-558,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1681.634,1687.558,"And they did not... they lived in some district, was it contiguous to it?"
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1687.558,1689.869,"I believe it was a contiguous district, yes."
1994.94-558,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1689.869,1693.96,And do you assume that they have standing to raise this claim?
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1693.96,1702.198,"Well, Justice O'Connor, as you are aware, we did not raise the standing issue, but I think that it is a problematic concern in this case."
1994.94-558,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1736.028,1741.132,"Well, if you're included in because you're black, I presume you're excluded out because you're white."
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1741.132,1742.724,Yes.
1994.94-558,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1742.724,1756.451,"Certainly a person who's contiguous enough that he might have been included in but for the fact that they wanted to exclude any more white votes, I assume he'd have some complaint, but he might have to show that, I guess."
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1756.451,1756.691,Yes.
1994.94-558,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1761.935,1762.465,Yes.
1994.94-558,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1762.465,1763.066,--Mr. Chief Justice?
1994.94-558,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1781.809,1783.309,"Thank you, General Days."
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,1785.47,1793.306,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, may it please the Court:"
1994.94-558,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1832.851,1841.816,"But Mr. Warren, certainly it is not a cosmetic makeover in the sense that is... it follows closely the lines of the earlier district."
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,1842.648,1848.262,"Well, Chief Justice Rehnquist, I think that's a misperception in this sense."
1994.94-558,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1851.234,1852.786,"Well, I mean, geographically it's quite different."
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,1852.786,1853.254,It looks different.
1994.94-558,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1854.205,1854.676,"Well, it sure does."
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,1854.676,1870.236,"--talking about visual appearances, it looks different, but let me stress that the key to this District 4 is four metropolitan areas which heretofore in Louisiana history had always been in three or four separate congressional districts."
1994.94-558,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1900.745,1905.53,"Mr. Parks, where do the plaintiffs reside, in what district?"
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,1909.032,1909.511,Justice--
1994.94-558,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1909.511,1912.105,Where do the plaintiffs reside?
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,1912.105,1916.916,"--Justice O'Connor, they reside in Grambling and Ruston, Louisiana."
1994.94-558,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1935.019,1937.811,They were in the 1992--
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,1937.811,1938.081,Yes.
1994.94-558,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1938.081,1938.77,--district.
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,1938.77,1939.241,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-558,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1939.241,1940.182,Do they contend--
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,1941.574,1942.213,"Yes, they are."
1994.94-558,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1942.213,1944.775,Are they in a district that is contiguous now to 4?
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,1944.775,1945.125,Yes.
1994.94-558,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1948.377,1952.159,Did they contend that the Zorro district was correctly designed?
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,1952.159,1955.943,"No, Chief... I mean, no Justice Kennedy."
1994.94-558,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1973.034,1984.792,"Well, assuming that their contention, and I think that would be their contention, is that both the Zorro district and this district are improper, how have they been mistreated in this case?"
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,1984.792,1996.719,"Well, they've been mistreated, and this is what I was trying to address, Justice Kennedy, they have been mistreated by the State of Louisiana by being classified by race for purposes of districting."
1994.94-558,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2007.035,2008.367,"But Mr. Warren, they're all of different races."
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2010.207,2011.328,Yes.
1994.94-558,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2011.328,2030.209,"That's a little hard to... I could see if you had white plaintiffs who said we were put out of this district because we were white, but you have a black plaintiff and a white plaintiff and an Asian American plaintiff, so every race is equally discriminated against, treated the same."
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2038.617,2048.712,"Justice Ginsburg, our claim is that our plaintiffs are entitled to be treated without regard to race."
1994.94-558,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2050.154,2054.717,"And these people are left out without regard to their race, or put in another district."
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2054.717,2064.623,"--No, but citizens in the State are being classified by... on racial grounds in order to draw these district lines, as the district court so found in this case."
1994.94-558,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2064.623,2072.157,Then you really are arguing a kind of standing that I up until now thought existed only in the Establishment Clause area.
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2077.981,2080.411,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't think that's true."
1994.94-558,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2087.388,2092.36,"Yes, but in the jury cases the people who are objecting are rather narrowly identified."
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2104.759,2113.574,"But still and all, it is based upon the right of every citizen not to be put on a particular petit jury based on his or her race."
1994.94-558,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2113.574,2136.88,"Well, yes, but if I happen to be going about my business on the street below the courthouse and I find that, or I have reason to believe that a discriminatory jury selection is going on, I can't walk in and be given standing to object to it, and yet the analogy is that if I am at the furthest corner of Louisiana I can do precisely that with respect to this district."
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2136.88,2158.254,"Well, first let me say that it... the jury pool from which juries are selected is very much like the electorate from which districts are being drawn, but let me go further to say our plaintiffs were, as I responded to Justice O'Connor, in District 4 of Act 42, which was then invalidated."
1994.94-558,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2165.84,2168.091,"But they weren't put out because of their race, since they were--"
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2168.091,2168.431,--Well--
1994.94-558,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2168.431,2168.98,--all different race.
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2168.98,2184.581,"--they weren't individually, perhaps, but the district lines were drawn based upon race so that individuals who were black or white or lived in those communities where the lines were being drawn on race were being classified by race."
1994.94-558,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2184.581,2190.775,"But they haven't personally been denied equal protection treatment, have them?"
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2190.775,2192.327,I think that they have--
1994.94-558,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2192.327,2194.357,Some kind of generalized grievance?
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2194.357,2195.179,--a personal right not to be classified by race.
1994.94-558,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2222.486,2232.894,"Except for the Zorro, their brief residence in the evanescent Zorro district, how are they any different from any citizen in Louisiana, following Justice Souter's question?"
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2240.246,2254.846,"First of all, I think we are arguing that persons who are in districts adjacent to this district are being affected, because the district... let me say, I don't want to engage in the very racial stereotypes which are the problem of this case in order to defend standing."
1994.94-558,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2267.055,2280.655,"Well, but you have to show some particularized injury, and I'm simply asking you how your plaintiffs are different than plaintiffs in any other part of the State, other than the fact they're contiguous, but they would have always been contiguous, other than the Zorro district, which they, too, challenged."
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2280.655,2296.334,"Well, I think again, unless I engage... it's easy enough for me to make the allegation that my plaintiff Ed Adams, who is black, is being harmed by being put in a district that is 85 percent white."
1994.94-558,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2306.602,2307.533,You wouldn't have to do that.
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2331.517,2334.548,"I think we have demonstrated that, because... because--"
1994.94-558,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2334.548,2338.532,But for this racial districting any one of your plaintiffs would have been in a different district?
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2338.532,2344.116,"--Well, but for this entire process they would have been in district 4 and Act 42."
1994.94-558,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2353.632,2355.082,They had to be redrawn.
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2355.082,2356.534,Of course they had to be redrawn.
1994.94-558,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2356.534,2359.316,They had to be redrawn because the prior system was unconstitutional.
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2367.13,2368.983,I--
1994.94-558,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2368.983,2370.932,And I don't know that you've made any such showing.
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2370.932,2373.294,"--Well, I think I've made the following showings."
1994.94-558,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2376.406,2382.291,"Mr. Warren, you did start out with plaintiffs who were voters in the district that you challenged."
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2382.291,2382.631,--Indeed.
1994.94-558,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2382.631,2387.523,"And then the State too it back and said, we realize this plan has infirmities."
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2387.523,2387.864,Right.
1994.94-558,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2387.864,2390.227,We're coming up with a new... and that left your people out.
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2401.984,2410.459,"But Your Honor, you're missing one major point that I keep trying to stress."
1994.94-558,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2417.603,2420.755,So you do say that anybody in the State has a claim.
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2420.755,2422.826,I do say anybody in the State has a claim.
1994.94-558,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2422.826,2423.066,Okay.
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2423.066,2425.3,I'm not trying to duck that at all.
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2425.3,2426.679,"Well, you tried to avoid it once."
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2427.29,2428.562,"Well, I apologize."
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2431.054,2434.355,--Can I ask you a hypothetical question that's been running through my mind?
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2434.355,2435.244,"Yes, Justice--"
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2435.244,2437.936,The heart of the case you say is driven by race.
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2437.936,2438.406,--Yes.
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2438.406,2455.447,"Supposing the State legislature had two alternative plans to consider, both of which had completely compact districts, had followed State county lines, or parish lines, were equal in population, they were equal in all respects in terms of neutral factors except one."
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2480.674,2484.728,"First, that's not our case, but--"
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2484.728,2486.168,I think it is your case.
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2486.168,2493.912,"--Well, I mean, I think it's not our case because I think these lines don't meet any of the criteria you're talking about, but let me continue and not argue--"
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2493.912,2502.939,"I'm assuming... I'm trying to follow up on Justice O'Connor's question as, how important is the shape of the district, and I'm assuming there's no shape problem at all in my hypothetical--"
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2502.939,2504.241,"--Oh, in your hypothetical, if we assume--"
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2504.241,2507.463,--and no doubt at all about the controlling factor in the decision between these two plaintiffs.
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2507.463,2508.762,--We're assuming away shape.
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2525.945,2528.166,But is it unconstitutional in my example?
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2528.166,2532.838,It is unconstitutional unless the State can come forward with a compelling interest.
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2532.838,2534.33,"Their only reason, in my example--"
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2534.33,2534.701,They have no--
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2534.701,2540.755,"--Their only reason is they think they have a history they're not proud of, and they would like to have two black Representatives in Congress."
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2540.755,2541.634,--The history won't do it.
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2541.634,2543.406,"Well, of course--"
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2552.393,2555.064,That would be equally questionable.
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2555.064,2556.905,So they couldn't choose either one.
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2557.145,2566.09,I don't think we would... in a real world I don't think we get stymied in the way in which you're talking.
1994.94-558,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2571.954,2572.665,"Mr. Warren, I assume when--"
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2572.665,2572.936,Yes.
1994.94-558,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2572.936,2581.701,"--you have regular districts and it's one of the elements of regular districts, ordinarily race is not the predominant factor."
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2603.093,2604.665,But I think an extremely unusual one.
1994.94-558,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2611.681,2615.352,You only assert it's bad if race is the predominant consideration.
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2615.352,2615.822,--Yes.
1994.94-558,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2616.473,2618.374,Do you acknowledge that race can be one of the considerations in a whole bunch?
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2618.374,2619.335,--Sure.
1994.94-558,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2619.335,2619.756,Or not at all.
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2619.756,2620.117,Sure.
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2621.627,2627.64,Supposing it's the predominant consideration for only those legislators who are frank in their voting in the legislature.
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2634.366,2641.538,"--This Court has had for 20 years a framework for evaluating these cases, these questions of mixed motive."
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2646.964,2652.247,"But it requires a careful examination of legislative history to find out what the real motive was, is that right?"
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2652.247,2662.122,"It requires a careful examination of facts, and those facts can include consideration of the real purpose of the legislature."
1994.94-558,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2681.496,2687.6,"I suppose for many... I mean, the basic thing that I have a lot of trouble is, I don't understand this word predominant."
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2743.147,2753.883,"I understand exactly, and Justice Breyer, the starting point is this Court's traditional analysis under Vandermeer... I mean, under Washington v. Davis and Arlington Heights."
1994.94-558,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2771.704,2775.387,"Well, that would be true in many, many, many districts in the United States."
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2809.27,2809.788,--First... first of all--
1994.94-558,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2809.788,2810.83,--appropriate or not appropriate?
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2810.83,2828.652,"--First of all, Justice Breyer, this Court said in Shaw, and I think Justice O'Connor's opinion on this draws about the right line, and that is that race can help us to define the boundaries of a community."
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2889.72,2909.315,"But Mr. Warren, does it make that assumption really that all will vote the same way, or that a sufficient number of them will vote the same way to make a political judgment that makes sense, such as all Catholics tend to vote in a certain way in the City of Chicago or all Polish Americans tend to vote in a certain... are you saying they are all going to vote the same way?"
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2910.205,2911.456,"--No, I don't think you're saying all--"
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2911.456,2913.197,--You're just saying there's a political reality at work here.
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2913.197,2917.831,"--But I think what you're saying, you're making again, it is just as--"
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2917.831,2920.763,It's invidious to assume that all blacks--
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2920.763,2921.123,--Yes.
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2921.123,2924.913,--Is it less invidious to assume that all Polish Americans will vote the same way?
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2924.913,2930.138,"If being a Polish American is a suspect classification, it's the same--"
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2930.138,2937.843,"Well, it's only if it's a suspect classification that you don't get the benefit of being able to have your group interest treated as a group interest."
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2937.843,2946.91,"--I think it's... I think you're making an assumption of it being a benefit, and what I'm saying is that it is a stereotype--"
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2946.91,2952.643,"Well, certainly, don't you think more black legislators would have voted for this plan than against it, and is it invidious to make that political--"
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2952.643,2961.219,"--I'm not at all sure, and I think that black legislators, who knows, but I think that... those are the presumptions that we cannot rest on."
1994.94-558,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2979.49,2980.352,"--Mr. Warren, what do you do with--"
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,2980.352,2981.071,--that lies at the heart of the problem.
1994.94-558,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2981.071,3005.518,"--It was a badly splintered opinion, but there were two, if you will, stereotypes involved in the UJO case, and both of them, both groups accepted the proposition that if we can have our district not every Hasidic Jew is going to vote the same way but a lot of them are, and the same assumption was made... what is the difference between Louisiana and New York, or do we just say, UJO is a hopeless precedent, forget it?"
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,3005.518,3011.711,"Well, I think this Court in Shaw did deal with UJO and probably dealt with it about right."
1994.94-558,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3035.297,3057.661,"Supposing... supposing, Mr. Warren, that the evidence before the... shows that the Louisiana legislature simply paired off this district because they wanted about a 70 percent Democratic majority in it."
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,3073.321,3074.934,It would be a very hard proof.
1994.94-558,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3113.108,3116.65,"Mr. Warren, may I ask you just to clarify something about your position?"
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,3124.736,3124.997,Yes.
1994.94-558,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3124.997,3130.359,"As I understand it, your position is not that it must be the predominant purpose."
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,3135.772,3145.038,We suggest that what this Court said in Arlington was that it mus be a substantial motivating factor to create a prima facie case.
1994.94-558,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3145.038,3145.279,But not predominant.
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,3145.279,3150.182,But substantial motivating and predominant first of all I think are simply semantic--
1994.94-558,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3150.182,3150.422,Academic distinctions.
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,3150.422,3158.387,"--distinctions, but let me say secondly, under Arlington Heights, substantial motivating factor is what triggers... what creates a prima facie case."
1994.94-558,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3164.191,3164.972,Okay.
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,3164.972,3165.953,--predominant factor.
1994.94-558,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3165.953,3169.536,Did the judge then in this particular case go too far?
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,3181.083,3182.893,I really don't think that's the case.
1994.94-558,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3212.182,3219.287,"Mr. Warren, I'd like to be clear on whether you make a distinction between race and other suspect categories."
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,3237.25,3247.135,"Justice Ginsburg, we address that in our brief, and we said that if a suspect classification becomes the touchstone, it's invalid."
1994.94-558,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3272.042,3289.313,"What if, and this raises both Kiryas Joel and the UJO case, what if a racial, ethnic, or religious group has certain social characteristics that render it cohesive?"
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,3302.82,3303.361,Not at all.
1994.94-558,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3303.361,3314.979,"--to a city which has an area that is a social unit, all of which is black, and perhaps the blackness has something to do with the social unit of it, that being lumped together, would you?"
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,3314.979,3315.8,"No, not at all."
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3316.301,3320.433,"Well then, why isn't the fact that they typically vote together sufficient?"
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,3320.433,3322.896,--Because that is the racial stereotyping.
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3323.916,3326.827,"You mean, it's a stereotype if it's a social affinity--"
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,3326.827,3327.297,"--No, no, no."
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3327.297,3332.5,"--I mean, a stereotype if it's a political affinity but not a stereotype if it's a social affinity?"
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,3332.5,3333.421,The question--
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3333.421,3339.175,And why then doesn't... wouldn't proof that they in fact have a social affinity overcome the presumption?
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,3339.175,3343.739,"--These are always going to be difficult factual questions, but it's a different issue."
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3352.405,3353.404,We can take judicial notice of that.
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,3353.404,3353.785,Right.
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3353.785,3359.479,"But we can't take similar judicial notice whenever the characteristic is a racial characteristic, is that it?"
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,3359.479,3363.902,"Race is different, and it's not just race, it is suspect classifications."
1994.94-558,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3363.902,3366.614,So normally race is different because it's normally totally irrelevant to the decision.
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,3375.278,3385.434,"Well, race comes into play in lots of decisions that are made in society which are subject to the Arlington Heights analysis."
1994.94-558,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3439.28,3482.608,"Mr. Warren, when you speak about difficult decisions, one of the many problems in this case is when you deal with Shaw v. Reno, when you've got one criterion, bizarreness, and that's not hard to apply, but to determine predominant, substantial, and it can spread to other groups, national origin groups that have been classified as suspect, it seems you're getting... you're opening the door to the kinds of challenges that the Federal courts were into of necessity in the school segregation cases and to a limited extent in the redistricting cases."
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,3489.754,3491.905,"Your Honor, I don't think it's difficult to contain."
1994.94-558,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3529.301,3530.322,"Thank you... your time has expired, Mr. Warren."
1994.94-558,2,23434,edward_w_warren,,3530.322,3530.693,--Thank you.
1994.94-558,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3530.693,3531.013,Thank you.
