1971.71-517,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,41.59,"We’ll hear arguments next in 71-517, Combs against the United States."
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,43.531,47.44,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.71-517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,169.126,175.764,"Let’s assume that the thief hides his goods in a checkroom, he just hides it there."
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,197.26,197.766,"No, Your Honor."
1971.71-517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,200.505,208.095,"Well, I know but they didn’t have permission from anybody to take the good and the Fourth Amendment protects those effects."
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,208.095,208.217,Yes sir.
1971.71-517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,208.217,209.269,"That’s your point, isn’t it?"
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,209.269,210.069,"Yes, sir."
1971.71-517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,210.069,228.683,"Well now, couldn’t it -- the Court could say, well we -- surely you have standing to object in the sense that they’re your goods but they’re has just been no violation of your Fourth Amendment rights because the police may seize stolen goods without violating anybody’s Fourth Amendment right?"
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,228.683,229.863,"Yes, sir."
1971.71-517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,233.352,234.5,"Well, he loses it."
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,234.5,236.913,"Yes, sir."
1971.71-517,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,236.913,240.67,"Now, how is your case different from that?"
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,240.67,250.121,"In our case, the goods were seized on a farm in Hazard, Kentucky where the goods were stored on the petitioner’s father’s farm."
1971.71-517,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,250.121,252.648,Was it the relationship that --
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,252.648,253.177,"No, sir."
1971.71-517,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,253.177,258.918,How is the son different from the checkroom that Mr. Justice White postulated?
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,258.918,265.146,"Well, we feel that to assert that – yes, this liquor did belong to me."
1971.71-517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,271.15,283.741,"Of course, he would’ve admit anything if the police got on the -- let’s assume that the police did not violate your client’s Fourth Amendment rights by entering the father’s property."
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,283.741,283.968,Yes sir.
1971.71-517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,283.968,291.657,"Let’s just assume that, and got to the shed, still they hadn’t validated his rights and then they saw the liquor."
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,291.657,291.988,Oh!
1971.71-517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,296.683,296.949,Oh!
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,314.594,315.029,"Yes, sir."
1971.71-517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,315.029,321.597,Would you say there was any violation in his Fourth Amendment rights in the pack of seizing the liquor?
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,321.597,327.499,"Your Honor, I would say that there are no violations of his rights at that point."
1971.71-517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,328.628,338.736,"But -- and all that you’re contending for here is you’re not able to make the argument that he ought to be able to have the chance of saying, my rights weren’t violated?"
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,338.736,349.672,"Your Honor, we feel that in this particular instance, the search warrant was and I think it’s conceded, it was not an adequate warrant, and we want to attack that."
1971.71-517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,349.672,351.233,"Well, I understand that."
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,351.233,352.57,"Yes, sir."
1971.71-517,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,352.57,358.652,"But all you’re claiming is a basis for attacking the warrant is the claim of possession in the goods, isn’t it?"
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,364.967,369.017,We had an expectation of privacy and that’s why we concealed on this farm.
1971.71-517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,370.997,386.39,"In this case, were you denied the right to show that you had such an interest in the real property, that the entry onto the property violated your client’s rights."
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,386.39,391.286,"Your Honor, the issue of standing was not discussed at the trial court level."
1971.71-517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,404.05,418.403,"Well, so it’s never been tried out as to whether or not if the warrant was no good that your client’s Fourth Amendment rights were violated by entering the property."
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,418.403,419.334,I believe that’s right.
1971.71-517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,431.212,431.391,Oh!
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,432.476,433.314,"Yes, sir."
1971.71-517,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,433.314,446.833,"Supposing the -- supposing your client had planted the liquor on some farm of a complete stranger, would that case from your point of view been a -- different than this one?"
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,446.833,447.373,"No, Your Honor."
1971.71-517,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,457.278,468.663,"Suppose he drove out the country with the truck and had a bulldozer, and bulldozed a great, big hole on the ground, buried it and cover it over, and just we don’t know whose land it is?"
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,468.663,470.601,"Yes, sir."
1971.71-517,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,470.601,473.112,Expectation of privacy?
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,473.112,481.438,"Yes sir because in this instance, he hid them, he doesn’t want anybody to find them illustrating his intent to conceal them."
1971.71-517,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,484.561,491.55,"Well, what amendment honors and protects that kind of a claim of privacy, that kind of an expectation?"
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,491.55,496.375,"Well, we understand that the Fourth Amendment is a personal right and the --"
1971.71-517,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,496.375,501.004,Personal right to bury -- I’d stolen goods on somebody else’s land?
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,501.004,505.474,"Well, to be protected in your effects and your effects are the liquor that you’ve buried."
1971.71-517,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,505.474,508.365,"Of course, they aren’t his, by definition here?"
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,508.365,513.149,"Well, in the -- from the concept of property and ownership, the Court is correct."
1971.71-517,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,518.445,526.45,But I thought you’re arguing a minute ago that your principle contention was violation of the expectation of privacy on the farm.
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,534.286,539.727,"Yes, Your Honor, based on the idea that we were charged with possession."
1971.71-517,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,549.4,552.839,"Well, but the liquor was taken from you before this."
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,557.534,560.543,"Yes, sir."
1971.71-517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,560.543,571.291,I thought you’ve said that it was complete and appropriate example if the police could seize the stolen merchandise or the contraband without violating your Fourth Amendment right?
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,571.291,575.378,"Your Honor, maybe if I had the opportunity, I take that back."
1971.71-517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,575.378,578.841,Do you think that’s fatal?
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,578.841,581.819,"Your Honor, that question is a difficult imposed question."
1971.71-517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,593.726,593.826,Oh!
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,599.008,601.687,"In that case, I would say probably not."
1971.71-517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,601.687,602.534,Yes.
1971.71-517,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,602.534,609.234,"Suppose -- so that you’d have standing to lose the issue, to lose the point?"
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,609.234,616.532,"Yes, sir."
1971.71-517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,636.108,640.451,I thought that Simmons held that if whatever you said could not be used against you at the trial?
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,640.451,641.914,"Yes sir, that’s correct."
1971.71-517,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,708.057,725.328,"Well, wouldn’t you -- aren’t there some situations in which prior to the determination of the ultimate issue, the known possession of stolen property affords spaces for probable cause for either an arrest or a warrant?"
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,725.328,726.723,"Yes, sir."
1971.71-517,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,726.723,733.982,So that you sometimes do need to make a preliminary and tentative determination before trial?
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,733.982,738.755,"Yes sir, that’s the probable cause determination."
1971.71-517,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,738.755,744.446,"Is there anymore than that involved here, the probable cause to believe that he wasn’t entitled to the possession of this, probably?"
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,744.446,749.013,"Well, except to that at the pretrial hearing, he might come on and say, no, I’m not a thief."
1971.71-517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,758.907,762.532,"Was this the merchandise was not in tax statement, they’ve put this --?"
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,762.532,766.58,"Your Honor, the tax was properly paid, it was legitimate alcohol."
1971.71-517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,766.58,769.983,Was a question of being stolen?
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,769.983,774.687,"Your Honor, I think there was a question of whether it was stolen and who stole it."
1971.71-517,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,817.227,824.836,"As I understand it Mr. Perry, the Government has now conceded that the search warrant in this case was defective, insufficient, is that your understanding?"
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,824.836,826.957,"Yes, sir."
1971.71-517,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,826.957,846.612,"And also, since the question of standing was not even raised by the Government, the District Court level, you had no opportunity to show your client’s relationship to the premises where the liquor was seized, is that --?"
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,846.612,847.237,That’s correct Your Honor.
1971.71-517,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,847.237,848.072,Am I correct to that?
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,848.072,853.875,"We’d argue for a waiver of that point as a matter of fact, while the U.S. Government, we’re not raising it at a trial court level."
1971.71-517,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,853.875,854.871,It wasn’t raised at all?
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,854.871,857.125,"No, sir."
1971.71-517,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,857.125,865.113,Of course the reason that the Government might not had raised that I suppose is that they got a favorable ruling on the validity of the search warrant affidavit.
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,865.113,872.939,"Well, Your Honor, at the time they rested on the arguments at pre – at the pretrial motion to suppress, they did not know if it was going to be favorable or not."
1971.71-517,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,882.243,894.392,"You thought as they could’ve attack or sub-supported the validity of the warrant both on the sufficiency of the affidavit on the -- and on the absence of standing, is a too prong part of the same argument."
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,894.392,904.033,"Your Honor as a matter of fact, a little bit more on that point, if the affidavit in the search warrant had been adequate under Aguilar and Spinelli."
1971.71-517,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,919.753,926.347,Did the Government concede the insufficiency of the warrant in the -- before the Court of Appeals or --
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,926.347,929.383,"Yes, sir."
1971.71-517,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,929.383,931.909,And raised the question of standing for the first time there?
1971.71-517,0,32376,james_n_perry,,931.909,934.684,"Yes, sir."
1971.71-517,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,939.729,941.573,Mr. Reynolds.
1971.71-517,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,941.573,946.126,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.71-517,2,32376,james_n_perry,,2439.608,2440.214,"Nothing further, Your Honor."
