2004.02-1028,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.795,"We'll hear argument now in No. 02-1028, the Norfolk Southern Railway Company v. James N. Kirby."
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,10.857,12.965,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.02-1028,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,26.673,27.454,"Mr. Phillips, I'm glad you're doing that."
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,40.829,58.54,"Well, I think the primary reason under... with respect to the Hamburg Sud bill of lading is that that is incorporated into a tariff that's filed with the Federal Maritime Commission under the Shipping Act of 1984, and it's long been settled that the interpretation of tariff and obligations arising out of tariff filings are questions of Federal law."
2004.02-1028,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,72.658,78.331,Was... was the question waived by the respondent below?
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,81.657,96.889,"Well, we... the parties clearly litigated this issue from... essentially from day one as a question of Federal law, and I think you could, in fact, simply accept that as the case comes to the Court without resolving the question of whether Federal or State law--"
2004.02-1028,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,96.889,103.167,"Well, the difficulty with that was we would be deciding a highly hypothetical case without knowing that Federal law governed."
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,103.167,124.753,"--Well, it's... it's not as hypothetical as it might be in some contexts because it's absolutely clear that there are going to be lots of instances in which ocean-based carriers are going to be issuing bills of lading and which... and which the responsibilities or duties that arise out of those bills of lading, as they apply against the actual owner in operating against the freight forwarder, are going to arise, and there's not going to be any serious question in that context."
2004.02-1028,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,126.694,138.128,"I... I want you... I think the whole bench wants you... to talk about State versus Federal, but as just one preliminary question... I don't mean to... if it's State law, do we know what the answer is?"
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,142.298,143.374,"Well, I'm quite sure--"
2004.02-1028,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,143.374,144.117,--Alabama law applies.
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,146.612,147.605,"--No, it's not clear at all."
2004.02-1028,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,150.372,150.743,I was afraid that would be your answer.
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,150.743,152.146,I apologize.
2004.02-1028,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,224.859,227.338,What about the question of Federal... Federal or State law?
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,227.338,239.105,"--Well, I... I think that on the Hamburg Sud bill, again the easy way to answer that is it's incorporated into a tariff, and if it's incorporated into a tariff, that means it's a question of Federal law."
2004.02-1028,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,239.105,242.836,But it is not necessarily true that the law that applies to the second bill of lading also applies to the first.
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,242.836,245.065,It wouldn't necessarily be the same.
2004.02-1028,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,251.531,251.903,"Well, is--"
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,251.903,255.33,--but it's absolutely clear that the first bill of lading ought to be interpreted as a matter of Federal law.
2004.02-1028,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,255.33,265.444,"--Is... is your argument that if you don't interpret the second one under Federal law, you're, in effect, going to undercut the significance or the... the efficacy of Federal law in interpreting the... the first, the... the Hamburg Sud?"
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,265.444,276.59,"I don't think it necessarily undermines the efficacy of the... of the Federal uniformity of the Hamburg Sud bill because if you enforce that one, then the second one in some respects becomes irrelevant."
2004.02-1028,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,276.59,276.961,Yes.
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,277.499,279.318,But... but I do think it... it interferes with--
2004.02-1028,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,279.318,280.721,--is going to be different in another case.
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,280.721,289.554,"--It might be different in another case, and I do think it obviously interferes with the kind of uniformity you would ordinarily expect when you're dealing with essentially maritime commerce."
2004.02-1028,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,289.554,317.668,"Mr. Phillips, I hope maybe you make... you're going to make this point later, but it seems to me it's very important which contract controls because the Government has made an argument, as you know, that the COGSA limit, the $500 per package, would not apply under the ICC contract, that the number there would be $450,000."
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,337.935,344.167,I want to be clear that obviously in our view the... there's no question about the Hamburg Sud bill.
2004.02-1028,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,397.999,399.114,So what's your view of that?
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,407.742,409.478,There's no question that that--
2004.02-1028,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,409.478,409.666,All right.
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,415.96,431.397,"--Well, in the... in the appendix to the petition, you'll find both the district court and the court of appeals orders granting interlocutory review, and they are very explicit in identifying the $500 COGSA limit as the justification by which the parties decided to take the case on an interlocutory basis."
2004.02-1028,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,484.691,490.014,"But now, for instance, we... we do not accept stipulations on questions of law."
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,497.527,500.499,--Are you talking about on... on the question of whether Federal law--
2004.02-1028,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,500.499,500.615,Yes.
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,500.615,501.708,--or State applies?
2004.02-1028,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,590.483,592.712,That was before Erie against Tompkins.
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,592.712,597.542,"Well, I understand that, and... and all I'm saying is what is the Federal rule."
2004.02-1028,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,659.093,664.415,"Now, what is the significance, if any, of COGSA in... in your analysis in coming to that conclusion?"
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,666.523,677.025,I don't think COGSA directly affects that particular analysis other than by enforcing the bill of lading.
2004.02-1028,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,682.392,684.993,"If you didn't have the prior cases, what would the significance of COGSA be?"
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,684.993,699.194,"Well, COGSA says that there are $500 limits on the bill of lading, but it doesn't necessarily tell you the question of what's the relationship between the owner or the freight forwarder and the... and the ocean carrier in this particular case."
2004.02-1028,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,699.194,708.293,What is... what is the efficacy of the COGSA limit if... if in fact the... the tariff is... the bill of lading is not enforced as a matter of Federal law?
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,708.293,713.19,"Then COGSA has no role at all, which is why it's very important, if COGSA is to have a meaningful--"
2004.02-1028,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,713.19,715.131,That's... that's what I was trying to get at.
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,715.503,716.618,--I was trying to get there too.
2004.02-1028,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,716.618,716.768,"--Yes, okay."
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,716.768,717.915,But I was getting there pretty slow.
2004.02-1028,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,718.37,718.62,What about--
2004.02-1028,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,718.62,723.737,"If I understand it, you'd say COGSA doesn't give you the substantive answer, but COGSA makes it a Federal question."
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,723.737,725.057,"COGSA, yes."
2004.02-1028,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,730.509,731.418,--Why is it?
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,731.418,732.904,--ultimately you'd say the maritime statute makes--
2004.02-1028,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,732.904,733.276,Why is it?
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,781.535,782.716,--Right.
2004.02-1028,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,782.716,787.851,And the... Mr. Shipper wants to sue one of these carriers.
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,835.793,839.946,I think there are three theories that have been put forward in the past.
2004.02-1028,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,860.63,861.66,I agree it's very unreasonable.
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,870.039,887.462,"--Well, the legal basis is that because the carrier is obliged to take the goods and cannot discriminate, that he has no choice but to accept the person, and that the courts are not going to impose an obligation on him to look behind who shows up with the goods in order to determine the rights or obligations of the... of the--"
2004.02-1028,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,887.462,889.486,Is that the first of your three... you said there are three... three theories.
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,889.486,890.562,"--Yes, that's the first of my three theories."
2004.02-1028,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,890.562,890.734,All right.
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,891.189,895.609,"The... the second one is a bailment theory, and we... we spent a little bit of time on that in the reply brief."
2004.02-1028,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,955.917,958.6,One... one brief does take quite a clear position on this.
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,978.951,988.572,"As I... as I recall the way that amicus brief reads, it's a little cagier than that because it says of the law that we have evaluated in this brief, nowhere else."
2004.02-1028,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1006.693,1009.127,May I ask you a question that just troubles me as I read all the papers?
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1011.273,1012.638,Yes.
2004.02-1028,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1013.957,1015.693,It was sued in Australia.
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1015.693,1016.315,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.02-1028,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1016.315,1018.005,And for the maximum... what--
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1018.005,1019.491,"It was settled, so I don't know."
2004.02-1028,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1019.491,1020.4,--Okay.
2004.02-1028,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1020.4,1021.31,"I mean, they made the... the full claim."
2004.02-1028,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1024.199,1025.435,"Very well, Mr. Phillips."
2004.02-1028,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1027.459,1036.664,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.02-1028,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1076.416,1089.686,"Yes, but I think we would have some reservation about... excuse me... about deciding a case where one of the principal points in issue was simply assumed rather than decided."
2004.02-1028,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1089.686,1107.707,"Well, first of all, Your Honor, with respect to the Hamburg Sud bill of lading, as we've argued in our brief, that is unquestionably covered by Federal law because of the application of the Shipping Act and the tariff regime and the nondiscrimination principle that requires enforcement of the terms of the bill of lading, which is incorporated into the tariff."
2004.02-1028,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1128.717,1132.804,Suppose there had been... been no agreement by the parties.
2004.02-1028,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1139.946,1149.688,"--Your Honor, that's an open question, and we've argued in our supplemental brief that it would be appropriate, if the Court felt it necessary to address that question."
2004.02-1028,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1205.788,1214.045,"What... what if the overseas... this maritime part of the shipping was 500 miles and the land part was 2,000 miles?"
2004.02-1028,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1214.045,1219.208,"Well, we think it would be... we think it would be inappropriate to do a mileage analysis."
2004.02-1028,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1221.975,1224.288,"Well, I'm asking you to do a mileage analysis."
2004.02-1028,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1224.288,1244.926,"--Well, we would submit that it... it would be inappropriate to adopt a rule in which the... the applicability of Federal law depends on the relative mileage because that would create uncertainty and confusion, although here, if one were to apply such a rule, it would suggest application of Federal maritime law, given the distance, more than 10,000 miles versus 366 miles."
2004.02-1028,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1244.926,1248.724,"You're talking not my hypothetical, but about the facts of this case."
2004.02-1028,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1248.724,1249.756,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2004.02-1028,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1249.756,1255.988,"I said, you're not talking about the 500 miles ocean/2,000 miles land."
2004.02-1028,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1258.468,1258.923,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.02-1028,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1294.96,1297.106,Would you just clarify one thing for me?
2004.02-1028,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1314.733,1316.508,"--Yes, it would because in that--"
2004.02-1028,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1316.508,1320.595,And then if... would the rate be different in that instance?
2004.02-1028,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1320.595,1327.615,"--Well, it would be if it... a through rate... by definition, if you have a through bill, you have a through rate."
2004.02-1028,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1330.753,1335.916,I'm trying to find out whether the railroad would have a different liability under my hypothetical.
2004.02-1028,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1338.638,1346.607,"--The record doesn't reveal that, but... but it would have been a different negotiation obviously, subject to different terms, and it seems likely that the rate would have been different."
2004.02-1028,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1362.127,1372.075,Should we assume that the railroad probably gave a special bargain to the shipper in this case because it had a lesser exposure for liability?
2004.02-1028,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1372.075,1373.849,"--Yes, that seems appropriate to assume."
2004.02-1028,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1397.588,1402.622,"But the record doesn't actually tell us whether the rate was, in fact, different than it otherwise would have been."
2004.02-1028,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1402.622,1403.16,--That's correct.
2004.02-1028,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1403.16,1409.226,"Mr. Hungar, the railroad industry has been deregulated."
2004.02-1028,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1420.25,1425.046,"Justice O'Connor, the railroad industry has been deregulated, but the shipping industry has not."
2004.02-1028,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1455.339,1455.915,Thank you.
2004.02-1028,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1455.915,1468.425,"The tariff... with respect to, Mr. Chief Justice, your question about Great Northern, Great Northern, although decided pre-Erie, is not a... it was not decided under diversity jurisdiction."
2004.02-1028,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1508.65,1510.696,And might not that have been a matter of contract law?
2004.02-1028,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1510.696,1529.272,"No, Your Honor, because it's very... it's very clear that... that tariff rates are enforceable... federally filed or federally published tariff rates are enforceable as a matter of Federal law, and liability limits are part of that, as this Court said in precedents that the... that are cited in the petitioner's brief."
2004.02-1028,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1536.702,1547.726,Is it clear that they're applicable... the tariff as a matter of law... to a shipper that hires an independent freight forwarder to arrange for the shipment?
2004.02-1028,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1547.726,1550.698,"Well, that's exactly the facts in Great Northern."
2004.02-1028,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1550.698,1551.07,Okay.
2004.02-1028,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1551.07,1567.128,"In Great Northern, the shipper hired the Boyd Transfer Company to... to ship the goods, which in turn hired the railroad, and then the shipper tried to sue the railroad, and the Court said you can't do that and... and clearly relied, at least in part, on the tariff regime, as well as the... the whole history of... of the Federal common carrier law."
2004.02-1028,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1567.128,1583.846,Does it make any difference that we have this division between freight forwarders who act as agent for the cargo owner and the so-called NVOCC that... that act as principal vis-a-vis the ocean carrier?
2004.02-1028,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1583.846,1584.589,"No, Your Honor."
2004.02-1028,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1623.393,1625.456,"Thank you, Mr. Hungar."
2004.02-1028,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1627.647,1638.709,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.02-1028,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1725.15,1733.695,Can you point to the record anyplace where you took the position below that Federal law could not and did not apply?
2004.02-1028,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1733.695,1734.15,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.02-1028,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1737.51,1743.354,"Well, why shouldn't we just say you both assumed it was going to be decided under Federal law?"
2004.02-1028,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1743.354,1752.355,"This Court would be making precedent, Your Honor, on the basis of the wrong legal theory for what substantive law controls."
2004.02-1028,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1754.872,1761.726,"Well, now, the parties presumably could agree among themselves in the contract what law to apply."
2004.02-1028,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1761.726,1764.698,"--True, Your Honor, but that isn't--"
2004.02-1028,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1764.698,1769.489,So is it a step to say they can implicitly agree the same thing?
2004.02-1028,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1769.489,1772.5,"--Well, that... there's no agreement here, and that's our point."
2004.02-1028,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1772.5,1773.326,There's no objection.
2004.02-1028,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1773.326,1775.101,We're objecting now.
2004.02-1028,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1775.101,1776.92,"Yes, but it's a little late."
2004.02-1028,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1776.92,1781.788,"It's not late, Your Honor, because the... the question here... this is a diversity case."
2004.02-1028,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1798.606,1803.352,"Mr. Frederick, there are diversity cases in which Federal maritime law has applied."
2004.02-1028,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1803.352,1803.958,That's true.
2004.02-1028,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1803.958,1811.017,"So it doesn't follow like the night, the day, that because it's brought under the heading of diversity, that therefore State law applies."
2004.02-1028,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1811.017,1818.075,"That's true, Justice Ginsburg, and that's why it's important that you understand what their theory is for applying Federal maritime law."
2004.02-1028,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1896.094,1906.83,"Where does that... I mean, and... and assuming from that, that it follows that this isn't Federal jurisdiction and so on... Federal rule, where does that leave the... sort of the... the carrier in the middle?"
2004.02-1028,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1923.465,1927.923,"Justice Souter, our position is that this is simply a matter of contract interpretation."
2004.02-1028,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1936.718,1949.1,"Well, it's... it's a matter of contract interpretation, but the... the significance for... for an understanding of the contract liability, which the shipper in the middle is undertaking, may be enormous."
2004.02-1028,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1965.612,1973.62,The carrier has uniformly been... the... the issue is a question of contract interpretation.
2004.02-1028,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1995.668,1996.616,But... but that's... that's not--
2004.02-1028,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1996.616,1998.64,I'm not following.
2004.02-1028,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1998.64,1999.012,--No.
2004.02-1028,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1999.012,2001.778,I'm not sure it's... it's just a matter of contract interpretation.
2004.02-1028,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2016.101,2022.667,"--Well, respectfully, yes, it is, Justice Scalia, because you have to look at who was within the clause."
2004.02-1028,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2097.919,2108.61,But the Jenson line may make real sense in... in its application to intermodal bills of lading like this which occur all the time.
2004.02-1028,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2130.779,2139.074,"--Justice O'Connor, if Congress makes that decision, that's certainly an appropriate thing for discussion for legislation."
2004.02-1028,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2155.793,2156.33,Why not?
2004.02-1028,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2179.281,2179.941,No.
2004.02-1028,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2179.941,2180.563,Because?
2004.02-1028,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2180.563,2190.981,Because most of them have choice of law provisions that States respect and as did the ICC bill of lading which applied for the country's law of shipment to govern.
2004.02-1028,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2196.0,2200.187,Is there anything I can read that would help me decide if it really would be a mess or wouldn't be a mess?
2004.02-1028,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2200.187,2201.656,"--Well, yes."
2004.02-1028,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2229.065,2240.022,"If you're right, Mr. Frederick, that it's State law that controls, then why should we decide anything beyond that choice of law question?"
2004.02-1028,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2250.985,2262.381,"Well, the substantive answer, as I think Norfolk Southern has basically conceded on the agency point, there's no question that if... if that is decided as a matter of contract interpretation, we win."
2004.02-1028,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2265.725,2265.975,Whatever.
2004.02-1028,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3418.7,3422.226,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2004.02-1028,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3582.395,3584.335,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
