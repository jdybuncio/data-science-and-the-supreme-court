1979.79-421,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.267,"We will hear argument first this morning in three consolidated cases, Bryant v. Yellen, California v. Yellen, and Imperial Irrigation District v. Yellen."
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,19.11,23.491,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-421,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,29.2,32.467,"It is being distributed now, Mr. Ely."
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,32.467,65.941,"The primary question before the Court, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, is whether the Boulder Canyon Project Act, this Court's opinion in Arizona v. California, and its two decrees in that case require the Secretary of the Interior to deliver water in satisfaction of present perfected rights in excess of 160 acres per owner."
1979.79-421,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,180.574,181.912,Where was that determination?
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,181.912,189.957,"That is in this Court's decree of January 1979, in Arizona v. California."
1979.79-421,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,189.957,195.439,That is a supplemental decree that got around to specifying the perfected rights?
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,195.439,197.978,"That is correct, Mr. Justice White."
1979.79-421,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,258.779,266.638,"Mr. Ely, to whom did the perfected right run?"
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,267.827,268.159,Yes.
1979.79-421,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,290.321,294.774,What standing does state law have under the reclamation laws?
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,294.774,315.133,"The Bounder Canyon Project Act -- this Court's 1964 decree, I should say, defined present perfected rights as rights acquired under state law and perfected by the application of a specific quantity of water to a defined area of land by the effective date of the project act."
1979.79-421,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,518.355,529.441,"Well, they could deliver it if the land was in 160 -- all held by persons owning no more than 160 acres."
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,529.441,545.693,"If the equitable owner of the water right is compelled to sell, the effect, according to our opponents' brief it this the land carries with it no present perfected right."
1979.79-421,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,567.1,574.067,And under that approach it is a truism to say that the landowner could sell no water.
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,574.067,574.878,That is correct.
1979.79-421,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,599.793,602.813,"Mr. Ely, are you going to address the question of standing or is your colleague?"
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,602.813,607.271,"Yes, I will touch on that no doubt, and Mr. Bender will, too."
1979.79-421,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,608.732,611.669,It is your --
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,611.669,617.788,Judge Turrentine in the District Court decided against the United States.
1979.79-421,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,671.716,676.574,What was the folcrum by which that letter was published in the Congressional Record?
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,676.574,686.199,It was placed in the Congressional Record by Senator Nelson and I don't know the circumstances under which he came in possession of it.
1979.79-421,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,789.033,811.712,"Mr. Ely, do you regard this interpretation of the Secretary as the kind of interpretation described by Justice Jackson's opinion in Skidmore v. Swift Company, where the Secretary is not authorized specifically to make rules but is the one charged with administering the statute and follows an administrative practice?"
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,811.712,813.736,"Well, I would think so, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1979.79-421,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,956.381,969.138,"When Hellen and his group sought to intervene, did they make a commitment to buy or tender any money that obligated them in any way to buy?"
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,969.138,970.612,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.79-421,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,970.612,971.662,They just said --
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,971.662,980.036,"They said that they couldn't buy at $1,400 an acre, they expected to be able to buy at the lower price that the Secretary would set."
1979.79-421,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1000.148,1009.492,"Well, would not the owner confronted with that situation be also free to sell to anyone of his own choice over --"
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,1009.492,1010.722,The former owner?
1979.79-421,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1010.722,1013.046,"Well, the ones who had more than the 160 --"
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,1013.046,1015.678,He would be limited altogether to 160 acres.
1979.79-421,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1015.678,1019.669,"Yes, but could he sell the excess to anyone he wanted but not to Yellen?"
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,1019.669,1027.811,"Yes, he could, at desert land prices. There is no assurance at all that Dr. Yellen would be the lucky buyer."
1979.79-421,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1034.377,1039.698,Doesn't that have something to do with his standing to intervene in this case?
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,1039.698,1042.742,"Well, we think so, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.79-421,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1169.128,1189.278,"I suppose if we agreed with you on standing we would just vacate the judgment of the Ninth Circuit which would leave the District Court's judgment standing but a judgment that wouldn't bind anybody but -- it would bind the United States, but would it bind some other people who --"
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,1189.278,1191.678,"Well, it would bind the United States but I think it would be very --"
1979.79-421,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1191.678,1206.948,"If somebody else could convince the court that he had standing to challenge this holding, why, I suppose the judgment wouldn't bind him."
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,1206.948,1207.797,I suppose.
1979.79-421,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1209.931,1217.126,I suppose that somebody would look around for somebody like that since they would know what the attitude of the Ninth Circuit is.
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,1217.126,1219.127,I think you are probably right.
1979.79-421,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1230.706,1232.88,"Mr. Ely, one other question on standing."
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,1238.901,1240.81,"No, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1979.79-421,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1245.841,1251.427,So we have to assume that there will be voluntary sales at desert land prices in order to support standing?
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,1251.427,1269.06,"That is the assumption, yes, and this means that a man on the day before the Project Act took effect, June 24, 1929, who had a 480-acre farm would wake up two days later and discover that he had water rights for 160 acres."
1979.79-421,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1283.918,1289.579,"Mr. Ely, do you concede that a different rule prevail in the other valley?"
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,1289.579,1291.942,"Coachella, yes, sir."
1979.79-421,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1307.258,1309.441,They just came in and bought some water.
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,1311.061,1314.224,"Well, they --"
1979.79-421,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1314.224,1316.898,"They didn't come in and say we have rights to water, they just came in and bought some water."
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,1316.898,1318.122,That's correct.
1979.79-421,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1370.274,1399.245,"Mr. Ely, again the United States isn't suggesting that the water -- if the irrigation district just refused to deliver water to anybody who owns more than 160 acres but then sales took place, the irrigation district would have the water to delivery to anybody who owns 160 acres?"
1979.79-421,0,37089,northcutt_ely,,1399.245,1399.69,Yes.
1979.79-421,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1437.76,1439.229,Mr. Bender.
1979.79-421,1,18396,charles_w_bender,,1439.229,1444.07,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-421,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1634.601,1655.29,"Counsel, there is the general rule that if the administrative construction is totally wrong, the government is not estopped in the way an ordinary party is by a long -- even a fairly long history of wrong construction if the courts determine that it was just flatly wrong."
1979.79-421,1,18396,charles_w_bender,,1655.29,1671.453,"That's correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but the premise of that rule, it seems to me, is that the court will uphold the status quo unless the matter is free from doubt, unless there can be no reasoned argument in support of the status quo."
1979.79-421,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1671.453,1680.29,So you say that in effect Secretary Wilbur's letter is a permissible construction of the statute even though perhaps not the only one?
1979.79-421,1,18396,charles_w_bender,,1680.29,1697.52,"That is right, and it is permissible because of the language of the statute, because of what transpired in Congress when Reclamation Commissioner Mead said acreage limitation would not apply, because of what happened in Congress when Congressman Swing said acreage limitation would not apply."
1979.79-421,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1938.308,1942.403,Is Mr. Nilson typical of the owners?
1979.79-421,1,18396,charles_w_bender,,1942.403,1944.36,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-421,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1965.352,1970.454,"Well, are the nine typical of the owners who would be benefited if you prevail here?"
1979.79-421,1,18396,charles_w_bender,,1970.454,1979.871,"Yes, Your Honor, they represent a class and there are approximately, according to the record, a stipulated fact, 800 such ownerships."
1979.79-421,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2091.708,2093.516,Is Lake Mead named after him?
1979.79-421,1,18396,charles_w_bender,,2093.516,2095.775,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-421,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2280.971,2290.488,"What was the occasion, do you know, for the reexamination of the question in the Department of the Interior in 1964?"
1979.79-421,1,18396,charles_w_bender,,2290.488,2329.263,"The occasion arose in 1964 hearings, in April, from Associate Solicitor Weinberg and the Secretary were before Congress, a Senate committee on Irrigation, considering a plan which called for use of 1.3 million acre-feet of Colorado river water in Arizona and the bringing of water from the northwest into California to replace that, and Senator Kuchel asked what law would apply to that new water brought in from the northwest."
1979.79-421,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2376.394,2388.653,"Well, I suppose that this Court has already twice heard opinions from the Solicitor General about this matter, hasn't it?"
1979.79-421,1,18396,charles_w_bender,,2388.653,2399.665,"Yes, you heard about it in the footnote from Solicitor General Rankin's brief, you've heard about it from Solicitor General Griswold, and will hear about it from Solicitor General McCree."
1979.79-421,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2408.667,2411.389,"Solicitor General Rankin thought it was clear, didn't he?"
1979.79-421,1,18396,charles_w_bender,,2413.035,2415.063,"I'm not sure he asserted it, Your Honor."
1979.79-421,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2415.063,2417.685,"On one occasion he did, didn't he?"
1979.79-421,1,18396,charles_w_bender,,2417.685,2420.203,"One occasion is all that I am aware of, Your Honor."
1979.79-421,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2430.409,2436.588,Mr. Solicitor General.
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2436.588,2440.291,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-421,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2697.109,2712.42,And the water I take it that you say the land already had before the project is precisely the adjudicated protected right?
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2712.42,2715.847,"The adjudicated protected right, that's right, if the Court please."
1979.79-421,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2715.847,2726.489,And you say the value of that water would be attributed to the land that somebody would be required to sell?
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2726.489,2729.549,That is our reading of this requirement --
1979.79-421,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2729.549,2730.969,And you say that --
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2730.969,2736.217,-- which makes the windfall not as great.
1979.79-421,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2736.217,2742.001,Which also says that the landowner is entitled to the water.
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2742.001,2743.004,Not exactly.
1979.79-421,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2743.401,2746.724,"Well, he could sell it, he gets to sell it."
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2746.724,2754.191,But the land will be appraised according to its value as irrigated by that water.
1979.79-421,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2754.191,2760.989,So the water follows the land and the owner gets the value of the water.
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2765.53,2770.592,As it was irrigated under the Alamo Canal Project.
1979.79-421,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2770.592,2773.702,Which is a presently perfected right that was adjudicated.
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2773.702,2785.166,But the water that is received now is different from in many respects in the form and manner in which it is delivered from the water that was received earlier.
1979.79-421,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2785.166,2790.595,"But the amount that you are talking about is the presently perfected right, that was adjudicated."
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2790.595,2797.339,The presently perfected right is water to which the irrigation district is entitled.
1979.79-421,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2798.934,2804.966,And each owner is entitled to be paid for his share of it.
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2804.966,2818.808,Each owner is entitled to have his land appraised for the purpose of section 46 of the Omnibus Act according to its value before the Boulder Project was completed.
1979.79-421,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2818.808,2830.418,"The difference, General McCree, that you are referring to is basically efficiency and certainty of delivery of the water, rather than the creation of new water rights, isn't it?"
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2830.418,2840.467,"That's correct, and I think it is significant here to consider what happened before the Boulder Project was enacted."
1979.79-421,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2968.905,2997.509,"Mr. Solicitor General, suppose the irrigation district had title to all the land at the time that the Boulder Canyon Project Act was passed, at the time of the adjudication of the presently perfected rights, suppose all the land was in one ownership, you would not be taking the same position, I suppose?"
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2997.509,3000.671,I suppose we would take the same position based on the statute.
1979.79-421,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3000.671,3013.18,So it really doesn't make any difference that the land is in a variety of ownerships and that the perfected right was adjudicated to the district?
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3013.18,3019.028,"That's correct, the right is the right of the district and not the individual owners."
1979.79-421,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3019.028,3025.621,"Yes, but it doesn't make any difference which one it is because you would take the same position even if it was all in one ownership."
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3025.621,3040.807,"Yes, because section 46 of the Omnibus Adjustment Act provided that no water should be delivered from a reclamation project to any single ownership exceeding 160 acres."
1979.79-421,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3040.807,3046.435,"And the district holds it as trustee for the various landowners, does it not?"
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3046.435,3048.491,This is our understanding of the law.
1979.79-421,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3048.491,3076.196,"Mr. Solicitor General, suppose a man now had 640 acres and before this case is decided he sells three tracts of 160 each to three qualified eligible purchasers that leases back all of the land sold and continues his operation as before, would that be permissible?"
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3076.196,3093.894,"Where there is -- Mr. Chief Justice, the statute provides -- this is section 46 of the Omnibus Adjustment Act -- that upon proof of fraudulent representation the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to cancel water rights."
1979.79-421,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3095.269,3108.647,"My hypothetical is that there is no fraud, he sells it to three different owners each of whom will have 160 and each of them leases back to him on a legitimate lease --"
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3108.647,3110.605,I want to think about that.
1979.79-421,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3163.832,3177.795,"But how do we know that some subsequent Secretary won't come along and say, just as Secretary Udall did, that this thirty-year construction of the act is wrong and we're now going to change it?"
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3177.795,3207.379,"We have this assurance, that after the breakup of the excess acreage and after more than one-half or at least one-half of the project works have been paid for, the price limitation does not apply to subsequent sales of the property and the statute so provides also in section 46 of the Omnibus Adjustment Act of 1926."
1979.79-421,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3207.379,3226.412,"Well, my hypothetical, part of the assumption is that it is a legitimate transaction, all on top of the table, he could lease back, the one person could lease back three other 160-acre tracts from his vendee."
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3226.412,3229.254,"Well, I know of no prohibition against that."
1979.79-421,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3233.302,3235.286,Would that be a matter for the Secretary to --
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3235.286,3241.03,"That would be a matter for the Secretary to handle, as we understand."
1979.79-421,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3241.03,3264.796,"Let me ask you, Mr. McCree, as to the government's understanding of the meaning of section 46, do I correctly understand that it is your view that the Secretary of the Interior did not have, by reason of this statute did not have the legal authority to enter into a contract with the Imperial District, the contract itself should not have been entered into at all?"
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3264.796,3266.828,"No, it is not our position."
1979.79-421,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3279.065,3280.085,But it didn't.
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3280.085,3280.856,It did not.
1979.79-421,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3280.856,3289.788,"Doesn't the statute, in your reading of it, flatly prohibit the contracts that he made that says no water shall be delivered, and so forth?"
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3289.788,3298.476,"Well, it doesn't prohibit the making of the contract, but it would prohibit the delivery of the water pursuant to such a contract, that's correct."
1979.79-421,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3298.476,3310.292,So it isn't merely the Wilbur letter but it is the fact that they have been delivering water pursuant to an understanding of the statute with which you disagree for all these years?
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3310.292,3313.777,Since the project began in the early 1930's.
1979.79-421,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3313.777,3326.615,"And really the case would be precisely the same even if Mr. Wilbur had never written the letter, because you would still have the position taken by the government of the United States on which everybody acted because of their reading of the statute."
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3326.615,3334.777,But an effort was subsequently made to have the contract amended to conform with the statute.
1979.79-421,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3334.777,3335.913,"Now, when was that?"
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3335.913,3342.235,"This was first about 1964, I believe, efforts were made to have the contract reformed to comply with the statute."
1979.79-421,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3342.235,3345.655,"Yes, I understand that, but from --"
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3345.655,3360.397,"But from about 1931 until 1964, we submit that the administration of the waters from this Boulder Project was contrary to congressional authorization and direction."
1979.79-421,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3360.397,3363.179,But the government wants to keep the money that was paid.
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3363.179,3364.497,Pardon me?
1979.79-421,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3364.497,3367.975,Wasn't money paid pursuant to this contract?
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3367.975,3370.478,The water was not paid for.
1979.79-421,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3370.478,3371.196,"No, but I --"
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3371.196,3397.44,"The irrigation district was required to pay for the construction of the All-American Canal, but the fact of the matter is the All-American Canal had several power drops along the way and the electricity that was generated in these power drops was attributed to its share of the cost of the project works."
1979.79-421,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3420.375,3430.873,Suppose the All-American Canal had been built before the Boulder Project and they had been using it and their water had been running through it --
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3430.873,3433.314,It could have been expressly --
1979.79-421,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3433.314,3436.73,The fact is that the district was entitled to the water.
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3436.73,3441.553,But it would have been expressly exempted.
1979.79-421,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3461.946,3469.47,But the government construction of the statute for thirty years was contrary to your present submission.
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3469.47,3476.5,"It was, there is no question about it, but we say it was wrong, it was contrary to the direction of the Congress."
1979.79-421,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3476.5,3492.745,"General McCree, you cite in your brief Justice Jackson's opinion for the Court in Skidmore Swift & Company about administrative construction, at page 140 of 323 U.S. in that case."
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3519.639,3530.04,"I don't think we have to characterize it that far, but we do say that it is contrary to the congressional direction."
1979.79-421,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3542.411,3552.325,"Thirty years of congressional inaction after Wilbur's letter is quite significant, isn't it?"
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3552.325,3568.892,"It is significant, but we still say that the remedy is in the Congress and not in the Court, and Judge Wallenberg, writing for the Ninth Circuit recognized that in the opinion below which we respectfully urge this Court to affirm."
1979.79-421,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3568.892,3590.379,"Mr. Solicitor, let's just assume for the moment that you agree that the statute could be construed, could reasonably be construed A or reasonably be construed B, and for thirty years it had been construed A but the government now preferred to construe it B, what would your position --"
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3590.379,3598.004,"If I make that assumption, I would agree I think with the conclusion that you would draw, but I don't make that assumption --"
1979.79-421,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3598.004,3598.575,Exactly.
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3599.397,3600.608,-- because the statute --
1979.79-421,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3600.608,3606.417,Do you think it is so clearly drawn that thirty years of error should be corrected?
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3606.417,3609.417,Should be corrected because there has been a --
1979.79-421,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3609.417,3612.941,"Sort of like the income tax, a hundred years of error."
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3614.934,3620.592,I don't find anything in the Omnibus Adjustment Act that gives me any encouragement in that area.
1979.79-421,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3620.592,3621.343,Thank you.
1979.79-421,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3621.343,3629.719,Thank you.
1979.79-421,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3629.719,3632.382,"Mr. Brunwasser, you may proceed."
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,3632.382,3635.936,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-421,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3695.91,3710.685,Is there something in the nature of a subsidy lurking in the windfall that was referred to earlier by the Solicitor General and others for the purchasers who acquire the property at a modest price?
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,3710.685,3733.703,"Mr. Chief Justice, Congress intended a subsidy and a windfall and Congress intended that that subsidy and that windfall go to small farmers because of a number of reasons which formed part of the fabric of legislation intended to protect small family farmers as developed in the amicus brief that has been filed in this Court."
1979.79-421,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3748.273,3767.635,"Would you disagree then with at least the Solicitor General's tentative response to my hypothetical that one individual, a bachelor, no wife, no children, could dispose of all of his acreage in excess of 160 and lease it back."
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,3771.355,3790.279,"Well, the answer to that question, Mr. Chief Justice, is this, there are proposed regulations to cover this very point which are set out in the appendix to the district's brief, and the Secretary of the Interior has proposed that there be a limit to the amount of acreage which may be leased."
1979.79-421,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3868.789,3872.384,What is the thrust of the pending legislation that you referred to?
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,3872.384,3884.631,"Number one, insofar as this case is concerned, it is to delete any applicability of the acreage limitation and the residency requirement of reclamation law to the Imperial Valley of California."
1979.79-421,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3927.716,3930.581,"And that has passed the Senate, did you say?"
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,3930.581,3951.263,"It did, in December of 1979, S. 14 passed the Senate -- I'm sorry, on September 14, 1979, it passed the Senate, I believe in fact last week hearings were held before the appropriate subcommittee of the House Interior Committee on that very legislation."
1979.79-421,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3951.263,3955.485,"If that passes, is that going to be the end of this problem?"
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,3955.485,3957.969,"That is the end of the ball game, Your Honor."
1979.79-421,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3958.748,3963.846,"Suppose it passed tomorrow, would the case just be moot?"
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,3963.846,3965.27,I think so.
1979.79-421,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3991.925,3994.619,"Where is the bill in the House, in the committee?"
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,3994.619,3995.029,Yes.
1979.79-421,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4000.335,4003.021,Does the House have its own bill or was the hearing on the Senate bill?
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4003.021,4009.158,"It is my understanding that the hearing is on the Senate bill, S. 14."
1979.79-421,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4072.476,4076.222,"Well, I hadn't understood that to be their precise contention, counsel."
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4105.073,4107.923,"Well, I think the argument is two-fold."
1979.79-421,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4133.041,4138.319,Secretary Wilbur wrote an opinion letter of about six pages.
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4138.319,4142.738,"Two and a half pages, Your Honor, the Wilbur opinion."
1979.79-421,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4142.738,4151.267,Perhaps I was reading a different -- in one appendix or the other it comprises several pages.
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4151.267,4164.808,"If I may correct Your Honor, that is a collection of documents which are appended to the opinion of former Solicitor Barry, and the Wilbur letter is about two and a half pages."
1979.79-421,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4164.808,4165.295,Okay.
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4167.859,4191.365,"But the short answer is, number one, if there is anything unfair or inequitable about enforcing congressional policy and seeing that the federal water subsidy is delivered to the people to whom it was intended is, as this Court indicated in Gerlach and Ivanhoe, the landowner should go to the Court of Claims."
1979.79-421,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4191.365,4201.62,"Well, you first have to determine what congressional policy was here, whether the acreage limitation was intended to apply to the Imperial Valley."
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4201.62,4202.583,Okay.
1979.79-421,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4375.443,4381.033,"Mr. Brunwasser, but you have an express administrative construction that went on for thirty years."
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4381.033,4385.673,An administrative construction which was wrong and --
1979.79-421,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4385.673,4422.648,"You say it was wrong, but it has to be absolutely totally wrong, as I understand the law, and if one reads Solicitor Barry's opinion as opposed to Secretary Wilbur's opinion, it seems to me that in the reference to the various land division opinions one construed vested rights more narrowly than the other."
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4426.513,4430.23,I respectfully disagree with Your Honor.
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4463.046,4511.726,"Suppose the All-American Canal had been guilt before the Boulder Dam Project was even thought of and they had a big on the Colorado and the Project Act comes along and they are going to preempt the headgate and so the Imperial Valley people say you must protect as in this, you must agree to deliver and they say we will they write in the Project Act that we will satisfy perfected rights and when the dam is built they contract to deliver to Imperial Valley the water that had previously been taken out through the All-American Canal."
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4515.056,4518.381,"I would have to have more details, Mr. Justice White."
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4539.759,4555.805,"What they did is they went to the government and said you are going to be taking our water and the government says no, we're not going to take your water, we're going to give it back to you, we are going to give it back to you when the project is built, you are going to be taking your water out of the project."
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4555.805,4558.873,In Your Honor trying to summarize what has happened in this case --
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4558.873,4562.156,"That is a hypothetical, a plain and simple question."
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4562.156,4580.171,"If the government says that and the government allows the previously delivered appropriated water to go through the federally financed canal, the acreage limitation must apply."
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4585.217,4594.506,"But if the All-American Canal had been built before and it was not financed by the project at all, in my example --"
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4594.506,4597.041,"Well, if there was no --"
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4597.041,4603.785,-- but nevertheless project water is delivered to the Imperial Valley through the All-American Canal.
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4603.785,4605.527,Through the privately financed canal?
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4605.527,4606.858,Yes.
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4606.858,4609.365,"Well, it is a matter of contract then."
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4611.109,4621.439,"Well, suppose the only contract that was made is the contract that was in this case and then the provisions of the statutes are precisely the same."
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4623.954,4632.122,"The distinction, Mr. Justice White, is that in the case at bar it is a federally constructed canal, the water --"
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4632.122,4634.616,"I understand that, but now how about my question."
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4639.23,4642.328,I don't think I would if it was a privately financed irrigation project.
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4642.328,4649.541,"Although the provisions of the contract, provisions of the statute, provisions of the Reclamation Act would be precisely the same."
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4649.541,4687.435,"Well, there is a case that comes close to the hypothetical, it deals with the San Louis Project in the Central Valley of California, where there is a dam and a reservoir which was constructed jointly by the United States and the State of California and there is a Solicitor's opinion by Solicitor Barry that the acreage limitation would not apply to the service area served by the state financed canal, even though the water in the jointly constructed reservoir comes from both places."
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4689.432,4701.799,"So you wouldn't be here making the argument if the All-American Canal had been privately financed, even though the contract would be exactly the same contract as present here and the acts would say exactly the same thing."
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4701.799,4711.006,"Well, of course, there wouldn't be that kind of contract because the contract is not only to deliver water, the contract is to construct the canal."
1979.79-421,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4720.609,4732.81,What about the land office decision in the Wright case that Secretary Wilbur relied upon which Solicitor Barry simply said is inapplicable here?
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4736.409,4739.649,I am not going to be able to respond in detail.
1979.79-421,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4746.104,4753.723,"Well, we are here deciding whether or not Secretary Wilbur's construction was a plausible or reasonable one."
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4764.828,4766.675,As I recall those cases --
1979.79-421,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4766.675,4769.474,That is part of the question we are answering here.
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4769.474,4774.977,"I understand these cases, the two lands cases discussed in the Wilbur letter."
1979.79-421,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4807.221,4830.781,"Well, I can understand that as a perfectly plausible reason if you are arguing a case to say no, the Wright opinion doesn't apply, but it doesn't seem to me that that means that the Wright opinion simply had no applicability whatever and that Secretary Wilbur was just almost out of his mind in citing it."
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4830.781,4853.559,"Well, according to Mr. Weinberg, Secretary Wilbur -- not to use that phraseology, but he was wrong because the practice had always been that when you bring in a federal project vested rights under state law do not exempt the landowners from the acreage limitation."
1979.79-421,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4931.965,4946.646,"Do you think, on the question of presently perfected rights, do you think the government could have charged the irrigation district, the Imperial Valley Irrigation District anything for the water?"
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4946.646,4948.663,Not under section 1.
1979.79-421,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4954.687,4957.744,Because it was a presently perfected right.
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4957.744,4968.723,"No, I don't agree that that is the reason because under Gerlach the government appropriated preexisting water, vested water rights under state law and there was a valid claim presented in the Court of Claims."
1979.79-421,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4968.723,4973.71,"Of course, this is a statutory -- the Project Act provided for --"
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4973.71,4975.059,For the exemption.
1979.79-421,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4975.059,4979.069,-- for observing presently perfected rights.
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4979.069,4981.299,"Yes, but as this Court said in Arizona --"
1979.79-421,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4981.299,4984.636,Would it have been inconsistent with that to charge for the water?
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4984.636,4985.357,I don't think so.
1979.79-421,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4985.357,4989.457,Would it have been inconsistent with that section to charge for the water?
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,4989.457,5004.578,"I don't believe so because it is one thing to deliver water, it is another thing to charge for it and this Court said very clearly in Arizona v. California that nothing in the compact purports to control any distribution of water within a state."
1979.79-421,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5073.411,5075.545,This is section 46 of the act?
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,5075.545,5077.942,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5215.485,5222.152,Do the qualifications of your clients to purchase depend at all on the price at which the land was offered?
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,5222.152,5224.176,"It doesn't, Your Honor, because they --"
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5224.176,5226.215,They can pay whatever price is asked?
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,5226.215,5231.738,"No -- well, the landowner does not have the right to set a price."
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5231.738,5233.863,We don't know yet what the price will be.
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,5233.863,5241.796,But we know it is going to be below market prices and we could use our common sense to anticipate that that is going to be pretty cheap for this kind of farm land.
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5249.199,5252.987,What would motivate a seller to sell at less than market price?
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,5252.987,5270.733,"Because the testimony in this record in answer to questions from their own counsel, the landowner said that there is no use for that land except farming, there is under two inches of rain a year, unless they wanted to raise rattlesnakes and rabbits."
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5270.733,5275.106,"Well, maybe they want to wait and see what the House of Representatives does with S. 14."
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,5275.106,5279.032,"Well, that may be but, you know, life is full of imponderables like that."
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5279.621,5283.989,Would you sell at about a fourth of market price if you owned the land?
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,5283.989,5323.265,"If I owned 14,000 acres, like Mr. Elmore, the typical Imperial Valley farmer that has been referred to by the petitioners and I had thousands of dollars worth of improvements in my land, as they claim they have, and I know that the law is determined by the Ninth Circuit and Tulare provides that the value of the improvements will be taken into consideration in setting the fair and reasonable X contract price, I would be very reluctant to sit back and let my 14,000 acres return to desert."
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5323.265,5331.401,What roughly in your judgment is the spread between the fair market value of the land with water and the price at which it will be sold per acre?
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,5332.224,5339.069,I don't know because we entered the case as intervenors and we didn't enter --
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5339.069,5346.222,But your standing depends on some opinion at least as to the likelihood of making purchase.
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,5346.222,5353.851,But the record to date shows that the value of land without the water is $25 to $50 an acre.
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5353.851,5354.435,Right.
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,5354.435,5359.33,"And the value with the water is $1,200 to $1,400 an acre."
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5359.33,5371.387,"What light does that shed on the question, my first question as to likelihood of an owner selling at the very reduced price when there is a statute or a bill pending in Congress which would restore the full value of the land?"
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,5371.387,5371.982,"Well, number one --"
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5371.982,5374.443,It has already passed one body of Congress.
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,5374.443,5384.74,"Number one, if the bill passes Congress, that is the end of the case, but I don't know that the Court may decide the case based upon the possibility that Congress may change the law."
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5421.385,5422.56,What are these improvements?
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,5423.74,5429.001,"They build ditches, they line the ditches to keep the water from seeping down too far."
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5439.147,5443.881,"Some of which, I suppose, would be retained on the 160-acre plots that they could retain."
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,5443.881,5449.558,"Well, if you want to engage in farming, you would, although there are ways where --"
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5449.558,5458.242,I take it your standing argument does -- at least I am correct to extent -- does depend on an assumption that the owners could sell at the reduced price.
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,5458.242,5460.315,A substantial number of them would.
1979.79-421,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5460.315,5461.947,Or maybe just one might be enough for you.
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,5461.947,5479.621,"Even one would be enough and I don't think it is necessary that we make the tender of $25 to $50 to Mr. Elmore, Mr. Chief Justice Burger, to ask him to refuse our offer for some of this rich farmland."
1979.79-421,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5482.413,5483.808,Your time has expired now.
1979.79-421,3,15633,arthur_brunwasser,,5483.808,5485.433,Thank you.
1979.79-421,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5485.433,5491.557,Do you have anything further?
1979.79-421,4,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,5491.557,5493.448,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-421,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5577.441,5578.47,"Thank you, gentlemen."
