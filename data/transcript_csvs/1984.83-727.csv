1984.83-727,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,110.821,"Mr. Attorney, General, I think you may proceed wherever you're ready."
1984.83-727,0,44135,w_j_michael_cody,,110.821,114.689,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-727,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,416.322,427.178,"I'd like to ask, General Cody, if an effects test is appropriate in this case."
1984.83-727,0,44135,w_j_michael_cody,,450.959,459.899,"Justice O'Connor, we do not believe that that would be the result, and it's the error we think that the court of appeals made."
1984.83-727,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,525.859,550.741,"Do you... do you agree that the case decided by this Court last term, Consolidated Bail v. Darrone, if that is the correct pronunciation, indicates that Congress incorporated into Section 504 an effects standard... in other words, the standard adopted by HHS regulations?"
1984.83-727,0,44135,w_j_michael_cody,,550.741,558.33,"Justice O'Connor, I do not believe that it did, and we... we have made an argument in our brief that--"
1984.83-727,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,558.33,562.132,"But there certainly is language to that effect in the opinion, isn't there?"
1984.83-727,0,44135,w_j_michael_cody,,562.132,563.898,"--Yes, there is, but I think the Darrone regulation--"
1984.83-727,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,563.898,567.017,"So was that just wrong, in your view?"
1984.83-727,0,44135,w_j_michael_cody,,567.017,567.484,--No.
1984.83-727,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,784.191,792.295,You... you say that... that you should win because there's no discrimination.
1984.83-727,0,44135,w_j_michael_cody,,800.451,802.403,"That's... that's right, Justice White."
1984.83-727,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,804.286,805.838,Isn't that just as good a way of putting it?
1984.83-727,0,44135,w_j_michael_cody,,805.838,807.64,--I think it's a better way of putting it.
1984.83-727,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,818.595,829.736,Mr. Bator.
1984.83-727,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,829.736,833.255,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-727,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1120.692,1121.242,Mr. Bator--
1984.83-727,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1121.242,1121.842,That's the very--
1984.83-727,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1121.842,1125.46,--Can I ask you one question you answer whenever it's convenient in your argument?
1984.83-727,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1133.983,1168.471,"--We feel, Your Honor, that insofar as the statute incorporates an impact test at all... a question which we, the government, has elided here... but on that assumption, assuming that no intentional discrimination needs to be proved, that a discriminatory impact within the meaning of 504 exists only if the effect of the practice adopted by the state bars the handicapped from equal access to or an equal opportunity to get the benefits of the program."
1984.83-727,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1172.775,1180.029,"When you say bars the handicapped, do you mean bars an individual handicapped person or the class of persons who fit the statutory definition of handicapped?"
1984.83-727,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1181.296,1182.312,"Well, I think either or--"
1984.83-727,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1182.312,1183.129,Because here it clearly seems--
1984.83-727,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1183.129,1183.696,--Either or both.
1984.83-727,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1195.637,1198.472,--Intentional or unintentional?
1984.83-727,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1198.472,1204.725,"--We are assuming that with that... with respect to that kind of practice, intention need not be shown."
1984.83-727,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1248.954,1249.873,May I just ask one... one other?
1984.83-727,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1252.023,1259.646,"--Equal opportunity to receive the benefits that Tennessee has provided, which is a given measure--"
1984.83-727,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1259.646,1260.212,"Well, that's... that's--"
1984.83-727,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1260.212,1261.081,--Of health care.
1984.83-727,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1261.081,1265.699,--It's not equal opportunity to get the health care they need.
1984.83-727,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1270.87,1274.889,"That form of words, Justice Stevens, makes the word ""opportunity"" totally inoperative."
1984.83-727,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1274.889,1280.024,"And if you say equal opportunity to get what they've offered, it seems to me you automatically win."
1984.83-727,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1280.024,1285.745,Equal opportunity to take what they've offered and that the federal government has chosen to subsidize.
1984.83-727,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1319.298,1320.898,Mr. Bonnyman.
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1320.898,1324.083,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-727,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1361.875,1367.794,How many days would it be required... would there be required to produce the result that you argue for?
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1367.794,1397.898,"Your Honor, I think the record is not... the record is not clear, but it suggests that an annual limit itself is problematic; that the... the evidence that was produced below suggests that... it doesn't just suggest; it is very clear that we were talking about a limitation that the State of Tennessee employs that very few other states employ, and that there are a range of other ways of defining the service."
1984.83-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1411.473,1431.804,"Mr. Bonnyman, I think General Cody and the Solicitor General take the position that if your position is sustained, any across-the-board reduction in hospital services would at least be subject to a prima facie finding and an individualized hearing in court as to whether it could be sustained."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1432.887,1434.839,"--I do not agree, Your Honor, and... and I think--"
1984.83-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1434.839,1435.189,Okay.
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1444.61,1444.926,--No.
1984.83-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1464.988,1469.291,"Well, when you say problematic, you mean bad under the Sixth Circuit's decision."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1469.291,1470.141,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1984.83-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1470.141,1477.563,"Now, would that be true if Tennessee imposed an initial limitation of 20 days for the first time if it had had no limitation before?"
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1477.563,1480.349,"I think that... I think that is... is true, Your Honor."
1984.83-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1494.34,1505.631,"Well, now, how... how about if... the court of appeals said, didn't it, that the... Tennessee could have gotten by with limiting the number of visits per year?"
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1505.631,1506.648,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1508.166,1508.482,Yes.
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1509.868,1510.651,No.
1984.83-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1516.022,1524.878,"Well, but I'm trying... I'm trying to find out from you exactly what the state might have done without having the court of appeals decide it if it had to go to court and sustain this on a hearing."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1527.763,1529.746,"That would not be problematic, Your Honor."
1984.83-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1534.834,1540.804,"Well, but... but the fact that many other states use... use it certainly wouldn't insulate it from the court of appeals' reasoning in this case."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1540.804,1546.606,"--No, Your Honor, but I think... I only point to the experience of other states to make the point that it is feasible."
1984.83-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1562.05,1566.769,"But that's true of any... any limit on days in the hospital, isn't it?"
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1566.769,1568.869,Any annual limit on the number of days in the hospital.
1984.83-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1575.356,1578.391,"Well, supposing we turn to number of days per admission."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1596.372,1605.227,"--Well, Your Honor, that may be why the Sixth Circuit said we had only established a prima facie case, and it ought to be remanded for that sort of justification, if it exists to be offered."
1984.83-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1605.227,1609.679,"Well, but, I... I'm not talking about the... the plan that Tennessee actually went with here."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1616.766,1618.018,With no limit on the number of admissions.
1984.83-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1618.018,1619.118,Yes.
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1619.118,1639.449,"Well, I think our point there is that if you look at the way... if you look at the expert testimony about the way the hospitals respond to these limits and the way the hospitals respond to these limits and the way Medicaid recipients gain admission to the hospital, that would afford access to hospitalization, as would the host of other alternatives used by other states."
1984.83-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1639.449,1648.637,But wouldn't it discriminate against some types of handicapped people who need fairly extensive stay in the hospital once they get admitted?
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1648.637,1662.445,"Well, the... the regulations, Your Honor, the HHS regulations on which we rely do not... and I think this is very important... do not, as the Solicitor General suggests we are arguing, guarantee an equal result."
1984.83-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1665.58,1668.968,"Well, then you reject that part of the court of appeals' opinion, I take it."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1668.968,1669.384,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-727,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1689.897,1693.333,"Well, doesn't that depend on how you define benefit?"
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1693.333,1694.433,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1984.83-727,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1694.433,1702.289,"Well, if you define the benefit as medical services, how can you prevail?"
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1702.289,1713.33,"Well, I think if you define it in terms of hospital services... and I think that's the correct way to define it, because that's the way the Medicaid Act defines it... the state, after all, is not free to go out and make up another definition."
1984.83-727,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1726.404,1727.155,Mr. Bonnyman?
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1727.155,1727.587,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-727,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1727.587,1730.189,Can I get back to the Chief Justice's question?
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1733.474,1753.305,"Your Honor, we would suggest on the record that there are probably... that this... this basic way of casting the coverage probably on the evidence adduced below... and again, that evidence may have changed with the changes in the program... that that particular way of casting the coverage is probably not acceptable under 504."
1984.83-727,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1756.174,1757.876,Let me be specific.
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1757.876,1758.376,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-727,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1758.376,1764.43,"Using the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, how many days?"
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1764.43,1769.565,We think that probably none of those days would be acceptable.
1984.83-727,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1769.565,1771.415,"Well, let me put it this way."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1780.437,1782.187,"No more days, Your Honor, because--"
1984.83-727,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1782.187,1783.639,"Well, what are you arguing about?"
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1783.639,1799.065,"--Well, what we are arguing about is that... that there are... and that's the whole problem with this particular method that Tennessee and... has chosen, because we are not asking for more days for the handicapped and the nonhandicapped."
1984.83-727,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1803.7,1804.217,Like what?
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1804.217,1805.319,--As well as in form.
1984.83-727,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1805.319,1806.019,Like what?
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1806.019,1807.219,"Like, for example--"
1984.83-727,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1807.219,1808.254,I mean in words.
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1810.873,1811.289,--It... it--
1984.83-727,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1811.289,1816.491,"Now, the handicapped person is entitled to blank days?"
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1816.491,1817.027,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.83-727,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1818.06,1824.446,The handicapped person is entitled to more consideration than another person?
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1824.446,1825.632,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.83-727,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1825.632,1835.754,"Well, what do you want the handicapped person to have that he doesn't already have, which according to the state is equal access?"
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1835.754,1836.788,"Well, according to the state--"
1984.83-727,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1836.788,1838.204,I'm not arguing that; that's what the state's arguing.
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1838.204,1839.604,--Right.
1984.83-727,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1856.88,1860.683,"Was that brought before the legislature, a committee or anybody?"
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1860.683,1861.5,--Pardon me?
1984.83-727,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1861.5,1867.937,Did the handicapped people appear before anybody when these rules were set up?
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1867.937,1882.864,"There was a duly constituted Medicaid advisory committee which was comprised of patients and representatives and consumers, and... and it roundly condemned this particular... this particular cutback, and the state legislature has said it makes no sense because of its impact on hospitals."
1984.83-727,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1882.864,1886.233,Did the state legislature hold hearings?
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1886.233,1887.501,"It did, Your Honor."
1984.83-727,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1887.501,1888.318,It did not hold hearings?
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1888.318,1894.739,"It did hold hearings after the fact, and... and we cite a legislative finding there that the effect of this particular way of cutting has been--"
1984.83-727,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1894.739,1906.629,Was there anything in the hearings that shows that the state intended to treat handicapped people differently from others?
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1908.164,1909.464,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.83-727,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1932.63,1936.499,"Well, what does burning crosses on the lawn got to do with medical treatment?"
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1936.499,1939.368,"Well, we would say in this case nothing, Your Honor."
1984.83-727,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1957.079,1973.957,"Well, even assuming an effects test is incorporated, that doesn't mean you necessarily prevail, because if the Solicitor General is correct, you don't look at the results; you look at the opportunity for a particular medical service."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,1973.957,1980.695,"Well, I... I think critical to the... to the Solicitor General's position are two fallacies."
1984.83-727,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2010.963,2019.653,"Well, you're equating the benefit with the particular advantages that one might gain from the benefit, and that's the point."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2024.355,2041.249,"Well, I think if you... if you adopt the Solicitor General's approach to impact tests, it's going to be very easy for any defendant in these case to resort to the tautology that the benefit, which is being distributed unequally, is whatever we define it to be."
1984.83-727,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2075.905,2084.761,Only in a generic sense perhaps by the fact that Congress encouraged states to provide some medical services available to all.
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2092.348,2103.906,"Well, it's clear that Congress did not mandate that they meet all of the needs of everyone, and... and that's why it's important to go back to our first concession from the moment the complaint was filed."
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2125.319,2129.123,"Mr. Bonnyman, may I ask you a question about the disparate impact?"
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2152.036,2152.655,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2158.057,2159.325,"It's primarily the latter, that if--"
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2159.325,2159.959,"--That, in other words--"
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2159.959,2166.896,"--If a nonhandicapped person and a handicapped person both have pneumonia, the handicapped person may need to stay in the hospital longer than the--"
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2166.896,2180.973,"--May have to stay longer and... but more importantly, given the fact that what we're concerned about is simply getting access to the hospital to begin with, he is more likely to have been in the hospital previously within the fiscal year so that he's already exhausted the state's--"
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2180.973,2183.441,--But perhaps possibly for some other ailment then.
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2183.441,2184.558,--Or the same one.
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2188.512,2193.982,"But, see, if it's for some other ailment, then you'd really be in the other branch of my hypothetical."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2193.982,2194.615,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2194.615,2204.254,"I mean if you're suggesting... I mean if... if your theory is that handicapped people as a class are more apt to need hospital care, I don't see how you can possibly lose the case."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2204.254,2206.123,"Well, I... I don't--"
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2206.123,2206.856,Even if they go back for--
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2206.856,2213.627,"--Well, Your Honor, I think... I think that... that the way we can lose the case is if we go back on remand--"
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2213.627,2214.027,--Yes.
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2214.027,2220.114,"--And the state shows that there as no alternatives, as have been suggested here; there are no alternatives which won't have the same impact."
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2220.114,2224.252,No alternatives except giving the handicapped people say 28 days and the nonhandicapped 14.
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2224.252,2224.702,Right.
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2231.172,2231.789,You do concede that.
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2231.789,2232.79,--We concede that.
1984.83-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2235.309,2235.892,"Well, where--"
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2235.892,2237.475,On the evidence now before the Court it's gratuitous.
1984.83-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2237.475,2264.143,"--Where do you come up with this alternatives, because ordinarily I would have thought that if you... if the statute requires a showing of disparate impact, you show disparate impact, coming up with alternatives which might have been used and instead the state saying we have no alternative, then you say well, all right, then you're entitled to use this thing with disparate impact, that is not the kind of analysis we ordinarily engage in."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2288.025,2297.881,"Well, Your Honor, I think if you just analyze this in... in... in the way impact, disparate impact cases go, we have... we have gone beyond our initial burden."
1984.83-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2329.336,2350.582,"But what... what makes you think that the alternative you have proposed which, as I understand it, is a limit on the number of days per admission but no limit on the number of admissions per year, that some group of handicapped people, perhaps unknown to you, couldn't show that that discriminated against them, because once they got admitted they needed to stay longer than most people, than unhandicapped people?"
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2350.582,2361.807,"Well, I... I think if you look at the regulations and you look at our contentions, we are not talking about... we are... we're not talking again about degree; we're talking about kind."
1984.83-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2374.331,2380.269,But a limit on the number of days per admission would mean you're thrown out of the hospital at the end of six days.
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2380.269,2380.769,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2411.454,2412.588,And they'll keep you as long as you have to stay?
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2412.588,2413.24,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2413.24,2421.827,"Well, then, really when you say there is a way of doing it, it's a way of doing it because the hospitals don't enforce what you say they might be entitled to enforce."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2421.827,2422.196,Right.
1984.83-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2422.646,2424.446,So there really is... there really is no way of doing it.
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2424.446,2424.962,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.83-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2444.359,2455.167,"Well, but your suggestion that there is another limit that would have some bite to it, that would be acceptable, turns out on examination that the limit would have no bite to it at all."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2455.167,2456.367,I'm sorry.
1984.83-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2458.019,2459.385,"Well, you... you... you say well--"
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2459.385,2461.218,"--It would save the state the money, if that's what your concerned with."
1984.83-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2461.218,2476.494,"--Well, you say the state could have used a limitation on the number of days per admission, but then as I understand your response to questions, the... the reason that works is because the hospitals don't enforce the number of days limitation."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2476.494,2479.612,"Do not... once you're in the hospital, that is correct."
1984.83-727,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2495.491,2500.962,"Mr. Bonnyman, I'm still not 100 percent sure I understand your position."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2509.651,2513.035,"Well, we don't have evidence on that, Your Honor, because the way--"
1984.83-727,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2513.035,2514.785,Do you think it's a matter of evidence?
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2514.785,2515.804,--Pardon me?
1984.83-727,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2515.804,2518.287,I say would it turn on a matter of evidence?
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2518.287,2518.939,It does.
1984.83-727,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2518.939,2521.375,With respect to each claimant?
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2521.375,2521.775,No.
1984.83-727,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2540.603,2548.943,"So that if this case were here from Florida that provides 45 days, you'd still have to have a litigation?"
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2548.943,2550.895,"I... I don't know that, Your Honor."
1984.83-727,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2556.279,2556.881,Yes.
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2556.881,2561.916,"And that when we go back on remand, we're going to have to reassess."
1984.83-727,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2561.916,2571.022,"Well, is it correct then that your position is not focused on the fact that there was a reduction from 20 to 14 days?"
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2571.022,2577.795,"Well, I think again there... we... we did not have enough proof, I think, to challenge the 20 days."
1984.83-727,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2577.795,2578.128,"Yes, yes."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2581.813,2582.863,That's correct.
1984.83-727,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2585.032,2592.304,"Well, I was simply going to repeat my question as to whether or not the change makes any difference."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2594.47,2595.506,"I don't think it does, Your Honor."
1984.83-727,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2595.506,2596.589,Right.
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2596.589,2608.647,"I think this... and... there seems to be an inference to be drawn from the Solicitor General's position that somehow the... the annual limit was enshrined in the Medicaid Act, and that's a central fallacy."
1984.83-727,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2618.086,2627.942,"Mr. Bonnyman, could HHS by regulation impose a limitation on the state's authority to fix the number of days?"
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2627.942,2629.311,"--It can and it has, Your Honor."
1984.83-727,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2629.311,2630.077,It has?
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2630.077,2637.215,"Well, I mean it has... what it has said in the context of... it can do so in two ways."
1984.83-727,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2648.623,2651.307,Without regard to the number of days it may take of hospitalization?
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2651.307,2651.757,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-727,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2654.342,2659.663,"No, but does HHS have that authority under the statute?"
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2659.663,2660.746,I think it probably does.
1984.83-727,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2660.746,2663.031,But you say it has or has not?
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2663.031,2675.689,"Well, under... under the Medicaid Act it has not defined what would be minimally necessary in the number... in the amount of hospital services to satisfy the Medicaid Act."
1984.83-727,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2747.052,2752.273,Suppose a nonhandicapped person needed more than the allotted days.
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2755.208,2764.08,"No, Your Honor, because he's not... Congress... Congress has not chosen to... to protect that person."
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2777.388,2779.073,--May I ask you two questions?
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2798.701,2799.168,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2803.62,2806.655,84.4.
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2806.655,2807.638,84.4.
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2810.673,2811.94,(b)(4)?
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2811.94,2820.61,"--(a)(4), the section I just read, and then there is a separate provision... I'm sorry."
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2822.012,2822.529,You meant (b).
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2822.529,2833.786,"84.4(b)(4), and 84.4(b)(1) and then small Roman numeral iii."
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2833.786,2834.669,Okay.
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2834.669,2840.257,"And it says, ""You cannot provide a qualified""... that letter section that I had not read before..."
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2862.353,2867.738,"And my second question is, because I've never quite understood, as I understand it, the court of appeals ordered a remand."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2867.738,2868.257,That's correct.
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2868.257,2870.422,Let the other side have a chance to rebut your case.
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2873.641,2881.897,I think they could rebut our case by bringing in some of the proof that's been alluded to in some of the questions of showing that there are no alternatives that would not have a disparate--
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2881.897,2890.253,"In other words, you would say the statute or regulations would not be violated even if there is the kind of discrimination that you rely on as long as there's nothing they can do about it."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2890.253,2892.038,"--Right, exactly."
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2897.174,2900.459,"Well, you surely could avoid it by giving them a longer period in the hospital."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2901.528,2902.011,--Right.
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2917.771,2921.156,"--But if they prove they in fact would result in differential treatment, then you lose the case."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2921.156,2928.576,"Well, I think that gets into the question of... of how far do they clearly have some duty to accommodate."
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2928.576,2931.362,"Well, but that's quite a different answer than you gave me 30 seconds ago."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2931.362,2934.13,"Well, again, it... it involves anticipation of what--"
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2934.13,2935.13,"Well, which is your position?"
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2940.7,2943.55,"--There is an affirmative duty to accommodate, Your Honor."
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2944.435,2946.018,Then they can't possibly win the case.
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2946.018,2946.604,--Pardon me?
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2946.604,2947.954,Then they can't possibly win the case.
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2947.954,2955.71,"Well, let me just say that... that... that the Court has already said in Southeast Community College v. Davis that a fundamental change in the program--"
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2955.71,2956.376,"Well, maybe you're right."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2960.345,2978.889,"--There is a duty to accommodate, and let me just say that we are at the opposite poll from Southeast Community College v. Davis, because the proof on the record right now is that this... this impact is gratuitous in the sense that there are other alternatives which would not have this impact of barring people from the hospital, and they've offered no... no reason."
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2980.241,2988.514,"Well, maybe not have this impact, but I thought you were going to... you said they had to prove that their alternatives would not have any impact, any differential impact."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2988.514,2989.114,Well--
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2989.114,2990.197,If you base it--
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2990.197,2991.947,"--I'm... I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2991.947,2995.601,--I just don't really know what would happen on remand if we were to affirm.
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,2999.386,3019.883,"Well, what would happen or remand if our were to affirm, Your Honor, is that they would be able to come forward and refute our case, if they can, by putting on proof showing, a) that... and again, the first question is the... the record says that we're not moot, but we are muddled because there have been changes in the statistical evidence since then because of changes in the program."
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3038.575,3045.93,"Well, no, you say here there's a 5 percent disparate impact on the handicapped and 1 percent on the nonhandicapped, as I... the gross figure."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,3056.203,3061.024,"--Well, I think they would have to got with... with... with method which has, absent other factors, which has a lesser impact on the handicapped."
1984.83-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3061.024,3065.328,"Your time has expired now, counselor."
1984.83-727,2,24920,g_gordon_bonnyman_jr,,3065.328,3065.744,Thank you.
1984.83-727,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3065.744,3068.427,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Attorney General?"
1984.83-727,3,44135,w_j_michael_cody,,3068.427,3069.146,I do not.
