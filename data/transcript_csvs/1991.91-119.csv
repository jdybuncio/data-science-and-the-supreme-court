1991.91-119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.522,"We'll hear argument now in No. 91-119, the Wisconsin Department of Revenue v. William Wrigley, Jr., Co.--"
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,14.474,15.926,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,15.926,17.426,"Mr. Creeron, you may proceed."
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,17.426,20.913,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-119,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,130.467,132.651,Was that a unanimous opinion?
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,132.651,134.02,"Yes, it was."
1991.91-119,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,228.712,231.731,How long does it take for gum to get stale?
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,232.747,234.533,I do not know.
1991.91-119,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,234.533,235.816,It's 6 months.
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,240.453,249.876,The statute at issue is a minimum activity statute.
1991.91-119,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,311.183,313.135,"That was the only instance, wasn't it?"
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,313.135,319.705,"The only shipment of goods other than to the customer was to the warehouse and to its employees' homes, yes."
1991.91-119,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,319.705,322.657,That's the only warehousing instance that the record discloses?
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,322.657,328.061,"Yes, but that instance continued through all six of the tax years at issue."
1991.91-119,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,328.061,331.013,"Wasn't much of a warehousing, was it?"
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,331.013,335.899,"No, it was... they rented warehouse space, but gum isn't, and the space was not--"
1991.91-119,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,335.899,336.501,How large a space?
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,336.501,337.101,--Excuse me?
1991.91-119,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,337.101,338.517,How large a space?
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,338.517,347.873,"I do not know how large the space was, but I believe the record indicates that during this time period the annual cost was no more than $300 a month."
1991.91-119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,347.873,353.343,"When you say they did, I thought it was one salesman did, right?"
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,357.247,374.024,"Yes, the record clearly reflects that the regional manager in 1973 obtained permission from Wrigley to rent the warehouse, and was assured by Wrigley that he would in fact be reimbursed for those warehouse costs."
1991.91-119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,643.798,657.991,"Well, Mr. Creeron, I think Wrigley's in their brief say that even you, your side, the State, doesn't insist that it be only solicitation, only would you like to buy, period."
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,668.615,684.225,"We, the Wisconsin Department of Revenue, did not apply the narrowest test that is applied in some States, but it is our position that the activity must be part and parcel of the sales pitch."
1991.91-119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,692.064,699.885,"How about restocking the gum at the... you know, at the same call would you ask him to buy some more?"
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,699.885,702.67,--It's our position that you can't do that.
1991.91-119,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,709.859,721.75,"Well, it could be seen as part of the overall solicitation, saying this is the kind of service that we routinely perform and therefore you ought to deal with us."
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,721.75,726.821,"Well, the statute, first of all, only protects the sale of tangible personal property."
1991.91-119,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,730.023,731.823,"No, of course."
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,749.067,750.85,Not at all.
1991.91-119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,804.535,832.304,"Mr. Creeron, suppose you have a salesman who makes his presentation to the customer, the customer buys some gum, and then the customer says, but I'm telling you now, I'm not going to place another order unless you forward to the company and support these complaints that I have about the company... about the last shipment."
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,845.662,849.433,I don't believe that activity does come within our definition.
1991.91-119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,857.254,860.039,Meaning that it renders the company taxable?
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,860.039,860.506,Yes.
1991.91-119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,860.506,872.965,"But surely solicitation includes not just the first time you approach the company, but approaches thereafter to keep their sales going?"
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,872.965,873.631,Absolutely.
1991.91-119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,877.517,894.378,"And if you're back the third time, and the customer said I've really got these complaints about the first two batches that I bought, forward them to the manufacturer, the salesman cannot do that without going beyond solicitation in your view?"
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,894.378,903.484,"Again, it's our position that's a quality control service, and that that is... that is not part and parcel of the sales pitch."
1991.91-119,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,903.484,907.352,May I ask about the storage?
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,928.116,932.92,We absolutely do not recognize any de minimis exception.
1991.91-119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,973.931,975.247,Maybe Senator Byrd was wrong.
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,975.247,983.686,"He may have been, but if we look simply to the unambiguous language itself--"
1991.91-119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,983.686,984.819,xxx Byrd.
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,984.819,986.221,--Excuse me?
1991.91-119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,986.221,987.054,Senator Byrd.
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1001.614,1002.85,Well.
1991.91-119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1002.85,1004.983,So all you say is this is categorical.
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1010.52,1022.061,"The plain an unambiguous meaning of the term ""only"" means that, and it's our position, anyway, that Congress did not want a de minimis exception with respect to this particular statute."
1991.91-119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1033.118,1038.087,"I don't know another taxing statute that uses the word ""only"", do you?"
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1038.087,1039.439,Perhaps that's all the more reason--
1991.91-119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1039.439,1039.888,xxx then.
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1039.888,1042.891,--why this statute should not be construed to have de minimis exemption.
1991.91-119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1042.891,1053.033,"What if the salesman is seeking new customers, and he wants some samples."
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1081.116,1095.943,"If he gives the... a prospective customer samples, it would be our position that that would be permissible because it has no other purpose other than solicitation of orders."
1991.91-119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1100.596,1105.548,"Well, you got to put them somewhere, and your wife doesn't like them in your house."
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1117.456,1120.491,"--Well, first of all, that's not what happened here."
1991.91-119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1124.379,1125.295,It's what?
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1125.461,1126.561,--Replace stale product.
1991.91-119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1144.757,1147.374,"--Well, you can have a locker 2 feet square."
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1147.374,1157.766,"--If you're renting physical plant within a State, it's our position that that is not permissible with any unambiguous language of the statute."
1991.91-119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1157.766,1161.634,Can you pay a taxicab to carry these samples?
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1170.74,1172.706,"No, absolutely you can do that."
1991.91-119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1172.706,1173.789,"Well, why can you do it?"
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1187.899,1191.334,I didn't say that you couldn't carry them in a cab.
1991.91-119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1191.334,1193.869,"I know you didn't, but you ought to if you're going to say you can't put it in a locker."
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1194.785,1199.939,"I'm saying you can't put it in a warehouse, which is what happened here."
1991.91-119,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1199.939,1207.11,"Can you engage in activities to stimulate sales, since the ultimate purpose of doing that is of course to stimulate orders?"
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1207.11,1211.747,You can engage in the sales pitch itself.
1991.91-119,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1227.357,1239.498,"If the salesman arrives for the first time at a store and says we'll give you all of these posters to display in the store that advertise the virtues of the gum, pictures of the twins, and so on, is that impermissible?"
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1239.498,1241.231,"No, I believe you can do that."
1991.91-119,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1248.968,1258.157,What about renting newspaper space for advertising in local papers or renting radio time?
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1259.823,1273.166,"If the term ""solicitation"" is determined to... is given its ordinary and accepted meaning, then I believe that would be permissible."
1991.91-119,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1273.166,1277.201,What about a warehouse to store the posters in?
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1277.201,1280.236,"I don't... again, I don't think you can do that."
1991.91-119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1294.696,1295.763,But the cab's okay?
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1295.763,1296.346,--The cab's okay.
1991.91-119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1297.215,1300.15,If you just have them driven around constantly you'll be all right.
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1300.684,1314.326,"Probably an unlikely scenario, but transportation to and from the customer is a necessary consequence of solicitation."
1991.91-119,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1324.432,1336.073,Haven't you slipped pretty far down the slope when you let the... when you let the salesman go out and start renting or buying radio time and taking out newspaper ads?
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1358.938,1362.973,"Well, I don't know if I would look at it in those terms."
1991.91-119,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1381.685,1384.185,"I think that's what I was assuming in my question, yeah."
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1386.653,1388.005,--That is a problem.
1991.91-119,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1399.894,1400.913,I probably wasn't clear.
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1438.051,1453.727,"Well, if the ad does in fact involve third-tier solicitation, which is... I take it your question assumes that, then... I mean, you can't do it simply because the customer imposes it as a condition."
1991.91-119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1453.727,1453.911,All right.
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1456.677,1458.713,I don't think so.
1991.91-119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1458.713,1459.213,All right.
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1486.096,1492.286,"Again, with advertising you have a difficult problem."
1991.91-119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1507.212,1511.164,What's a customer's customer?
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1515.45,1515.733,Right.
1991.91-119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1515.733,1516.917,But not the consumer.
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1516.917,1529.459,"Well, you see in this case, the problem with that is, and why advertising really is a difficult issue here and why we're not relying on it, is in this case some retailers were Wrigley's customers."
1991.91-119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1532.844,1535.546,I don't know why you concede customer's customer.
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1537.648,1544.819,"I believe section (e)(2), which refers to missionary activities, does permit solicitation of the customer's customer."
1991.91-119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1544.819,1561.763,"Well, if the advertising... if just advertising in the State from out of State would give you jurisdiction to tax, why you would just be home free and so would every other State because there... national advertising."
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1561.763,1564.215,"Well, that... that's the next case."
1991.91-119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1564.215,1564.898,xxx.
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1565.698,1571.469,Jurisdiction to tax--
1991.91-119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1571.469,1572.904,Not if you lose this one.
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1582.343,1585.878,--Jurisdiction to tax is present is this case.
1991.91-119,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1610.426,1623.501,"Can I just ask one other little... maybe this is stupid, but supposing we could identify the percentage of Wrigley's business that was done in the ways that you say established something more than solicitation in the State."
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1634.308,1636.76,--It's our position that it's an all or nothing statute.
1991.91-119,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1645.099,1649.401,Has anybody passed... have courts passed on that particular point I've raised?
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1653.872,1665.93,I'm not aware of any court which has taken a contrary position and required some kind of a percentage apportionment based on what activities are solicitation and what are not.
1991.91-119,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1665.93,1677.368,"So that if 99 percent of their sales and solicitations were exempt under the statute, but they have 1 percent that is generated by an... by a taxable method, the whole 100 percent becomes taxable."
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1677.368,1682.736,"Well, some courts have accepted the de minimis argument, but I'm not aware of any--"
1991.91-119,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1682.736,1684.855,But it's either all... it's always an all or none proposition.
1991.91-119,0,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,1684.855,1687.557,"--As far as I know, there's no court that's held to the contrary."
1991.91-119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1695.996,1697.646,"Thank you, Mr. Creeron."
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1699.781,1702.649,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1751.094,1751.977,How did you check credit?
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1751.977,1752.629,--Pardon me?
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1752.629,1753.962,Didn't you even check credit?
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1753.962,1754.845,Illinois did.
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1760.116,1762.651,You mean they did it on the phone to Wisconsin?
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1762.651,1772.441,"Well, the Wisconsin office, whenever a prospective customer came in, the name was forwarded to Illinois for a number of reasons, among them, to make sure that they could pay their bills."
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1775.209,1777.078,So they corresponded or used the telephone to check the credit.
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1777.078,1780.28,"--Yes, they would either send in a written notice--"
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1780.28,1780.863,Into Wisconsin.
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1780.863,1781.946,"--No, to Illinois."

1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1785.934,1787.667,I have no idea how they checked the credit.
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1788.534,1789.802,"Well, I assume they communicated with somebody."
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1789.802,1793.17,"--Well, there's no evidence in this record that--"
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1793.17,1797.889,"Well, you mean they just sat in Illinois and said, gee, here's this name, and it must be good?"
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1798.658,1802.293,"--Well, the--"
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1802.293,1805.162,They must have written into Wisconsin.
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1805.162,1812.631,"--What this record reflects, Justice White, is that credit matters were handled out of Chicago."
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1812.631,1813.5,"Yes, I know."
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1814.117,1815.3,That's what the record reflects.
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1820.571,1820.987,All right.
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1821.637,1827.624,--the cards that the salesmen gave out didn't even have a Wisconsin address or telephone number on it.
1991.91-119,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1904.624,1909.592,"Well, I think it's an overstatement, Mr. Prettyman, to say it doesn't take power away from States to tax."
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1916.23,1917.098,--Absolutely.
1991.91-119,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1986.158,1986.324,The what?
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1986.324,1988.941,--The agency stock transfers.
1991.91-119,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2046.862,2048.045,Who was billed for what?
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2048.045,2056.216,"Either the wholesaler billed that... retailer, or if it was a large account, Wrigley billed the whole... the retailer."
1991.91-119,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2056.216,2059.152,"But de minimis or not, it was a sale of gum."
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2059.152,2066.007,"No, it was not... it was not a sale... I don't think it was a sale in the normal sense, Your Honor, because--"
1991.91-119,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2066.007,2071.661,"Well, it was not a sale to a consumer, but neither was it a gift to the retailer as an inducement."
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2073.962,2079.315,"--If it will help move us along, I will say it's a sale because it was totally de minimis."
1991.91-119,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2114.37,2119.191,"Well, is there a de minimis concept that we should accept here?"
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2122.476,2131.499,"I don't think most statutes that have a de minimis exception to them express language in that way, Justice O'Connor."
1991.91-119,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2149.876,2153.911,"Well, do we have to worry about the word ""only"" that appears in the statute?"
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2153.911,2161.081,"--You know it's interesting, Your Honor, if you look at the statute and take out the word ""only"", I think the statute would mean exactly the same thing."
1991.91-119,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2251.289,2258.36,"Before you get to the warehouse, what is the relationship that renders something de minimis or not?"
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2262.745,2263.681,--In Wisconsin.
1991.91-119,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2265.331,2267.149,--Of their total sales in Wisconsin?
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2267.149,2267.599,Yes.
1991.91-119,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2267.599,2269.265,You think that's the way to decide it?
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2269.265,2269.815,Yes.
1991.91-119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2283.025,2284.275,But may I just interrupt there?
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2284.275,2284.575,Certainly.
1991.91-119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2284.575,2294.833,"You said minor exception to the normal practice, but we're talking about a normal practice, aren't we, the replacing of stale gum and doing this delivery and having this billing you described here?"
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2294.833,2299.301,"Well, there's a big difference between replacement of stale gum and the agency stock."
1991.91-119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2299.301,2301.403,"Well, aren't they both normal practices?"
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2301.403,2308.906,"Well, the agency stock is a normal practice, but it's de minimis because it constitutes such a tiny percentage of what we do."
1991.91-119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2316.246,2321.483,Does the retailer pay for the fresh gum that's used to replace the stale gum?
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2321.483,2322.566,"No, he's already paid for it."
1991.91-119,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2352.883,2355.834,This is gum that has not gone stale on the retailer's shelf.
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2359.036,2359.269,"--No, no, no."
1991.91-119,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2363.871,2367.456,And he doesn't pay for this new gum?
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2367.456,2368.058,No.
1991.91-119,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2370.677,2376.312,"So he only pays for the gum that he either sells, or that stays perpetually fresh?"
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2376.312,2376.997,If he--
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2392.59,2395.625,xxx wasn't gum.
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2435.5,2437.535,"Your Honor, I think you make a very good point."
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2439.252,2446.475,What point was I making?
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2447.108,2456.013,--The fact that there are some duties that can go beyond solicitation depending what is customary in the industry.
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2471.59,2481.898,Say the salesman is a qualified technician and he... part of his duties is regularly answering customers whose engines won't run.
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2481.898,2485.516,"--I think, Your Honor, that you'd look at what was customary in the industry."
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2485.516,2486.683,"Well, say it is customary in the industry."
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2486.683,2499.407,"Well, if it's customary in the industry, and in fact he's doing most of his time selling, and as... he also spends a portion of his time doing something which he thinks he has to do in order to get the next order, then I would say that it's covered here."
1991.91-119,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2543.651,2545.619,It was his wife.
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2546.669,2549.388,I'm not going to touch that one.
1991.91-119,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2586.763,2595.536,Are there any cases that you rely on for the proposition that there's a de minimis exception in this kind of tax situation?
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2595.536,2605.992,"Well, I don't have a tax case for you, but I gave the example, Your Honor, of the Abbott Labs case, where you did carve a diminishment... de minimis exception right out of the statute itself."
1991.91-119,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2605.992,2619.234,"Yeah, but the argument is that you have different presumptions that play when it's a tax case and when it is restricting the State's otherwise existent jurisdiction to tax."
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2619.234,2632.125,"Your Honor, I think you have to look, if I may suggest it, at Congress really had in mind with this statute because I don't think you give it the most conceivably restrictive interpretation that you possibly could."
1991.91-119,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2694.779,2703.451,"Well, there's a wide variety, is there not, among the States as to what exemptions they say are covered and what aren't?"
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2703.451,2724.881,"The language in some of the decisions is widely varying, Your Honor, but I would suggest to you I do not... I think I can honestly say I do not know of a single State decision that I would disagree with the result in, because in every one of those cases, they were doing something which we would concede is beyond solicitation."
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2728.102,2729.569,You concede it's all or nothing?
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2729.569,2733.354,--In answer to Justice Stevens' question it was... that's an interesting question.
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2744.626,2746.328,Have you covered all the four things that--
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2746.328,2747.194,--Let's see.
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2752.648,2754.767,--But you've covered the stale gum.
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2754.767,2756.7,Replacement of stale and warehouse.
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2756.7,2757.317,And the warehouse.
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2757.317,2757.802,Yes.
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2757.802,2758.052,All right.
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2758.052,2759.402,"Shall I touch briefly, then, on--"
1991.91-119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2759.402,2760.818,Can I ask one other question about the stale gum?
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2766.972,2774.809,--It covered some $600 worth of sales divided into the total sales in the State.
1991.91-119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2774.809,2775.476,I understand.
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2777.094,2777.444,Yes.
1991.91-119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2777.444,2780.53,"That didn't include, for example, replacing the stale gum."
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2780.53,2780.896,No.
1991.91-119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2782.064,2783.031,How big a percentage is that?
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2783.031,2783.881,--Pardon me?
1991.91-119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2783.881,2785.349,Do you know how big a percentage that is?
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2785.349,2791.67,"No, but that was... the salesman testified that it was 85 percent of the stock that they kept on hand."
1991.91-119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2797.74,2800.207,Eighty-five percent is used to replace stale gum.
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2800.207,2800.374,Yes.
1991.91-119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2803.14,2806.528,"Would the case be different if instead of replacing stale gum, you bought it back?"
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2806.528,2810.73,"I think if you make an actual sales, as a--"
1991.91-119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2810.73,2811.363,I'm... not sale.
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2818.586,2820.552,--You mean you buy back what you've sold him?
1991.91-119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2820.552,2822.135,"Well, because you don't want him to sell that."
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2826.087,2826.622,"Oh, I see."
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2834.96,2837.995,What do you do with the stale gum you take off the shelf?
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2839.945,2840.395,--No.
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2840.395,2842.197,"It's really a trade, isn't it?"
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2842.197,2844.066,"Well, first of all--"
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2844.066,2845.966,You take it and you replace it.
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2846.616,2851.751,"--Back during this period, most of it was packaged and sent back to Chicago."
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2852.936,2853.153,So it's a trade.
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2853.67,2856.055,--A little bit of it was thrown into the local dumps.
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2856.055,2859.674,"So instead of money, you give them new gum."
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2861.09,2862.34,It's an exchange.
1991.91-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2862.34,2864.458,It's sort of a sale.
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2866.125,2867.41,"No, not for the stale gum."
1991.91-119,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2875.748,2879.052,"Mr. Prettyman, why did they send it back to Chicago?"
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2881.618,2887.205,"Your Honor, the reason it is sent back to Chicago is that in those days it could become part of new gum."
1991.91-119,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2890.757,2896.827,Recycled.
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2897.827,2898.846,"Well, they treat it."
1991.91-119,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3088.828,3092.446,That's one of the things that troubles me.
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3137.959,3140.11,"Your Honor, I don't think it is at all."
1991.91-119,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3185.555,3186.339,But it says that.
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3197.378,3200.996,"--Well, don't we have to be practical about this, Your Honor, and--"
1991.91-119,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3200.996,3201.396,I'm trying to be.
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3201.396,3203.281,--try to make sense out of what Congress did.
1991.91-119,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3219.707,3230.699,"Well, that would make me think that maybe carrying your samples around in the taxicab, yes, is part of solicitation, but I don't know why replacing stale gum is."
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3230.699,3250.577,"Well, I can only tell you that the evidence in this case, Your Honor, is that there is nothing more inextricably bound up in a salesman's mind and in common usage and practice than replacing stale gum. Because you're not... look, if you go to a retail store, and you're selling $10 worth of gum, that's not going to do anything for you."
1991.91-119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3251.362,3252.895,May I interrupt you right there?
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3252.895,3253.395,--Certainly.
1991.91-119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3253.395,3259.965,I take it a regular practice of delivering gum by the salesman would not constitute solicitation.
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3281.045,3287.199,"Well, Your Honor, I will submit to you that it is not delivery, that's... that it's an exchange."
1991.91-119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3300.625,3302.541,"No, what's in the store is the gum that's being exchanged."
1991.91-119,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3321.288,3321.821,"Well, that's funny."
1991.91-119,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3361.362,3363.014,"Thank you, Mr. Prettyman."
1991.91-119,2,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,3365.715,3373.635,"On the de minimis exemption, the word ""only"" is what gives the statute its character protecting small business."
1991.91-119,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3395.735,3396.951,I don't know if I understand that argument.
1991.91-119,2,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,3407.725,3409.244,"--Well, even if--"
1991.91-119,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3409.244,3416.814,"What I'm saying is if there's a de minimis exception, the small business will get the benefit of it as much as the big business."
1991.91-119,2,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,3416.814,3420.599,--But how do you determine what the de minimis exemption is?
1991.91-119,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3422.082,3422.582,"Well, that's another problem."
1991.91-119,2,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,3431.122,3437.893,"--But I mean, a small business couldn't claim a de minimis exemption if all its $600 of sales involve direct delivery."
1991.91-119,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3472.984,3481.756,Just because you're such a worthy opponent.
1991.91-119,2,23773,f_thomas_creeron_iii,,3482.706,3485.808,Thank you very much.
