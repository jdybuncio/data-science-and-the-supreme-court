1985.85-363,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,79.516,"Mr. DeFranks, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,79.516,82.218,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-363,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,142.109,144.225,And you think that's the function of the jury in the trial of the case?
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,144.225,144.894,"Yes, sir."
1985.85-363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,198.629,202.914,"Mr. DeFrank, do we have, to read the dissent to understand the majority opinion, do you think?"
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,202.914,205.783,"No, I don't believe you have to, but the dissent makes it very clear."
1985.85-363,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,287.52,294.924,"When you're talking about substantial restraint, Mr. DeFranks, you're talking about seizing of all the copies of a magazine or something like that?"
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,294.924,298.876,"Or even one, if it's the only offering of a movie theater, I would suggest, that might--"
1985.85-363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,302.761,312.783,"There's some suggestion in respondent's brief, that could have been the case here, that this was the only copy or something?"
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,312.783,320.723,"Indeed, 85 days after the seizure there was an assertion that, ""these were our only copies""."
1985.85-363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,356.246,365.434,"Well, what... the circumstances here, it's a business that rents out videotapes?"
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,365.434,367.167,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,367.167,384.563,"And if the State ware to seize under the warrant, in fact the only copy of the videotape in such a business for a particular film, is there an obligation on the part of the State to provide hearing?"
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,384.563,392.235,"There's an obligation not only to provide a hearing, adversarial under Heller, but there's an obligation to allow him to copy it."
1985.85-363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,397.037,403.025,"Well, does the State have to offer that in the first instance and find out whether that's the case, or not?"
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,403.025,408.661,It was determined under Heller that there need not be a pre-seizure adversarial hearing.
1985.85-363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,415.934,420.838,"So, the burden is on the business owner to request it?"
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,420.838,421.254,Yes.
1985.85-363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,421.254,422.454,Which was not done?
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,422.454,424.37,"Was not done, and I submit the burden--"
1985.85-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,424.37,426.422,"If it had been done, copies would have been made?"
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,426.422,428.239,"--Copies would have been made, of course."
1985.85-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,429.224,430.858,If he wanted them?
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,430.858,440.832,"In preparation for trial he requested, 30 days after the seizure, inspection and/or copying to prepare for trial."
1985.85-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,466.814,472.368,"If there was only one copy in the first place, I suppose all you're obligated to do is to get that back to him."
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,475.653,478.955,"That's indeed what Heller says, and we would have been compelled to do so."
1985.85-363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,478.955,494.298,"Mr. DeFranks, you think that in... for a warrant to be proper that there has to be established probable cause, that every element of the crime has been committed, or something less than that?"
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,494.298,502.218,"For the warrant to be sufficient, I would contend that the affiant should indicate that he's reviewed the entire film."
1985.85-363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,503.586,505.386,"Just answer the question, please."
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,509.907,511.842,--At least an inference.
1985.85-363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,518.58,525.667,And I Guess the argument here focuses on whether in fact all the elements of this offense have been met?
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,525.667,528.1,"Yes, and I would submit that they have."
1985.85-363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,528.1,529.369,By inference?
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,529.369,532.904,"By inference, yes."
1985.85-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,558.888,562.94,"By the way, can you help me find the affidavit?"
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,562.94,564.392,--Yes.
1985.85-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,573.148,578.533,Thank you.
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,578.533,583.854,"As I was saying, the focus of the Court of Appeals was that something might have been left out in this case."
1985.85-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,702.247,707.834,"Well, the affidavits purport to describe each scene in succession."
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,707.834,714.904,"Yes, they do, but there are affidavits we are concerned with which do not go in succession either."
1985.85-363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,737.186,744.924,"Mr. DeFranks, assume for a moment that the warrant was not supported by probable cause here."
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,750.578,751.429,"Yes, it is."
1985.85-363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,751.429,759.951,"Do you think then that, under the Leon case, that the material could be seized in any event?"
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,759.951,764.17,I would think that under Leon this warrant and seizure would be upheld.
1985.85-363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,777.311,778.744,As a matter of state law?
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,778.744,781.679,Yes.
1985.85-363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,865.183,866.9,May I ask you a question.
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,866.9,867.802,"--Yes, sir."
1985.85-363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,867.802,874.706,"You are not asking us to review the affidavits themselves to decide whether there is probable cause, are you?"
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,882.293,884.029,"Well, I'm asking two things."
1985.85-363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,890.298,899.421,"Supposing we read the Court of Appeals' opinion, and I was looking at page A-7 right after the footnote you refer to, and they are talking about, probable cause can or cannot be inferred."
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,909.379,923.704,"Well, I would ask that if it were determined that the Court of Appeals was applying a probable cause standard, and I don't believe that that's the case, I would ask that you review the sufficiency of the evidence here as you did in Gates."
1985.85-363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,923.704,928.173,You want us to review each of these affidavits and then render an opinion on whether that's probable cause?
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,928.173,932.827,"The same as you did in Gates, make a legal determination as to their legal sufficiency."
1985.85-363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,932.827,934.344,As to each of these movies?
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,934.344,935.696,As to each of these movies.
1985.85-363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,935.696,949.437,"And what is it in the opinion... could you tell me where you think the majority makes it most clear that they are applying an elevated standard, without regard to what the dissent says about it, because sometimes I think it's a mistake to rely on other opinions to interpret the majority."
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,949.437,956.341,"Well, first I would refer the Court to page A-7 where they refer to their standard."
1985.85-363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,965.713,968.249,That's referring to what the dissent said.
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,976.837,977.154,All right.
1985.85-363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1004.804,1006.987,"Well, right after the footnote on page 3, they say,"
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,1017.778,1020.83,"As we suggest, they pay lip service to probable cause and as the dissent--"
1985.85-363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1020.83,1023.116,You agree they do pay lip service to the probable cause standard?
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,1023.116,1023.532,--Yes.
1985.85-363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1023.532,1024.949,But you say they misapplied that?
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,1024.949,1025.332,Yes.
1985.85-363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1033.805,1037.59,"Well, you say that, but their opinion doesn't say they're asking for an unequivocal demonstration of obscenity, does it?"
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,1037.59,1046.628,"No, but I think that the statement at page A-7 can be interpreted as saying, it must be unambiguous."
1985.85-363,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1055.134,1062.455,"Well, you say from the sentence in A-7, that they are interpreting the affidavit in the way least damaging to the defendant--"
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,1062.455,1062.838,Yes.
1985.85-363,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1062.838,1066.174,"--I mean, that is not a proper application, or that's not the proper--"
1985.85-363,0,29847,john_j_defranks,,1066.174,1070.626,In avoiding what this Court has said about deference to the Magistrate.
1985.85-363,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1086.218,1089.603,Mr. Cambria.
1985.85-363,1,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1089.603,1092.005,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-363,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1175.043,1178.211,"What was the chill here, in your view?"
1985.85-363,2,29847,john_j_defranks,,1178.211,1185.084,"The chill here, Your Honor, is the fact that once A... this is not, first of all, an adult Bookstore."
1985.85-363,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1234.6,1238.052,"Mr. Cambria, was this point addressed by the New York Court of Appeals?"
1985.85-363,3,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1238.052,1246.056,"The New York Court of Appeals, to my recollection, did not specifically address how many numbers of copies were taken."
1985.85-363,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1246.056,1248.173,Did they unspecifically address the question?
1985.85-363,3,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1248.173,1248.607,Pardon me?
1985.85-363,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1248.607,1250.375,Did they unspecifically address the question?
1985.85-363,3,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1250.375,1253.311,Only in reciting what had happened and what was taken.
1985.85-363,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1253.311,1256.279,Did you make this argument to the New York Court of Appeals?
1985.85-363,3,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1256.279,1271.456,"We did not make an argument, a prior adversary hearing argument, because we don't believe that prior adversary hearing is... this isn't the Heller case, I submit, because in Heller this Court didn't do away with the necessity of the scrupulous exactitude."
1985.85-363,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1311.395,1326.323,"Well, under Illinois versus Gates, doesn't the Court ordinarily defer to reasonable inferences drawn by the issuing magistrate, even though they aren't the only inferences that might be drawn?"
1985.85-363,3,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1326.323,1331.958,"--I think the two things, yes, I think that under Illinois versus Gates that is a fair reading of the opinion there."
1985.85-363,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1337.676,1346.718,"So, it's your position that we just shouldn't apply the Illinois versus Gates standards of reviewing what the Magistrate did, is that your position?"
1985.85-363,3,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1346.718,1349.67,"--Yes, and particularly in this First Amendment area."
1985.85-363,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1423.932,1425.315,What difference does that make on the question of issuing a warrant?
1985.85-363,4,29847,john_j_defranks,,1425.315,1428.067,"I think it makes this difference, if I might, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.85-363,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1468.894,1480.218,"Well, all of the things you're saying there, of course, are very important, in a very important way on the ultimate decision, but how do they bear on whether a warrant should issue?"
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1480.218,1492.576,"--I think that when we make a decision about probable cause, and I hope the history of the Court bears me out... I know it does with regard to the State Court decisions... that all of the elements must be satisfied in some preliminary fashion."
1985.85-363,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1492.576,1499.849,"There isn't in the record... the record doesn't show what the Magistrate thought, does it?"
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1499.849,1501.449,"Well, yes, it does, and I'll say how it does."
1985.85-363,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1501.449,1502.967,What does he say?
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1502.967,1513.172,"Under 690.40 of our New York procedures, any communication whatsoever, beyond the papers is and must be recorded."
1985.85-363,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1517.826,1522.762,"It may not, but you're not suggesting that the Magistrate didn't know about what the cases required?"
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1522.762,1525.397,"But the Magistrate never reviewed any of the materials, Your Honor."
1985.85-363,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1527.266,1542.776,"The Magistrate read the affidavit and let's assume the Magistrate said, I know all about these three prongs and I've read all these affidavits and I infer that all... there's probable cause to believe that all three prongs are satisfied."
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1542.776,1544.876,--I think that that's precisely what--
1985.85-363,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1544.876,1549.696,"We must assume that's what... that he did that, at the minimum."
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1549.696,1552.898,"--I think, as it comes up here, that assumption comes with it."
1985.85-363,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1583.334,1588.488,"The State Court did decide this as a federal question, didn't it?"
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1588.488,1589.588,--Pardon me?
1985.85-363,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1589.588,1593.041,This was decided as a federal question?
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1593.041,1594.641,"I don't believe that that's so, Your Honor."
1985.85-363,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1608.134,1610.936,"Well, we just shouldn't ever have granted this?"
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1610.936,1625.43,"I agree, and I said that in my petition, in my opposition to the petition, because when you look at this case and you look at the main cases, the Podbora case, it relies on another New York State case and that New York State case chronicles all the state decisions."
1985.85-363,5,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1667.257,1690.02,"Where is the clearer statement in the case which we require to go off on the adequate and independent state grounds, in light of the Court's language dealing with application of the Fourth Amendment in the citation of Roaden, Marcus versus the search warrant, Stanford versus Texas, Maryland versus Macon?"
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1694.657,1701.311,"I think that when we analyze the decision at A-4 of the record, they start off by talking about it in parallel terms."
1985.85-363,5,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1710.184,1714.404,It certainly doesn't meet the Michigan versus Long standard by any stretch.
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1714.404,1716.939,"--Well, I think that it meets it in this sense."
1985.85-363,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1758.266,1767.788,"Take a look at A-4 and A-5, Mr. Cambria, the sentence beginning in the... it says,"
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1781.696,1791.321,"Yes, I think that that's true in connection with that general principle which no one disagrees with, I hope, that there must be scrupulous exactitude."
1985.85-363,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1855.993,1862.999,"Well, was the Miller case concerned with the issuance of a warrant, or was it concerned with the merits?"
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1862.999,1874.455,"Well, I think that we have to define what it is and what happened here is... forgetting the Miller case, taking the statute which the Court refers to, 235, it incorporates the definition of Miller."
1985.85-363,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1874.455,1883.145,"All the things you were referring to from the Miller holding had to do with decision on the merits of the case, had nothing to do with the warrants, isn't that so?"
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1883.145,1899.939,"If we look at... well, I think that interprets that statutes and you have to have... when you're finding probable cause you have to start somewhere and I submit, Mr. Chief Justice, you must start with the statute and say, what are the elements that I as a judge am attempting to find probable cause to issue a warrant for."
1985.85-363,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1926.64,1934.595,"Tell me, Mr. Cambria, do you think that it was the Magistrate's duty to see the motion pictures?"
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1934.595,1937.797,"--I... the Court of Appeals, of course, says no."
1985.85-363,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1942.868,1943.635,And you agree to that?
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1943.635,1951.891,"I believe that in exigent circumstances that that could be a substitute which would be available to the Court, meaning in the sense that--"
1985.85-363,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1951.891,1955.859,"Well, ordinarily do you think the Magistrate should see the films?"
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1955.859,1957.545,--I think that the Magistrate should review the film.
1985.85-363,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1959.411,1964.615,He has to do that before he decides whether to issue the warrant?
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1964.615,1969.667,"--I say yes, because I think that's the best way, and in this case it was easy."
1985.85-363,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1970.167,1974.821,"If this were a federal issue, is there any case of ours that says that?"
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,1974.821,1976.237,--There's no case which says that.
1985.85-363,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2203.785,2204.552,Let's take--
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,2204.552,2205.404,--Your Honor?
1985.85-363,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2205.404,2208.523,--A different kind of case.
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,2220.581,2222.831,I submit that would be enough for two reasons.
1985.85-363,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2222.831,2229.269,--Doesn't have to do anything about... doesn't hays to do anything at all about the merits.
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,2229.269,2230.302,Right.
1985.85-363,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2230.302,2231.086,And that's sufficient?
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,2231.086,2236.856,"Right, and that would be enough because, number one, he would have hit all the elements of murder, and secondly--"
1985.85-363,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2236.856,2237.49,I beg your pardon.
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,2239.058,2246.128,--I think that the simple taking of life would have enough to show a violation of at least New York law.
1985.85-363,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2246.128,2248.997,Why would not simple obscenity be enough?
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,2248.997,2253.818,"Because the difference is, there's no First Amendment which presumptively protects murder."
1985.85-363,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2264.856,2267.391,Have you anything else to go along with that?
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,2267.391,2268.275,--Pardon me?
1985.85-363,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2268.275,2271.01,Have you anything else to bolster that?
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,2271.01,2289.741,"I think I have all of these decisions that indicate that there must be the determination by the Magistrate and that the Magistrate has to make the finding and the determination through a higher hurdle, through a scrupulous exactitude, through a searching, focused inquiry, and I submit that that's the difference here."
1985.85-363,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2289.741,2291.791,And that's only true for First Amendment?
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,2291.791,2295.145,"I believe that that's true, and I believe that this Court has said that that's true."
1985.85-363,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2295.145,2297.178,"What if you murdered an author, would that involve--"
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,2297.178,2297.645,Excuse me.
1985.85-363,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2297.645,2301.298,"--If you murdered an author, would that involve a First Amendment--"
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,2301.298,2312.939,"I suppose that if you were a district attorney and you murdered an author because you were trying to silence what he was writing at the time, that that could be a First Amendment matter and we could have an argument with regard to it."
1985.85-363,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2316.141,2318.724,"--May I ask you a question before you sum up, Mr. Cambria."
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,2318.724,2319.543,--Yes.
1985.85-363,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2319.543,2330.734,"Because the question presented in the cert petition, I'm trying to figure out some way where I don't have to decide whether there's probable cause in all these affidavits, because that doesn't seem to me to be something I should have to do in a case like this."
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,2343.291,2358.968,"I think that the question here is, under New York State, as they perceive their laws, their statutes, their laws, their cases, did the Judge here, given these facts, have a sufficient basis to try to make a probable cause determination and only a probable cause determination."
1985.85-363,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2383.933,2402.228,"I recognize that, buy what about the sentence at the bottom of A-4, because there was seizure based upon ideas, that was based upon ideas, they contain... there is a higher standard for evaluation of a warrant application seeking to seize such things as books and films as opposed to--"
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,2402.228,2424.926,"I think what that means is this: as this Court said in Roaden and Heller and Lee Art and all the cases we've talked about today, there's a higher standard in a sense that the judge must focus searchingly on the question of obscenity, and even this Court used the word, on the question of obscenity, in Marcus, as opposed to probable obscenity."
1985.85-363,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2469.621,2475.692,"--You rely on Roaden, and my recollection of that case is that there was no warrant involved."
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,2479.744,2480.294,--That's true.
1985.85-363,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2481.179,2482.196,That case is--
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,2482.196,2484.048,"--Well, I take this position--"
1985.85-363,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2484.048,2486.048,--several times--
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,2486.048,2493.737,"--Roaden, in the sense that Roaden seems to chronicle all the cases in this area, because Roaden takes us back to Marcus and says we have a higher hurdle."
1985.85-363,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2561.112,2564.497,--May I ask you another question that puzzles me about this litigation.
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,2576.471,2585.16,"I... when we made that argument below, the response was that there would be some evidentiary objections."
1985.85-363,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2587.41,2592.664,"Respondent... these people who made up the affidavit know what the movies are, and I guess they're on the market."
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,2596.282,2597.218,"--Well, the problem--"
1985.85-363,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2597.218,2598.968,"From either side, I mean, I don't know what you gained."
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,2598.968,2622.584,"--What we gained is this: the minute that that warrant hits that store, which again is not the yellow front store, that sends a chill up the spine of those individuals that's heard from coast to coast, and I mean that with all sincerity, because each time this warrant hits a store and some presumptively protected material is taken off the shelf pursuant to the warrant, that constitutes a chill which every one of us--"
1985.85-363,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2622.584,2628.653,Would it be as much of a chill as being found guilty or the basis of... I assume some of it--
1985.85-363,5,37788,paul_john_cambria_jr,,2628.653,2647.382,"--Your Honor, that issue was brought up in the Hair case, Southeastern Promotions, and of course this Court found there that the punishment after the crime such as in penal law situations is one thing, but punishment pre-crime which is the restraint situation is something more onerous, and I take the position that it is."
1985.85-363,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2706.135,2710.77,Mr. DeFranks.
1985.85-363,6,29847,john_j_defranks,,2710.77,2716.157,"I would like to just make one point, with regard to Franks versus Delaware."
1985.85-363,6,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2746.776,2756.901,"Mr. Attorney General, why didn't you buy a copy of this and renew... re-open the case rather than bothering us with it?"
1985.85-363,6,29847,john_j_defranks,,2756.901,2758.618,"Well, they weren't all firsthand."
1985.85-363,6,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2758.618,2759.786,You didn't have--
1985.85-363,6,29847,john_j_defranks,,2759.786,2775.879,"They were... having rented it and not returned it during a certain period, that might well he considered a seizure had we not returned it pursuant to the rental agreement, seizure without a warrant."
1985.85-363,6,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2775.879,2778.231,"--Well, couldn't you have rented it long enough to copy it?"
1985.85-363,6,29847,john_j_defranks,,2778.231,2781.433,"We could have rented it long enough to copy it, yes, we could have."
1985.85-363,6,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2781.433,2783.766,"In fact, he says you did that, is that right?"
1985.85-363,6,29847,john_j_defranks,,2785.318,2789.853,"We did rent certain of them and copied certain of them, yes."
1985.85-363,6,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2789.853,2792.905,"If you had the copies, then why did you have to fight about the suppression?"
1985.85-363,6,29847,john_j_defranks,,2792.905,2798.209,Because the actual films were the best evidence in this case to present to the jury.
1985.85-363,6,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2799.578,2800.928,"The copies were not legible, is that what it is?"
1985.85-363,6,29847,john_j_defranks,,2800.928,2802.78,"--Well, they would have had to have been verified."
1985.85-363,6,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2803.98,2809.265,Do you think it's harder to verify copies than to come to the United States Supreme Court on an issue?
1985.85-363,6,29847,john_j_defranks,,2809.265,2817.038,"--No, but there was also more of an impact on the jury to show them the actual films that were taken from the store."
1985.85-363,6,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2821.173,2825.476,Is it correct that the only purpose of the seizure was for use as evidence?
1985.85-363,6,29847,john_j_defranks,,2828.845,2829.428,Not at all.
1985.85-363,6,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2829.428,2829.861,Not at all?
1985.85-363,6,29847,john_j_defranks,,2829.861,2831.345,No attempt.
1985.85-363,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2831.345,2832.713,"Thank you, gentlemen."
