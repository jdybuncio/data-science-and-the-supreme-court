1970.135,0,21114,david_c_long,,41.735,45.345,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.135,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,98.462,107.005,"Mr. Long, can you give me a little geographic help, how close is Westchester to Austin?"
1970.135,0,21114,david_c_long,,107.005,110.165,Respondent’s brief refers to it as being seven miles.
1970.135,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,126.77,128.142,Are the two adjacent?
1970.135,0,21114,david_c_long,,128.142,129.3,They’re not adjacent.
1970.135,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,129.3,131.494,Something in between?
1970.135,0,21114,david_c_long,,131.494,137.402,They’re roughly connected by some side roads and a freeway.
1970.135,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,137.402,139.488,How large is Westchester?
1970.135,0,21114,david_c_long,,139.488,147.14,"Westchester, according to the ‘60 Census is 18,000 persons, approximately."
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,1912.091,1916.129,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1975.067,1980.44,"Those remarks were made contemporaneously, were they not at the time of hearing?"
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,1980.44,1986.061,"Yes, at the time the trial court indicated he would deny the one request for an injunction and grant the others."
1970.135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1986.061,1997.324,"Well, at that time do you suppose the people present anticipated that this temporary restraints would be in effect for three years?"
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,1997.324,1999.216,"I’m sure they did not, Your Honor."
1970.135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2013.994,2016.078,Who could have brought that on for a hearing on (Voice Overlap)?
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2016.078,2025.033,"Well, once a notice of appeal has -- once the appeal was taken in the jurisdiction that was transferred from the trial courts, so it’s in effect then the appeals that have delayed the --"
1970.135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2025.033,2029.608,How long after the entry of the order was the appeal noted?
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2029.608,2035.519,"I think it was within 30 days, appeal of this character you have to file your notice for appeal within 30 days."
1970.135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2050.853,2063.367,"Mr. McNamara, what about this page 68, Mr. Long, I take this appendix to raise that the Court, who knows law and follows the law and this is a temporary injunction."
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2068.534,2074.293,"Well, by statute, there are two different restraining orders of a preliminary nature."
1970.135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2082.114,2085.522,And the temporary injunction is what under Illinois law?
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2085.522,2089.422,"Well, I think, a preliminary injunction is what I would more normally call it --"
1970.135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2089.422,2092.92,This says the Court calls this a temporary injunction.
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2092.92,2096.107,"I think it was a loose labeling there, Your Honor."
1970.135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2144.805,2158.671,"Well, suppose there was a radio station which served this 18,000 community where he lived, that 18,000 figure represents the community in which his residence was located, is that right?"
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2158.671,2159.61,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1970.135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2159.61,2177.309,"And suppose there was a small weekly newspaper, is often in a community of that size, and each them, the radio station and the newspaper had said in their way everything that was said here."
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2179.544,2180.353,"No, indeed Your Honor."
1970.135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2191.721,2194.039,"But they’re not parties here, are they?"
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2194.039,2194.474,Who was that --
1970.135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2194.474,2195.267,(Voice Overlap) the newspaper.
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2195.267,2195.624,No.
1970.135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2207.011,2210.252,A different standard for a newspaper and a private party?
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2210.252,2218.679,"No, no, a different standard between publications Your Honor by newspaper and by the distributions of the nature that occurred here of handbills."
1970.135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2228.932,2235.97,"Well, in the Near case, Mr. Near did not publish a newspaper."
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2250.094,2260.925,"Here, Your Honor, I think, you have a situation where there has been a calculated invasion of privacy for the purpose of course in action which I do not think was the Near case."
1970.135,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2299.684,2307.537,Do you think the newspaper which published -- could be enjoined from publishing a special story on --
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2307.537,2309.755,"Absolutely not, Your Honor, under no circumstances."
1970.135,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2309.755,2315.025,Even though the newspaper was doing it deliberately to influence his neighbors or to influence him.
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2315.025,2319.14,"I have not -- I think, first, there are two matters of distinction there."
1970.135,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2333.569,2342.124,"So, you would permit -- you would’ve permitted -- you would say you could not enjoin the mailing of these same leaflets to Mr. Keefe’s neighbors?"
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2342.124,2346.588,"I think I would have to agree with that, Your Honor, because the element of personal confrontation here."
1970.135,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.688,2362.478,"So, you would say that these people could’ve been enjoined from talking personally to his neighbors."
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2362.478,2365.603,"For instance Your Honor, let’s say, they started --"
1970.135,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2365.603,2370.835,"Putting leaflets wholly aside, they could be enjoined from talking to Mr. Keefe’s neighbors."
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2370.835,2374.053,"In fact, yeah, let me give you an example if I might, Your Honor."
1970.135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2390.676,2392.214,Even if it becomes a nuisance?
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2392.214,2408.718,"Well, this is the point I’m making Your Honor but it can lose -- I think the First Amendment protection of that type of harassment and conduct is so minimal that it should be weighed at the balance against the right of privacy and the parties concerned and not be permitted."
1970.135,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2408.718,2414.42,What is involved (Inaudible)
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2414.42,2415.262,This prevented --
1970.135,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2415.262,2419.669,(Inaudible)
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2419.669,2427.009,"As I read it Mr. Justice White, it prevented the physical distribution by members of the OBA in the community of Westchester."
1970.135,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2427.009,2430.026,(Inaudible)
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2430.026,2432.555,"Yes, passing out I believe is the word to the injunction order."
1970.135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2432.555,2452.177,"Am I correct that under this first section, first paragraph of this injunction, no member of OBA prepares out leaflets in the City of Westchester, Illinois to advocate (Inaudible)?"
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2452.177,2455.298,"I don’t know that any of them have passed out such leaflets, Your Honor, but I think the --"
1970.135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2455.298,2457.431,But does that prohibit them from doing it?
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2457.431,2473.38,"I think the language was perhaps unduly broad there because obviously, it was Mr. Keefe’s activities at which this injunction order was directed and I’m sure that had matter been called to the trial court’s attention by either of the parties that the order would’ve been so limited."
1970.135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2473.38,2475.661,But it is before us.
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2475.661,2476.016,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1970.135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2476.016,2478.407,It hasn’t been changed.
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2478.407,2489.367,"Under Illinois law, it is held that a specific to orders of this character, if not made to the trial court could not later be raised on appeal."
1970.135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2489.367,2493.543,But what can we do with this?
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2493.543,2501.394,"I think, interpret it, Your Honor as the parties have limited and prohibited only activities directed at Mr. Keefe."
1970.135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2501.394,2505.992,You mean the petitioner recognizes that?
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2506.82,2512.869,"I have not seen anywhere in his argument and briefs that he’s filed to date Your Honor, I could be mistaken any reference to the fact that --"
1970.135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2512.869,2527.898,"But you want us to put our approval on an injunction that is this broad that says, a man as long as he lives may never (Inaudible) or pass out any literature including the Bible."
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2527.898,2530.939,"But, I would say this, Mr. Justice Marshall, the --"
1970.135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2530.939,2533.343,Including a sample ballot.
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2533.343,2547.638,"I would not show this up as a model of draftsmanship but again, the parties involved here assume there would be a hearing on the merits within a space of weeks or months and a final order entered either granting or denying the injunction."
1970.135,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2547.638,2552.059,"But you haven’t objected to the jurisdiction of this Court, have you?"
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2552.059,2569.533,"No, Your Honor, I did in the response to the request for certiorari, I did raise the point that this was a preliminary injunction and it seemed to me somewhat unusual that at this stage the Court would consider a right for determination."
1970.135,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2731.332,2745.933,"Mr. McNamara, in your opposition to the petition for certiorari, you made the statement, it is only the physical presence of members of the OBA in Westchester that is enjoined."
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2765.074,2765.544,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.135,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2892.797,2895.918,Is there residential picketing involved here?
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2895.918,2900.821,"The injunction order, there had been no residential picketing in Westchester, Mr. Justice."
1970.135,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2901.698,2907.139,"I gather all that happened in Westchester, the distribution in the --"
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2907.139,2910.387,"In his neighborhood, at his church and in his shopping center of the handbills."
1970.135,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2910.387,2911.508,(Inaudible)
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2911.508,2913.061,That is correct.
1970.135,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2913.061,2916.278,We’re not dealing here with --
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,2916.278,2918.343,I think we are to this extent.
1970.135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2987.542,2998.107,"Well, would that be relevant unless you had an injunction here that prohibited delivering any material to this man’s house?"
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,3000.474,3004.709,"Yes, there you were involved with the mail order --"
1970.135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3004.709,3020.564,"If your injunction here just simply prohibited any activity by way of delivering pamphlets or written material to the home of your client, you might have a Rowland type of situation."
1970.135,1,43124,thomas_w_mcnamara,,3020.564,3040.291,"Yes, I don’t claim Mr. Chief Justice that this is a analogy to the Rowland case but I do think the opinion expressed there that there must be a balancing in certain circumstances between the right to communicate on the one hand and the right to be left alone on the other has applicability to this case."
1970.135,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3106.962,3108.996,Thank you Mr. McNamara.
