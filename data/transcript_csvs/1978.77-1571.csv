1978.77-1571,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.925,We'll hear arguments first this morning in Delaware against Prouse.
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,16.882,20.317,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1571,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,287.503,291.467,Mr. Oberly did the police officer asked if the driver had insurance?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,291.467,292.982,"In this particular case no, Your Honor."
1978.77-1571,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,292.982,300.699,"He didn’t I know, but would you say would the state have -- would it permissible for him to inquire of the driver on that subject on a random basis?"
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,300.699,301.866,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
1978.77-1571,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,332.041,337.032,But the officer had the right I suppose to ask the man if he had a drink within the last hour?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,337.032,342.828,I don’t believe that he would have that right unless he had some articulable suspicion to pursue it any further than that.
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,356.933,360.994,I have a little trouble with the word random.
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,373.067,377.597,Your Honor Justice Marshall I --
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,377.597,382.373,If you have to stop every fourth car that’s what I’d think it would be random.
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,382.373,388.124,I think if you use a classic definition of a random that could possibly would be correct.
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,391.767,395.377,Is there any restriction on who can be stopped?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,395.377,397.391,Not by using the test of Delaware.
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,397.391,402.312,Could a police officer stop all Negroes and would that be alright?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,402.312,404.006,That would certainly not be alright.
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,404.006,405.313,Why?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,405.313,406.785,It would be certainly --
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,406.785,410.832,"Well, suppose he stopped 20% of them?"
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,410.832,414.905,If 20% of the drivers in the State of Delaware happened to be Negroes then I’d submit that that --
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,414.905,418.217,Suppose he stopped all women that would be alright?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,418.217,419.462,I think Your Honor as you’re indicating upon --
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,419.462,421.827,Would that be alright to stop all women?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,421.827,424.734,"No, it would not be."
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,424.734,430.095,"Well, he only stopped whoever he wants to stop?"
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,430.095,431.587,That would be correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,437.005,442.908,"Well Terry does not supply that, any help for you there at all, does it?"
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,442.908,445.562,I believe Terry does supply some help there.
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,445.562,447.402,Can he stop anybody?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,447.402,447.868,"No, but --"
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,447.868,459.258,"I thought this Court went to great details in explaining what happened in Terry, that policeman was -- Terry for about three or fours hours, didn’t he?"
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,459.258,460.579,"Yes, he did Your Honor."
1978.77-1571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,460.579,471.283,Well doesn’t random by definition mean nothing more than the person is driving a motor vehicle on the highway that there isn’t any other ground for stopping them?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,471.283,474.908,That is the state’s contention yes Justice Rehnquist.
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,497.414,501.038,But in Terry the policeman barged man casing the joint?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,501.038,502.463,Yes he did and that --
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,502.463,505.879,"Well, would this driver casing any thing?"
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,505.879,506.642,I’m sorry.
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,506.642,507.378,What was he doing?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,510.83,513.676,"That’s correct, he was doing nothing more than driving the car at the point he was stopped."
1978.77-1571,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,513.676,519.457,There’s nothing illegal in it and driving the car if he has a license and if he has insurance.
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,519.457,519.928,That’s correct.
1978.77-1571,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,519.928,524.793,"If he doesn’t have a license then it is illegal, isn’t it?"
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,524.793,525.317,That’s correct.
1978.77-1571,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,526.416,543.519,"Your point is that Delaware claims the right to stop any car to see whether he has number one, the license to drive it which implies carrying insurance and that driver has the title papers to the car, I suppose to check that."
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,543.519,544.238,That’s correct.
1978.77-1571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,566.913,570.159,Does Delaware have a safety inspection law?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,570.159,592.179,"Delaware has a yearly inspection of the automobile, at which time it is run through a inspection point to test for brakes, safety and the registration is signed and a fee is paid and the sticker is given to driver and it’s put on the license and the car owner indicating the ownership of the vehicle is unstamped which indicate that the proper insurance is all there."
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,592.179,594.846,Well he didn’t stop him to see if he has a sticker?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,594.846,597.628,"No, the sticker is displayed on the license plate."
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,597.628,598.789,I should hope so.
1978.77-1571,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,598.789,600.306,This is only yearly.
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,600.306,602.421,That’s only yearly Your Honor.
1978.77-1571,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,602.421,606.937,Does Delaware have a policy of making random stops?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,606.937,615.188,"There is no set policy by any of the police departments in Delaware that I am aware of, that requires any officers to conduct random stops."
1978.77-1571,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,626.292,635.671,Apart from the state policy is there any -- does the record show whether this particular officer was working pursuant to any local policy or is it just his own initiative?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,635.671,637.884,The record clearly indicates it was his own initiative.
1978.77-1571,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,656.448,664.187,And was the marijuana package in plain sight or did he detect that first from the odor of the marijuana?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,664.187,670.511,As soon as he walked up to the car he never had a chance even to engage in initial questioning before he smelled the marijuana.
1978.77-1571,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,752.33,767.234,"But what was not -- I didn’t think the issue here whether or not the state could do this, the question was whether having done it in the manner it was done here the marijuana seized could be used as evidence against the driver?"
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,767.234,768.348,Well I think it’s --
1978.77-1571,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,768.348,769.457,Is that the issue?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,769.457,770.274,It’s combination of both.
1978.77-1571,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,770.274,777.38,You may be denied that without being denied any authority to stop?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,777.38,777.934,That is --
1978.77-1571,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,777.934,779.84,To make traffic checks?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,779.84,781.049,That is a possibility.
1978.77-1571,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,793.308,805.213,"Well I know, but I thought the issue really was whether or not you lost the conviction of Mr. Prouse on the ground that this evidence was illegally admitted, didn’t you?"
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,805.213,807.764,It was illegally seized and never even got the trial and that’s correct.
1978.77-1571,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,807.764,811.517,What you want is that the conviction be reinstated?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,811.517,812.548,We would like the --
1978.77-1571,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,812.548,820.014,But I don’t see if he moves and there is an affirmative of that at all stops Delaware from making new stops.
1978.77-1571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,820.014,824.088,Well didn’t the Delaware Supreme Court say the stop violated the Fourth Amendment?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,824.088,828.17,"Yes, the Delaware Supreme Court explicitly held that the stop violated the --"
1978.77-1571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,828.17,836.221,So that the police officers should no longer just stop people because they’ve been told that it violates the Fourth Amendment.
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,836.221,841.47,"That is the effect of the holding, that we are no longer allowed to stop people unless there is articulable facts that they --"
1978.77-1571,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,841.47,844.861,I suggest that’s not really what’s involved?
1978.77-1571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,844.861,848.765,Well it may -- that’s what the Supreme Court held though?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,848.765,857.518,I submit that what -- that the test that the Supreme Court applied is a wrong interpretation of what the requirement of the Fourth Amendment is.
1978.77-1571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,857.518,877.403,"Of course, you could as Justice Brennan suggested, carry out your policy, serve both the state's and the Fourth Amendment by saying that any evidence that comes from such a stop isn’t admissible."
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,877.403,879.186,As to other crimes.
1978.77-1571,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,879.186,892.798,"Well -- but logically, no evidence even of a -- not having a driver’s license or not having a registration would be admissible either, if this is a Fourth Amendment violation."
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,896.036,896.803,It's the state's contention --
1978.77-1571,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,896.803,901.093,To try to find drivers without licenses and without registrations.
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,901.093,904.627,"That’s the state contention, we cannot possibly enforce these, unless we have that right."
1978.77-1571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,904.627,911.073,"You couldn’t cancel their license, you can get them off the road, you may not be able to convict."
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,911.073,953.815,"Your Honor, it’s the state’s belief that if we are not able to stop absent articulable suspicion and that the Delaware Supreme Court ruling is affirmed, the meaning of that would basically be that any person without a driver’s license, who has a suspended license, a revoked license or no insurance is being given notice that you may drive upon the roads of the State of Delaware unless you are unfortunate enough to either drive past the officer who previously arrested you or you violate some other rule of the road and then we submit that it's possibly too late at that point that the determination of who is fit and who is not fit is whether or not you possess that license, not whether or not you violate a law and then you're found not to posses a license."
1978.77-1571,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,953.815,963.506,Does Delaware pursue the practice also of setting up random check points at which the license of every driver is checked?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,963.506,965.347,No it does not Your Honor and --
1978.77-1571,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,965.347,967.699,And many states do.
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,967.699,969.068,Some states do.
1978.77-1571,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,973.99,994.217,"I am not talking about border searches, I am talking about random check points that may vary from hour to hour so long as you stop every car that comes along say for 20 minutes or for an hour, you slow up traffic temporarily, that’s done routinely in my city of Richmond, Virginia."
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,994.217,1005.321,It’s the states contention that the use a road block type of procedure is much more than is required under the Fourteenth Amendment.
1978.77-1571,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1005.321,1026.236,"But if you have a real problem, the chances of catching people who violate say a license law would be much greater if you could stop 500 cars in 20 minutes, then if you go around at total random picking up one here or there and yonder, don't you think?"
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1026.236,1028.507,I have never seen a road block or participated in one.
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1102.125,1109.067,"How can you say about treated equally, when it depends on which policeman you pass by?"
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1109.067,1110.882,In your random stop situation you are referring to?
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1110.882,1114.279,In the stop -- in the situation in Delaware.
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1125.89,1127.441,That’s correct and there is --
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1127.441,1142.449,"Well that isn’t equal to everybody, that’s up to the whim of that policeman at that time, more likely whether he had bad coffee for breakfast or not, isn’t that true?"
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1142.449,1143.142,The state doesn’t --
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1143.142,1147.269,And isn’t what you try to keep away from with policeman?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1147.269,1150.346,"The state does not believe that that is true, there is --"
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1150.346,1155.269,"Well for example the policeman said he knew the smell of marijuana, how did he happen to know that?"
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1155.269,1157.942,"I believe he knew that from his prior experience, prior arrest."
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1157.942,1166.244,Well why do we have them dogs specially trained to smell marijuana if they are police who can smell it?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1166.244,1180.408,"Your Honor, the answer to that is that the situations involving dogs involves suitcases, luggages where it’s not burned and the animals are able to ascertain a smell that human wouldn’t be able to ascertain."
1978.77-1571,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1180.408,1187.565,Mr. Oberly you mentioned the hundreds of people would be inconvenienced by the suggestion Mr. Justice Powell made.
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1197.239,1205.916,Referring to hundreds of people I am referring to the possibility of a road block which would have stopped some through fair and line cars up. I am presupposing it would have stopped hundreds.
1978.77-1571,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1213.122,1215.739,"About this particular officer, we don’t know how often he does it."
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1215.739,1222.462,"He, as the record indicates in our writ of certiorari, he does it a case only when he has a law –"
1978.77-1571,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1222.462,1226.665,"What do you suppose that means, maybe a couple of times a week or couple of times a day or --"
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1226.665,1228.293,Unfortunately the record was never explored further.
1978.77-1571,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1228.293,1234.793,"So does it say two or three times a week, this a really a very significant deterrent, is he going to catch very many people?"
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1234.793,1240.136,"Your Honor, that individual does it two or three times week times, the 400 police officers in the state."
1978.77-1571,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1240.136,1242.589,We don’t know that they all do it.

1978.77-1571,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1253.966,1264.447,"So you are not in a position to tell us how often or how successful the program is, how many people they actually find without driver’s license or you don’t really have any information that tell us how wise this policy is, do you?"
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1264.447,1266.547,No there are no statistics kept in Delaware that I am aware upon now.
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1266.547,1273.83,"Is there a regulation, statewide regulation of the police department which says that you’re authorized to do this?"
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1273.83,1283.581,No there is not any state authorize except the statement in the law which the police are charged with the enforcement of all laws of the state in the motor vehicle laws or laws.
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1283.581,1289.948,Well don’t you have a [Inaudible] arrested and things like that.
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1289.948,1291.072,"No, no we don’t --"
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1291.072,1293.618,Do you not have a manual for the police --
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1293.618,1293.748,There is --
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1293.748,1295.262,Do you have a manual for police?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1295.262,1297.906,There are police training manuals which acts --
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1297.906,1299.702,Well is that in the training manual?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1299.702,1301.532,Not that I am aware Your Honor.
1978.77-1571,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1301.532,1307.412,And you don’t know any statewide regulation which requires the police officer to do this?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1307.412,1309.717,"No, I do not know of any."
1978.77-1571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1309.717,1311.85,This man was a State policeman?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1311.85,1314.155,No he was a New Castle County police officer.
1978.77-1571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1314.155,1315.977,And how many counties are there in Delaware?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1315.977,1323.605,"There is three counties, New Castle County has its own separate police department of approximately 200 officers."
1978.77-1571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1327.694,1331.598,What percentage of the population Delaware is concentrated in New Castle?
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1331.598,1333.967,Approximately 75%.
1978.77-1571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1333.967,1343.9,And is the Delaware Turnpike between Wilmington South to Newark and Stanton in New Castle County.
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1343.9,1346.542,The entire portion of Turnpike is in New Castle county.
1978.77-1571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1346.542,1348.3,How many lanes are there each way on that.
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1348.3,1352.092,There is three lanes in each direction.
1978.77-1571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1352.092,1359.436,"My question, we understood each other including all the police in Delaware, city, county, state."
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1359.436,1364.695,Yes I am not aware of any written policy in this area.
1978.77-1571,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1364.695,1371.142,"Tell me, does Delaware have one of these programs for checks of agricultural products."
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1371.142,1373.88,The bona types for agriculture products like California?
1978.77-1571,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1373.88,1374.99,Something like that.
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1374.99,1383.953,"No, I’ve been a life long resident of Delaware, I do not know of any policy that California has and some of the western states have."
1978.77-1571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1383.953,1389.55,"Trucks, low Commercial Vehicles automatically have to stop at the, when they are coming to the state?"
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1389.55,1401.029,No there is only one weighing station that has just been implemented in the state of Delaware but there is not a weighing process that’s utilized for all states that are using the highway either.
1978.77-1571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1555.556,1561.917,"Mr. Oberly it may be of no legal significance but as I read the record there was no conviction in this case, was there?"
1978.77-1571,0,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,1566.211,1574.018,That’s correct.
1978.77-1571,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1574.018,1578.787,Mr. Lukoff?
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,1578.787,1583.198,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1571,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1651.298,1664.484,"Now is it your position that anything, anything that was found in the car following the stop may not used in evidence in any criminal case is that correct?"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,1664.484,1666.442,That is correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1978.77-1571,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1666.442,1691.226,"Suppose instead of the prohibited drugs they had found in the trunk of the car a human being bound and gagged who was being kidnapped, you couldn’t prosecute the kidnapper for that offense on your theory and on the theory of the Supreme Court of Delaware."
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,1691.226,1695.241,Mr. Chief Justice unless there were some facts that would help --
1978.77-1571,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1695.241,1708.214,"Take the same, take the same facts precisely with instead of marijuana it’s a 14-year old girl bound and gagged in the trunk of the car but still alive."
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,1708.214,1711.308,The ultimate result of this rule would be that that could not be used.
1978.77-1571,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1711.308,1712.668,Could not be used.
1978.77-1571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1712.668,1717.908,"Mr. Lukoff, just stopping and asking for a driver’s license, how would they find a man in the trunk."
1978.77-1571,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1717.908,1721.489,Well that Mr. Justice Stevens is the entire point.
1978.77-1571,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1730.377,1746.611,"Let me add a fact, the victim hearing some conversation makes enough noise in the back of the trunk, so that the suspicions and the policemen are excited and aroused."
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,1746.611,1749.641,"There is obviously no question that they could assist the victim, that’s the first --"
1978.77-1571,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1749.641,1753.723,"They could assist the victim, just save the victim but not prosecute the kidnapper."
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,1753.723,1762.155,"I think the ultimate result Mr. Chief Justice is that that is in fact the case, because that evidence, because the seizure will be invalid."
1978.77-1571,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1762.155,1808.554,"But having, let me extend that beyond instead of a live victim, who could tap on the trunk of the car and get some attention, policemen having found some illegal, some contraband material, marijuana, heroin, guns, a bag full of currency in large amounts then decides to search the entire car, and he finds a dead body in the back and your theory he can’t be prosecuted for a possession of a dead body if that’s a crime in Delaware or for the murder if he is --"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,1808.554,1820.595,"Mr. Chief Justice, if I may, the example in the kidnapping case, if I may go to that for a moment, of course the victim could testify and there would be evidence from that victim."
1978.77-1571,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1822.104,1824.109,That’s why removed to somebody who to somebody who can’t testify.
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,1824.109,1827.642,"You cannot testify, that was my understanding of you change."
1978.77-1571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1827.642,1840.219,"Mr. Lukoff, do you understand the State of Delaware to be seeking to justify this practice on the basis that there’s some probability or at least the possibility that by stopping cars, they may find some dead bodies and guns and so forth on?"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,1841.994,1843.827,"Mr. Justice Stevens, that is not their justification as I see it."
1978.77-1571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1843.827,1857.794,I suppose if it was you could stop people in high crime areas and say do you have a gun and frisk them and a lot of ways you can find evidence of crime if you don’t have any limitation on the amount of stopping and searching you do.
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,1857.794,1859.003,That is in fact the case.
1978.77-1571,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1873.912,1881.098,"Suppose, you return to my question now and complete your answer about the body in the back of the car."
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,1881.098,1886.723,"Mr. Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, the difficulty of course is that, that is not the direct state interest."
1978.77-1571,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1921.443,1923.751,May I ask you question?
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,1926.893,1929.779,It’s my understanding Mr. Justice Powell that they have --
1978.77-1571,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1929.779,1931.038,Game.
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,1931.038,1937.038,"Fishing game, they have an environmental protection officer’s game warden, similar I believe there."
1978.77-1571,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1937.038,1938.149,Are you a hunter?
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,1938.149,1940.798,I’m not Mr. Justice Powell.
1978.77-1571,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1940.798,1959.546,Or perhaps you’re not familiar with the practice of game wardens of making random stops to see whether the hunters have licenses and also to see whether or not they have game in that bag that’s unauthorized to be killed at that time or perhaps duck hunters have killed wasn’t the limit.
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,1959.546,1966.726,I’m not familiar with that procedure although it would appear that if that is the case --
1978.77-1571,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1966.726,1972.629,I can tell you personally that’s the case.[Laughter]
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,1972.629,1973.062,I would --
1978.77-1571,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1973.062,1977.869,"Also true with Federal game wardens, they sometime use helicopters."
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,1977.869,1996.357,"It would be respondent’s position Mr. Justice Powell that there is a substantial interest if nothing else to protection of game which this kind of seizure or the person who is licensed, a specific hunting license to carry a weapon be it a, any antique weapon or a modern gun."
1978.77-1571,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1996.357,2004.591,"You’re not suggesting that protecting game is more important than protecting the public from unlicensed drivers, are you?"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2004.591,2006.176,From unlicensed drivers?
1978.77-1571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2016.358,2019.667,Let me ask you there are more drivers than there are hunters.
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2019.667,2021.394,That is also true Mr. Justice Marshall.
1978.77-1571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2021.394,2025.428,What describes you as a driver and you are not a hunter?
1978.77-1571,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2025.428,2035.207,"You wouldn’t think the conservation of game was more important than the control of marijuana and heroin and what not, would you?"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2035.207,2045.313,They are at least equally important Mr. Justice -- Chief Justice.
1978.77-1571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2071.312,2075.639,I thought you conceded that it was an important interest?
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2075.639,2086.844,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we did not concede that -- we concede that traffic safety is an important interest and that is the asserted interest that the state has presented here."
1978.77-1571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2086.844,2119.567,"Well, and the State of Delaware has determined apparently that the way it will further that interest is by the policy of random stops that apparently everyone has agreed upon and discussing that you describe it as arbitrary, the state describes it as random of when a police officer isn’t called out on any other thing more major, he simply will stop a car at random without any reason to believe that the person doesn’t have a license and without any articulable grounds for suspicion."
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2119.567,2122.275,That is what the state is attempting to get.
1978.77-1571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2122.275,2127.373,"Yeah, well and that’s their policy, that’s what --"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2127.373,2128.095,I would disagree sir.
1978.77-1571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2128.095,2130.641,Officer -- well that’s what Officer Vena did anyway.
1978.77-1571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2130.641,2135.266,[Inaudible] that’s the state policy and the policy of one police officer.
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2135.266,2138.07,That is not as I understand it the State policy Mr. Justice Marshall.
1978.77-1571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2160.544,2169.594,"Well, then let’s say, it was the policy of this particular officer to do that, no one disagrees about that?"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2169.594,2173.037,"Well, the disagreement is that he said he does it sometimes."
1978.77-1571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2181.676,2187.317,"Well, unless the Constitution forbids him from doing it, he’s entitled to it I take it?"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2187.317,2193.471,"Our position is that the Constitution in fact forbids him from doing it, the Fourth Amendment specifically."
1978.77-1571,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2193.471,2200.308,Would you say the same thing if there was a written policy for every officer just to make ten stops a day?
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2200.308,2202.091,That is true Mr. Justice White.
1978.77-1571,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2202.091,2206.408,"Then the random problem has no relevance here, it really doesn’t."
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2206.408,2212.045,"Mr. Chief Justice, the difficulty with the randomness is how you test whether it is truly random."
1978.77-1571,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2219.785,2224.548,"Well, can’t you assume that a policemen can count up to ten?"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2224.548,2226.515,We can assume that but we can’t assume that he is --
1978.77-1571,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2226.515,2231.098,"He doesn't an electronic device to stop every tenth car, does he?"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2231.098,2237.608,"He doesn’t need that Mr. Chief Justice, but the difficulty is that how do we check as to whether he in fact is doing it."
1978.77-1571,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2243.312,2266.821,"Well, your response to Mr. Justice White indicates that it wouldn’t make any difference for your case and the position you’re taking whether the State legislature had authorized the Attorney General to promulgate rules, guidelines and he promulgated them and said the officers may do thus and so, you’d still make the same points?"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2266.821,2271.046,Mr. Chief Justice that presents a slightly different problem.
1978.77-1571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2285.194,2319.572,"I think you’re response to the Chief Justice certainly differs from -- it shows that you differ at least from my understanding of constitutional law that, I would think that the action taken by the state here and represented by a state attorney, represents the policy of the state, albeit you cannot argue that it is a uniformly applied policy and that for the legislature placed its imprimatur on the policy, it doesn’t make it any different from a constitutional point of view?"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2319.572,2329.705,Well the -- Mr. Justice Rehnquist the state has not taken upon itself to give us any guidance.
1978.77-1571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2345.951,2351.232,Does the Supreme Court of Delaware have authority to speak for the State of Delaware?
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2351.232,2352.448,"Yes, it does Mr. Justice Marshall."
1978.77-1571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2352.448,2381.662,"Well, it said we ruled that before the government may single out an automobile to stop it, there must exist specific facts justifying the intrusion, conversely a random stop in the absence of a specific justifying facts is unreasonable and unconstitutional, that's the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware?"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2381.662,2383.754,"That’s correct Mr. Justice Marshall, I've spoken to that issue."
1978.77-1571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2383.754,2390.382,And does have as much authority as the designate of the Attorney General?
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2390.382,2391.448,At being one of the --
1978.77-1571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2391.448,2393.051,Or the policemen?
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2393.051,2395.927,"Clearly as much authority, if not greater."
1978.77-1571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2395.927,2397.183,I don’t understand --
1978.77-1571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2397.183,2408.76,"Would you say, would you say that the Supreme Court of Delaware was, felt itself constrained by the Federal Constitution or that it was simply ruling as a matter of state policy?"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2408.76,2415.665,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist that was brought out in our brief in our third point, the question of whether they were adequate state grounds."
1978.77-1571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2419.068,2423.927,"There’s not a federal case on that date, not one."
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2434.541,2441.053,"The court, the Supreme Court of Delaware did not refer to Brignoni, did not refer to Martinez to support his opinion."
1978.77-1571,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2441.166,2443.74,"Well, what’s the significance for the sentence?"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2457.092,2467.462,"Mr. Justice Brennan, the significance is that there’s an ambiguity in the Delaware opinion as to whether they’re relying solely upon a federal question or in fact, they were also relying upon independent state grounds."
1978.77-1571,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2467.462,2475.556,"Are you suggesting that that’s decision, that’s this decision rests both on the Delaware Constitution and the Fourth Amendment?"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2475.556,2477.454,It appears to rely upon on both but again it’s ambiguous.
1978.77-1571,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2477.454,2481.674,And if it does rely on both?
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2481.674,2485.231,"If it does rely upon adequate and independent state grounds, then this Court --"
1978.77-1571,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2485.231,2492.298,"If it does rely on both and it does rely on an adequate -- independent grounds, is that true?"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2492.298,2494.703,That’s the difficulty with the ambiguity.
1978.77-1571,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2504.616,2508.746,It’s clearly one constitutional –
1978.77-1571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2508.746,2532.003,"Mr. Lukoff, on the question that was raised before your opponent says the, suggests that the test, the ultimate test under the Fourth Amendment is one of reasonableness and in your view is there any difference in the strength of the presumption of reasonableness of state action depending on whether the policy determination that has been made by a state legislature on the one hand or by an isolated police officer on the other?"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2532.003,2552.892,"There maybe the presumption of legitimacy or stronger case when the legislature has spoken because the legislature we assume speaks for the people and perhaps the people have accepted this kind of intrusion, but we don’t know that in this case because Delaware has not spoken to this specific issue."
1978.77-1571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2594.939,2602.836,Why didn’t the Supreme Court of Delaware go off on that ground?
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2602.836,2609.312,The question of safety although raised didn’t come up quite as clearly perhaps as in this case?
1978.77-1571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2609.312,2615.519,"The statute, you’re referring to as a safety inspection not a driver’s license or motor vehicle registration statute?"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2615.519,2622.395,"It’s a safety inspection, but then the registration statute is also safety inspection Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1978.77-1571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2624.195,2627.191,But anyway the Supreme Court of Delaware didn’t rely on that statute --
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2627.191,2627.644,They did not.
1978.77-1571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2627.644,2631.023,-- the motor – the officer exceeded his authority under the statute?
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2631.023,2638.678,They didn’t rely upon that statute in reaching their opinion.
1978.77-1571,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2638.678,2642.218,Did you file a response to the petition for certiorari?
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2642.218,2643.695,"Yes, we did Mr. Justice Stewart."
1978.77-1571,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2643.695,2652.427,"I just didn’t seem to have it here on my papers, did -- in that response did -- I see it, it’s a – Let me read --"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2652.427,2654.34,That’s correct Mr. Justice Stewart.
1978.77-1571,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2654.34,2665.275,In that brief in opposition did you point out the possibility that this opinion of the Delaware Supreme Court may rest upon at quite an independent state ground?
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2665.275,2665.931,"Yes, we did."
1978.77-1571,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2665.931,2666.471,You did.
1978.77-1571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2666.471,2670.199,I think there’s a problem in the last paragraph.
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2670.199,2670.885,I’m sorry Mr. Justice --
1978.77-1571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2670.885,2682.088,The last paragraph of the Supreme Court of Delaware opinion says specifically the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States’ Constitution.
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2682.088,2685.584,"They do not speak of the State Constitution in the last paragraph, that is true."
1978.77-1571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2685.584,2688.788,But they did mention the Federal Constitution.
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2688.788,2690.172,They’ve clearly mentioned the Federal Constitution.
1978.77-1571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2690.172,2695.035,There is something I think the last paragraph of opinion is the opinion.
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2695.035,2704.05,"They also Mr. Justice Marshall in the first paragraph spoke about both a violation of the federal and state constitutional guarantees, in the first paragraph of the opinion."
1978.77-1571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2704.05,2708.412,"We hold that for, which --"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2708.412,2709.201,I agree.
1978.77-1571,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2709.201,2711.152,Okay.
1978.77-1571,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2711.152,2725.983,"What about the courts posing of the issue as being whether or not this stop violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment, that’s the specific issue."
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2725.983,2727.132,"Again, not referring to the State Constitution."
1978.77-1571,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2727.132,2742.653,On page 5 of the -- and I suppose you’d agree that the reason it violated the State Constitution was that it violated the Fourth Amendment?
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2742.653,2750.784,The Delaware Supreme Court interpreted the State Constitution as being essentially the same as -- the State Constitution provision as being essentially the same as the Fourth Amendment.
1978.77-1571,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2750.784,2758.033,Why do you say -- why do you they pose the legal issue as being whether the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments were being violated?
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2758.033,2780.752,"I believe that may have been how the question was asked, it was referred to on briefs by both sides and the issue was argued on a federal constitutional grounds below even though the State Constitution obviously has provisions which are comparable to the Federal Constitution."
1978.77-1571,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2810.857,2813.904,Are you suggesting that if it been high noon on a sunny day --
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2813.904,2815.877,It would not --
1978.77-1571,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2815.877,2817.133,-- it would be different?
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2817.133,2821.943,"Mr. Chief Justice, it wouldn’t be different in the constitutional aspects."
1978.77-1571,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2821.943,2825.913,"Well, isn’t that all we’re talking about here, the constitutional aspect?"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2825.913,2836.199,The nature of the – the reason I brought in the fact that it was nighttime is because it shows that this type of arbitrary seizure can be accomplished at anytime of the day or night.
1978.77-1571,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2836.199,2853.108,"That’s well -- one explanation and it seem to be an obvious one that at 12 midnight, a policeman probably has more time to make random stops than he does at high noon and therefore he might do it more often."
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2853.108,2854.312,"Mr. Chief Justice, I --"
1978.77-1571,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2854.312,2857.185,Actually it doesn’t make any difference to your constitutional point?
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2857.185,2858.72,"It does not, it does not."
1978.77-1571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2887.114,2891.776,"Your whole argument, which is like the state’s is a little bit of an amalgam of everything, isn’t it?"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2905.986,2912.144,"Whether or not it was day or night, in the balance, in the reasonableness balance not -- we submit make a difference."
1978.77-1571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2912.144,2917.914,"So you say then that the nighttime aspect, it simply doesn’t making any difference?"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2917.914,2919.247,It’s one additional factor.
1978.77-1571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2932.733,2950.37,"What if Officer Vena had testified that he made stops only between sunrise and sunset because he realized it was kind of a hairy experience for somebody to have the whirling red-light pull-up behind him at night, would you think your case is any weaker?"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2950.37,2952.497,"No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1978.77-1571,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2952.497,2960.332,What is your position as to Mr. Justice Powell’s suggestion of random checkpoint stops?
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2960.332,2984.261,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, the position of the defendant is that the random checkpoint stops which the State of Delaware specifically did not reach in the lower opinion or as this Court has held less intrusive in terms of the both subjective and the objective intrusiveness I believe that was held in Martinez --"
1978.77-1571,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2984.261,2987.115,"And so, what’s your position, that’s what I asked?"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2987.115,2988.109,Our position is that --
1978.77-1571,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2988.109,2989.14,I know it’s less intrusive --
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,2989.14,2993.353,"It’s less intrusive, but it raises other issues."
1978.77-1571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3035.94,3057.276,Isn’t there a factor on the other side of though there as to the reasonableness element in that if you try to conduct a road block on the Delaware Turnpike when it’s -- at a busy time you are not just going to intrude the same amount on the people you actually stop.
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,3068.658,3099.475,"That maybe true based -- but again the requirement I think if you use the road block type of -- assuming the road block is a valid constitutional mechanism, if you use it, it would appear important to say the least that the state setup guidelines as to when it can be used and what time so to lessen that kind of inconvenience that would perhaps come out of an I-95, the Delaware Turnpike rush hour problem."
1978.77-1571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3108.631,3122.372,So then as someone driving I-95 Delaware Turnpike during rush hour would feel confident that he at least would never be asked for his driver’s license or his motor vehicle registration because the state couldn’t setup a road block at that time.
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,3122.372,3144.074,"No I am not suggesting they can’t Mr. Justice Rehnquist but I believe the factors -- the time element is important in the decision as to whether a road block would be effective and there maybe a greater interest in lack of inconvenience -- in the inconvenience to the generally lawfully motoring public than there would be gained from, in a safety manner from stopping every vehicle."
1978.77-1571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3144.074,3148.527,Mr. Lukoff I have a rather serious question to ask.
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,3167.151,3171.123,"Mr. Justice Stevens, the record is ambiguous."
1978.77-1571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3174.354,3183.842,"And the officer testified, “I don’t believe he was the driver,” it indicates here as one arrested -- this page A12 is --"
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,3183.842,3202.438,"He talked about -- the officer did testify in that regard and -- but he wasn’t clear totally, and a part of that difficulty of course is that, it’s clear from the record that Mr. Prouse was the registered owner of the vehicle that he had a proprietary interest in the vehicle because of his ownership."
1978.77-1571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3221.569,3223.535,The record shows he was the owner of the vehicle?
1978.77-1571,1,21168,david_m_lukoff,,3223.535,3229.28,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1978.77-1571,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3329.568,3331.044,Very well Mr. Lukoff.
1978.77-1571,2,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,3333.96,3376.05,"Any comment that the state would like to make is again the respondents relied on the Brignoni heavily and I submit that this Court in Brignoni noted that it gave border patrol officers the right to stop cars for questioning for the enforcement of the immigration laws and it used the test, basically articulable suspicion test, and the reason I submit or the state submits the Court utilized that test was in that opinion it specifically states that there are objective criteria in which you can determine that articulable suspicion such as somebody might use a car of a certain length."
1978.77-1571,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3424.881,3434.288,Mr. Oberly would you comment on the suggestion that this decision may rest on the Delaware Constitution as well as the Federal Constitution?
1978.77-1571,2,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,3434.288,3440.079,"As I read the Delaware Supreme Court opinion, it simply said, “Our Article 1 Section 6 is like the Federal."
1978.77-1571,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3447.003,3460.685,"I know but it didn’t, I don’t read it as saying or do you, that we are compelled by the interpretations of the Fourth Amendment similarly to interpret the Delaware Constitution?"
1978.77-1571,2,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,3460.685,3468.687,"I don’t know whether they read it, as they were compelled to, but it’s my clear reading that opinion that they did not consider State Constitution separate, independently."
1978.77-1571,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3473.971,3477.017,"I wonder if it’s kind of case, we’ve had several of them."
1978.77-1571,2,19751,charles_m_oberly_iii,,3487.229,3499.199,"I would, don’t believe it necessary be appropriate I think the Supreme Court has very clearly indicated that they interpret this as a Fourteenth – a Fourth Amendment case, but I imagine that’s a possibility."
1978.77-1571,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3499.199,3499.903,Thank you gentlemen.
