1979.78-1840,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,53.768,We'll hear arguments next in City of Rome against the United States.
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,58.147,62.037,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,281.777,283.765,And reduction of nine wards to three.
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,283.765,285.784,And reduction of nine wards to three.
1979.78-1840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,285.784,300.857,"With the Commission or Council now still elected at large and still the same number of members, but requirement that they reside, some of them reside in each of the three wards; is that it?"
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,300.857,303.638,That is correct.
1979.78-1840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,467.064,473.193,And these annexations had been by way of an ordinance or by way of legislation in the State Legislature?
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,473.193,476.568,"Four of them had been State Legislature, and the balance were by ordinance."
1979.78-1840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,476.568,477.06,By ordinance.
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,477.06,479.364,That's correct.
1979.78-1840,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,526.844,531.692,"What is it, except for this situation, is it a biennial or election every two years?"
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,531.692,533.104,Yes.
1979.78-1840,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,534.315,535.112,Every four years.
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,535.112,535.524,Yes.
1979.78-1840,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,535.524,540.873,"And the terms at first, I guess, were of differing lengths, to introduce the staggered terms, but thereafter --"
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,540.873,542.823,"That's right, to initiate the staggered terms."
1979.78-1840,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,542.823,544.566,Thereafter they were four-year terms?
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,544.566,549.596,That's correct.
1979.78-1840,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,703.626,715.355,"Mr. Brinson, it's been a while since I read the briefs in this case, do I recollect correctly that the population makeup of your city is about three-quarters white and one-quarter Negro?"
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,715.355,716.867,"That is correct, almost exactly."
1979.78-1840,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,725.178,729.871,"You've read us that finding, have there been Negro office holders in the city?"
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,729.871,732.956,There have been no elected black officials in the City of Rome.
1979.78-1840,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,747.423,748.468,But neither one was elected?
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,748.468,749.6,Neither one was elected.
1979.78-1840,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,754.479,757.891,And the election was at large both before and after 1966?
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,757.891,763.887,That's correct.
1979.78-1840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,821.977,837.682,"You say, then, that Section 5 of the Fifteenth Amendment permits Congress to provide for implementation of the proscriptions of the amendment itself, but it does not permit it to enlarge the rights created by the Fifteenth Amendment?"
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,837.682,838.431,That is correct.
1979.78-1840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,845.479,850.137,"I'm sorry, I was confusing Section 5 with respect to those things, too."
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,850.137,862.044,"We say that the substitute provision, Section 4 of the Fifteenth Amendment, controls just what they can enforce, that Congress can only enforce the substantive provisions of the Fifteenth Amendment."
1979.78-1840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,862.044,866.523,Of course the court has held otherwise with respect to the Fourteenth Amendment.
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,867.455,869.179,"I don't agree that it has, I --"
1979.78-1840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,869.179,874.321,"Well, I thought it did, I didn't agree with the Court when it did so, but --"
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,874.321,877.145,We have analyzed the Katzenbach vs. Morgan case --
1979.78-1840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,877.145,878.288,That's the case I'm talking about.
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,878.288,881.106,And Oregon vs. Mitchell as well.
1979.78-1840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,937.582,952.076,"But then it wouldn't have been a sufficient answer in those cases for the State or city to have come back and said the literacy test, although they may have had discriminatory effect, were not discriminatory in purpose."
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,952.076,991.79,"The point that we make is that, as was noted in Oregon v. Mitchell, that there are three -- as Justice Black noted in Oregon v. Mitchell, the three things that Congress can do are to enforce the substantive provisions of the Constitution and cannot strip the States of their power -- I'm going to get into that -- but with reference to States, it cannot strip the States of their power, and can only enact appropriate legislation, appropriate with respect to the State power reserved to it."
1979.78-1840,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1072.879,1083.851,"As I get it, the only way for that would be for the Legislature to say We are doing this for the express purpose of discriminating against the minorities."
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1086.866,1087.925,"No, Mr. Justice Marshall, --"
1979.78-1840,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1087.925,1088.457,Thank you.
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1088.457,1091.447,-- it is not.
1979.78-1840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1130.191,1139.428,"And the Civil Rights Act of 1954 and specifically Title VII thereof was enacted under the commerce clause power, I suppose?"
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1139.428,1143.984,I understand that it has been held to be also enacted under the Fourteenth Amendment.
1979.78-1840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1143.984,1145.92,"Well, the amendments maybe."
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1145.92,1147.668,Right.
1979.78-1840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1147.668,1151.03,"But they would be, I suppose, under the commerce power, at least arguably."
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1151.03,1152.347,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1840,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1213.766,1215.776,"That's Article IV, Section 4."
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1215.776,1217.314,The guaranty clause.
1979.78-1840,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1217.314,1218.573,For the republican form of government.
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1218.573,1220.475,That's correct.
1979.78-1840,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1379.884,1388.963,"So you submit that the effect language in the section is unsupported, is unsupportable under the Constitution?"
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1388.963,1398.197,"We do not, Your Honor; we have suggested to the Court a construction of the statute which would be within our argument about the constitutionality."
1979.78-1840,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1416.801,1425.166,"Well, you do argue that Congress has no power. --"
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1425.166,1425.899,We do.
1979.78-1840,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1425.899,1431.321,-- to prohibit electoral changes that have no discriminatory purpose?
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1431.321,1434.491,"We do indeed argue that, Your Honor, except that we argue --"
1979.78-1840,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1434.491,1438.048,Why do you argue that at all?
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1438.048,1449.788,"Because we feel that the Congress -- unless the statute is interpreted the way we suggested, that it has expanded those limitations of Section 1."
1979.78-1840,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1449.788,1463.332,"So you do argue, then, that Congress had -- that the effect language in Section 5 as it permits -- if it forbids changes without discriminatory purposes, unconstitutional?"
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1463.332,1464.573,"No, sir, we argue --"
1979.78-1840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1464.573,1476.74,"Well, if the effect language bans changes that took place without discriminatory purpose, you say that the effect language is unconstitutional."
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1476.74,1477.573,That's correct.
1979.78-1840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1484.123,1487.164,And you say we have never hold otherwise?
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1487.164,1488.387,I don't believe this Court has.
1979.78-1840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1496.064,1497.988,What about Beer?
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1497.988,1507.285,"In beer there was -- it was at least noted in the dissent that there was purposeful discrimination, that it was involved."
1979.78-1840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1507.285,1509.224,"Well, that's nice, talking about the dissent."
1979.78-1840,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1514.406,1516.362,What about the majority?
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1516.362,1540.977,"Well, in that case, Your Honor, I think the fact that there had been discrimination in the city, there had been a history of discrimination, but in looking to effect, the issue was not before the Court at the time, but in looking at the effect, there was the cognizance that the city had had a history of racial discrimination."
1979.78-1840,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1540.977,1552.014,"We wouldn't reach a constitutional claim, I take it, if there was some nonconstitutional basis upon which we could decide the case?"
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1552.014,1553.934,I believe that would be correct.
1979.78-1840,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1553.934,1561.125,And we reviewed a three-judge court's findings on a clearly erroneous basis?
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1561.125,1571.883,"The findings in this case would support our proposition, because they are exactly and specifically that we have no discriminatory purpose."
1979.78-1840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1571.883,1577.486,"Well, except that that necessarily includes your constitutional premise."
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1594.975,1600.907,"Well, we do very well, that is still another argument that we made, that there is no effect under the Act."
1979.78-1840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1600.907,1604.412,"Well, that would not require any constitutional holding on our part."
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1604.412,1605.308,That's correct.
1979.78-1840,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1605.308,1608.459,But that would require us to overturn the finding of the District Court?
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1608.459,1609.202,"Yes, it would."
1979.78-1840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1609.202,1615.197,"And therefore, at least we would be obliged to find that that finding was clearly erroneous, I suppose?"
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1615.197,1618.17,That's correct.
1979.78-1840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1662.516,1676.317,"Is it -- more fundamentally, Mr. Brinson, do you contend that this particular constitutional issue was not decided in Katzenbach, in South Carolina against Katzenbach?"
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1684.184,1712.219,"It was not decided, we contend, Your Honor, because the question, first of all, was not before the Court, and it is clear from the Court's decision that it was considering purposeful discrimination; that those were the evils to which it was directing -- to which Congress was directing the Act, and the reasons for justifying the Act were the unique circumstances existing at the time."
1979.78-1840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1737.958,1739.746,In South Carolina against Katzenbach?
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1739.746,1740.306,Correct.
1979.78-1840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1740.306,1747.279,"And you're telling us now they have changed circumstances, which would imply that you're conceding that this issue was decided in Katzenbach."
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1747.279,1747.496,"No, sir."
1979.78-1840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1747.496,1748.879,That's what confuses me.
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1748.879,1751.023,"Well, we do not concede that issue, but we say that --"
1979.78-1840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1751.023,1757.686,"Well, even if the conditions have not been changed, you're telling us that in any event this is a new question before this Court."
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1757.686,1759.231,I am saying in any event.
1979.78-1840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1759.231,1759.782,Yes.
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1759.782,1760.929,I am saying that.
1979.78-1840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1786.322,1789.39,"That wasn't true in Morgan v. Katzenbach, though."
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1794.107,1808.817,"No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but the claim there was that non-English speaking people had been intentionally discriminated against with respect to city services, or, rather, services, governmental services."
1979.78-1840,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1851.548,1853.472,"Your time has expired now, Mr. Brinson."
1979.78-1840,0,38615,robert_m_brinson,,1853.472,1856.338,Thank you.
1979.78-1840,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1856.338,1864.491,Mr. Wallace.
1979.78-1840,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1864.491,1868.509,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1840,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1888.778,1894.742,Do you think we made a mistake in noting probable jurisdiction then?
1979.78-1840,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1894.742,1897.787,"Well, that is not for me to say, Mr. Justice."
1979.78-1840,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2026.564,2032.15,"Mr. Wallace, one of your statements was annexation of predominantly white areas."
1979.78-1840,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2041.884,2050.926,"In those, in 47 of the 60 annexations, the Attorney General precleared them after that became apparent."
1979.78-1840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2070.614,2073.453,Does that change the percentage very much?
1979.78-1840,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2073.453,2076.338,"Not very much, but measurably, Your Honor."
1979.78-1840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2076.338,2079.614,Less than one percent?
1979.78-1840,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2079.614,2092.952,"It was a total of two percent; it was a one percent increase in white registered voters, and a one percent decrease in the percentage of black registered voters for a difference of two percent."
1979.78-1840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2109.025,2114.468,You think that ties in with the holding in Richmond?
1979.78-1840,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2114.468,2125.258,"It does tie in with the holding in Richmond, Mr. Justice, but it ties in even more closely with the holding in the City of Petersburg."
1979.78-1840,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2278.11,2286.785,"Isn't it fairly well settled that when we affirm a judgment in the District Court we don't affirm the reasoning, we simply affirm the holding?"
1979.78-1840,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2286.785,2324.579,"That the Court does not necessarily affirm the reasoning, and that is why I thought it wise to take a look and see whether there's some other conceivable basis for the affirmance, and why I'd like, if the Court please, to turn now to pages 6 and 7 of that motion to affirm, because I think that the government there fairly laid bare exactly what was at issue in this appeal, based on the findings that had been made by the District Court in the holding there."
1979.78-1840,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2396.08,2410.164,"Well, is it your position that although we do not adopt the opinion of the District Court when we summarily affirm we adopt the statement of the government's motion to affirm?"
1979.78-1840,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2410.164,2412.618,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
1979.78-1840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2465.127,2481.257,"Mr. Wallace, it's sort of hard to refresh my recollection, because I wasn't here; but on page 8 of your motion you point out that in that case the majority white Council had been generally unresponsive to the expressed needs and desires of the black community, and we have a precisely opposite finding in this case, don't we?"
1979.78-1840,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2481.257,2484.177,"Well, I'm aware of that difference between the two cases."
1979.78-1840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2484.177,2487.259,"That difference could have been critical, couldn't it?"
1979.78-1840,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2487.259,2502.988,"There was a different finding here, which arguably, could make a difference either in the relief that would be appropriate or in the finding of whether there was a retrogressive effect."
1979.78-1840,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2754.531,2762.2,Why does it treat the Board of Education different from the City Commissioners with respect to annexation?
1979.78-1840,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2762.2,2775.825,"Well, the difference is because of a residency requirement for City Commission elections, which did not exist under the old procedure for the Board of Education election."
1979.78-1840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2964.474,2965.789,In that case in that case.
1979.78-1840,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2965.789,2967.173,In that case.
1979.78-1840,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3333.569,3335.735,"Mr. Wallace, may I interrupt?"
1979.78-1840,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3351.232,3359.477,"Well, there is a provision in the Act for the bringing of a declaratory judgment action to exempt itself from the coverage --"
1979.78-1840,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3359.477,3361.557,I understand that.
1979.78-1840,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3365.911,3371.89,"The provision is set out on page 43 of our brief, Mr. Justice."
1979.78-1840,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3386.678,3393.461,"Does that mean if one county failed to comply with that, that the rest of the State would remain under the Act?"
1979.78-1840,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3393.461,3405.482,"That question has not been decided by a court, but so far as I'm aware that would be the meaning of it, because there is no provision for piecemeal bail-outs which would be for the reasons we stated a very impractical way to proceed."
1979.78-1840,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3405.482,3413.684,So that the smallest unit in a State can keep the entire State under the Act indefinitely?
1979.78-1840,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3413.684,3416.834,"Well, the Act, of course, is a temporary one."
1979.78-1840,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3416.834,3418.204,The Act is temporary?
1979.78-1840,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3418.204,3419.44,"Well, it extended --"
1979.78-1840,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3419.44,3421.462,That's what Katzenbach said.
1979.78-1840,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3421.462,3430.041,"It was extended by Congress in 1975 to seven additional years, so it presently expires in 1982."
1979.78-1840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3450.269,3461.183,"Mr. Wallace, if you're correct that the city can't bring an action to bail out, and we agree with you, is the case over?"
1979.78-1840,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3462.814,3468.511,"Well, the city is saying that the District Court erred in refusing to preclear its changes."
1979.78-1840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3480.745,3483.538,So that we must reach the other issue?
1979.78-1840,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3483.538,3483.963,Yes.
1979.78-1840,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3487.649,3488.253,"Thank you, gentlemen."
