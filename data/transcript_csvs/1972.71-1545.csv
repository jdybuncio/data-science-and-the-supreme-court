1972.71-1545,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,23.172,"We'll hear arguments next in 71-1545, Butz against Glover Livestock Commission."
1972.71-1545,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,27.189,30.397,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1972.71-1545,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,240.278,245.096,They don't -- their commission isn't based on a percentage of the sale price?
1972.71-1545,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,245.096,253.075,"It's based -- and I think that in the record there is a schedule of the commission, that is based in part on the weight of the cattle."
1972.71-1545,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,268.521,272.044,To that extent then it would be against their interest to short-weigh?
1972.71-1545,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,272.044,293.603,"Only if the short-weighing brought the weight down from 100-weight category into a lower one and in fact, in this case, none of the cattle short-weighed in fact brought the weight down from 100-weight category to another, so that there was no loss in commissions resulting from the short-weighing."
1972.71-1545,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,325.615,336.032,"Is there any concession here by Glover, however, that the short-weighed was not due to negligence in this case?"
1972.71-1545,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,336.032,344.421,"No, I believe that they have consistently maintained that their infractions of the Act where not intentional."
1972.71-1545,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,346.512,354.087,And denied that they were willful or do you distinguish between intentional and willful?
1972.71-1545,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,354.087,358.891,"Yes, we do distinguish between intentional and willful as did the Court of Appeals."
1972.71-1545,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,366.499,370.473,I think you know what you are doing?
1972.71-1545,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,373.142,383.538,"Well, I believe that it means that if you act in careless disregard of your statutory responsibilities, that's considered to be willfulness for purposes of the Act."
1972.71-1545,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,388.209,390.183,What is intentional?
1972.71-1545,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,390.183,400.063,"Well, I suppose that in this context, intentional would mean that, for example, the respondent ordered its weigh master to weigh the cattle at less then their true weight."
1972.71-1545,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,400.063,406.089,And there is no concession for it being intentional?
1972.71-1545,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,406.089,406.633,That's correct.
1972.71-1545,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,406.633,409.943,Is there a concession that they were willful?
1972.71-1545,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,409.943,427.192,"I believe so, in the sense that the respondent has conceded that the suspension here was within the statutory authority of the Secretary, and of course, it would not be if the act where not committed willfully, in other words, not a violation of the Act."
1972.71-1545,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,447.739,454.395,"As a matter of fact, did we limit the grant here only to the remedy?"
1972.71-1545,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,458.851,464.305,I don't recall Mr. Chief Justice.
1972.71-1545,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,472.852,476.464,There really is only one issue in the case?
1972.71-1545,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,476.464,480.531,And that's the proper scope of reviewing how it is applied.
1972.71-1545,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,743.534,752.699,What if -- Judge Stevens in his opinion for the Court of Appeals said this was unconscionable.
1972.71-1545,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,760.668,761.845,"Well, I think that there must be some --"
1972.71-1545,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,761.845,763.938,Just a matter of language?
1972.71-1545,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,763.938,766.123,I think there must be some reasoned elaboration.
1972.71-1545,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,766.123,768.791,"Well, he gave the reason why he thought it was unconscionable?"
1972.71-1545,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,768.791,769.012,Yes.
1972.71-1545,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,802.692,810.867,"What if he had simply said that the firm had abused its discretion, that, that would be equally conclusory, wouldn't it?"
1972.71-1545,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,810.867,811.632,That's correct.
1972.71-1545,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,827.158,829.936,The statute they use is all right here?
1972.71-1545,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,829.936,830.374,No.
1972.71-1545,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,830.374,831.46,Only their explanations?
1972.71-1545,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,831.46,831.628,No.
1972.71-1545,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1122.117,1140.672,"Now, it seems to me in your brief Mr. Jones, you emphasized that there had been prior violations and that there had been three or four occasions when the authorities of Secretary staff warned Glover about violations."
1972.71-1545,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1140.672,1143.426,"That's correct Mr. Chief Justice, there were repeated violations."
1972.71-1545,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1143.426,1147.544,I don't find that the Court of Appeals made any mention of that or perhaps --
1972.71-1545,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1147.544,1159.746,"I think the court overlooked that as it did I think many other things as well, relating to the seriousness of this offense and to the uniformity of the sanctions which the Secretary has implied in the past."
1972.71-1545,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1169.197,1176.004,The upshot was that no punishment or remedy whatsoever was to be imposed?
1972.71-1545,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1176.004,1176.348,No.
1972.71-1545,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1179.117,1179.775,That's all?
1972.71-1545,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1179.775,1181.109,That's all.
1972.71-1545,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1183.614,1188.505,Very well.
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,1188.505,1189.424,May it please --
1972.71-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1189.424,1190.315,Eilbott.
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,1190.315,1198.527,"-- the Chief Justice and may it please Your Honors, gentlemen of the Court."
1972.71-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1264.487,1272.68,"Yeah, well I used to litigate against small town lawyers (Inaudible) and it was almost (Inaudible)[Attempt to Laughter]"
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,1272.68,1274.073,"Well, that's what I hope to do to Mr. Jones."
1972.71-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1274.073,1275.355,That is actually what I thought.
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,1275.355,1277.076,Yes sir.[Laughter]
1972.71-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1281.243,1290.125,"Small town lawyer, counsel, is like a lawyer who walks into the courtroom with just one law book, and that's the fellow that --"
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,1290.125,1294.401,I wish I had one law book Your Honor.[Laughter]
1972.71-1545,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1418.284,1421.763,Did he testify it was true with scales all over the country?
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,1421.763,1426.544,"That is correct, Your Honor, he certainly did Justice Marshall."
1972.71-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1433.561,1435.895,"We will resume there after lunch, counsel."
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,1435.895,1442.442,Yes sir.[Luncheon Recess]
1972.71-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1442.442,1444.635,"Counsel, you may continue."
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,1444.635,1450.947,"May it please the Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1972.71-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1487.661,1490.844,"How many working days, business days would that actually be?"
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,1490.844,1493.469,"Your Honor, that's about three working days."
1972.71-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1592.881,1596.669,"I think it wasn't the Solicitor General, it was my suggestion."
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,1596.669,1596.921,Well then --
1972.71-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1596.921,1599.956,"In inquiry, I said I couldn't find it --"
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,1599.956,1602.042,Well --
1972.71-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1602.042,1602.604,In reading it on the bench.
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,1602.604,1631.03,"If Your Honor would look at Appendix A to the petition for writ of certiorari, on Page 16, you would find Glover is an operator of a posted stockyard in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, registered so forth, to sell livestock, honored by June 2, 1964, July 26, 1966, and June 20, 1967, representatives of the USDA conducted investigations of so forth and so on, and it goes on."
1972.71-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2013.628,2030.141,"Mr. Eilbott, you were -- at least as I follow your argument, you are arguing and rearguing an element on which the Court of Appeals has found against you, and you have -- you have no cross appeal here."
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2032.267,2033.249,Mr. Chief Justice --
1972.71-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2033.249,2033.72,Let me read this first.
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2033.72,2035.735,Excuse me sir.
1972.71-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2035.735,2050.576,"All evidence considered the Hearing Examiner crediting the evidence that the cattle reweighed had no access to food and water could properly conclude that they had been underweighed by Glover, and now that's just one of several items."
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2062.706,2079.699,"Yes sir, Mr. Chief Justice, and that was what I was prepared to argue until I came this morning, and I found that it was stated that the Court of Appeals had not considered this, that, and the other, and I knew the Court of Appeals had, because it was in their opinion."
1972.71-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2275.389,2290.44,"What difference, I wonder, would it make whether they were tried actually, tried out on a contested basis or whether they in fact entered a guilty plea in terms of the penalty?"
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2290.44,2325.273,"Your Honor, we find no case, and we have asked the department to show us a case in which it has been tried or otherwise where they have made a finding that -- had not made a finding that it was intentional and suspended of business, not a one and I say to you today, standing in the Supreme Court of the United States, we have not found a single case."
1972.71-1545,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2339.322,2342.899,Suppose the Court of Appeals sent it back for a finding?
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2342.899,2343.747,I beg your pardon?
1972.71-1545,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2343.747,2348.521,If the Court of Appeals sent it back for a finding?
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2348.521,2352.805,I don't think there was evidence there Justice Marshall to support such a finding.
1972.71-1545,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2353.41,2360.932,"Could they have sent it back to the administrative agency to make appropriate finding, one way or the other?"
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2360.932,2365.862,"Yes sir, and if they did, I think they could, yes."
1972.71-1545,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2367.111,2371.174,"But instead, they took over the administrative agency’s charge?"
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2371.174,2373.746,They may have taken it over only because they found --
1972.71-1545,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2373.746,2379.197,You called it the administrative agency’s job but do they have authority to do that?
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2379.197,2387.529,"I think they do, unless you would read the Stockyard and Packers Act as a complete abrogation of judicial review."
1972.71-1545,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2387.529,2389.555,I am just talking about the general administrative law.
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2389.555,2391.656,I understand that.
1972.71-1545,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2391.656,2394.713,Wouldn't the Act makes it so different?
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2394.713,2395.885,What makes it --
1972.71-1545,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2395.885,2399.607,So different from the regular Administrative Procedure Act?
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2399.607,2405.476,"I think the Eight Circuit could have sent it back, but they chose to say --"
1972.71-1545,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2405.476,2409.662,"Well, would you object to us suggesting that the Eight Circuit send it back?"
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2409.662,2415.597,That would be just like throwing us back to the lines from which we came.
1972.71-1545,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2425.153,2428.43,I am asking about what relief you're entitled to?
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2428.43,2429.29,I am entitled to a relief --
1972.71-1545,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2429.29,2433.724,You want this Court to say that you're just not guilty of doing anything?
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2433.724,2435.72,No sir.
1972.71-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2503.803,2509.433,"You are saying that since there has been violation of the, what, the Secretary’s own rules?"
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2509.433,2511.066,Yes sir.
1972.71-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2511.066,2516.831,"If he for the first time imposed the suspension, was it not an intention of violation?"
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2516.831,2517.445,That's correct.
1972.71-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2522.776,2525.701,"Well, he imposed the penalty though?"
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2525.701,2532.388,"Yes sir, and his own judicial review officer reduced it to 10 days."
1972.71-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2532.388,2539.679,But you are saying that the -- because this is the first time the sentence (Inaudible)?
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2539.679,2543.792,"Then it's discrimination, unless he gives a reason why we should be discriminated again."
1972.71-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2543.792,2556.464,"Then you have – where you have non-intentional, non-intentional violation, you either get them both -- either suspend them both or not suspend them both?"
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2556.464,2559.486,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1972.71-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2561.516,2565.688,He could be starting on a program of suspending everybody?
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2565.688,2567.517,What he didn't start before he got to us?
1972.71-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2567.517,2569.771,He might have changed his mind.
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2569.771,2577.36,"Well, he may have changed his mind, then he should have given us a reason why we out of all of the world should be signaled out."
1972.71-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2589.929,2591.39,"Well, I don't know, that isn't an issue here right now."
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2591.39,2594.957,"I know that's not the issue, but that's all part of the background."
1972.71-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2594.957,2596.637,I am not even sure that's part of the record.
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2596.637,2598.371,"Yes, it is."
1972.71-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2602.991,2605.016,But not with respect to the --
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2605.016,2619.042,"No, but I can say to you, I ask -- I asked Prezel (ph), one of the two government witnesses whether or not he had any proof whatsoever that we intentionally violated this Act, and he said no."
1972.71-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2619.042,2622.216,What do you understand willful means in terms of that?
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2622.216,2628.486,"What I understand willful means could be flagrant negligence, but that's far different from intentional."
1972.71-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2628.486,2632.156,"Oh yes, but is that all that willful means?"
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2632.156,2633.135,Yes sir.
1972.71-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2637.65,2639.709,You didn't know you were short-weighing?
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2639.709,2640.286,That's correct.
1972.71-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2640.286,2644.087,"You did one physical action of going through and you were careless, that's --"
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2644.087,2654.592,"We were careless, but we also, when we were careless, we took every step we knew to find out what was wrong."
1972.71-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2660.525,2665.029,"Well, whatever the reason, but nevertheless (Inaudible)"
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2665.029,2677.283,"The Eight Circuit found we were careless, but the Eight Circuit refused to find that we intentionally did what we did, and the Eight Circuit pointed out that the Secretary had held that uniformity was a situation."
1972.71-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2677.283,2687.945,So you're saying that the Secretary may not suspend a willful violator?
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2687.945,2689.969,Unless --
1972.71-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2689.969,2690.103,Well --
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2690.103,2697.362,"Unless he gives adequate reason, according to his own opinions."
1972.71-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2697.362,2702.955,That he has to put him with the negligence of violator rather than with the intentional?
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2702.955,2730.141,"Yes sir, but if he puts him only with the negligent violator, then it's my position that the Department of Agriculture or the Secretary must show a reason for doing that, otherwise all others who have been found guilty only of negligence, there has been nothing, but a cease and desist order, why suddenly us?"
1972.71-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2730.141,2731.099,"Well, on that score --"
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2731.099,2733.632,"And if he was going to make -- pardon, may I finish?"
1972.71-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2733.632,2734.623,"Fine, you finish."
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2734.623,2740.346,"If he was going to make a new rule, then why didn't he say so?"
1972.71-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2740.346,2773.197,"Alright, on that point, it's a common occurrence in traffic courts, for example, where the traffic judge is confronted with hundreds and hundreds of cases, sees a mounting epidemic almost of either drunken driving or speeding or some such thing, and finally, the last straw comes, and on that day he starts imposing more severe sentences to make an example out of either a drunk driver or a speeder or what not?"
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2773.197,2773.563,"Now, Mr. Chief Justice --"
1972.71-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2773.563,2786.719,"Now, do you think the judge; that's what you have here must make some explanation that this situation is getting so severe that I am tired of this underweighing and we are going to make an example out of Glover?"
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2786.719,2786.867,Well --
1972.71-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2786.867,2788.484,Do you think he is going to articulate that?
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2788.484,2792.025,You are getting down on my level now Mr. Chief Justice.
1972.71-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2805.598,2808.453,"Let's assume he didn't though, that's the assumption, let's assume he just did --"
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2808.453,2813.179,I don't think he'd ever do it.
1972.71-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2813.746,2815.438,"Well, they do it quite regularly."
1972.71-1545,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2815.438,2818.39,But assuming he did?
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2818.39,2829.377,"Then assuming he did, if it was within his power, he had that right, but it would certainly be discriminatory against the first man he did it to, Mr. Marshall."
1972.71-1545,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2829.377,2830.665,(Inaudible)
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2830.665,2831.608,Sir?
1972.71-1545,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2831.608,2834.274,(Inaudible) but not necessarily.
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2834.274,2834.604,No.
1972.71-1545,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2841.61,2844.438,(Inaudible)
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2844.438,2882.196,"If he had announced the caveat, then I would say it was not discrimination, but I say in all fairness that when you, out of a great line of cases, none of which have ever imposed a suspension unless there be found an intentional violation, then suddenly you do that, you are saying to me and to my clients, you are a bunch of crooks."
1972.71-1545,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2882.196,2884.813,But that wouldn't go for the second?
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2884.813,2890.507,"Not if I had been told why and it had been told to me, it wouldn't be a first impression."
1972.71-1545,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2890.507,2892.727,You take that position because they do it.
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2897.825,2898.98,Yes.
1972.71-1545,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2898.98,2901.57,I see.
1972.71-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2901.57,2907.355,"I never thought they could be second if you set the first one aside, it would always be a first?"
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2907.355,2913.797,"But Mr. Justice White, my position simply is --"
1972.71-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2913.797,2918.74,"If you set it aside and say it is unjustified, and this will again be the first?"
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2918.74,2923.345,"The Eight Circuit didn't say it was unjustified, they found it unconscionable."
1972.71-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2938.543,2942.413,"And the question in the case is whether Congress gave them that power really, isn't it?"
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,2942.413,2943.98,"Yes, that is."
1972.71-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2989.164,3006.511,"Well, would it be fair to assume that since you indicate they were news releases, the word has gotten around in the industry, among the dealers, would it be fair to assume that perhaps they're being a little more careful after the experience of Glover and the litigation that's ensued?"
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,3006.511,3016.911,"Mr. Chief Justice, I do not propose to deal in levity with you, but it would have been easier if they just chopped off one of our hands, then maybe it might have been a better lesson."
1972.71-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3016.911,3017.86,"Well, I am speaking of others."
1972.71-1545,1,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,3019.529,3032.014,"I don't think it's had any effect on anybody besides Glover Livestock, and that's the only one that has ever been inspected as far as I know in the State of Arkansas; it certainly was up to the day we were inspected."
1972.71-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3043.304,3044.557,Thank you Mr. Eilbott.
1972.71-1545,2,33866,keith_a_jones,,3048.243,3054.4,I would just like to dispel one misimpression.
1972.71-1545,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3080.552,3084.924,A little -- give us a little time to find that would you Mr. Jones.

1972.71-1545,2,33866,keith_a_jones,,3171.384,3178.613,"I can't answer that with confidence, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but I assume that he could have been called."
1972.71-1545,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3214.764,3215.551,Thank you.
1972.71-1545,3,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,3216.675,3219.207,Can I have one minute of what you have.[Laughter]
1972.71-1545,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3219.207,3222.11,"No, we don't permit a surrebuttal counsel."
1972.71-1545,3,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,3222.11,3222.952,Thank you.
1972.71-1545,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3225.634,3226.494,Very well.
1972.71-1545,3,39168,r_a_eilbott_jr,,3226.494,3228.124,(Voice Overlap) from the court.
1972.71-1545,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3228.124,3229.097,Case is submitted.
