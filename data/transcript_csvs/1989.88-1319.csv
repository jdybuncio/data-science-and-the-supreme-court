1989.88-1319,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.847,"We'll hear argument next in Number 88-1319, Commissioner of Internal Revenue versus Indianapolis Power & Light Company."
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,19.675,24.586,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1319,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,82.114,98.216,"Mr. Wallace, do you concede that under the applicable utility regulations and general accounting principles, that these deposits have to be recorded as liabilities of the company?"
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,98.216,114.367,"--Well, I concede that that is an accepted accounting practice which the company is following, insofar as I am aware that is the practice approved by the public service commission."
1989.88-1319,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,127.096,137.464,"Then, it seems strange then that the government would take the position that it does here on the taxability of these deposits."
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,145.189,147.321,"No, we would not."
1989.88-1319,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,166.733,169.217,"Why does it depend upon that, Mr. Wallace?"
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,182.927,199.126,"Well, under our tax system, and in particular for an accrual basis taxpayer, it has to have a right to the use of the monies within its own dominion and control."
1989.88-1319,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,209.103,221.572,"I suggest that in establishing that, they are not looking to economic reality, which is what you argue we ought to look to for the rest of the case, and not to intent or to such... such other matters."
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,221.572,237.133,"Well, that is a form of economic reality, Justice Scalia, in that that means that the company can use the monies as its own, as it sees fit, to produce whatever earnings it can produce--"
1989.88-1319,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,237.133,241.948,But you are taxing those earnings... you began your presentation by saying that is not at issue--
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,241.948,242.719,--That is correct.
1989.88-1319,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,242.719,244.239,--whether... what happens to the earnings from them.
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,270.972,279.046,"Perhaps there would be a basis for making such an argument, but that is not the position the Commissioner has taken."
1989.88-1319,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,293.228,295.622,"Mr. Wallace, you mentioned this was a reviewed decision."
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,298.463,299.393,--It was unanimous.
1989.88-1319,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,320.717,326.912,Do you have any explanation why it has taken so long to get this case here?
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,333.266,344.504,"Well, these things do tend to get sorted out many years after the taxable years at issue."
1989.88-1319,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,366.883,374.9,"Well, it gets so that the interest sometimes exceeds the basic tax, and this certainly isn't justice, normally."
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,374.9,384.636,"--Well, in any event the issue is now before this Court for resolution."
1989.88-1319,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,658.931,664.136,"And your position is that the deposits here should be treated as advance payments, I take it?"
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,664.136,666.918,That is precisely our position.
1989.88-1319,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,666.918,672.191,"But the problem I have with that, or maybe it isn't a problem... you tell me if I am wrong."
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,690.983,692.965,That... that is correct.
1989.88-1319,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,692.965,693.105,All right.
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,702.221,707.036,"Well, there is--"
1989.88-1319,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,707.036,713.083,And so it seems to me that the government is getting more under the security deposit theory than it would under the advance payment theory.
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,716.634,723.648,--It operates precisely the way an advance payment operates.
1989.88-1319,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,723.648,726.292,But an advance payment is attributable to a month.
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,729.172,730.653,"Well, that is correct."
1989.88-1319,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,733.066,734.108,So you are getting an extra month.
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,734.108,748.38,"--Well, but the security deposit, when it would be applied against a month in which the customer defaults in his obligation, or when it is refunded, the taxpayer would get the same credit for it."
1989.88-1319,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,750.53,757.635,"Well, at the very end of the cycle... at the very end of the cycle it works out, although, of course, at that point the utility now has a new customer and it starts all over again."
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,757.635,760.815,"--Well, that might not be the very end of the cycle."
1989.88-1319,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,833.634,852.057,"Mr. Wallace, what would you do with a security deposit that secures both the covenants in a normal security deposit and also could be applied to the last month's rent, if unpaid... or services?"
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,852.057,867.188,"Well, that is the difficult factual question that sometimes has to be determined in these cases, as the court of appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in the City Gas Company recognized--"
1989.88-1319,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,867.188,872.511,And what test would you propose be applied to one of these mixed applicability cases?
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,872.511,887.801,"--We agree completely with the court of appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in the City Gas Company, which agreed with the Commissioner's position in that case, that the primary purpose of the particular deposit is determinative."
1989.88-1319,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,946.712,958.629,"Mr. Wallace, could you... I don't understand how you reconciled the Commissioner's Revenue Ruling 79-229 with what you are urging upon us here."
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1004.4,1024.536,"Well, there are, as a matter of fact, many exceptions that have been developed in revenue rulings and in a revenue procedure that the Commission has adopted and in statutes that Congress has enacted, that allow deferral--"
1989.88-1319,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1024.536,1025.314,Statutes... Congress is allowed to be inconsistent.
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1027.337,1048.25,"--that allow deferral of payments under which, you know, the possible full sweep of the holdings of this Court in the trilogy of cases I have mentioned has been receded from."
1989.88-1319,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1075.597,1078.679,"If I understand you, you are acknowledging it is inconsistent."
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1078.679,1100.053,"Well, there may be an inconsistency in the... in the sense that the Commissioner found that in that factual context it was necessary to make a different type of factual inquiry, and there would be different material questions."
1989.88-1319,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1173.493,1180.636,But you wouldn't treat... you wouldn't treat the purchaser differently if it were a utility company as opposed to a livestock dealer.
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1182.909,1203.683,"That is correct, and... but, what is required in each case is to determine what the purpose of the particular receipt is."
1989.88-1319,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1252.348,1264.775,"Mr. Wallace, the Seventh Circuit, as I understand it, took the position that you have to look at the facts and circumstances of each case, and they upheld the determination of the tax court."
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1269.038,1291.502,"Well, the facts and circumstances that they looked at, and that the tax court looked at, seem immaterial to us, and therefor will give rise, if each court is to look at them in each case, to erratic results that don't reflect the economic reality of the situation."
1989.88-1319,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1291.502,1299.629,"Well, do you... does your rule give one uniform result for all deposits required by utility companies from customers?"
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1299.629,1331.67,"It... it does once a determination is made that the deposit is primarily for the purpose of assuring payment for goods or services to be delivered in the future, and that the deposit is not required to be escrowed or otherwise segregated and kept from the dominion of the utility company."
1989.88-1319,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1361.432,1377.324,"Well, is there some one factor... factor in your analysis that is controlling, so that you could say it wasn't a facts and circumstances test, or is it just you think there should have been different facts and circumstances considered, or perhaps a different result reached on the same facts and circumstances?"
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1377.324,1386.599,"--Well, any... any criterion that we look to can be considered to be facts and circumstances."
1989.88-1319,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1456.393,1466.571,"Suppose... suppose, Mr. Wallace, that I establish a scheme, I am a marketer of furniture, or whatever, and I establish a scheme where I let people make advance payments."
1989.88-1319,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1483.073,1486.756,"I believe not, Mr. Justice."
1989.88-1319,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1491.838,1510.201,"Please proceed, Mr. Stroble."
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,1510.201,1513.861,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1319,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1540.251,1542.241,Why were they not segregated?
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,1542.241,1553.478,"The rules for collection, refunding and payment of interest on these deposits is prescribed by the state Public Service Commission."
1989.88-1319,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1566.938,1571.763,You mean if they were segregated some state rule would be violated?
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,1571.763,1578.318,"No, they could have been segregated, but there was simply no reason to segregate them."
1989.88-1319,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1578.318,1580.889,Then my question is why weren't they segregated to avoid all this litigation?
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,1580.889,1590.857,"If... perhaps they would have been had that been an announced position in 1921, that they would be taxed if they were not segregated."
1989.88-1319,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1596.101,1598.622,"Well, does the company now escrow the funds?"
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,1598.622,1609.5,To my knowledge the company is continuing to follow the practice it always has and continues to follow exactly what the state Public Service Commission's regulations prescribe.
1989.88-1319,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1609.5,1613.963,I guess I am not following this.
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,1630.326,1631.397,"Well, that does seem--"
1989.88-1319,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1631.397,1633.61,"But I didn't understand that to be the government's position, that all you had to do was segregate it."
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,1633.61,1635.941,"--Well, that seems to be what they have said in their brief."
1989.88-1319,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1635.941,1638.545,"Not escrowed, just segregated."
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,1638.545,1644.087,We have never seen why segregation of these funds should be an important distinction.
1989.88-1319,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1700.597,1714.218,"But if these sums were segregated, I take it it would be a indication that these funds were not available for just any use that the company wanted to make with... of them."
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,1714.218,1715.44,--It would--
1989.88-1319,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1715.44,1721.835,"Whereas the loan proceeds, you borrow money to use for the general corporate purposes, I suppose."
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,1721.835,1732.203,"--Well, as in the case of a loan, the company does have to stand ready at any time to make a refund to a customer whenever the conditions that have been established are met."
1989.88-1319,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1742.29,1749.413,"Yeah, but if the... if the company goes broke it may not have the money to refund these."
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,1755.968,1761.362,It's... the Indiana Public Service Commission could have prescribed such a rule.
1989.88-1319,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1762.083,1769.096,"Well, the company could have followed such a policy, too, so it's a peculiar argument."
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,1769.096,1769.767,--The company could have accepted the funds and set them into a separate bank account.
1989.88-1319,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1769.767,1775.751,What sort of a test do you think should govern the taxability of these monies?
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,1775.751,1784.128,We think that the test that should govern is essentially the tests that the tax court and Seventh Circuit applied: are the amounts in question--
1989.88-1319,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1784.128,1787.498,So you think it makes a difference whether interest is paid on it or not?
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,1787.498,1791.141,--We think that the payment of interest is one factor that should be considered.
1989.88-1319,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1819.871,1824.133,"Well, an advance payment has to be returned if the service isn't rendered."
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,1824.133,1832.468,"Justice Kennedy, that is exactly correct, but the situation in which it has to be returned is exactly the opposite of what we have here."
1989.88-1319,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1861.887,1868.352,"But, the reality of the utility business is that you can't pick and choose your customer."
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,1873.787,1875.628,--There is an obligation to--
1989.88-1319,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1875.628,1885.563,"And so that differs, makes a substantial difference between the security deposit in this industry and the security deposit in, say, a furniture business where you might decide that you are just not going to deliver."
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,1885.563,1895.301,"--I think that is a valid observation, that there is a difference between a regulated industry and the private commercial setting where many of the advance payment cases originally arose."
1989.88-1319,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1909.669,1913.422,"So, from a practical standpoint, it really is just an advance payment, isn't it?"
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,1916.545,1922.709,"Well, another reason why it is not the equivalent of an advance payment is that it is subject to a refund."
1989.88-1319,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1922.709,1927.284,"Well, so is the advance payment if the customer elects to terminate the service."
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,1927.284,1937.65,"Well, I think in a normal advance payment situation the customer would want to make certain that it had assured what it was going to receive for its advance payment."
1989.88-1319,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1946.955,1950.538,"But, as we have already established, a utility always has to deliver services."
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,1955.353,1972.905,"But that is a obligation that is imposed independent of the deposit, or as a separate obligation that is not a countervailing or a mutual obligation that arises for the reason of having received this deposit."
1989.88-1319,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1992.859,1994.421,"Mr. Stroble, are you sure that that is true."
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2016.5,2017.041,Well--
1989.88-1319,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2017.041,2028.958,"So, it's general obligation to serve all comers is suspended with respect to some particularly economically shaky individuals."
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2029.659,2046.101,"--Well, the facts of the case as they were disclosed by the record is that the... this utility, except very rare cases, would supply service to any customer, would allow them to hook up to the system, would turn on the electricity and sell them electricity."
1989.88-1319,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2055.107,2055.246,Fine.
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2068.208,2084.601,"In most cases the record discloses that the customer who fails to make any payment, either a deposit or an actual payment on the delinquent utility bills, would be disconnected for failure to pay the utility bill."
1989.88-1319,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2084.601,2092.797,"So he is getting something for the payment, continuing service, which the utility would not otherwise have any obligation to provide."
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2092.797,2099.461,It is true that a customer who absolutely refused to pay a deposit could be disconnected from the system.
1989.88-1319,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2099.461,2103.374,"That is to say, all the customers from whom you demand these prepayments."
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2103.374,2115.163,"But in that event... in that circumstance, I think we still have to ask the question is the deposit collected for the purpose of buying these future goods and services."
1989.88-1319,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2125.13,2129.734,"Is what counts what it is collected for, and not at all what it is paid for?"
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2134.347,2134.547,I think you're right.
1989.88-1319,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2136.29,2140.283,"I mean, I am sure that he is paying it only to get more electricity."
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2157.207,2177.139,"--In the three cases which Mr. Wallace alluded to, the Automobile Club of Michigan, the Triple A case and the Schlude case, the Commissioner fought very hard for the proposition that there are circumstances under which the accrual method of accounting can be deviated from."
1989.88-1319,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2234.56,2236.032,"Well, he is under an obligation if he doesn't furnish it."
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2236.032,2243.118,"If he doesn't furnish... if he doesn't live up to his contract, then he has to return the, he has to return the deposit."
1989.88-1319,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2244.82,2247.502,"Nevertheless, meanwhile he has returned it as ordinary income."
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2247.502,2250.544,"--Yes, that... that's correct."
1989.88-1319,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2405.977,2415.374,"Excuse me, you would have that same problem if it were, even if it were considered, whether it is considered a security deposit or a prepayment."
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2416.596,2422.76,"Well, I think there is a difference, and perhaps an example might help me better illustrate it."
1989.88-1319,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2434.858,2435.659,I am sorry.
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2443.306,2443.766,Yeah.
1989.88-1319,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2443.766,2445.348,Wouldn't the same thing happen?
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2445.348,2446.788,I don't think so.
1989.88-1319,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2446.788,2449.202,"I mean, that is just a function of what happens when you get a prepayment."
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2449.202,2469.734,"I don't think so, because what happens in that case is the utility receives a prepayment for a given utility service, it would have no reason to send out a bill to that customer or to accrue any additional income, because it has already received the payment, with those identifiable goods and services."
1989.88-1319,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2481.114,2487.178,You wouldn't report that payment until the services were provided 12 months later?
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2487.178,2489.952,"Well, if it was a true prepayment, as you has posited in your example--"
1989.88-1319,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2489.952,2490.461,And you're on an accrual basis.
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2490.461,2498.307,"--And I'm on the accrual basis, under the trilogy cases I would report that as income at the point I collected it, no question."
1989.88-1319,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2498.307,2498.708,At the point you collected it.
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2498.708,2506.084,But I would not then again accrue income as I delivered those services to that customer.
1989.88-1319,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2510.846,2514.178,"Well, you don't accrue it when you, at the end, at the twelfth month."
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2527.679,2533.743,--That seems to solve the problem as long as we contain everything within a given taxable year.
1989.88-1319,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2533.743,2533.923,That's right.
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2556.108,2571.529,"If it is an advance payment, then it would normally be identifiable with some goods and service that would permit the taxpayer to avoid that second, that accrual, that separate accrual and the double counting that would occur in the first year."
1989.88-1319,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2573.96,2585.32,"Whereas a security deposit is carried on indefinitely and might not relate to the first year, so the government tends to maximize income to a greater extent under security deposits than with advance payments."
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2585.32,2586.138,--Exactly.
1989.88-1319,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2604.881,2611.285,"Of course, I guess the government could argue it's the way we structure the hypothetical, it's the way we are assuming the advance payment is designated."
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2612.777,2621.052,It seems that an advance payment has to be designated to some particular identifiable good or service.
1989.88-1319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2740.715,2749.541,"Mr. Stroble, although Mr. Wallace didn't make the point, doesn't that case, or that ruling deal with cash-basis taxpayers?"
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2749.541,2753.164,It deals with the question whether a cash-basis taxpayer should be--
1989.88-1319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2753.164,2757.548,But then does it have any bearing on how we treat accrual-basis taxpayers who get income up front?
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2757.548,2768.957,"--I think it does in an environment where we say we are going to make an exception to the normal accrual method and tax the receipt of the cash as a prepayment, if it really is a prepayment."
1989.88-1319,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2784.237,2785.908,But you don't object to that?
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2786.268,2789.232,"--If it is a true advance payment, we wouldn't object to it."
1989.88-1319,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2789.232,2789.311,--You don't object to it.
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2794.876,2795.007,It is.
1989.88-1319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2847.86,2849.713,But does the ruling say the converse?
1989.88-1319,1,35112,larry_j_stroble,,2852.915,2868.105,"In, it enumerates four or five factors that are to be looked at, and clearly the question of whether it is refundable and whether or not it is part of an enforceable sales contract for specific goods and services are key factors in making that determination."
1989.88-1319,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2981.202,2983.154,"--Thank you, Mr. Stroble."
1989.88-1319,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2984.945,2987.476,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.88-1319,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3009.903,3012.885,"Mr. Wallace, can I interrupt you just a second on those three cases?"
1989.88-1319,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3017.569,3020.27,"--Yes, Mr. Justice."
1989.88-1319,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3020.27,3030.586,"Now, isn't it true that those cases basically said that we will make an exception from normal accrual accounting procedures for payments received in advance, as in those cases."
1989.88-1319,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3031.968,3032.679,That is correct.
1989.88-1319,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3032.679,3034.019,--we construe an exception broadly or narrowly.
1989.88-1319,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3034.019,3036.92,"Well, that is correct."
1989.88-1319,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3187.895,3200.434,"Mr. Wallace, there is no significant economic difference between, let's assume a security deposit not for payment of future rent, but for not destroying the property, which you acknowledge is not taxable immediately."
1989.88-1319,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3200.855,3203.156,That is never converted into income.
1989.88-1319,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3203.156,3203.316,All right.
1989.88-1319,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3239.353,3256.745,"Well, but the code does not give controlling significance to labels that are meaningless, either, when the same payment is being made between two parties to a transaction and it is called one thing or another."
1989.88-1319,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3270.474,3273.097,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
