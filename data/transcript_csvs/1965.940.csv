1965.940,0,24267,frederick_b_lacey,,14.434,19.589,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.940,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,267.914,269.815,When was â€“ did it happen?
1965.940,0,24267,frederick_b_lacey,,269.815,275.706,1958 sir.
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,1128.474,1133.925,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.940,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1230.481,1236.037,"I thought, Mr. Handler, that's all we ever do get in the way of a legislative history in New Jersey, is it?"
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,1236.037,1238.374,That's one of our complaints also Justice Brennan.
1965.940,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1313.567,1321.373,"How do you know when -- how do you know whether an appeal is frivolous, or promiscuous or some of those other words?"
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,1321.373,1336.585,I don't think that anyone can be certain as a matter of any objective analysis whether an appeal is frivolous or whether sham or bogus merely because an appeal is lost.
1965.940,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1352.713,1361.864,I guess we've all seen some appeals which at the time they were taken that the -- frivolous and then it turned out to be successful.
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,1361.864,1376.049,That's -- has happened probably too often and of course it's happened not infrequently in the area of appeals by indigents.
1965.940,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1436.459,1438.693,May I ask you Mr. Handler.
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,1452.188,1452.665,No.
1965.940,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1456.439,1456.527,Oh!
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,1456.527,1458.708,-- statute which requires an indigent --
1965.940,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1458.708,1461.137,But this is 18 that --
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,1461.137,1463.22,He is attacking Section 18 which is the --
1965.940,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1463.22,1463.245,"Yes, yes."
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,1463.245,1464.404,-- reimbursement statute.
1965.940,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1464.404,1465.769,"Yes, I understand that."
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,1465.769,1493.542,"But in evaluating the New Jersey statute in its totality and as applied to this appellant, I think it important that the Court appreciate that the New Jersey statute has a application provision, that as applied to this particular appellant he was not deterred or impeded in his recourse to the appellate courts."
1965.940,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1503.278,1513.908,"Mr. Handler, may I ask you, suppose the -- on his conviction, if that -- the jail term, he got a suspended sentence and had taken the appeal."
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,1518.758,1520.766,"Yes, Justice Brennan."
1965.940,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1520.766,1524.273,But would Section 18 have been operative in that case?
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,1524.273,1526.776,But Section 18 would have been inoperative.
1965.940,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1526.776,1527.544,Inoperative way?
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,1527.544,1538.71,"In other words, Section 17 is designed to enable any person claiming a state of indigency to apply to the Court for a free transcript."
1965.940,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1567.258,1577.763,"Now, incidentally, this applies only to the one who is in that institution, an institution covers more than the prison, I gather."
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,1577.763,1579.212,It does.
1965.940,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1595.616,1596.636,Mental hospitals?
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,1596.636,1601.269,And other types of institutions where work is --
1965.940,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1601.269,1612.515,"Do we still though, the sex offender law that the -- on conviction for sex offense instead of going to a prison, after he'd gone a mental (Inaudible) he go to some mental hospital, do you still have that?"
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,1612.515,1613.424,Yes.
1965.940,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1613.571,1624.273,"So that I take it a -- one convicted under that statute and went to a mental hospital and earn 20 cents a day or whatever he did at the mental hospital would also be taken out of his earnings, wouldn't it?"
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,1624.273,1624.652,Yes.
1965.940,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1637.79,1645.986,"If he was found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed to a mental hospital, would he have to pay this?"
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,1645.986,1648.387,I'm not prepared to say Chief Justice.
1965.940,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1662.077,1670.858,And wouldn't apply to anybody who had been placed on probation or who had been fined or had been given a suspended sentence?
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,1670.858,1678.765,It would not apply to that category of indigent defendant.
1965.940,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1757.024,1770.266,"Well, that doesn't square very well with your original pieces as I understood that this was to -- designed to discourage frivolous appeals."
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,1805.733,1810.786,I would say not entirely so Mr. Chief Justice.
1965.940,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1817.743,1818.669,You say in what?
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,1818.669,1820.618,Risk weighing process.
1965.940,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1876.697,1904.163,"Yes, but Mr. Handler, how -- I can't read Section 18 as suggesting for example that one who has a suspended sentence who takes an appeal for some reason or another the suspension is revoked and he then goes to prison subject to this Section 18, this seems to indicate its only the applicant who is confined at the time he applies for the transcript to whom this sentence -- Section 18 applies."
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,1906.074,1910.739,"Well, let me say this Mr. Justice Brennan."
1965.940,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1933.732,1937.231,"Well, I'm just looking at the words, the wording of the statute itself."
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,1956.71,1963.862,I would have to concede that the -- that language seems clear enough on that point.
1965.940,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1978.006,1981.724,Is that question involved in this particular man's case?
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,1981.724,2000.487,I think it is involved only to the extent that the appellant is urging that the statute in terms of the classifications that it draws or that it -- are inherent in the policy are invidious against him.
1965.940,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2019.68,2025.105,I thought he mentioned something of that in his argument to us.
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2025.105,2028.46,"Well, I think that was in response to a question."
1965.940,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2038.287,2043.662,"But so far as he is concerned, is he hurt by that particular provision, that's what I was asking."
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2043.662,2046.378,I don't think that he is hurt and --
1965.940,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2046.378,2047.688,But how could you be?
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2052.039,2054.976,I don't see how he could be.
1965.940,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2060.288,2067.891,"Am I right in thinking that the real issue here -- I'm just asking because I am not sure, is this."
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2097.937,2110.72,That is substantially correct except for the qualification that must be conceded that this creation of a debt applies only to a prisoner who is being paid by the state.
1965.940,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2110.72,2117.879,"Well, I suppose -- suppose he is not a prisoner and being paid for the state."
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2119.5,2120.459,No.
1965.940,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2123.387,2125.506,How do you collect the cost?
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2125.506,2127.028,The costs are waived.
1965.940,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2152.263,2154.58,Suppose he's not a pauper --
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2154.58,2155.993,"If he's not a pauper, he would pay."
1965.940,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2155.993,2156.797,-- and loses.
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2156.797,2158.477,He would pay costs.
1965.940,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2158.477,2159.091,Pay costs.
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2159.091,2159.751,He would pay costs.
1965.940,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2159.751,2165.606,"So that -- why is that, (Inaudible) that the state created debt for those cost and how do they collect that debt from him --"
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2165.606,2165.648,Those --
1965.940,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2165.648,2167.648,-- if he's not a pauper?
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2167.648,2172.01,Those costs would be assessed in the normal course of litigation.
1965.940,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2188.645,2189.47,Have paid them (Voice Overlap) --
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2189.47,2191.5,-- from the reporter and pay it for himself.
1965.940,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2193.235,2202.778,"The difference here then is it, after you finally get down to the ultimate difference is that the state pays those costs for an indigent."
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2216.136,2220.49,"Well, the state does that only with respect to indigents."
1965.940,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2220.49,2223.56,"Well, you say they collect it from the others without that."
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2223.56,2228.077,"I thought your question applied to non-indigents, Mr. Justice Black."
1965.940,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2228.141,2232.346,"No, for non-indigents, you say they collect it from them anyhow."
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2234.218,2234.781,That's correct.
1965.940,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2234.781,2237.789,So you have a system whereby you collect costs.
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2254.399,2254.564,That is --
1965.940,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2254.564,2255.385,-- and can.
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2255.385,2257.147,That is correct.
1965.940,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2257.147,2259.06,Is that the ultimate issue?
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2259.06,2260.295,I think that is -- that is the --
1965.940,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2260.295,2261.326,I don't know.
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2263.169,2265.915,I think that is the ultimate issue of what --
1965.940,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2265.915,2268.847,"But Mr. Handler, wait a minute, I don't know that it is."
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2293.979,2294.673,That is correct.
1965.940,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2294.673,2295.2,That's right.
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2295.2,2295.686,That is correct.
1965.940,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2295.686,2307.289,The only indigent who has to pay anything is the (Inaudible) in prison and then only to the extent of the 20 cents a day that the state pays him for whatever work he does in prison.
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2307.289,2308.54,That is correct.
1965.940,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2311.553,2315.254,But I wanted to get out of that was the case.
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2315.254,2316.493,That is the case here.
1965.940,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2322.617,2341.809,"Well, of course the state might have the power to go after an indigent to make him pay the money back but it might if the reason of some special provision which thereby discriminated him against him on account of the fact that they were indigent, still could be barred by the Equal Protection Clause."
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2341.809,2342.559,Oh!
1965.940,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2344.923,2345.015,Well --
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2345.015,2345.368,Of course we (Voice Overlap) --
1965.940,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2345.368,2351.745,"Then you're -- then the ultimate issue as you see it, do you agree with Mr. Justice Brennan that that's the ultimate issue here?"
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2351.745,2351.967,That is --
1965.940,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2351.967,2353.3,The one he said?
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2353.3,2355.986,I agree with his statement of the problem.
1965.940,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2355.986,2359.38,"Well, doesn't that raise some equal protection problem?"
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2359.38,2363.259,I don't think so Mr. Chief Justice.
1965.940,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2411.494,2411.808,What are they?
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2411.808,2433.174,"Now, the question that would have to be posed by the court, is there any reasonable basis for the State of New Jersey not to collect the costs of litigation against indigents who are not confined to prison, notwithstanding they are under conviction that they have not reverse their convictions."
1965.940,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2466.711,2472.883,"Let me give you just a specific case and see if there is any discrimination, this situation."
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2538.587,2554.355,"I think that that question cannot be answered unless you give some consideration to why in one case a man is sentenced and in another case, he is given probation."
1965.940,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2554.355,2559.105,"Well, you're putting it then not on the basis of frivolous appeal."
1965.940,1,16223,alan_b_handler,,2565.872,2572.965,I think that this is not disassociated from the policy of the statute.
1965.940,2,24267,frederick_b_lacey,,2945.856,2951.921,First I would like to respond to a question put by Mr. Justice Brennan to Mr. Handler.
1965.940,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2987.572,2988.567,May I ask you a question (Voice Overlap) --
1965.940,2,24267,frederick_b_lacey,,2988.567,2990.685,"Yes sir, Mr. Justice Black."
1965.940,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2990.685,2992.902,"Just to the issue, completely clear."
1965.940,2,24267,frederick_b_lacey,,2992.902,2994.254,Yes sir.
1965.940,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2994.254,3022.035,"Is your case in your judgment depend on a holding that a state is without constitutional power to collect back from a defendant that it is required to pay costs, that is without constitutional power to collect that money back if they can, so long as the law doesn't in some way discriminate as between the person to which collect it from."
1965.940,2,24267,frederick_b_lacey,,3022.035,3034.561,"No sir because that would include the example put to me by Mr. Justice Harlan and in answering him, I said that under certain language, certain phrasing, certain proportion, I would recognize the state had a right to reimbursement."
1965.940,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3070.431,3082.053,"I understand that argument but as far as I'm concerned, as my understanding of Griffin would not go -- does not fit in -- it is not the same."
1965.940,2,24267,frederick_b_lacey,,3082.053,3082.259,No sir.
1965.940,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3082.259,3085.558,It's wholly distinguishable in this respect.
1965.940,2,24267,frederick_b_lacey,,3098.315,3099.027,"Yes sir, on --"
1965.940,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3099.027,3100.011,As you --
1965.940,2,24267,frederick_b_lacey,,3100.011,3102.465,I want to make that clear at the outset Mr. Justice Black.
1965.940,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3105.246,3105.571,Yes.
1965.940,2,24267,frederick_b_lacey,,3105.571,3114.751,-- that we were not arguing a deprivation of liberty here as was the case in Griffin and you're quite right sir that we are arguing a deprivation of property.
1965.940,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3120.193,3121.721,Deprivation of property is --
1965.940,2,24267,frederick_b_lacey,,3121.721,3123.74,"Without due process, yes sir."
1965.940,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3124.253,3126.289,You're not relying on equal protection?
1965.940,2,24267,frederick_b_lacey,,3126.289,3126.926,Yes sir.
