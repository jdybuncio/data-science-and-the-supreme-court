1995.95-809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.448,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-809, Lockheed Corporation v. Paul Spink."
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,13.162,13.773,"It is, Your Honor."
1995.95-809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,100.899,107.785,"Mr. Krischer, may I ask you to clarify something in regard to the first question?"
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,138.253,153.303,"Well, I don't... I believe it's the same question that's being raised, Justice O'Connor, because what the Ninth Circuit held... it didn't make a big distinction between the plan sponsor and the retirement plan committee that would pay the benefits to eligible employees."
1995.95-809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,154.315,169.254,"Well, certainly the Solicitor General's brief suggests there may be substantial differences in answers to the two questions, and I just wondered whether we should confine ourselves to what you raised in the original cert position--"
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,169.254,169.935,--I think--
1995.95-809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,169.935,176.21,--and look to whether the plan sponsor was acting in a fiduciary--
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,176.21,189.577,"--The first point, Your Honor, there are petitioners in this case, including the individuals who are on the retirement committee as well as the executives of Lockheed, who were sued in their executive capacity because they adopted or had the company adopt the amendment."
1995.95-809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,232.585,234.537,"--Well, excuse me, I thought that wasn't it."
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,252.409,262.845,"--The... well, I think both... if you certainly want to limit yourselves to the first question, the Court can do it, but I believe that both questions should subsume--"
1995.95-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,262.845,263.365,Was there--
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,263.365,264.705,--and the overall question is--
1995.95-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,264.705,266.167,--It depends on how you want to argue the case.
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,294.056,296.698,"--Well, I think that's what we're suggesting, Justice Scalia."
1995.95-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,296.698,297.196,"Yes, well, not really."
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,299.339,299.89,Well--
1995.95-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,299.89,309.785,"--and the fiduciary point is not going to answer this second question, but do you have an argument that even if the settlor were a fiduciary the adoption of this provision would not have been unlawful?"
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,309.785,311.638,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,399.454,402.776,"That was the district court opinion you were quoting from, not the court of appeals."
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,402.776,406.407,"--That is correct, and the Ninth Circuit didn't quarrel with that and didn't differ on that point."
1995.95-809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,438.898,446.314,"And if that point is sound, it is sound regardless of whether, in the act of amendment Lockheed was acting as a fiduciary or not, isn't that correct?"
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,446.314,453.1,"It purported... the Ninth Circuit, Your Honor, purported not to decide that question, but in essence--"
1995.95-809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,453.1,464.427,"That's right, but I mean, that question... the answer to... all I'm getting at is the answer to that question is not going to be dictated by whether we determine that Lockheed was acting as a fiduciary in making the amendment."
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,465.008,465.656,--That's correct.
1995.95-809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,465.656,465.957,--Okay.
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,465.957,466.738,That's correct.
1995.95-809,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,466.738,467.509,Mr. Krischer--
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,488.182,490.613,"It depends, I think, on the trust instrument, but I think--"
1995.95-809,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,490.613,492.674,"Oh, no, no, I mean, it... assume normal--"
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,492.674,493.606,--I think yes.
1995.95-809,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,494.587,505.403,"--So in other words, you're saying under ERISA they can say, give away the entire corpus, settlor amends it, says, give it all to John Smith, provided John Smith gives me his separate company."
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,505.403,508.836,"Well, I don't think that under ERISA that can be done."
1995.95-809,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,508.836,509.326,Why not?
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,509.326,515.14,Because there are other requirements under ERISA that state what the minimum participation funding investing standards are.
1995.95-809,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,515.14,515.671,They're all with them.
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,537.574,549.873,"Mr. Justice Breyer, I agree that that claim is presented her, but the merits of the claim are that there is no bright line other than in 406 that's drawn, and that's the prohibited transaction rule."
1995.95-809,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,551.082,553.396,So you're saying they can give away... they can give away the whole shebang.
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,553.396,555.366,"--I'm... yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,578.25,578.581,So--
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,584.685,585.065,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
1995.95-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,585.065,586.097,He can terminate it entirely.
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,586.097,586.996,He can terminate it at any time.
1995.95-809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,596.473,598.804,Can you have any conditions on it?
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,616.966,620.258,"The first part of that, Ms. Justice Ginsburg, would be."
1995.95-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,655.012,655.743,What provision is that you're talking about?
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,655.743,655.933,--but that's not done here.
1995.95-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,655.933,659.887,What are these vested provisions that are going to be violated by that commitment?
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,659.887,674.025,"Well, for example, if... there's a rule in ERISA in title I, the vesting rules, that indicate that for the... generally, that an employer has to vest in the benefit within a 5-year period, and if--"
1995.95-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,674.025,675.367,"Well, he's vested."
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,681.25,686.324,"--Well, I don't... it may not prevent vesting, but it may make it subject to defeasement."
1995.95-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,691.616,692.638,"No, but assuming he can."
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,702.365,714.22,--They are not different if you can assure the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Labor and courts that you are not linking vesting or benefit accrual to some future event.
1995.95-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,719.375,726.068,"And your position is that's okay because he doesn't have to set up this plan anyway, and he can terminate it at any time, so he can make it conditional on anything that isn't criminal."
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,726.068,727.14,That's--
1995.95-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,727.14,729.802,And I assume that giving up your claim against an employer is not criminal.
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,729.802,735.555,"--It is not criminal, and, indeed, the courts as a matter of public policy favor settlement of claims."
1995.95-809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,735.555,736.717,"Mr. Krischer, you just said--"
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,764.624,767.986,The term in the plan would still be a valid term.
1995.95-809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,810.585,811.837,"Well, what about Federal claims?"
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,828.33,838.025,"I believe that if the release is otherwise enforceable under those substantive provisions, it is enforceable and this provision is not unlawful, and indeed, the Internal Revenue Service has regulation--"
1995.95-809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,838.025,847.851,"But then you're making a distinction between Federal claims and State claims who's saying the State can protect the workers despite the plan provision, but as far as Federal claims is... there's no protection."
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,847.851,853.695,"--No, the Federal Government could protect them, too, as, in fact, it has under the Age Discrimination Act, for example."
1995.95-809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,870.117,872.267,Maybe the release is unenforceable.
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,872.267,872.558,--is independent of whether it's enforceable.
1995.95-809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,872.558,874.85,May I ask you kind of a more basic question?
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,881.905,882.165,That's correct.
1995.95-809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,882.165,888.239,"--Now, supposing the amendment did require compliance... performance of a prohibited transaction."
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,890.68,895.264,"Our position is, it would be permissible to make the amendment."
1995.95-809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,917.879,919.418,So then your position... I want to be sure.
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,926.904,932.677,"--Well, I don't... that's correct, Mr. Justice Stevens, but I don't think that the Government goes that far."
1995.95-809,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,944.376,945.635,What's the line?
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,946.046,957.994,"Well, we suggest that the line be drawn that's already been drawn by Congress in the Statute under 406, and that is, if it's a benefit payment, a payment of benefits to a participant required by the plan, that is not a prohibited transaction."
1995.95-809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,957.994,959.686,--No matter what the condition?
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,959.686,960.137,That is not a transaction at all.
1995.95-809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,960.137,969.971,"No matter what the condition, even if the condition was that the beneficiary must agree that he won't rent his house to a certain class of persons, or something, something totally unrelated to the plan?"
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,969.971,978.326,"As an academic matter, that's correct, Your Honor, but you know, these pension plans are set up in the real world, involving real concerns of employees, and I--"
1995.95-809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,978.326,982.13,"I understand, but your view is that nothing that the pension plan authorizes can be a prohibited transaction?"
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,982.13,985.032,--That goes too far.
1995.95-809,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,993.649,993.969,Pursuant to the lawful terms--
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,1023.498,1024.169,"--That is, Your Honor."
1995.95-809,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1026.201,1032.535,"--Why isn't this for the benefit of the employer, and when you're answering that, distinguish this hypothetical."
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,1045.724,1059.522,"Responding to the first question, and then the hypothetical, if I might, everything an employer does with respect to its promise as to what the benefit level will be is in the employer's self-interest."
1995.95-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1074.703,1077.304,Or the basic condition of continuing to work for the employer.
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,1095.667,1098.518,--You're correct.
1995.95-809,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1107.525,1108.035,So would you answer--
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,1108.035,1108.534,--if I might--
1995.95-809,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1108.534,1109.405,--the second half of his question?
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,1109.405,1112.807,"--I'd like... the second half of the hypothetical, that pushes the line, and that is difficult."
1995.95-809,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1131.37,1132.701,"Well, but, can you--"
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,1132.701,1133.151,--what you're doing--
1995.95-809,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1133.151,1134.303,--Is it a violation of this section?
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,1135.0,1136.442,--It is not a violation of this section.
1995.95-809,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1136.442,1139.424,Why isn't it for the benefit of a party in interest?
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,1139.424,1143.777,The party in interest here... there are two parties in interest.
1995.95-809,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1170.585,1171.587,Why isn't this a kickback?
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,1171.587,1176.018,It is not a kickback because... for several reasons.
1995.95-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1230.795,1234.357,My problem is that I could think of... my problem is not that I can't think of scenarios.
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,1244.603,1247.985,"--If it's a sham transaction, I suppose."
1995.95-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1248.586,1249.778,"What do you mean, sham?"
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,1253.369,1253.859,--Well--
1995.95-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1253.859,1258.243,Or he really wants to get the employee to promise to make him a loan at 1 percent.
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,1258.243,1258.671,--If--
1995.95-809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1258.671,1259.542,That's not sham.
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,1259.542,1260.253,--No.
1995.95-809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1275.404,1284.881,"Do you say it's not a prohibited transaction, or do you say it's not a prohibited transaction unless it is expressly prohibited, or unless it is prohibited by some substantive section of ERISA?"
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,1284.881,1296.007,"It is not a prohibited transaction under 406 because it's not specifically mentioned, and it may not be a prohibited transaction, but it may otherwise be unlawful under another provision of ERISA."
1995.95-809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1296.348,1305.163,"So you're saying, once we're in a situation in which the question is whether the payment of the benefit is lawful, you simply look to some other source of law, you don't look to this section."
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,1305.163,1323.236,"--That's correct, and one such other section is... would be section 403... I'm sorry, section 1054(g), which is... which specifically says an amendment to a plan may not cut back benefits."
1995.95-809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1365.382,1382.992,"Well, what does that language in 406 cover, then, when it says that you can't pay it to a party in interest, you can't... you can't transfer to or use by or for the benefit of a party in interest any assets of the plan."
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,1384.004,1395.872,"--That would be giving a loan to Lockheed, taking money out of the plan and giving it to a participant in violation of the terms of the plan, doing something with the assets that are different than paying benefits."
1995.95-809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1395.872,1396.974,Discretionary acts.
1995.95-809,0,25571,gordon_e_krischer,,1406.808,1408.701,"Well, in part we are saying that."
1995.95-809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1420.289,1421.19,"Thank you, Mr. Krischer."
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1423.291,1430.013,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-809,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1457.124,1459.377,"It may be sufficient, but not very helpful."
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1484.983,1501.714,"--Well, Your Honor, with respect, the petition for certiorari argued that there was a conflict in the circuit only on the question of whether an amendment can be an act itself that violates section 406, so presumably that was the ground on which the Court took certiorari."
1995.95-809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1501.714,1503.883,But that would just defer the essential question.
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1519.465,1520.717,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1995.95-809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1544.633,1552.717,"But it seemed to me that the Ninth Circuit wasn't making that distinction, that it was really answering the second question against the plan, against Lockheed."
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1552.717,1558.57,"I believe, Your Honor, that the Ninth Circuit answered both questions against... against Lockheed."
1995.95-809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1558.57,1563.173,"So if we send it back, then they say, well, we answered both questions, so our answers still stand."
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1563.173,1589.341,"The one issue that the Ninth Circuit has not dealt with so far, Your Honor, is, assuming that the amendment of the plan is itself a lawful act, whether implementation of that amendment is... is therefore lawful or tends to be unlawful, petitioners have argued at points in this case that, given a lawful amendment, implementation can't be unlawful because it can't be unlawful for the fiduciary to pay benefits in accordance with the terms of the plan."
1995.95-809,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1589.341,1616.327,"But they've said, I take it, that everyone now would concede... I don't want to concede for them if they don't really want to... that you have a plan, a certain amount's earmarked for vested benefits, somehow there's some extra cash around, and the settlor has amended it so that it says, take all the extra cash and give it to Smith, who happens to be one beneficiary, provided he gives to me, the settlor, his house, his car and a lot of other things that have nothing to do with it."
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1624.245,1626.284,"All right, let me turn to that, then, Your Honor--"
1995.95-809,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1626.284,1630.626,"And not for the settlor, but I'm now an administrator, for the first time come to this act."
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1635.661,1636.232,--Okay.
1995.95-809,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1658.395,1667.16,"As a matter of plan... as a matter of plain language, the fiduciary does that whenever he pays out the benefits only if the employee continues to work for the employer."
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1674.677,1680.411,"--Your Honor, we agree with you entirely that it would similarly fall within the plain language--"
1995.95-809,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1680.411,1680.782,Right.
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1680.782,1682.501,--to pay benefits in return for an employee's services.
1995.95-809,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1682.501,1683.032,Right.
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1683.032,1686.884,"However, it's very clear within ERISA that that's what Congress was talking about."
1995.95-809,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1732.584,1737.267,You're going to give it the narrowest meaning that will allow the act to have some function?
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1749.474,1766.298,"--We're not saying that it's unrelated to the employer's business, Your Honor, and we're certainly not saying that ERISA says anything about an employer's right to use its own money to buy a waiver of claims against it any more than ERISA prohibits its employer to use its own money to buy the employee's house or car."
1995.95-809,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1778.343,1783.087,"Why is it, in your view, that this is a lawful amendment of the plan?"
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1788.872,1799.817,"--Your Honor, our view is that the amendment itself, the act of amending, was not unlawful under section 46 because, while amending the plan, Lockheed was not acting as a fiduciary."
1995.95-809,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1799.817,1805.471,"Beyond that, why does 40... I take it beyond that you agree with Lockheed as well."
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1805.471,1806.162,No.
1995.95-809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1822.532,1823.634,It is a violation.
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1826.986,1836.823,"Well, out of section 406, Your Honor, what we take from there is that you've got a prohibition that is very strict, it's written in very broad language, it's in fact in a catchall provision."
1995.95-809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1866.242,1868.083,They don't actually pay enhanced benefits for services.
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1870.594,1872.817,"--Well, that's correct, Your Honor."
1995.95-809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1872.817,1876.627,"When they make the payment, the person is no longer an employee."
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1876.627,1884.444,"I wasn't speaking to this case, but that is correct, Your Honor, and what we would say to that is that pension benefits generally have served dual purposes."
1995.95-809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1887.944,1892.639,"The promise of benefits attracts the employee, but not the payment itself, because at the time the payment is made the person is a former employee."
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1892.639,1893.298,That--
1995.95-809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1893.298,1896.222,"Unless it's a disability benefit, and then they're paid when they're not working."
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1896.222,1899.024,"--That is correct, Your Honor, and we take the position that the promise itself--"
1995.95-809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1899.024,1901.895,But the promise isn't covered by 406(D).
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1903.536,1911.183,"--Well, Your Honor, we would take the position that the promise would be covered in the following context, and that's that if you take the position that it's only the outflow of cash--"
1995.95-809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1911.183,1911.329,Right.
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1911.329,1917.775,"--then a fiduciary could pledge plan assets, guarantee debts with plan assets, agree to loans with plan assets, and all of that would be--"
1995.95-809,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1917.775,1920.446,You say the quid pro quo is sucked into that.
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1924.289,1925.14,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1995.95-809,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1925.14,1927.02,--except you want to make an exception for--
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1927.02,1927.852,"Well, we don't want to make an exception."
1995.95-809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1927.852,1928.483,"--Yes, but your--"
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1928.483,1932.354,We're just carving as narrow exception out of section 406 as the act logically permits.
1995.95-809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1932.354,1937.788,"--But your pledge examples are all fit within the word transfer, but the promise of future benefits doesn't--"
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1937.788,1944.542,"Well, we're talking about a use of plan assets, Your Honor, not a transfer here, and under section 406(a)(1)(D) a use of plan assets is included."
1995.95-809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1977.334,1988.661,"--On the first issue, what you're saying, they're buying the releases with tax-benefitted dollars, otherwise they'd have to pay for them with their--"
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1988.661,1990.123,"That is correct, Your Honor--"
1995.95-809,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1990.123,1990.624,--with funds that don't--
1995.95-809,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1990.624,1993.616,--so the taxpayer is essentially subsidizing this transaction.
1995.95-809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1996.408,1999.279,"--Ms. Traber, we'll hear from you."
1995.95-809,2,43392,theresa_m_traber,,1999.279,2007.086,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-809,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2043.859,2045.531,Where is this statutory section?
1995.95-809,2,43392,theresa_m_traber,,2047.482,2048.203,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-809,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2090.261,2098.504,"So you're saying that ERISA, at least that section, incorporates all of the other legal prohibitions against what a trustee can do?"
1995.95-809,2,43392,theresa_m_traber,,2098.504,2103.047,"--In 404(a)(1)(D), yes, absolutely."
1995.95-809,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2128.615,2138.64,"But are you saying it's a violation of ERISA for a plan to adopt a provision that would, say, be contrary to a State law for a trustee?"
1995.95-809,2,43392,theresa_m_traber,,2138.64,2142.564,"I... I... we haven't addressed that, Your Honor."
1995.95-809,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2142.564,2145.425,So you don't need to make that point for your argument here.
1995.95-809,2,43392,theresa_m_traber,,2145.425,2150.779,"No, Your Honor, and 4(a)(1)(D) addresses plan terms that violate ERISA specifically."
1995.95-809,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2153.3,2159.214,"So you're not relying on any proposition that, because this might have violated some other law, it's bad."
1995.95-809,2,43392,theresa_m_traber,,2162.106,2163.238,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1995.95-809,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2191.535,2197.86,May I ask you if the portion of section 406... 404 on which you rely is quoted in any of the papers?
1995.95-809,2,43392,theresa_m_traber,,2197.86,2199.161,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1995.95-809,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2199.161,2200.181,And do you know where?
1995.95-809,2,43392,theresa_m_traber,,2200.181,2204.524,"There are quotations to many statutes in the papers, Your Honor."
1995.95-809,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2205.245,2209.036,"But you place particular reliance on 404, that's why--"
1995.95-809,2,43392,theresa_m_traber,,2209.036,2209.367,--Yes.
