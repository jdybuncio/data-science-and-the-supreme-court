1979.9_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,57.503,We will hear argument next in United States v. Louisiana.
1979.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,60.59,63.459,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.9_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,227.554,228.342,There is no what?
1979.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,228.342,232.068,There is no dispute between the parties with respect to it.
1979.9_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,329.842,330.438,"Do you know how much is involved in that, Mr. Claiborne?"
1979.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,330.438,334.53,Approximately $19 million.
1979.9_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,335.901,339.202,"This involves Zone 1, so-called?"
1979.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,339.202,341.401,"Well, so we thought."
1979.9_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,347.566,350.561,"On the other side, it involves Zone 4, right?"
1979.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,350.561,353.156,There is no issue with respect to Zone 4 because --
1979.9_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,353.156,357.058,"No, but --"
1979.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,357.058,360.243,There would have been had Louisiana been --
1979.9_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,360.243,364.252,"It is what you call extravagant claims, it would have involved Zone 4."
1979.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,364.252,377.302,"Indeed, though they would have been more extravagant than Louisiana ever put forward because Zone 4 was defined as that area which Louisiana did not by its most extravagant claims assert."
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,1614.088,1619.138,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.9_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1889.193,1893.335,"The United States is not an ordinary escrow agent though, wouldn't you agree?"
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,1893.335,1896.92,"No, I don't agree, Mr. Chief Justice Burger."
1979.9_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1968.168,1971.297,"Well, it is an interest claim, where interest is an equivalent, isn't it?"
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,1971.297,1972.112,No.
1979.9_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1984.817,1986.175,Another way of saying that is interest.
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,1986.175,1987.532,"Wait, please."
1979.9_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2007.0,2009.253,How would you value it?
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2009.253,2011.37,I think I would value it the same way.
1979.9_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2020.078,2023.083,"When you hire money, what you pay is interest."
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2023.083,2024.752,That's correct.
1979.9_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2055.835,2064.591,"What if the United States had held your money in a separate fund, never used it, just deposited it in some bank somewhere and there it sat and drew no interest whatsoever."
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2064.591,2065.96,That is the tin can theory.
1979.9_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2077.159,2079.118,And damages would be the interest that the money would have earned?
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2079.118,2080.973,If you wish to measure them in that way.
1979.9_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2084.261,2088.143,What is the legal rate when they are over in the Court of Claims?
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2088.143,2100.453,"Well, you know we rely in our brief on an 1841 statute that says that the government shall invest trust funds and government securities at 5 percent."
1979.9_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2227.845,2231.286,"That is a rather remarkable argument, if I understand you correctly."
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2239.409,2240.753,"That's right, they --"
1979.9_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2240.753,2242.835,"In other words, they horn swoggled the United States."
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2242.835,2243.405,"Oh, no."
1979.9_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2254.982,2257.748,You mean the Louisiana witnesses so testified?
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2257.748,2258.155,What's that?
1979.9_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2258.155,2263.68,You are saying the Louisiana witnesses testified as to the reason why the United States representatives didn't bring it up?
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2263.68,2264.635,That's why they thought --
1979.9_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2264.635,2265.824,"Well, how did they know that?"
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2265.824,2277.292,"Well, they wouldn't, know that, Your Honor, but if you are going to take -- of course they wouldn't know it, but they presumed that the reason the United States didn't bring it up was the same reason that they wouldn't bring it up."
1979.9_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2280.636,2287.306,"Well, their presumption as to what the United States negotiators may have thought surely has no probative value whatsoever, does it?"
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2287.306,2303.933,"And their presumption about what they had in their minds has only probative value if you take the entire context of what they had in their minds, and what they had in their minds was these words that have been written down and handed to us by the United States that imply that that escrow agent has to pay interest to us."
1979.9_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2303.933,2308.631,"Well, if that was so clearly in their minds, I find it remarkable that they wouldn't discuss the rate of interest."
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2308.631,2311.504,"Listen, I always learned if you've got your case, one, you shut up."
1979.9_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2311.504,2314.67,"Well, apparently you didn't have the case, one, at least at the Master's level."
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2314.67,2322.723,"But we thought so at the table of negotiation, so that was the intention of our people at that time."
1979.9_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2351.598,2352.763,Let's go back a step.
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2361.563,2366.653,"If they knew the law of escrow and the responsibility of trustees, certainly the knew it."
1979.9_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2366.653,2377.424,"But you just said, I take it, that subjectively the Louisiana negotiators knew that the United States had no intention or paying interest."
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2377.424,2379.038,They thought that.
1979.9_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2379.038,2380.568,"Well, you can't have it both ways."
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2387.979,2394.072,"They felt that what would govern would be the words of that contract, and I have to tell you --"
1979.9_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2394.072,2395.604,"Well, Louisiana did --"
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2395.604,2395.906,Yes.
1979.9_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2395.906,2398.245,"-- but what about the United States, not intending to pay interest?"
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2398.245,2400.319,I don't know what they thought.
1979.9_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2418.95,2420.926,"Which way do you run it, that they would or that they should or shouldn't pay interest?"
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2420.926,2436.064,"No, I would run that to the effect that, no matter what they thought, interest would have to begin at the end of the longest period of time, a year and six months, because that is all they were thinking about, all of the parties at that table."
1979.9_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2439.595,2443.85,"Why wasn't any of the principle ever paid over, by the way?"
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2443.85,2444.192,All right.
1979.9_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2457.27,2459.06,With interest or without?
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2459.06,2462.335,"No, just a check for the principle, no interest."
1979.9_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2462.335,2465.36,"Well, wouldn't your claim for interest have been good then?"
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2465.36,2467.947,"No, and I will tell you why."
1979.9_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2484.483,2491.459,Except that I suppose you are certainly claiming interest on that amount that was paid over to you?
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2491.459,2493.827,"Yes, certainly we are."
1979.9_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2493.827,2501.119,"Well, I would have thought somebody would have stopped interest on that amount by paying interest."
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2501.119,2502.083,"Well, I wish they had."
1979.9_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2505.697,2507.897,And not a murmur about interest at that time?
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2507.897,2509.018,Not a murmur.
1979.9_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2509.632,2511.816,Did it even cross your mind at that time?
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2511.816,2513.586,I only became Attorney General --
1979.9_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2513.586,2517.159,"Well, you are speaking for the United States and you ought to be able to speak --"
1979.9_orig,1,44793,william_j_guste_jr,,2517.159,2521.125,"Well, there is nothing in the record and I really don't know those things."
1979.9_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2549.025,2551.965,Mr. Ellis.
1979.9_orig,2,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,2551.965,2553.669,I was on the case at that time.
1979.9_orig,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2590.96,2597.73,Let's back up a second -- and interest paid over?
1979.9_orig,2,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,2597.73,2599.615,"There was not interest paid over, no, sir."
1979.9_orig,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2599.615,2604.894,"I know, but the resolution should have said invested and interest paid."
1979.9_orig,2,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,2604.894,2610.265,"Well, investments may be by dividends also, such as Gulf State Utilities Company, et cetera."
1979.9_orig,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2614.93,2621.473,"I know, but you say investing it, you say that automatically implies that any return comes to you?"
1979.9_orig,2,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,2621.473,2626.794,"To the winner, for the benefit of the ultimate winner of the contested funds."
1979.9_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2626.794,2632.792,That is a unilateral wish that the legislature expressed.
1979.9_orig,2,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,2644.436,2653.326,"It was communicated to the United States as a request pursuant to what was construed as a duty of the United States under the agreement, Your Honor."
1979.9_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2653.326,2656.322,"Communicated, that doesn't make an agreement, does it?"
1979.9_orig,2,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,2656.322,2657.71,"That's correct, that was not, no."
1979.9_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3400.65,3402.419,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.9_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3556.382,3560.83,What if you had invested it?
1979.9_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3569.897,3574.497,"I think, Mr. Justice White, that if the agreement had accordingly been amended --"
1979.9_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3574.497,3576.865,"Well, I am talking about this agreement."
1979.9_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3581.255,3593.231,"That might properly be viewed as an implied amendment of the agreement done at the request of Louisiana, the acquiescence of the United States with respect to monies held under the agreement."
1979.9_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3595.015,3597.901,"Well, what if you had invested it from the outset?"
1979.9_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3597.901,3611.918,"Well, in these circumstances I don't, think we would owe interest because the agreement doesn't provide for it, but there would be an equitable claim that we should have some of the benefit of it."
1979.9_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3612.503,3617.681,Then why isn't there an equitable claim that they should have the benefit of your use of the money?
1979.9_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3619.864,3631.126,The equities are no stronger against our use of the money than they are with respect to Louisiana's use of our money for thirty years on which we claim no interest and have no right to claim any interest.
1979.9_orig,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3655.688,3656.499,"Thank you, gentlemen."
