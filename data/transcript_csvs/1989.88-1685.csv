1989.88-1685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.106,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 88-1685, the National Labor Relations Board v. Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc.--"
1989.88-1685,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,13.158,17.11,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,118.743,133.67,"Mr. Shapiro, do you think that the Board could have given any evidentiary value to the fact that it was replacement workers who were working?"
1989.88-1685,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,141.324,145.227,"Your Honor, I think two things are clear."
1989.88-1685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,163.605,166.307,Do you think it should count for something?
1989.88-1685,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,166.307,168.557,--The fact that replacements have been hired?
1989.88-1685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,168.557,169.009,Yes.
1989.88-1685,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,169.009,175.93,"I think it is a relevant fact, and that in certain circumstances it may well make a difference, but that it has--"
1989.88-1685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,175.93,178.032,What else is necessary?
1989.88-1685,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,178.032,188.804,"--Well, there is, at the moment, I think, an ongoing dialogue between the Board and the courts of appeals on exactly what is required."
1989.88-1685,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,228.26,235.414,"Mr. Shapiro, I can under... it is the Board's rule that a good faith doubt suffices."
1989.88-1685,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,281.193,286.797,"Your Honor, I think I would like to do two things in response to that question."
1989.88-1685,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,334.946,336.746,"They wanted their members rehired, didn't they?"
1989.88-1685,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,336.746,337.898,--I think they would have liked that.
1989.88-1685,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,337.898,342.35,"Well, it's very hard to get your members rehired if the people that have been brought in to replace them are not told to leave."
1989.88-1685,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,342.35,369.584,"Well, in many situations, as Judge Williams pointed out in the dissent below, the accommodation that is reached is for the employer to take back many or most of the strikers, although some have been gone... may have gone on to other jobs, to take back many or most of the strikers, but to retain many or most of the replacements, and then to rely on a process of attrition, if the business is not expanding, to bring the work complement back to what it was."
1989.88-1685,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,374.505,375.857,Not very much.
1989.88-1685,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,394.649,404.905,"Your Honor, I don't... but the question here, I think, is not whether a Board decision to adopt a presumption of this kind is correct and entitled to deference."
1989.88-1685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,555.537,572.831,"Well, it couldn't have existed for 50 years, if the Board's old rule used to be that if the bargaining unit now contains a majority of replacements, that that establishes a good faith doubt."
1989.88-1685,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,572.831,592.412,"Your Honor, I was backtracking to the underlying rule that said that... that still says that an employer may withdraw recognition only if he can establish that the union no longer has a majority, or that there is a sufficient objective basis for a good faith doubt."
1989.88-1685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,593.179,599.648,"Well, didn't the Board used to say that if a majority of the bargaining unit consists of replacements that--"
1989.88-1685,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,599.648,600.1,--Until--
1989.88-1685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,600.1,601.0,--there is a good faith doubt?
1989.88-1685,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,601.0,601.334,--Yes.
1989.88-1685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,601.767,603.469,That rebuts the presumption.
1989.88-1685,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,603.469,605.352,--Until the mid-1970s.
1989.88-1685,1,29599,james_v_carroll_iii,,1666.064,1669.183,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1685,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1723.818,1733.542,"Well, I gathered from Mr. Shapiro's presentation that the Board would not agree with your statement, Mr. Carroll, that they find a number of different situations and they say it is not always true."
1989.88-1685,1,29599,james_v_carroll_iii,,1733.542,1740.212,"Well, Your Honor, that is true, and the Board cites two cases, IT Services and Stormer, in its brief, footnote 12."
1989.88-1685,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1765.578,1780.254,"Yes, but it doesn't necessarily follow from the fact that the union would like to get the replacements replaced, that if they aren't replaced, the replacements that are going to stay on would not vote for the union."
1989.88-1685,1,29599,james_v_carroll_iii,,1795.93,1808.905,"Your Honor, in the first place, the Station KKHI rule is a rule that pertains both to prestrike end situations, in other words withdrawals of recognition which occur during the strike."
1989.88-1685,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1832.103,1838.774,"Well, don't you think it is fair to ask well, would the replacements like to have the... have a union representation, as long as they have got their jobs?"
1989.88-1685,1,29599,james_v_carroll_iii,,1838.774,1839.543,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1989.88-1685,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1847.797,1858.354,"I know, but the... but the Board refuses to infer, just from the fact that they are replacements, that they would not vote for a union."
1989.88-1685,1,29599,james_v_carroll_iii,,1858.354,1859.837,"--That is correct, and we think that is--"
1989.88-1685,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1859.837,1862.908,"And if they... I don't know, that--"
1989.88-1685,1,29599,james_v_carroll_iii,,1872.145,1873.995,--The question is whether they want this particular union.
1989.88-1685,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.995,1874.878,That's what I thought.
1989.88-1685,1,29599,james_v_carroll_iii,,1875.947,1876.863,The incumbent union.
1989.88-1685,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1877.497,1878.215,I agree with that.
1989.88-1685,1,29599,james_v_carroll_iii,,1878.215,1883.434,"And in truth, and in fact, the Board's so-called no presumption rule is not a no presumption rule at all."
1989.88-1685,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1921.357,1944.739,"Mr. Carroll, did the court below articulate a presumption, do you think, that the Board has to consider that the replacements workers will not support this union?"
1989.88-1685,1,29599,james_v_carroll_iii,,1944.739,1945.272,Your Honor--
1989.88-1685,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1945.272,1954.511,"Did it... or, is it open to treat it as an evidentiary inference, if it is justified?"
1989.88-1685,1,29599,james_v_carroll_iii,,1954.511,1964.367,"--Well, as I read the Fifth Circuit's opinion, it did rely on Professor Gorman's statement from his treatise, which merely reflected the 25-year history of the Board's dealing with this evidence."
1989.88-1685,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1975.859,1989.168,"Because there does seem to be a difference in whether there has to be a presumption one way or another, and what will suffice for meeting a burden of proof by a preponderance."
1989.88-1685,1,29599,james_v_carroll_iii,,1989.168,1996.572,"Justice O'Connor, I believe, as I was saying earlier, there are really only one, only two choices for the board when replacements are hired."
1989.88-1685,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2085.13,2091.617,"Well, I suppose the Board would say that's the operation of the underlying presumption of continuing majority support."
1989.88-1685,1,29599,james_v_carroll_iii,,2091.617,2094.235,"Well, undoubtedly they would, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.88-1685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2138.765,2162.13,"Mr. Carroll, are you arguing for a presumption, or are you arguing for the ability of the employer to say that in a particular case the fact that these are re-hires from a strike can be taken into account to determine that there is a reasonable doubt?"
1989.88-1685,1,29599,james_v_carroll_iii,,2162.13,2162.496,Your Honor--
1989.88-1685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2162.496,2167.098,Or do you say it must always lead to the conclusion of reasonable doubt?
1989.88-1685,1,29599,james_v_carroll_iii,,2167.098,2169.95,"--We argue two, for two results."
1989.88-1685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2183.876,2188.78,"Two years after the strike is over, and two years after the replacements have been there?"
1989.88-1685,1,29599,james_v_carroll_iii,,2188.78,2190.263,"Well, I would not make that argument, no, Sir."
1989.88-1685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2190.263,2195.267,"Well, then you are not saying that it's... that it's a uniform presumption."
1989.88-1685,1,29599,james_v_carroll_iii,,2203.29,2215.264,"And specifically under the facts of this case, where the persons were hired during the course of the strike, and recognition was withdrawn at the time that the union requested reinstatement, a few days after that time."
1989.88-1685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2238.963,2241.513,I'm not sure we're talking about presumptions here.
1989.88-1685,1,29599,james_v_carroll_iii,,2255.573,2266.796,"--The Board has a rule... our second position, Position B, Justice Scalia, is that the Board's rule forecloses the evidentiary weight of this evidence."
1989.88-1685,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2315.543,2319.812,"Mr. Carroll, that's not what Mr. Shapiro said today, is it?"
1989.88-1685,1,29599,james_v_carroll_iii,,2319.812,2327.435,"--It is not, and all I can do is ask the Court please to... review those authorities, because they are there for the world to see."
1989.88-1685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2328.001,2329.62,Tell us which ones they are.
1989.88-1685,1,29599,james_v_carroll_iii,,2329.62,2332.386,"--Tile, Terrazo Contractors, at footnote 2."
1989.88-1685,2,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3405.556,3407.289,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.88-1685,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3476.384,3492.743,"So, Mr. Shapiro, if the Board excludes a lot of what would otherwise be normal ways of proving a fact, to refuse to adopt a presumption can be much more important than if there were lots of other ways of proving facts."
1989.88-1685,2,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3492.743,3500.682,"--Your Honor, the Board has adhered to the good faith test, although I think, as several members of the Court have suggested, it may not have to."
1989.88-1685,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3523.365,3531.32,"Mr. Shapiro, the question is not whether in fact these employees support the union or not."
1989.88-1685,2,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3561.387,3577.248,"--That question of what is a sufficient objective basis to create a good faith doubt, which is a rule that the Board itself has created, is itself a question of law in which, we submit, the Board's judgment is entitled to deference."
1989.88-1685,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3577.748,3578.515,"Thank you, Mr. Shapiro."
