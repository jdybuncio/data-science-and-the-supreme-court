2015.13-1339,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.23,"We'll hear argument next today in Case 13-1339, Spokeo v. Robins. Mr. Pincus."
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,7.23,32.755,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has said that the irreducible constitutional minimum for standing is injury in fact; that the plaintiff suffered actual or imminent, tangible harm. In Lujan, the Court said that Congress may elevate to the status of legally-cognizable injuries, concrete, de facto injuries that were previously inadequate in law. Here, the Ninth Circuit held that there's no need for any de facto injury."
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,39.54,40.28,Why is it you think --
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,40.28,40.86,-- consequences --
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,40.86,49.88,Let's say I agree with you that there needs to be a concrete injury; that Congress needs to have recognized something that looks like a concrete injury.
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,98.66,109.54,"No, it's not, for -- for three reasons, Your Honor. And let me preface my response by saying that, of course, that isn't the case with respect to three of the claims in this case, which don't have anything to do with inaccuracy."
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,109.54,109.65,Okay.
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,111.35,112.07,I'm happy to focus --
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,112.07,128.54,"-- the gravamen of the claim. And why isn't the dissemination of false information about you in a credit report, why isn't that -- why isn't it -- it perfectly sufficient if Congress says that's a concrete injury?"
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,128.54,142.71,"Well, I -- I guess as a threshold matter, I think what the Court has said in other contexts is that Congress should clearly say that it is going beyond the tangible injuries that this Court has defined."
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,156.17,157.73,I'm sorry.
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,157.73,161.65,"Let me start -- well, maybe I can answer your question this way."
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,161.65,164.83,You said that there were reasons why that was not a concrete injury --
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,164.83,165.0,Yes.
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,165.0,173.925,"-- the dissemination of false information about a particular person. Why? Because to me, I'll just say, seems like a concrete injury to me."
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,173.925,175.29,"Well, first -- first of all --"
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,175.29,183.84,"You know? If -- I mean, if somebody did it to me I'd feel harmed. And I think that if you went out on the street and you did a survey, most people would feel harmed."
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,193.57,203.95,"First of all, the -- the common law tradition, which the Court has looked to, did not say that the dissemination of any false statement was an injury. To prove defamation --"
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,203.95,205.02,That's quite right.
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,225.87,229.8,"Well, let me answer your question in two ways."
2015.13-1339,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,244.51,263.87,"Can -- can you explain, then, the common law versus the legislature? So if we have some historic practice where damages are awarded to someone who has no out-of-pocket loss, if the common law says so it's okay but if Congress says so it's not? It's very strange."
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,263.87,270.8,"I don't think so, Your Honor. I think -- well, this question takes me a little afield from -- from Justice Kagan's question."
2015.13-1339,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,288.35,288.97,I'm sorry.
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,302.0,303.205,"Your Honor, I think --"
2015.13-1339,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,303.205,309.61,"I mean, most of the common law rights, like property rights, are -- are given to you by statute."
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,316.489,331.11,"And -- and the question is -- there are several ways that they can establish standing. One is to have the tangible harm, to meet the general tangible harm test that this Court applies, generally, in the standing context."
2015.13-1339,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,361.26,372.025,"So if I have a dozen or more cases that didn't involve property rights, where we didn't require economic harm, those would mean nothing to you?"
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,372.025,372.87,"Your Honor, I --"
2015.13-1339,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,372.87,377.955,"Those legal rights, we just decided through the centuries, all those cases wrong?"
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,377.955,383.03,"Well, I don't think -- there certainly aren't any cases that my friends cite that -- that meet that test."
2015.13-1339,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,387.4,389.525,"Well, what's the answer, then, to Justice Kagan's question?"
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,389.525,389.875,Okay.
2015.13-1339,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,390.13,394.36,"You said it could be psychic harm, there could be economic harm, there could be all different kinds of harm."
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,406.415,417.88,"It could be. If I can just finish my answer to -- to Justice Sotomayor, because I just want to make clear, and I think the College Savings case is a perfect analogy here, that every cause of action does not confer a property right."
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,455.66,459.99,These are not -- these -- these are not unimportant details.
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,468.91,471.72,"Well, Your Honor, your hypothetical, though, is any false statement."
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,479.83,481.31,"Here's the thing, Mr. Pincus."
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,533.6,539.135,"Well, I think there's a threshold assumption in your question that Congress actually identified that as a real-world harm."
2015.13-1339,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,571.92,580.51,"Well, how much more do you think the plaintiff in this case would have to allege or prove in order to show injury in fact?"
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,580.51,590.41,"I think if the plaintiff could show that -- that there was some -- some consequence to him, some -- from the false information: Something happened to his credit."
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,591.84,594.22,"But that's a really hard thing to do, Mr. Pincus."
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,594.22,595.22,"Well, there's actually --"
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,595.22,598.87,"People get these reports, and you don't know what they're doing with these reports."
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,618.84,620.63,"Well, Your Honor, I'm not sure that's so."
2015.13-1339,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,632.94,674.285,"I suppose -- I suppose the argument underlying some of the questions you've been asked assumes that if neighbors are making false comments, talking about someone, this is not actionable enough unless it's defamation. On the Internet with -- in this cyber age that we have where all this information is out, there's -- there's -- has to be some real injury. Is it different because this is a credit agency that is regulated? Does a credit agency have less latitude when it is defending on the ground of no concrete injury than other entities?"
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,674.285,682.16,"Well, I think there's a threshold question, Your Honor, of whether Congress made the determination that there should be a different treatment for -- for credit agencies."
2015.13-1339,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,688.47,692.54,But does the statute apply just to crediting? That's what -- that's what I was asking.
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,692.54,693.3,It does.
2015.13-1339,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,709.97,711.38,That's not disputed in this case.
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,711.38,711.99,Excuse me?
2015.13-1339,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,711.99,721.335,"It may have been disputed at an earlier stage, but now it's accepted that the defendant is a credit reporting agency."
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,721.335,723.17,"Well, it hasn't been ruled on by the lower court."
2015.13-1339,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,724.88,726.31,We must assume that that's true.
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,726.31,738.41,"-- that's the -- that's the posture. But -- but I think, going back to Justice Kennedy's question, I think what Congress did here was to create a massive number of regulatory requirements that are imposed on credit reporting agencies."
2015.13-1339,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,756.155,756.6,Isn't that --
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,756.6,757.65,-- in the absence of real harm.
2015.13-1339,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,757.65,762.835,"Isn't that, though, a question of the application of the statute?"
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,762.835,763.35,No.
2015.13-1339,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,763.63,775.04,It doesn't invalidate the injury here because this is the quintessential violation of the statute. He's saying they don't have reasonable procedures to check their accuracy.
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,837.74,839.335,"Well, respectfully -- I'm sorry."
2015.13-1339,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,839.335,855.42,"So I guess my question is, we've now taken a word, ""concreteness,"" that the Court in recent years has applied to injuries by citizens and when they can bring actions or not."
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,889.73,889.88,No.
2015.13-1339,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,889.88,891.785,It's a requirement.
2015.13-1339,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,891.785,895.06,Why don't you answer Justice Sotomayor's question first?
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,895.06,897.47,"Respectfully, I don't think that the cases say that."
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,928.18,929.9,"Well, I agree with you entirely on that."
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,929.9,930.02,Okay.
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,930.72,931.09,Go ahead.
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,931.09,936.55,"I -- I just want to also sort of distinguish -- in responding to your question, I think there are two questions."
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,984.24,988.005,"Congress does it by doing it, you know? Congress doesn't announce exactly --"
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,988.005,988.78,"Well, I'm not sure --"
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,988.78,991.725,"-- here we are, we're just going beyond the common law."
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1020.89,1021.51,Well --
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1021.51,1044.979,"And -- and so Congress has clearly done that here. And I guess I -- if you want to just explain to me why it is that Congress can't do -- I think we've said that Congress can do that, can go beyond the common law, and certainly can go beyond anything that we've ever said is a concrete harm as long as they've identified a concrete harm."
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1044.979,1048.37,"Well, a couple of responses to that."
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1054.31,1063.41,"Of course, harms can arise in the world, and can be identified in the world even though they haven't arisen before, or been identified before."
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1063.41,1081.54,"But the -- but the Court's -- I think the question -- and I take the burden of my friend's argument to be that Congress can define things as sufficient to satisfy standing, even if they wouldn't, if they just were asserted at a court, satisfied the tangible harm requirement. So I -- I guess, to respond to your question --"
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1081.54,1082.72,"If you're saying that, I agree with you."
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1082.72,1083.15,Okay.
2015.13-1339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1094.02,1109.005,"Mr. Pincus, I would have thought that your answer to Justice Kagan would have been Congress did not identify, as the harm for which it allowed suit to be brought, misinformation."
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1145.72,1147.33,And I apologize if I haven't been clear.
2015.13-1339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1147.72,1148.53,Isn't that your answer?
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1148.53,1151.04,That is exactly our argument -- (Laughter.)
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1151.04,1157.11,-- that Congress here created a remedy for any regulatory violation.
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1158.06,1160.81,"But why did Congress do that, Mr. Pincus? Congress did that --"
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1160.81,1161.12,"Well, can I --"
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1161.12,1167.72,-- Congress did that as a safe harbor. We are not -- it's a kind of industry-friendly act that Congress did.
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1195.43,1195.735,Well --
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1195.735,1205.76,"And that's what this is. It's a procedural requirement, the disregard of which can impair your interest in being represented accurately in credit reports."
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1205.76,1207.57,"Well, there is some problems with that, Your Honor."
2015.13-1339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1210.59,1211.02,Excuse me.
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1214.42,1214.94,Exactly.
2015.13-1339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1214.94,1218.95,-- not just somebody who -- whose information was -- was wrong.
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1218.95,1220.18,Because most of the --
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1220.18,1220.28,No.
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1220.28,1226.51,"If I may, Your Honor. Most of the statutory and regulatory requirements have nothing to do with falsity."
2015.13-1339,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1243.539,1262.28,"""Any person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed upon this subjecter with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer."" So it's not the whole world; it's the consumer that you dealt with --"
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1262.28,1262.94,"But, Your Honor --"
2015.13-1339,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1262.94,1265.455,-- or that the agency -- that the agency dealt with.
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1265.455,1277.42,"But, Your Honor, if the argument is that by enacting that, Congress meant to identify as a harm false statements, there's nothing that requires proof of a false or inaccurate statement in order to bring the claim."
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1277.42,1289.58,"Well, but, Mr. Pincus, the gravamen of this claim, as I said, and as more importantly, as -- as the -- the Respondent has said, is in 1681(e), which does talk about accuracy."
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1319.78,1333.26,"But -- but, Your Honor, I don't see how you can say that a cause of action that says nothing about inaccuracy applies to a previously enacted -- one of the many provisions of the statute, to create -- to say that Congress was focused on inaccuracies."
2015.13-1339,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1333.26,1334.66,Are you -- are you saying --
2015.13-1339,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1334.66,1335.64,Justice Kennedy.
2015.13-1339,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1335.64,1346.26,Are you saying in this case that Congress could have drafted a statute that would allow this individual to bring suit?
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1346.26,1350.16,"I think Congress -- yes, I think it might be possible."
2015.13-1339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1431.195,1433.05,"Do all of them go to accuracy, or --"
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1433.05,1433.16,No.
2015.13-1339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1433.16,1436.03,-- do some of them go to privacy and other matters?
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1436.03,1438.93,Most of -- one is about having an 800 number available.
2015.13-1339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1442.1,1445.83,"And that would be a violation, right, if -- if you didn't provide that?"
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1445.83,1447.325,Under -- under --
2015.13-1339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1447.325,1462.94,"And -- and presumably anybody, if -- if you believe Respondent, anybody who -- whose information is not accurate can sue to get the statutory damages for failure to provide an 800 number."
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1462.94,1468.73,"Well, I think Respondents would say even if the information was accurate, you could sue to get the statutory damages."
2015.13-1339,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1471.46,1490.01,"Counsel, I -- when we normally have a standing inquiry, you -- there can be some people who have standing under a particular statute and some who don't. Is -- is your position simply that you have to look at whether the plaintiffs have been injured in fact, and that some plaintiffs will be able to proceed if they can make that showing and others may not?"
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1490.01,1492.62,"Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice; that's our position."
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1500.92,1501.23,"Well, was this --"
2015.13-1339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1501.23,1504.97,By the particular violation? Injured in fact by the particular --
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1504.97,1505.14,Yes.
2015.13-1339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1505.14,1507.885,"Not by failure to have an 800 number, you're saying?"
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1507.885,1508.23,No.
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1518.42,1533.11,"No, because the district court found that all of the allegations of -- all of his arguments about why there was any tangible harm to him were speculative and flunked this Court's standard."
2015.13-1339,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1533.11,1534.5,Mr. Pincus --
2015.13-1339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1534.5,1537.785,I guess -- I guess what I -- that's okay.
2015.13-1339,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1537.785,1569.17,"Before you sit down, the -- the brief suggests that the real danger of allowing this kind of action is that it -- it will be brought on behalf of a class, and you could get millions of plaintiffs and billions of dollars. If we should hold that Congress can give consumers a right to redress for false credit reporting, if we held that, would you have grounds to oppose certification of a class."
2015.13-1339,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1569.17,1584.42,"Well, I think the problem here, Your Honor, is if you accept the broad theory that plaintiffs and the government espouse, which is all you have to show is a statutory violation, it's a pretty clear pathway to class certification because there is only common issues."
2015.13-1339,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1596.8,1601.745,"Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Consovoy."
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1601.745,1632.78,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Mr. Robins has Article III standing for three independent reasons. First, the violation of the statutory rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act constitutes injury in fact. Second, even if not, his entitlement to monetary relief as a consequence of that violation shows he has the personal stake that Article III requires. And third, the fact that his claim follows from the common law of defamation conclusively establishes that it is a case or controversy within the meaning of Article III."
2015.13-1339,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1632.78,1645.415,"I -- your -- your number two -- I mean, we can -- it sounds to me quite circular. You say -- you say he -- he has a personal stake because he has a -- because Congress said he has a personal stake. Is -- do I understand your argument?"
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1645.415,1647.44,I view it just like a contract case.
2015.13-1339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1668.465,1671.885,"All Congress has to do is provide for damages, right?"
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1671.885,1672.05,No.
2015.13-1339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1673.15,1673.35,Well --
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1673.35,1682.58,"It has to still create an interest, a discrete, legal interest that's personal to him; that only -- that is not a generalized grievance; that is not undifferentiated harm."
2015.13-1339,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1685.64,1687.755,But -- but that is a harm. It is a harm.
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1692.345,1707.67,So -- so the harm -- the violation of a legally-vested interest at common law in this Court's decisions throughout has always been deemed a concrete harm. Going back to Tennessee Electric where the Court narrowly used to say that a legal right was an injury.
2015.13-1339,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1717.53,1731.75,"What about a law that says you get a -- $10,000 statutory damages if a company publishes inaccurate information about you? You want -- you have an unlisted phone number."
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1745.42,1747.315,Congress has a lot of work to do there.
2015.13-1339,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1747.315,1747.89,I'm sorry?
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1747.89,1750.88,Congress has a great deal of work it needs to do to show --
2015.13-1339,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1750.88,1761.215,But -- but can you have -- do you have standing? Do you have injury in fact when you don't want people calling you; the company publishes a false telephone number.
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1761.215,1762.4,So the call --
2015.13-1339,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1762.4,1769.285,"Whether Congress has a lot of work or not, at the end of the day, can you recover those statutory damages?"
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1769.285,1779.09,"If Congress identified the interest of you receiving a phone call, and that's the injury, and you don't receive the phone call, you haven't suffered the injury Congress identified."
2015.13-1339,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1779.09,1779.74,"No, no, no, no."
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1780.26,1780.53,I'm sorry.
2015.13-1339,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1780.53,1797.15,"The injury they identify is we don't think companies should public false -- publish false information about you. Is it the end of the standing inquiry to say they published false information about me, or do you have to ask were you injured in some way by that publication?"
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1797.15,1797.68,No.
2015.13-1339,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1800.56,1807.145,"So it's in -- so what -- what would you say the injury in fact, not in law but in fact, is in that case?"
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1807.145,1813.0,So I don't think the contradistinction is between an injury in fact and an injury in law.
2015.13-1339,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1819.805,1823.395,But our cases have always said actual injury in fact.
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1832.475,1833.395,No.
2015.13-1339,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1858.095,1858.68,"No, but --"
2015.13-1339,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1858.68,1860.22,That's a very different question.
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1872.9,1893.805,"So I think the -- the Court uses the phrase ""concrete and particularized."" That's two companion words, I think, getting at these same concepts. Now, two things have to happen: One, to show that it's a differentiated claim, that it's not a generalized grievance, you have to identify a subclass of people who are distinctly harmed other than the general population."
2015.13-1339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1896.07,1898.315,"Well, I think that's the particularized part."
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1898.315,1900.955,The particularized part is that you're among those people.
2015.13-1339,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1902.56,1903.69,But how in the Chief Justice's --
2015.13-1339,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1903.69,1904.44,But -- but the law --
2015.13-1339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1904.44,1908.1,Concrete -- concrete has nothing to do with particularized.
2015.13-1339,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1914.23,1925.235,"And I was going to say, the -- the Lujan case says de facto, which is actual, existing in fact, having effect, even though not formally or legally recognized."
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1925.235,1926.78,So -- yes.
2015.13-1339,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1937.3,1940.935,"Yes, but this is my own view of this, maybe no one else's."
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2049.005,2051.345,I'll be responding to you: He does not.
2015.13-1339,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2051.345,2051.93,Fine.
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2068.98,2069.18,That --
2015.13-1339,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2069.18,2075.855,They mean any consumer who has obtained -- who suffers from false information.
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2075.855,2076.2,That --
2015.13-1339,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2076.2,2079.05,"If that's the government's position, then it's not a public action."
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2080.04,2081.8,That is -- that is Respondent's position.
2015.13-1339,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2081.8,2082.09,That's --
2015.13-1339,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2082.09,2082.91,In relation to that --
2015.13-1339,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2082.91,2083.41,-- that -- that's --
2015.13-1339,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2083.41,2084.22,Could I just say --
2015.13-1339,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2084.22,2084.68,Justice Alito.
2015.13-1339,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2084.68,2099.55,"In relation to that, can I just ask you something about that, that goes to how Spokeo operates: Is there anything here to indicate that anybody other than Mr. Robins ever did a search for him? (Laughter.)"
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2099.55,2101.715,Not in the record that I'm aware of.
2015.13-1339,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2101.715,2131.71,"Then how could -- then isn't that quintessential speculative harm? In my understanding -- you -- correct me if I'm wrong -- you don't have files someplace for every person in the United States or -- you have databases, and you will do a search if somebody asks you to do a search. I assume you wouldn't say that somebody as to whom there never had been a search would have standing, right? Even if -- you know, even if it would be the case that if there was a search it would come up with a lot of false information."
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2131.71,2137.77,"So for it to be a consumer report, there must be communication to a third party. So we have alleged communication to third parties."
2015.13-1339,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2172.9,2184.43,"I thought they had some -- I thought they had some disclaimer that Spokeo does not verify or evaluate each piece of data, It makes no warranties or guarantees about any of the information offer -- offered."
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2184.43,2185.16,And -- and --
2015.13-1339,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2185.16,2187.9,How is that saying if it's not accurate you're a -- he's a liar?
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2187.9,2204.01,"And -- and then it sells -- then it promotes its -- its service -- and this is in the FTC report and also in the complaint -- to human resources executives saying, if you want to run employee checks, come to us. It would be a strange business if they said, Come to us, but who knows if what we're telling you is true. And -- and -- (Laughter.)"
2015.13-1339,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2204.01,2205.66,I think that's what the disclaimer is saying.
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2205.66,2209.17,"But the -- whether the disclaimer is valid -- well, that is -- (Laughter.)"
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2209.17,2212.55,"-- that is exactly what the disclaimer says, but of course, Congress stepped into the breach --"
2015.13-1339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2212.55,2214.19,"You've got to do the best you can, you know? I mean --"
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2214.19,2214.755,I'm sorry?
2015.13-1339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2214.755,2216.54,I said you've got to do the best you can.
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2216.54,2216.84,You do.
2015.13-1339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2217.89,2227.37,"The person who hires somebody, if -- if they all have this disclaimer, which I expect they all do, you -- you either go without any information or you accept one of them."
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2227.37,2232.76,"Except Congress stepped in and said, if you are operating as a consumer reporting agency, you have duties and responsibilities."
2015.13-1339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2232.76,2253.82,I want to ask about what you think Congress did. You're -- you're saying it's limited to -- to people about whom false information has been given. Suppose Congress enacts a statute that says everybody has a right to sue for exorbitant expenditures by the Department of Defense.
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2289.225,2290.145,Likely not.
2015.13-1339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2291.08,2301.665,"Well, why is this case any different? You're -- you're saying only people who have been injured, assuming that -- that false information is injury -- only they can sue."
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2310.21,2323.985,"So it says -- this statute does things that the hypothetical statute does not. This statute says, starting with the cause of action, if you have done something that violates a statute with respect to a specific consumer, that consumer can sue you."
2015.13-1339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2323.985,2324.29,Right.
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2324.29,2333.09,"Then second -- then you look in the provision that we are basing the claim on here, the reasonable procedures provision. So that provision in particular, which is the only one --"
2015.13-1339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2333.09,2333.6,That's fine.
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2333.6,2334.395,-- before the Court --
2015.13-1339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2334.395,2337.545,Where do you get the -- the necessity of injury in fact?
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2337.545,2338.16,So why --
2015.13-1339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2338.16,2343.04,Where do you get the necessity that there has been false information which you assert is there?
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2343.04,2347.88,"So it says, ""reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy. """
2015.13-1339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2347.88,2349.98,Procedures to ensure maximum.
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2352.24,2352.695,No.
2015.13-1339,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2377.52,2400.76,"You have to say, don't you, in answer to Justice Scalia, that the words, ""follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy in respect to any consumer,"" the one who can sue, means that the -- when you fail to do it in respect to a consumer, you say something false about that consumer."
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2407.99,2410.84,And every lower court to reach this question has held that --
2015.13-1339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2410.84,2419.52,"But that wouldn't be true. You could fail to -- to follow the procedures and still come up with accurate information, like you could not have an 800 number."
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2419.52,2421.8,"Correct, and that person would not have standing."
2015.13-1339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2421.8,2424.77,It's impossible to read it that way because it's simply not true.
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2424.77,2426.71,"So, Justice Scalia -- (Laughter.)"
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2426.71,2432.605,-- every lower court to reach this question has held that this particular provision requires falsity as an allegation.
2015.13-1339,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2434.04,2455.005,But I want to -- as I understand -- I take the falsity out of the -- the hypotheticals to get exactly what your position is on the -- the breadth of Congress' power. So let's say the statute says anybody who's publishing information about you has to pay the individual $10 a year.
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2478.23,2478.685,So --
2015.13-1339,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2478.685,2484.99,"Now, does that individual have injury in fact because the statute has been violated with respect to him?"
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2484.99,2488.85,"That, I think no, because that statute would apply to everybody in the country. There would be no --"
2015.13-1339,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2488.85,2489.88,"Oh, no, no, no."
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2497.69,2498.005,Right.
2015.13-1339,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2501.61,2507.595,"So there'd be no standing -- that person would have no standing, even though Congress gave him standing?"
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2507.595,2513.33,Congress can confer substantive rights that lead to standing.
2015.13-1339,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2513.33,2513.56,Yes.
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2513.56,2520.49,But not everything Congress does will convey a substantive right that differentiates you from the general population.
2015.13-1339,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2520.49,2521.36,So if the statute --
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2521.36,2521.91,This one does.
2015.13-1339,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2521.91,2529.78,"-- says $10, no more, no less, he gets $20, does he have standing to sue under that statute?"
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2529.78,2532.98,"I don't think so, because it would apply so broadly to everybody --"
2015.13-1339,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2532.98,2533.29,"No, no, no."
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2539.295,2539.69,Right.
2015.13-1339,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2543.48,2559.53,Isn't there always a materiality question? In every violation there's always a materiality question: What is the falsehood? Is it material to anything? It could be a transposition of a telephone number.
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2559.53,2561.08,That's right.
2015.13-1339,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2568.17,2577.44,"Mr. Consovoy, can I just make sure I understand? You said you -- you need for the information to be inaccurate to have standing here."
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2590.42,2590.88,Yes.
2015.13-1339,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2637.83,2646.67,And one very quick thing. You said in your brief you're really only suing under 1681(e)(B).
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2646.67,2647.12,Uh-huh.
2015.13-1339,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2647.12,2650.765,Can I understand that to be that you're waiving all claims of other things?
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2650.765,2651.22,No.
2015.13-1339,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2674.93,2675.38,Are you saying --
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2675.38,2675.9,-- the general claim.
2015.13-1339,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2675.9,2693.72,"Are you saying you get the statutory damages for the four claims that you listed, or is it only what you've called the overarching claim? And in one footnote you said these other claims are -- are just supportive of the main claim."
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2693.72,2693.92,Right.
2015.13-1339,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2693.92,2715.05,"So are you asking for four times the statutory damages, or are you saying, no, this is really one -- one claim, and so we're asking for $100 dollars a head, or 10,000 -- or for $1000 a head?"
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2715.05,2716.91,It's -- it's one claim. And --
2015.13-1339,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2716.91,2717.65,It's one claim.
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2717.65,2733.88,"It is -- yes, Your Honor. Now, these are big-picture questions, but this case can be resolved on a much narrower issue. This Court has always held that if the cause of action you allege can be found in the common law, and is developed from the common law as in Stevens, that you have standing."
2015.13-1339,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2738.69,2751.41,"The Ninth Circuit didn't address that question, did it? I mean, as I understand it, I'm looking at the footnote, you know, on page 9A, it says it doesn't matter because you -- the statutory injury in law is enough."
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2751.41,2751.8,Right.
2015.13-1339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2767.73,2768.94,Excuse me.
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2793.46,2794.015,So --
2015.13-1339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2794.015,2795.08,-- that it's from common law.
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2795.08,2801.34,"-- in Steel Co., Your Honor, the Court said it must be in the tradition of the common law of the sort, not precisely replicated."
2015.13-1339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2801.34,2801.52,"Oh, I see."
2015.13-1339,1,62606,william_s_consovoy,,2801.83,2802.9,Not precisely replicated.
2015.13-1339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2802.9,2803.565,Close enough.
2015.13-1339,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2804.785,2821.41,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart."
2015.13-1339,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2821.41,2844.435,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Defenders of Wildlife, the Court gave the following description of what injury in fact means: It said injury in fact is, quote, ""an invasion of a legally-protected interest which is, A, concrete and particularized, and, B, actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical."" And so the injury part of it was the invasion of a legally-protected injury -- interest."
2015.13-1339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2859.19,2861.66,"What -- what happened to ""concrete and particularized""?"
2015.13-1339,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2861.66,2862.79,"Well, particularized --"
2015.13-1339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2862.79,2866.185,"We -- we say that in -- in -- in, gee, a whole lot of cases."
2015.13-1339,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2868.4,2868.9,It did.
2015.13-1339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2869.26,2870.5,Say it again.
2015.13-1339,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2870.5,2893.27,"-- ""actual or eminent"" -- well, ""concrete and particularized"" and ""actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical."" And the Court has explained both the terms ""concrete"" and ""particularized"" as aspects of the -- the requirement that the wrong be done to the particular plaintiff, not that it be done to the community as a whole. And the Court used the terms that way in Schlesinger."
2015.13-1339,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2894.0,2903.82,"Mr. Stewart, let's say your -- your -- Congress thinks that the president is not doing enough to stop illegal immigration."
2015.13-1339,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2922.955,2925.72,"Well, I think there would be a couple of different problems with that."
2015.13-1339,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2938.46,2940.41,"Well, I think that's kind of avoiding the hypothetical."
2015.13-1339,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2941.9,2950.195,"But presumably you would raise those issues after the action's been filed, and -- and, you know, you could raise those issues as an amicus defending the action."
2015.13-1339,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2950.195,2965.54,"I mean, I think that would -- typically when Congress has done this, and in all the common law analogues that we've cited, the -- the class of people who could file suit would be people whom the prohibited conduct had a natural tendency to harm."
2015.13-1339,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2965.54,2976.185,"Yes, we're talking about Congress says, Well, these people who are unemployed, illegal immigrants have jobs, they should be able to sue to stop that because the -- you know, because they -- Congress thinks the president isn't doing enough."
2015.13-1339,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2976.185,2987.35,"I mean, I think it would be -- I think that would stretch the limits of Congress's power to -- to treat those -- that broad class of individuals as victims of all acts of illegal immigration."
2015.13-1339,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3012.66,3016.01,"I mean, you know the -- you know the objection behind -- behind my hypothetical."
2015.13-1339,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3016.01,3016.12,Yes.
2015.13-1339,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3016.12,3025.38,"Which is Congress can say, basically, to a group of citizens, you get to enforce one of our laws because we're giving you a cause of action."
2015.13-1339,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3041.63,3057.29,"I -- I think when we get to the point of -- of the hypothetical where any unemployed person in the State is treated as the legal vitamin of every act of unlawful immigration that occurs into that State, we -- we do have concerns. But the -- the statute we're dealing with here says --"
2015.13-1339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3057.29,3075.875,"The statute we're dealing with here treats everybody about whom false information has been given as somebody about whom false information that harms him has been given. I mean, the class is not -- is not coextensive with those -- those that are harmed."
2015.13-1339,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3087.65,3106.885,"Well, again -- again, leaving aside the -- the possibility that immigration is something that can't be dealt with by private suits, if there was some particularized connection required, if the person could show that he applied for the job that the illegal immigrant received, that -- that would be a much different sort of statute. Here the statute we're dealing with doesn't say --"
2015.13-1339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3106.885,3120.0,In the community -- in -- in the border states is not proximate enough for you. Let's just say anybody who is unemployed in the community where there is an illegal immigrant can sue.
2015.13-1339,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3120.0,3132.225,"I think that's still probably too -- too broad a class. And I understand the allure of the hypotheticals, but you could do the same thing with rational-basis review of substantive legislation."
2015.13-1339,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3141.33,3159.29,How -- how -- the difference is that this is dealing with the requirement of a case or controversy which has always been recognized as at the core of Article III jurisdiction. And we have a legion of cases that say you have to have actual injury. That's what makes it a decision appropriate for resolution by the judicial branch.
2015.13-1339,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3163.615,3177.11,"Well, the point is -- I was trying to make was that Congress has been doing this since 1790, and nobody's pointed to a statute that comes close to the hypotheticals. But to -- to return to the point about injury in fact, the Court has said there has to be actual injury."
2015.13-1339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3194.42,3204.08,"What -- we've also said that violation of a procedure, even if you are given a right to the procedure, that alone does not suffice for standing."
2015.13-1339,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3210.455,3211.1,"Well, what --"
2015.13-1339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3211.1,3217.29,"We -- we said that, so it has to be something more than just the violation of what the -- what Congress says is a legal right."
2015.13-1339,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3218.5,3234.32,"And at -- the Court has also said that Congress can't give every citizen an -- an entitlement to sue simply by calling it a legal right. But with respect to procedures, the Court has said you can sue to complain about the deprivation of lawfully-required procedures if those procedures are intended to protect the --"
2015.13-1339,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3234.32,3243.07,"Right -- right here we have in the complaint, I guess, there were certain errors: A photograph of the wrong person; a statement that he's in his 50s; he isn't."
2015.13-1339,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3260.25,3260.72,Exactly.
2015.13-1339,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3260.72,3273.735,"Fine. Now, for purposes of deciding this case, are we simply to refer to this and say, this is a case about a person who's complaining this? And is this, which I just listed, a sufficiently-concrete injury?"
2015.13-1339,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3273.735,3274.12,Yes.
2015.13-1339,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3275.16,3275.43,Thank you.
2015.13-1339,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3275.43,3296.93,"Was it -- then that's not what the Ninth Circuit based its decision on. The Ninth Circuit says he had standing by virtue of the alleged violations of his statutory rights, without respect to whether there was harm to his employment process or related anxiety. So I would suppose, if we're going to decide it on that basis, we have to determine that the Ninth Circuit's rationale was in -- was wrong."
2015.13-1339,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3296.93,3330.22,"I'm sorry I don't have the exact wording in front of me, but if you look at the very first sentence of the Ninth Circuit's opinion, the Ninth Circuit says, ""the question we confront is whether a person has injury in fact when false information about him is disseminated."" Now, the -- the Court said we don't have to decide what is added to the complaint by the allegations that employment prospects were actually harmed. And it's -- and it's also true that the Ninth Circuit didn't analyze the question that it framed in quite the way we would have. It didn't rely on the defamation analogy; it relied on the statutory right."
2015.13-1339,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3335.13,3354.805,"And -- and Mr. Stewart, if I could just -- I mean, the -- maybe this is the sentence that you're talking about. At one point the Court says, ""the interests protected by the statutory rights at issue are sufficiently concrete and particularized."" Now, look, it's not a good opinion, and then it doesn't tell you why it is that they're sufficiently concrete."
2015.13-1339,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3360.48,3374.51,"The -- the other point I would make -- I -- I agree with that. And the other point I would make about Defenders of Wildlife is the statute at issue in that case said any person can sue to complain about particular types of Endangered Species Act violations. And the Court said, that's just too broad."
2015.13-1339,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3436.77,3440.125,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Pincus, you have three minutes remaining."
2015.13-1339,3,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3440.125,3451.3,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Justice Kagan asked the question earlier about how could people find this? You know, our legal system is people have to have allegations that they're harmed."
2015.13-1339,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3480.16,3483.155,So are we ruling on the outcome or are we ruling on the reasoning?
2015.13-1339,3,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3483.155,3513.76,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I think, as the Court comes -- the -- the question presented was does the Ninth Circuit's rule that a mere statutory violation unaccompanied by any harm is sufficient to satisfy Article III? I think the Court has to address that issue. The next issue is: Did Congress elevate -- did -- did Congress say that false statements inflict a certain kind of harm, and therefore, we're going to single them out? And I think, to rely on Congress, Congress actually has to have made that determination."
2015.13-1339,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3525.75,3527.39,I think --
2015.13-1339,3,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3527.39,3528.55,"If it wanted to do that, it should --"
2015.13-1339,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3528.55,3531.225,"See, I look at this case slightly differently."
2015.13-1339,3,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3559.445,3567.24,"Your Honor, that's not right. The -- all of the decisions that my friends refer to were decisions, not where there were willfulness claims, but where there were actual damages claims."
2015.13-1339,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3605.86,3606.34,But here you --
2015.13-1339,3,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3606.34,3613.25,"-- the class of all inaccuracies can't possibly be a class of people, most of whom are going to suffer one harm."
2015.13-1339,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3613.25,3633.18,"We have one brief, the brief of the restitution scholars who say if this Court says that you have to show -- how can -- some harm, what happens to all the restitution cases where you measure the relief by the gain to the defendant? There has been no loss to the plaintiff."
2015.13-1339,3,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3633.18,3636.58,"Your Honor, restitution is all about a measure of damages."
2015.13-1339,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3651.19,3656.55,So what is -- what is the harm to the neighbor whose -- puts a toe into his neighbor's land?
2015.13-1339,3,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3656.55,3661.83,It -- it is the intrusion on the right to exclude the property interest created by the common law.
2015.13-1339,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3666.155,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
