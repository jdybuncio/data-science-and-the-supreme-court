1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,0.0,20.655,This case involves no issue of fact -- fraction but only a naked question of constitutional law.
1959.54,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,218.525,223.059,That was between 1953 and 1956 that he qualified for the benefits?
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,223.059,234.264,"Well, he actually qualified as of November of 1955 and the first -- it was the -- the order came in 1956 just before he was deported."
1959.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,243.13,247.144,"How long had he been a member of the system, Mr. Smith?"
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,247.144,256.642,"He -- he has started an employment which was subject to social security in about 1936, I believe, it was early."
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,333.256,336.538,Where was the statute dealing with cutting off?
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,336.538,350.372,"That is Section 10 to -- Section (n), it's -- appears at page 9 -- 91 of our brief."
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,350.372,351.805,Thank you very much.
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,351.805,359.081,202 in -- of the Act.
1959.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,359.081,367.941,Was it illegal for him to be a member of the party during the years he was a member?
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,367.941,375.188,"Well, I don't -- we don't know the number -- the years that he actually was a member but presumably not."
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,415.256,417.781,May -- may I trouble with one more thing.
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,420.088,421.764,That is right.
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,421.764,424.092,Was that in the original enactment?
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,424.092,426.865,"No, this was enacted in 1954."
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,427.92,429.823,Amendment to the Act.
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,435.726,436.573,That is right.
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,436.573,441.405,"Well, this is subsequent to the beginning of his earned social security."
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,441.405,441.92,That is right.
1959.54,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,456.221,462.536,"And -- and this, I think (Inaudible)"
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,462.536,464.126,"Yes, that is right."
1959.54,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,464.126,467.654,And came into the law after (Inaudible)
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,467.654,472.496,After the proceedings were instituted but before there was any finality to any order of deportation.
1959.54,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,472.996,476.597,Does the statute provide for any refunds to him of what he's paid in?
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,476.597,485.467,"No, there is no refund given and -- in -- in this connection."
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,525.499,527.906,Where is that in the brief?
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,527.906,536.591,That's at page 92 and 93 of my brief that begins with the paragraph numbered 4 at the very bottom of page 92.
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,681.345,685.758,"When you say taxing the labor force, individuals are taxed."
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,685.758,686.537,That's right.
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,686.537,690.839,"And I suppose for each individual, there's a separate fiscal account."
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,693.848,693.975,There --
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,693.975,702.119,"To their general -- to their general fund that these -- the amounts collected both from an employer and employee go into a general fund, do they?"
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,702.119,710.181,"Well, not -- not -- there -- there is a trust fund that covers the whole Social Security System but there is no fund for an individual."
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,710.197,710.644,"No, no, no."
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,712.709,716.755,But there's no record even of the taxes as far as the individual is concerned.
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,728.022,728.295,No.
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,735.024,736.739,They'll attempt to collect them from him.
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,736.739,737.412,Pardon?
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,737.412,738.993,They -- they will attempt to collect them.
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,738.993,739.062,He --
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,739.062,742.074,"Actually, his employer withholds them as -- as you know in the employer."
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,742.074,747.554,"It isn't that his insurance that is the Social Security benefit fees, do they?"
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,749.275,755.288,"No, they -- no, but on the other hand, if they do not collect them for some reason, if he resist the payment of them --"
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,755.288,755.612,Yes.
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,755.612,757.649,"-- and -- and for some reason, they are never --"
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,757.649,758.1,Or overlooked.
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,758.1,758.86,-- collected.
1959.54,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,764.74,766.769,Does he lose his job?
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,766.769,766.814,No.
1959.54,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,766.814,768.736,If he doesn't pay in.
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,768.736,771.292,It has no relationship to his -- to his job.
1959.54,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,771.292,776.845,This particular payment has nothing to do with his job security.
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,776.845,777.157,No.
1959.54,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,786.048,787.03,Yes.
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,787.03,795.915,And so the -- there's no reason -- there's no federal impact on his job whether he pays or doesn't pay.
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,796.692,806.496,"As a matter of fact, a good many of the employees' taxes are paid by the employer, as we know very widely."
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,806.825,807.059,Certainly in the --
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,807.059,808.131,-- in certain classes of -- of --
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,808.131,809.174,"-- in the domestic field, it must be -- be --"
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,809.174,810.406,-- the domestic belongs entirely.
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,810.406,813.028,It belongs entirely.
1959.54,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,813.967,816.093,Does the Government make any contributions there?
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,816.093,822.823,"No, the entire system is financed through the taxes on the employer and the employees."
1959.54,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,835.75,841.03,Do you think it makes a constitutional distinction that they call these payments taxes instead of something else?
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,841.03,848.022,"No, I don't think that they -- the fact they call them taxes or put them in the tax law is the determinative factor."
1959.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,862.323,864.789,"Well, doesn't the Act call it insurance?"
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,864.789,866.529,The Act does call it insurance.
1959.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,866.529,874.346,"Well, why -- why then do we have to take the -- the tax definition of it rather than insurance?"
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,874.346,881.368,"Well, because this does not have the features which you generally have within insurance -- insurance policy."
1959.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,899.179,901.914,"They pay every month, don't they?"
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,901.914,902.553,They -- they --
1959.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,902.553,904.605,Like we do in insurance?
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,904.605,907.638,They pay every month -- they every week if --
1959.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,907.638,907.682,"Yes, to whom?"
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,907.682,911.685,-- they were told -- they were told whatever pay -- whatever pay there is.
1959.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,911.685,913.514,And they get a benefit --
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,913.514,913.554,They --
1959.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,913.554,916.019,"-- for having paid it, whatever it might be."
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,916.019,916.571,That's right.
1959.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,926.827,934.086,You mean they get benefits in the same sense here that they do from paying their income tax?
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,934.086,948.201,"In -- in -- basically yes, they -- I don't mean that the income tax finances the Social Security System, but citizens of the United States get certain benefits and -- and rights from the Federal Government."
1959.54,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,966.324,971.404,"Mr. Davis, what is the statutory characterization of these benefits?"
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,981.133,981.388,That is right.
1959.54,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,981.388,982.673,-- statutory characterization?
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,982.673,983.423,That is right.
1959.54,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,983.423,986.093,"Then it's not called insurance, is it or isn't it?"
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,986.093,987.557,"Well, it is -- it is."
1959.54,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,987.975,989.815,(Voice Overlap) want compensation insurance?
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,989.815,990.278,No.
1959.54,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1029.997,1037.44,Is this a -- a truly contributory system in the sense that what you get depends on dollars paid?
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1037.44,1037.699,No.
1959.54,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1068.0,1071.425,"Well, what's the $22 billions in the trust fund for?"
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1071.425,1072.563,What's it for?
1959.54,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1080.651,1086.138,"Well, I thought you just said that the current take takes care of the current outlets."
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1086.138,1091.539,"Well, I -- this is -- this has been built up through the years and it is used."
1959.54,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1097.887,1098.352,"Well, then --"
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1098.352,1099.034,-- dropped down.
1959.54,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1099.179,1100.259,-- then the income falls (Voice Overlap) --
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1100.259,1105.998,-- you get the income from that and you get an appropriation by Congress and the two were used for the payment of the -- of the current --
1959.54,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1105.998,1120.391,But the current payments that is collected with the taxes or what they are from employees and current collection rather and employers do not aggregate enough to pay the benefits currently --
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1120.391,1121.206,That's right.
1959.54,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1150.477,1158.253,"And the demands for benefit, as I -- I gather, it's calculated in time, will exceed the tax payments by such --"
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1158.253,1158.276,"Well, it --"
1959.54,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1158.276,1162.014,"-- amount that there have to be drawings on the so-called trust fund, is that it?"
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1162.014,1162.577,That's right.
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1183.687,1187.572,"Well, now, further word about the financing of it."
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1214.267,1214.451,"Yes, they --"
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1214.451,1216.804,-- to direct appropriations by commerce?
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1216.804,1219.508,"Well, they dig into this fund, the -- the interest from the fund --"
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1219.508,1219.993,But -- but that fund --
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1219.993,1221.144,-- and then in to the fund.
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1221.144,1221.279,But that --
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1221.279,1222.407,They used up the fund --
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1222.407,1224.156,But the fund came from the --
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1224.156,1224.174,That's right.
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1224.174,1225.617,-- practical resources.
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1239.798,1240.913,I imagine they would.
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1242.019,1242.07,"No, no, no."
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1242.07,1243.292,There would be no money that --
1959.54,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1243.292,1247.327,"I know but the scheme, the scheme required appropriations by Congress?"
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1247.327,1250.624,The annual appropriations by Congress is -- that is right.
1959.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1256.81,1260.33,"Mr. Davis, don't you have some pretty strong language to get over it?"
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1298.354,1300.034,That is this insurance --
1959.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1300.034,1300.846,I beg your pardon?
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1300.846,1304.886,That is as the term “insurance” repeatedly and insured repeatedly.
1959.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1304.886,1305.56,Yes.
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1305.56,1305.793,That's (Voice Overlap) --
1959.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1305.793,1307.842,"Now, you -- you wipe that all out."
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1307.842,1316.243,"Well, the -- the actual legal incidence of this are not the same as we think of as insurance."
1959.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1342.643,1350.433,You mean by that (Inaudible) you mean by that -- that we can forget about whether it's insurance or a tax.
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1350.433,1365.909,"Well -- well, what I -- I -- that -- I had originally stated it in terms of tax against insurance but I think that the only reason that that is important is because insurance is generally thought of as a contractual right."
1959.54,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1373.557,1398.959,I just want to ask you this just -- I don't want to interrupt you but are you -- is your defense based wholly on the idea that the Government has a right to cancel for the reasons that exist in this case or that the Government's right to amend gives it the right to repeal the whole law and abolish the point if it so desire?
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1398.959,1407.481,"Well, up -- up to the present time, I was attacking -- I was approaching the general proposition they have a right to abandon the whole -- the whole scheme."
1959.54,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1410.794,1411.692,Or to do a way with it.
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1411.692,1412.786,Or to do a way with it.
1959.54,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1412.893,1413.751,That's what I thought.
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1413.751,1427.831,"-- and now, when -- eventually, I shall come to the problem that this particular cutting off is an appropriate exercise of that power to -- to change and that's a different question."
1959.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1432.573,1439.64,Have they ever cut off any particular group before this?
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1439.64,1441.507,Not before this.
1959.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1481.776,1482.048,Three.
1959.54,0,30073,john_f_davis,,1482.986,1483.35,Those are the --
1959.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1483.35,1484.138,-- sections.
