1988.87-1318,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.433,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-1318, Volt Information Sciences v. The Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University."
1988.87-1318,0,30950,james_e_harrington,,52.245,57.68,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1318,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,299.1,311.5,"But that... I don't see how that gets away from the, the idea this is basically a question of fact, what the parties meant as manifested by, by the use of the phrase you, you just said."
1988.87-1318,0,30950,james_e_harrington,,311.5,335.115,"Well, it might have been a question of fact, Mr. Chief Justice, if... if there had been any evidence in the record concerning the parties' intent, but I know it's well-settled in California and presumably in the federal courts as well that where there is no extrinsic evidence bearing upon the meaning of the words in a contract, then the meaning of the contract is a question of law that the appellate court has jurisdiction to review de novo."
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,1733.585,1738.833,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1318,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1801.292,1804.822,Has this situation arisen before that brought this statute into being?
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,1804.822,1805.805,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-1318,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1834.701,1846.665,"Well, if somehow you were subject to the federal Act... to the Federal Arbitration Act, you... you would not have had the option that the California Code of Civil Procedure gives you I take it, or would you?"
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,1846.665,1854.614,"Well, for openers the answer is that we agree that California law was to govern here."
1988.87-1318,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1860.753,1863.001,"If the agreement had not had a place provision in it, and--"
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,1863.001,1865.86,--Had the agreement not spoken to California law--
1988.87-1318,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1865.86,1871.983,"--and Volt had gone to a federal court, I assume you would have been forced to arbitrate."
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,1871.983,1884.65,"--Had Volt... had there been no agreement, had the agreement not met what the court found it to have meant, and had we been in a federal court, the answer to your question is yes."
1988.87-1318,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1902.658,1914.498,"On, on that point, if in this case under this contract, say it were just Volt and Stanford, just two parties involved, you had gone to arbitration--"
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,1914.498,1915.311,Yes.
1988.87-1318,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1915.311,1915.92,--under this contract--
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,1915.92,1916.871,Yes.
1988.87-1318,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1916.871,1924.557,--could the prevailing party have gone to federal court to seek enforcement of the award under the Federal Arbitration Act?
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,1924.557,1928.475,"Had we gone to arbitration, just the two of us?"
1988.87-1318,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1928.475,1930.741,"Yes, and then you seek to enforce the award."
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,1932.099,1935.972,Do we by this hypothesis have the agreement that we had?
1988.87-1318,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1935.972,1939.3,"Yes, and you have the finding that you have by the state court."
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,1939.3,1952.481,"Well, we believe that the thrust of what the parties said here... that is, that California law was to obtain... would cause them rightly to go into the state court to have the award enforced."
1988.87-1318,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1963.93,1971.146,"So, you don't read the opinion as making the Federal Arbitration Act completely irrelevant to this contract?"
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,1971.146,1973.067,--No.
1988.87-1318,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1995.465,1999.384,In your view that would not encompass enforcement?
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,1999.384,2003.57,"--It may well, and it is our view that it does."
1988.87-1318,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2117.869,2119.838,"May I ask a question, kind of a preliminary question?"
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,2132.409,2135.83,There was no extrinsic evidence offered.
1988.87-1318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2382.501,2383.814,xxx.
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,2396.137,2397.042,That's true.
1988.87-1318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2397.042,2398.073,--and not the federal government--
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,2398.073,2398.48,That's true.
1988.87-1318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2398.48,2399.105,--or anything else.
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,2399.105,2399.73,That is true.
1988.87-1318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2399.73,2412.585,"Now, why... why isn't that the end of the case because surely California should be able to interpret the word ""place"" as... and construe that contract?"
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,2412.585,2414.568,"Why, we think that's absolutely right, Your Honor."
1988.87-1318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2467.205,2483.134,"Of course, there remains a federal question, does... although you say it's one that admits of a very easy answer... whether that sort of an agreement in a contract can prevent the... can result in the operation of California arbitration law as opposed to federal arbitration law."
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,2483.134,2484.806,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1988.87-1318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2513.764,2518.918,"Well, I suppose there either has to be an arbitration clause in the contract or you don't have to arbitrate."
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,2518.918,2519.637,That is true.
1988.87-1318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2519.637,2522.573,And there was an arbitration clause in this contract.
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,2522.573,2523.292,That is correct.
1988.87-1318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2523.292,2533.099,"What if it just happened to turn out, although the lawyers should have been pretty dumb if... what if it turned out that California had a law against any arbitration at all?"
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,2533.099,2534.599,Well--
1988.87-1318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2534.599,2537.754,And then... but there was still a... a provision for arbitration.
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,2537.754,2543.736,"--Are we assuming in this hypothetical, Your Honor, that there is an agreement?"
1988.87-1318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2543.736,2550.389,There's this... they say that the... this contract shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the law of the place where it's made.
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,2550.389,2550.78,Yes.
1988.87-1318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2550.78,2553.014,"And then they have an arbitration clause, too."
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,2553.014,2553.779,Okay.
1988.87-1318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2553.779,2556.857,And it turns out that California doesn't allow any arbitration.
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,2556.857,2560.949,And the question is whether the agreement would still mean what we say it meant?
1988.87-1318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2560.949,2564.807,"Well, the question is must you arbitrate?"
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,2564.807,2583.876,"Well, the answer is that if the parties meant to incorporate that provision of California law that said there shall be no arbitration... that's what they meant... then that's what should happen because a court cannot enforce the parties to do something they have not agreed to do."
1988.87-1318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2583.876,2584.908,"Well, but they've agreed to arbitrate."
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,2584.908,2607.68,"So, if the court in construing the clause has in mind the illogic of what Your Honor is pointing to and decides as a matter of fact that these parties really could not have intended that in the setting that Your Honor puts, then the court comes to the judgment that's not what the choice-of-law clause means here."
1988.87-1318,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2712.231,2729.646,"We, we can and do reach questions of state contract interpretation and reexamine them here if they're a bar to the assertion of a federal right such as the right not to have your contracts impaired."
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,2729.646,2730.365,Yes.
1988.87-1318,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2730.365,2731.802,Indiana v. Brand.
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,2750.202,2784.953,"Well, I think that Volt could make the argument, if they made it, that the state court's interpretation of the state law question was, for want of a better word, kind of wild, so unfounded in the words of the Demorest and Enterprise Irrigation cases, so certainly unfounded that what the court did may properly be regarded as essentially arbitrary or a mere device, you know, kind of a way to evade, manipulate around the application of a federal right."
1988.87-1318,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2947.247,2956.947,I suppose we could adopt a theory that whether in a particular contract parties have contracted out of federal law--
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,2956.947,2957.962,Yes.
1988.87-1318,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2957.962,2962.477,--which would otherwise be applicable is itself a question of federal law.
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,2965.523,2966.179,Neither do they.
1988.87-1318,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2966.179,2966.866,--it's thinkable.
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,2966.866,2968.256,Neither do they.
1988.87-1318,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3007.788,3020.721,"Well, let's say... let's say the issue in a state case is whether... state criminal cases... whether the defendant waived a particular federal constitutional right that is waivable."
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,3039.745,3063.5,"Well, I think that the... that the applicable rule would be... if you were worrying about whether somebody lost a federal right because he had messed up in respect to a state procedural rule, I think the applicable rule would be is that state procedural rule a sound rule that's generally followed or is it a mechanism to kind of take away a federal right."
1988.87-1318,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3063.5,3064.297,I'm talking about a state procedural rule.
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,3070.233,3071.202,"Oh, I see what you're saying."
1988.87-1318,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3071.202,3071.686,Something like that.
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,3071.686,3072.684,Okay.
1988.87-1318,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3072.684,3074.918,What was the meaning of that statement?
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,3088.382,3088.914,"Well,--"
1988.87-1318,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3088.914,3091.585,"But since it affects federal rights, we say it's a federal question."
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,3091.585,3098.533,"--I think it is quite a different thing to say that it's a federal question as to whether a confession, for example, is coerced."
1988.87-1318,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3129.35,3130.787,It isn't just a matter of choosing.
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,3151.871,3171.739,"Well, it's thinkable in the sense that I can certainly entertain the thought, and we have as we talk with one another, but unthinkable in... in this sense, that you are still dealing with a state law contract between local parties using local words in a local setting."
1988.87-1318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3302.625,3313.246,"xxx as a forum selection clause and... but with an arbitration clause, the state courts must provide for arbitration."
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,3313.246,3316.636,"That is a true statement, but the--"
1988.87-1318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3316.636,3317.167,"Right, right."
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,3325.181,3329.428,--Under the procedural remedies that they make available in general.
1988.87-1318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3329.428,3330.006,"Right, right."
1988.87-1318,1,20977,david_m_heilbron,,3330.006,3330.959,Absolutely right.
1988.87-1318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3424.547,3426.452,"Thank you, Mr. Heilbron."
1988.87-1318,2,30950,james_e_harrington,,3428.155,3431.373,A one-sentence response to the last point.
1988.87-1318,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3502.844,3505.139,"Your time has expired, Mr. Harrington."
