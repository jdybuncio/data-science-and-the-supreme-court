1957.547,0,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,15.608,29.882,"Chief Justice Warren, Honorable Justices of this Court, may it please the Court."
1957.547,1,23915,freeman_h_forrest,,1222.227,1232.586,"Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please the Court."
1957.547,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1426.624,1429.776,"Isn't it before he was taken into custody, Mr. Forrest?"
1957.547,1,23915,freeman_h_forrest,,1429.776,1430.183,"No, sir."
1957.547,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1433.096,1433.134,Yes.
1957.547,1,23915,freeman_h_forrest,,1433.134,1435.008,The first few days after he was taken into custody.
1957.547,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1435.008,1435.417,Yes.
1957.547,1,23915,freeman_h_forrest,,1435.417,1447.852,I am sorry that I do not enjoy the same circumstance as the petitioner for the -- that the petitioner's counsel does and that he tried the case in the lower court and I did not get it until it came to the United States Supreme Court.
1957.547,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1479.676,1484.075,Can you tell me what -- why has he gone to the mental health institute?
1957.547,1,23915,freeman_h_forrest,,1484.075,1488.495,"This is a question I cannot answer, Justice."
1957.547,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1488.495,1490.641,So they're frequently -- it affects the mind.
1957.547,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1490.641,1491.18,Certainly.
1957.547,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1491.18,1495.3,"The disease, they've had it suspected with that theoretically affecting his mind?"
1957.547,1,23915,freeman_h_forrest,,1495.3,1497.054,"Perhaps it may have, Justice Black."
1957.547,2,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,1988.231,1995.248,I'll state that.
1957.547,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1999.827,2001.202,The next year -- the next year?
1957.547,2,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,2001.202,2004.336,"The next year of this confession of the statement, October."
1957.547,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2004.336,2004.593,All right.
1957.547,3,23915,freeman_h_forrest,,2004.593,2011.839,The man was arrested in January and the trial held the next June 6th.
1957.547,3,23915,freeman_h_forrest,,2011.839,2032.763,"Now, since the test as to whether or not this, the confession that was admitted for the evidence violates the petitioner's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment is whether -- is -- involves looking at the pressures that were applied to him with respect to his ability to withstand those pressures."
1957.547,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2082.396,2088.851,Why does he content that he went to the hospital?
1957.547,3,23915,freeman_h_forrest,,2088.851,2092.136,I don't think there's a contention by the -- by the petitioner as to why he went there.
1957.547,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2092.136,2093.909,And you think the statement to which --
1957.547,3,23915,freeman_h_forrest,,2093.909,2098.96,"The State contends that he went there voluntarily, that they offered to take him there."
1957.547,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2098.96,2101.057,"No, taking that for what?"
1957.547,3,23915,freeman_h_forrest,,2101.057,2103.34,For the -- the purposes of --
1957.547,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2103.34,2105.566,The treatment of a venereal disease?
1957.547,3,23915,freeman_h_forrest,,2105.566,2106.522,"Yes, sir."
1957.547,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2106.522,2112.48,And was there another hospital in town where they had doctors who treated venereal diseases?
1957.547,3,23915,freeman_h_forrest,,2112.48,2114.333,"Well, I'm sure that there would be."
1957.547,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2114.333,2118.882,What -- is there any explanation as to why they took him to these particular place (Voice Overlap) --
1957.547,3,23915,freeman_h_forrest,,2118.882,2128.085,"The only -- the only explanation that I can offer to you, Justices, that which appears in the petitioner's brief."
1957.547,4,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,2139.554,2143.434,(Inaudible)
1957.547,5,23915,freeman_h_forrest,,2143.434,2150.265,He alludes to some civil procedure taken prior to trial.
1957.547,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2185.283,2185.882,Is there anything --
1957.547,5,23915,freeman_h_forrest,,2185.882,2187.108,This was not done.
1957.547,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2187.108,2200.173,Is there anything in the record which refused the statement of the petitioner attributed to him by Mr. Corbett who said that he was willing to go to the hospital and helped them all he could.
1957.547,5,23915,freeman_h_forrest,,2215.075,2216.383,"Now, your question?"
1957.547,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2216.383,2224.895,Is there anything in the record which refused that statement made by the defendant to Mr. Corbett.
1957.547,5,23915,freeman_h_forrest,,2238.746,2258.34,"Well, certainly, it does show that whether it shows that he was sent there for other reasons, I don't think so, specially in view of the counsel's statement that the petitioner [Laughs] there to go down there because he would rather sleep on a mattress than on the steel bed that was given to him in the Sioux City, which incidentally the record shows he was given a mattress after a few days."
1957.547,6,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3314.759,3317.482,May it please the Court.
1957.547,6,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3362.202,3363.939,"Well, the next question answered though?"
1957.547,6,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3363.939,3364.785,Yes.
1957.547,6,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3369.624,3371.488,That is what he said to Mr. Corbett.
1957.547,6,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3371.488,3372.247,Yes.
1957.547,6,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3375.299,3377.191,That's -- I understand that --
1957.547,7,23915,freeman_h_forrest,,3377.191,3377.261,Yes.
1957.547,7,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3377.261,3382.82,-- but that's what he says to the president of the bar association.
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3382.82,3384.365,You mean in their interchange by this --
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3384.365,3384.722,Yes.
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3384.722,3385.65,-- he said that.
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3385.65,3386.409,What?
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3386.409,3390.649,You mean he said that in the interchange of conversation between him and Mr. Corbett.
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3390.649,3391.495,Yes.
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3392.274,3393.2,"No, he didn't say that."
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3393.2,3394.557,That's my point.
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3394.557,3395.775,"No, he didn't."
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3401.52,3408.624,"No, but as to why he went and his attitude towards his going to the Cherokee State Mental Hospital."
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3408.624,3409.84,"Well, Mr. Corbett --"
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3409.84,3410.447,(Voice Overlap)
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3410.944,3411.573,Mr. Corbett came --
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3411.573,3414.844,Not this that he wanted to lie in a better bed.
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3414.844,3419.036,"Now, Mr. Corbett came to see him after he's been in custody 29 days."
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3446.066,3447.411,"Now, you've just said something."
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3452.711,3452.968,Yes.
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3452.968,3453.727,-- if anything?
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3453.727,3455.022,That's right.
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3455.03,3464.225,Even then there's a best of reasons for having -- for having taken him to the Cherokee Hospital for mental diseases rather than some city hospital of ordinary general diseases.
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3464.225,3464.782,Yes.
1957.547,8,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3475.51,3477.167,"Is that application in the record, Mr. Tacy?"
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3477.167,3478.532,"No, it is not in the record, sir."
1957.547,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3479.989,3481.446,But it was shown in the record.
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3481.446,3482.115,What is it?
1957.547,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3482.115,3484.54,Of what you've just told us in that record.
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3488.47,3518.126,"I -- I think, sir that that is -- if that is in the record that -- I think it's -- I think the State referred to that in their -- I believe in their -- they say -- they say as soon as Mr. Corbett's interview, he may say he was then taken to the State Mental Hospital."
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3520.901,3523.604,But you -- you've indicated a little while ago that --
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3523.604,3523.911,Well --
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3523.911,3534.741,"-- some procedure that for some presumably good reason, the authorities thought there ought to be some entirely be mistaken his -- into his mental health."
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3536.376,3538.659,"Yes, I believe I did, Your Honor."
1957.547,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3538.659,3543.27,"Well, was that before or after he first went to a mental hospital?"
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3543.27,3555.365,Now that -- the statement I made was when Corbett came to see him after 29 days of detention partly in the hospital and partly in the office of the -- or rather the police station in Sioux City.
1957.547,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3555.365,3561.371,"Now, you mean he made -- he made -- these proceedings started after that?"
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3561.371,3562.646,After Corbett visited.
1957.547,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3562.646,3563.185,Yes.
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3563.185,3563.844,"Yes, sir."
1957.547,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3563.844,3564.662,Corbett visited him --
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3564.662,3564.842,Yes.
1957.547,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3564.842,3565.93,-- 29 days after he was arrested.
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3565.93,3566.267,Yes.
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3571.906,3575.135,"Well, but Corbett didn't go there to do something."
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3576.041,3576.39,To find out.
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3576.39,3578.137,-- not what I've read in the testimony.
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3578.137,3578.734,"Yes, sir."
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3578.734,3584.341,"Evidently some -- if I may so, commendable members of the Sioux City Bar --"
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3584.341,3584.828,"Yes, very much so."
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3584.828,3588.171,"They must present, I assume, there was alot about this in the newspapers."
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3588.171,3588.97,"Yes, sir."
1957.547,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3588.97,3598.015,"And then some members of the Bar talked to their president, Mr. Corbett and said, “Well, this fellow, have we got lawyer for the other lawyer?”"
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3600.937,3601.157,That's right.
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3601.157,3608.071,Not to offer himself as a lawyer he disavowed that completely and you accepted that disavowed.
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3612.048,3613.264,"That is right, sir."
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3613.264,3622.445,"And from all, not only the testimony but you're -- of what you think of Mr. Corbett, makes one attached verity to what he testified."
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3622.445,3626.076,I consider Mr. Corbett a very reputable member of the Bar.
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3642.287,3648.353,May I suggest that he replied to your questions by saying he concluded after talking with Triplett.
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3648.353,3648.99,Yes.
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3648.99,3653.589,On Triplett's statement that his rights were not being interfered with.
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3653.589,3655.204,He wasn't being held against his will.
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3656.42,3658.374,"I mean, did you ask him that question?"
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3658.374,3659.003,"Yes, sir."
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3659.36,3661.945,And he has very clearly answered.
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3667.697,3668.493,Yes.
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3668.493,3670.33,But he did not think that he's right.
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3675.867,3676.444,"Oh, no."
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3676.444,3681.043,-- because I tried to open that it is the rights of the Board that were being violated and paid no attention to it.
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3681.043,3681.36,"No, I don't think that."
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3681.36,3683.287,Isn't that what it seems to be the testimony.
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3683.287,3684.582,I don't -- I don't think that.
1957.547,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3686.259,3687.327,"Now, may I ask."
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3687.327,3687.455,Yes.
1957.547,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3687.455,3691.784,"Well, let me get the sequence in mind if I -- if I can?"
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3698.546,3699.911,He was in a jail cell.
1957.547,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3699.911,3701.608,He was in his jail cell.
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3705.119,3709.219,He had been there on the 15th of September and stayed a little while.
1957.547,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3713.449,3713.796,Yes.
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3713.796,3714.235,-- bed.
1957.547,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3714.235,3714.615,Yes.
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3714.615,3719.633,"And then when Mr. Corbett interviewed him, it was 15 days later."
1957.547,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3721.118,3721.687,Yes.
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3721.687,3739.32,"Then immediately, he was taken to the state hospital again to put through the screening center and to be examined, and then the fourth day now, after Mr. Corbett interviewed him, they had that confession out of him down there on the 6th of October."
1957.547,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3739.32,3740.049,All right.
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3756.872,3758.055,Right after Corbett visited.
1957.547,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3758.055,3759.48,Right after Corbett visited.
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3759.48,3761.227,The State's brief -- the State's --
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3761.227,3763.58,"Now, isn't any of these in the record, Mr. Tacey?"
1957.547,8,43389,thomas_o_tacy,,3763.58,3765.946,"Yes, it is in the record, sir."
1957.547,8,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3766.054,3768.457,I mean in the stenographic minutes?
