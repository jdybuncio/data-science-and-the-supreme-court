1987.86-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.106,"We will hear argument now on No. 86-740, Omni Capital International v. Rudolf Wolff & Company."
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,12.886,15.995,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1987.86-740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,176.976,183.364,Do you think Rule 4(e) ever applies to a purely Federal question case?
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,183.364,186.988,"Justice White, Rule 4(e) applies--"
1987.86-740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,186.988,189.644,Or it just doesn't apply when there is a foreigner involved?
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,189.644,201.169,"--Well, Rule 4(e) applies for the purpose of the physical means of effecting service of process, not the amenability of the individual to the court's law."
1987.86-740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,201.169,213.275,"So, in a purely Federal question case, Rule 4(e) wouldn't apply at all if the question is the amenability of the defendant to service?"
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,213.275,213.634,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,248.698,258.382,"Well, what if the state didn't have a long arm statute at all and there is just a purely Federal question case pending in a Federal Court?"
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,258.382,259.023,"--Yes, sir."
1987.86-740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,259.023,261.786,Can you serve at all?
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,261.786,272.016,I think that if the state does not have a long arm statute then what you are faced with is whether or not it comports with the due process clause.
1987.86-740,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,306.861,322.152,"Well, Mr. Kutcher, I think most decisions in this area have taken the position that Federal courts have only as much subject matter and personal jurisdiction as Congress gives them by affirmative grant."
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,322.152,322.668,"Yes, ma'am."
1987.86-740,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,322.668,331.508,"And under your theory, there would not be an affirmative grant of jurisdiction then."
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,331.508,334.225,"Justice O'Connor, a personal jurisdiction."
1987.86-740,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,334.225,334.522,Yes.
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,334.522,335.882,You are correct.
1987.86-740,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,357.918,362.089,"Well, I suppose the weight of authority might be against you on this point; wouldn't it?"
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,362.089,362.698,"--Yes, ma'am."
1987.86-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,366.338,372.632,"Well, it is very difficult to say that the Fifth Amendment is a source of authority to serve process."
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,375.475,376.302,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,376.302,379.425,"So, why do you say the Fifth Amendment is a source of authority?"
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,379.425,387.47,Our argument is that the Fifth Amendment requires that there be due process in bringing someone into a court.
1987.86-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,388.187,388.937,But it's not.
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,393.092,393.779,"--Yes, sir."
1987.86-740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,427.86,436.7,If a state doesn't have a long arm statute it means that its courts... you may never bring in a non-resident into its courts.
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,441.932,456.332,"Well, that relates to the question of whether or not... the distinction that I'm making, Justice White, is the distinction between the amenability to jurisdiction and the physical means of service of process."
1987.86-740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,459.049,464.907,"I know, but the state says that... the state law is that you just may not serve this person at all."
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,475.091,486.602,--Because this is a Federal question case and the authorities and the authority under which a Federal court is acting in a Federal question case stems from the Commodities Exchange Act and not from state action.
1987.86-740,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,527.632,540.08,"Mr. Kutcher, there are some Federal statutes in which Congress has expressly adopted a provision such as you would have us apply here without an express provision."
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,540.08,540.314,"Yes, ma'am."
1987.86-740,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,540.314,549.467,"So, I guess, under your view, all those affirmative grants of jurisdiction on a national basis by Congress are superfluous."
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,550.637,551.825,"Well, I think that--"
1987.86-740,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,551.825,552.731,Isn't that right?
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,552.731,558.401,"--Insofar as a claim against foreign nationals is concerned, I think that the standard is--"
1987.86-740,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,558.401,562.524,"Well, you think that that action by Congress is just not necessary."
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,563.555,570.224,--Insofar as claims against foreign nationals are concerned because the source of the authority comes from the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.
1987.86-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,570.224,573.863,There you go again and say the source of the authority comes.
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,573.863,574.41,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,574.41,576.314,The source of the authority has to come from somewhere else.
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,578.142,586.374,"Well, I think it comes from whether or not it meets the traditional notions of fair play and justice that this Court has adopted over the past 50 years."
1987.86-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,586.374,595.371,Are you saying then that we can presume that Congress wished to reach out in every Federal question cause of action to the limits of the due process clause?
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,595.371,599.008,"I don't think you have to make that presumption, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1987.86-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,610.129,610.816,Of course.
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,639.493,669.808,"I think that under, I think that under 4(e) as was argued by Judge Wisdom in the dissent in the Fifth Circuit that Congress in a case... in the case of this nature involving what has been in the legislative history deemed to be something of significant importance to the enforcement of commodities actions would permit the extension of a nationwide service of process."
1987.86-740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,718.602,728.69,"Rule 4(e) says that whenever a statute of the United States or an order of the Court provides for service of summons, then you will serve the summons that way."
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,737.016,740.654,I think it refers to local rules or to rules which the courts--
1987.86-740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,740.654,753.556,"You mean a Federal Court in a Federal question case could, where a statute does not provide for a service, just enter an order in that particular case providing for serving of process?"
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,753.556,761.207,--To effect the physical means of notifying a defendant of the pendency of an action in a jurisdiction.
1987.86-740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,764.317,764.598,"Well, what about amenability?"
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,764.598,771.876,"On amenability, it comes down to the standard of whether or not you meet the traditional notions of fair play and justice."
1987.86-740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,771.876,779.014,"Well, could an order, could just... I just don't know why the rule has a reference to an order of the Court."
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,779.014,795.461,"Well, it seems... my interpretation of that, Your Honor, is that it authorizes and incorporates Rule 83 where the Court has the authority to enter rules as long as they are not inconsistent with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure."
1987.86-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,797.46,807.253,"Well, it could be, too, couldn't it to authorize substitute service, substitute service of process where one method has been tried and the person can't be found at the address?"
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,808.439,808.939,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,811.922,812.562,Mr. Kutcher?
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,812.562,812.828,Yes.
1987.86-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,812.828,832.525,"If the Congress is not using the manner of service as a shorthand for prescribing what the reach of personal jurisdiction is, then why is it that when the manner of service is improper, the suit is dismissed for want of jurisdiction?"
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,835.615,838.49,The suit is dismissed for insufficiency of service of process.
1987.86-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,840.568,842.316,--That is not a jurisdictional defect?
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,842.316,846.143,"--It is not a personal jurisdictional defect, no, sir."
1987.86-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,851.438,855.28,"Well, what other kinds of jurisdictions are there other than jurisdiction over the person and the subject matter?"
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,855.28,856.326,--That's it.
1987.86-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,859.014,864.714,"So, you are saying that all these dismissals because of improper service really are not jurisdictional--"
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,864.714,866.838,--They are not necessarily.
1987.86-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,902.777,912.991,"--What if you have an improper service of process and the point is not noted by the defendant, the case goes on to judgment and that judgment is then sued on somewhere else."
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,912.991,914.522,That's waived.
1987.86-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,933.827,934.906,The individual never appears.
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,934.906,942.011,"--And if you've got good service and the individual never appears and the default is taken, I don't think you can collaterally--"
1987.86-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,942.011,943.073,Improper service.
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,947.165,955.116,"--As I appreciate it, you would have to come back and argue the same way you would in any other default."
1987.86-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,961.286,962.925,"There is jurisdiction over the person, then, right?"
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,962.925,964.128,I think so.
1987.86-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,967.017,968.126,How do you waive it by not appearing?
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,968.126,973.608,"--Well, the same way that you would if you don't assert it, you waive it."
1987.86-740,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,977.606,978.762,"Well, that is a rather extreme position."
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,981.136,984.62,"--Well, then he has got the same remedies available to him--"
1987.86-740,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,984.62,987.009,"Well, he has some remedy other than 12(b)?"
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,987.009,987.602,"--Yes, sir."
1987.86-740,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,987.602,990.43,"Well, what is the difference if you have never heard of it and you are improperly served?"
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,994.382,1009.578,I think an improper service is waived if... I think an improper service such as would be dismissable under Rule 12(b) would be waived in any instance that any other 12(b) motion would be waived.
1987.86-740,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1009.578,1012.264,Even if he never even heard of the fact that a lawsuit had been brought against him?
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,1012.264,1013.874,"Well, if he never heard of it--"
1987.86-740,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1013.874,1014.749,How could he waive?
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,1014.749,1020.058,"--then I assume, then I would assume that when they went to try to collect on the judgment he would have remedies available to him."
1987.86-740,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1020.058,1025.229,"Well, he hears about it when they collect on the judgment, but the time to file a 12(b) motion is long gone."
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,1025.229,1033.741,"I think that is something that is addressed, frankly, to the discretion of the trial court as to whether or not there was... whether he should have known about it or not."
1987.86-740,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1034.741,1037.568,Do you have any cases for this rather novel approach?
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,1037.568,1044.941,"--No, sir, because I didn't plan on getting on the question of whether or not a default was taken."
1987.86-740,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1093.656,1102.697,"Well, you mentioned earlier, I think, that a source of authority to fashion the service of process rule is 83."
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,1102.697,1103.166,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-740,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1103.166,1105.025,Which deals with local rules; doesn't it?
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,1105.025,1107.868,As I understand it it deals with--
1987.86-740,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1107.868,1108.134,Beyond that?
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,1108.134,1109.524,"--Yes, sir."
1987.86-740,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1130.968,1140.947,"But if it is on alien defendants lack minimum contacts with the states, it nevertheless has to be sufficient national contacts?"
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,1140.947,1142.041,"--Oh, absolutely."
1987.86-740,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1142.041,1144.822,To be amenable jurisdiction under the Fifth Amendment.
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,1144.822,1145.368,Absolutely.
1987.86-740,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1145.368,1149.289,"So, to that extent, your submission is not as broad as I thought you were referring--"
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,1149.289,1149.819,"Oh, no."
1987.86-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1172.983,1175.435,"--Let me ask you one question, Mr. Kutcher."
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,1175.435,1175.622,--Yes.
1987.86-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1175.622,1186.367,"To the extent that you rely on Rule 83, does that mean that the District Court in New Orleans can have a rule saying: We want to go to the full extent of the Fifth Amendment in these cases."
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,1196.176,1200.205,I think the authority is such that--
1987.86-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1200.205,1201.064,"Well, what authority?"
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,1201.064,1223.181,"--I think that the argument that we are asserting, Chief Justice, is that under the... that the Federal Rules should not substantively effect the rights of a plaintiff to maintain an action against a foreign national."
1987.86-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1234.083,1236.472,"Well, now, are you going to get back to my question about Rule 83?"
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,1236.472,1244.203,"Well, I think that 83 just permits you to fashion... no, I don't think that you can have 93 different rules."
1987.86-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1244.203,1247.687,"So, how do you determine which rule is right in the various districts?"
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,1247.687,1250.529,I think as long as the rule is in compliance--
1987.86-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1250.529,1251.857,In compliance with what?
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,1251.857,1254.872,--With the limits of what is permitted under the Fifth Amendment.
1987.86-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1254.872,1261.182,"Well, then you say that every district has to promulgate a rule that goes as far as the Fifth Amendment permitted."
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,1261.182,1265.351,"Well, every district has, I think... I think the Federal Courts have that authority."
1987.86-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1265.351,1273.004,"What if one particularly, the Chief Judge up in Shreveport says: I may have that authority, but I just don't choose to exercise it."
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,1275.409,1285.235,"Chief Justice, I think that under those circumstances that there would be some sort of appellate review."
1987.86-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1300.509,1302.228,"It is not what they can do, it is what they choose to do."
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,1329.622,1343.336,"--In thinking about it, I think, as Mr. Lee did this morning, I think that I have got to change my response and say that as long as it is constitutional a District Court judge can do anything which is permitted under the Fifth Amendment--"
1987.86-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1343.336,1344.647,"So, you can have 93 different rules."
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,1344.647,1346.334,"--Theoretically, you can have 93 different rules."
1987.86-740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1418.227,1430.44,You say that 4(e) just deals with the manner of service of process and never in any action doesn't go to amenability of service outside the state.
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,1430.44,1431.518,"I think that, yes, sir."
1987.86-740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1435.501,1456.665,"And so, I suppose you would say Federal District Court could by rule say that when the suits are against non-residents service of process may be had on those people to the extent the Fifth Amendment will allow."
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,1456.665,1458.508,"--And I think... yes, sir."
1987.86-740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1458.508,1459.586,And provide the method.
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,1459.586,1460.912,And provide the method.
1987.86-740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1463.208,1467.191,And without having to worry about Rule 4(e).
1987.86-740,0,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,1467.191,1468.69,That's exactly right.
1987.86-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1586.628,1588.237,"Thank you, Mr. Kutcher."
1987.86-740,1,22955,elliot_paskoff,,1590.22,1593.78,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1649.883,1655.021,"Mr. Paskoff, before you get into your legal argument, could you help me on one factual matter?"
1987.86-740,1,22955,elliot_paskoff,,1655.021,1655.412,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1655.412,1659.426,Your opponent indicated at the end of his argument something I hadn't really quite understood.
1987.86-740,1,22955,elliot_paskoff,,1678.59,1689.367,"Your Honor, what has happened is in the original Point Landing litigation, one of my clients, Rudolf Wolff & Co., Ltd."
1987.86-740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1734.647,1735.833,--You had it in Section 27.
1987.86-740,1,22955,elliot_paskoff,,1735.833,1737.88,"--Yes, but then you had the next step."
1987.86-740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1748.281,1749.796,Whether your contacts with the whole country were adequate.
1987.86-740,1,22955,elliot_paskoff,,1749.796,1750.671,Exactly.
1987.86-740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1753.184,1754.497,And that motion was never decided.
1987.86-740,1,22955,elliot_paskoff,,1755.091,1767.147,"--Your Honor, that motion... that motion was decided... the motion was decided and that was Point Landing 1."
1987.86-740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1772.693,1775.911,"So, then your client was before the court."
1987.86-740,1,22955,elliot_paskoff,,1775.911,1776.285,Yes.
1987.86-740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1800.634,1805.663,"But if you had lost on that argument, your client would have been before the court?"
1987.86-740,1,22955,elliot_paskoff,,1805.663,1809.099,"If I had lost under that argument, we would have been before the court."
1987.86-740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1809.536,1812.207,"And, of course, if the District Court was right on the contacts rule."
1987.86-740,1,22955,elliot_paskoff,,1812.207,1812.77,That is correct.
1987.86-740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1815.722,1828.421,"What if the District judge had deferred ruling on your pre-emption argument or the, you know, that there's no Securities Act claim here, until the end of the Plaintiffs' case, something like that."
1987.86-740,1,22955,elliot_paskoff,,1841.072,1842.32,"--I believe so, Your Honor."
1987.86-740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1842.32,1845.898,After the case is half tried?
1987.86-740,1,22955,elliot_paskoff,,1845.898,1870.699,"Because if the Commodities Exchange Act has preempted the regulation of commodities futures trading, then Section 27 does not apply because the commodity... because the Securities Exchange Act is not applicable to determining the duties and liabilities involved with trading of commodity futures."
1987.86-740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1870.699,1891.659,"What if instead of the preempt, the argument that the Commodities Act superceded the other, you had simply persuaded the District judge that it didn't state a cause of action under the Securities Act and, yet, you were properly before... if you were before the court on the Securities Act, I presume they also could have tried the commodities exchange claim at the same time."
1987.86-740,1,22955,elliot_paskoff,,1894.268,1906.076,"Well, I understand what you are saying, Your Honor, except Congressional history has clearly indicated that the Commodity Exchange Act preempts--"
1987.86-740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1906.076,1906.779,"Well, I understand that."
1987.86-740,1,22955,elliot_paskoff,,1917.321,1918.32,--That is correct.
1987.86-740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1918.32,1922.788,"So, you were, for a brief period of time at least, subject to the jurisdiction of the Louisiana court."
1987.86-740,1,22955,elliot_paskoff,,1937.845,1938.718,That's correct.
1987.86-740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2245.128,2250.001,It seems to me that argument would also demonstrate that Congress didn't intend any cause of action to be implied.
1987.86-740,1,22955,elliot_paskoff,,2250.001,2253.718,"Your Honor, not necessarily."
1987.86-740,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2440.892,2444.875,"Thank you, Mr. Paskoff."
1987.86-740,2,39721,robert_a_kutcher,,2447.921,2460.369,"First, I will respond to Justice Stevens' inquiry regarding what happened in the District Court below."
1987.86-740,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2607.263,2609.294,"Thank you, Mr. Kutcher."
