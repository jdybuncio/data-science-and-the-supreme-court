2007.06-11612,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.776,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-11612, Gonzalez v. United States."
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,9.231,23.615,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner was not present at the bench conference and did not have the assistance of an interpreter when the magistrate judge solicited his attorney's consent to conduct jury selection."
2007.06-11612,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,57.272,68.533,"Mr. Newton, you're not claiming in this case that the defendant was any way disadvantaged by the magistrate judge conducting the voir dire, are you?"
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,68.533,75.842,I'm contending that the denial of his right to an Article III judge at felony jury selection violated his rights.
2007.06-11612,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,75.842,83.293,But there was no objection to any of the proceedings by the magistrate judge.
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,90.273,92.352,"Well, I think it was a combination, Your Honor."
2007.06-11612,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,103.987,110.235,"This may not be a pertinent question, but where does the right to voir dire come from in the first place?"
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,110.235,122.807,"--The Court has discussed the right to voir dire in capital cases and in non-capital cases as it relates to the right to a fair trial, the right to an impartial jury--"
2007.06-11612,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,122.807,126.82,So it's derivative from other rights?
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,142.188,162.82,"--Well, Your Honor, I would say that the Court has said that, in a Federal case particularly, you have a right to an Article III, Section 2 right to a jury, as well as a Sixth Amendment right, and the Court has referred to this as an allocation of Federal judicial power in the people as well as in judges."
2007.06-11612,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,180.77,189.246,"Well, where a defendant is waiving a jury trial or pleading guilty, that's something that an ordinary person can probably readily understand."
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,223.297,225.25,"Your Honor, I don't think that's necessarily true."
2007.06-11612,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,253.472,259.672,But there's a big difference between having a judge trial and a jury of one's peers.
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,270.964,274.79,"Well, Your Honor, it's hard to put these rights in terms of relative importance."
2007.06-11612,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,299.174,300.266,"Well, we're not talking about a trial."
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,321.974,326.568,"--Well, certain judges in Federal court tend to give the lawyers a lot of leeway."
2007.06-11612,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,336.454,339.343,Whose thumb is the magistrate under?
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,344.654,345.746,Well--
2007.06-11612,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,345.746,350.417,Who decides whether he stays on or she stays on as a magistrate?
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,350.417,353.744,--Article III judges are the ones who select magistrate judges--
2007.06-11612,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,353.744,358.774,So we're really not talking here about giving away any Article III power.
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,365.131,373.581,"--Well, Your Honor, the magistrate judges have been permitted to exercise the attributes of Article III power when they are adjuncts."
2007.06-11612,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,384.406,400.491,"That may well be, but the reason... the reason presumably is that an Article III judge, which goes... who goes through a much more substantial process of selection and confirmation is much more qualified."
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,412.408,414.283,"--Well, I think it's a twofold argument."
2007.06-11612,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,435.384,442.566,Would you go back to I think it was to Justice Ginsburg's question about the comparative significance of the waiver here.
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,496.31,497.483,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-11612,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,561.05,561.708,"Well, I see what you're doing."
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,585.839,591.103,"--Well, Your Honor, if I can answer your question, but also the third characteristic."
2007.06-11612,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,623.477,646.296,"Well, I was interested in your comment on trying cases, but to say that you have to sit down and explain to the... to the defendant the difference between the magistrate and an Article III and why you like this particular magistrate... it's the attorney that does all the questioning, after all... it seems to me is... is a burden."
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,650.235,656.061,"--Well, Your Honor, Congress has made the judgment that this is such a fundamental right that it must be personally waived by a defendant."
2007.06-11612,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,656.061,661.84,"In practice, it's more a tactical decision than a theoretical one."
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,684.219,687.795,"Your Honor, the very same thing could be said of waiving a jury or a grand jury."
2007.06-11612,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,687.795,696.885,"Well, if you get to that point, which case of ours holds that the right to a jury trial is a personal right that the defendant must waive rather than waive through counsel?"
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,696.885,711.427,"Two cases Your Honor: Patton v. United States, 1932, and Adams ex rel. U.S. v. McCann, which reaffirmed, and the Court has cited those two cases repeatedly for the proposition that this is a right that must be personally waived."
2007.06-11612,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,713.38,714.908,You say it was the holding in Patton?
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,714.908,718.191,--Patton I suppose would have been--
2007.06-11612,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,718.191,719.377,I suppose it was dicta.
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,719.377,724.828,"--But it became enshrined in Adams, and it has been cited repeatedly for that proposition."
2007.06-11612,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,731.934,745.337,"I thought what Adams stood for was that the defendant can himself waive the right to jury without advice of counsel, that if he wants to do it on his own he can do it without counsel."
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,750.663,760.408,"--Well, Your Honor, it's... the language in Adams which quotes from Patton says it must be the express, intelligent consent of the defendant, which has been widely interpreted as personal--"
2007.06-11612,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,760.408,762.97,But that can be expressed through counsel.
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,772.745,782.756,"--Well, my alternative position is, at the very least, the record needs to reflect that when counsel speaks, counsel is directly speaking with the approval of the client."
2007.06-11612,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,815.739,821.673,You were referring a while back to the Gomez case.
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,846.131,857.674,"Well, Your Honor, I think that's distinguishable because when one is objecting to the violation of a right, that's different from acquiescing in a knowing and voluntary and intelligent waiver of the right."
2007.06-11612,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,857.674,870.233,"It was the lawyer's choice, and we have no indication that it wasn't... it was anything other than the strategic choice of the lawyer."
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,881.678,890.784,"Well, Your Honor, in Gomez it was an objection to a alleged violation of Article III, as opposed to a waiver of the right to an Article III judge."
2007.06-11612,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,919.819,921.945,"But, of course, that was for the whole trial."
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,925.957,932.582,In Peretz the Court equated an entire delegation of a misdemeanor trial to delegation of felony jury selection.
2007.06-11612,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,940.576,948.091,"Peretz, also, if I understand the case correctly, equated the waiver with a failure to object."
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,951.027,957.118,"--Well, Your Honor, as I... as I think I've explained in the brief, Peretz is full of many statements that are ambiguous."
2007.06-11612,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,958.834,977.734,"Well, you say they are ambiguous, but isn't it... I've reread Peretz after many years getting ready for this argument, and it seems to me that it's difficult to read Peretz without reading the ""waiver failure to object"" phraseology as being equivalent."
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,977.734,988.356,"--Well, Your Honor, Peretz has to be read in light of two things: One, it has to be read in light of the facts of that case where there was a failure to object after the attorney had personally... or had stated his client personally considered it."
2007.06-11612,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1010.222,1016.842,"I mean, yes, but... everybody concedes that, but the question is by whom?"
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,1021.685,1022.746,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-11612,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1022.746,1031.275,"So you can't simply say it requires an express and knowing waiver, attributing that express and knowing waiver to the defendant."
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,1037.271,1037.973,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-11612,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1057.982,1073.916,"Well, except for one thing, and that is, if... if it is sound to say that Peretz equated ""waiver"" with ""failure to object"", ""failure to object"" is a... is a failure, if you will, of counsel, not of the defendant."
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,1087.706,1104.652,"--Your Honor, I would think in certain cases, if it's a personal right and a defense lawyer stands up and says in the presence of his client, my client consents, and the client doesn't object or respond that, I disagree, then it's fair perhaps to assume there's a sufficient showing of... of personal waiver by the defendant."
2007.06-11612,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1109.102,1127.737,"No, but the point was you were saying that in fact Peretz cannot be read as authority for the Government's position because the facts in Peretz, quite as you correctly note, were that the... the client had in fact consented, or that was the representation to the Court."
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,1163.254,1164.174,--I disagree.
2007.06-11612,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1194.427,1197.928,Do you think there has to be a showing on the record that the waiver is knowing?
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,1197.928,1207.705,"Under 18 U.S.C. Section 3401(b), which I contend is the obvious analog for waiving in the felony context, yes, absolutely."
2007.06-11612,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1219.387,1231.241,"So you think there has to be a colloquy like a Rule 11 colloquy or a waiver of counsel's, this is the different, this is what a district judge is, this is what a magistrate judge is, do you understand the difference between the two?"
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,1231.241,1236.428,It's going to obviously depend on the defendant because every case involving waiver depends on the particular circumstances.
2007.06-11612,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1243.268,1263.651,"I know it's a different context, but... it does not relate to the magistrate versus Article III judge, but do you think that a lawyer could stipulate that the judge or a magistrate presiding could do all the questioning and the lawyers would do none, without the... without the express consent of his client?"
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,1263.651,1268.412,In terms of the jury selection process?
2007.06-11612,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1268.412,1276.316,"It seems to me that the voir dire is peculiarly the... an area in which the lawyer knows what he is up to and what's at stake, and the client does not."
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,1276.316,1286.233,"Well, I would think the lawyer could in that situation for the simple reason that you have already at that point established, presumably, an Article III judge is presiding or it has been validly waived."
2007.06-11612,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1308.07,1329.856,"Do you think a jurisdiction could adopt a rule that was especially careful about selecting the jury panel and then decided they would take the first 12 jurors off an arbitrary list, just to pick them at random and have no voir dire during the trial, just to have a preliminary screening of qualifications of the... of the entire panel?"
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,1329.856,1332.668,I think certain jurisdictions have done that before.
2007.06-11612,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1446.214,1449.104,Was there a right to voir dire at common law?
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,1455.744,1456.821,"I don't know, Your Honor."
2007.06-11612,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1459.742,1460.615,Could I--
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,1460.615,1461.707,--Sure.
2007.06-11612,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1461.707,1475.343,"--Are we supposed to go through every one of the rights that a defendant has in a trial one by one and decide, you know, this one the lawyer can make, this one the defendant must make personally?"
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,1475.343,1476.611,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-11612,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1476.985,1477.578,One by one?
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,1482.028,1484.511,--I think the Court has already decided the vast majority of these.
2007.06-11612,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1503.787,1511.78,"That gets back to your structural argument, which makes a certain amount of sense just insofar as knowing where the line is."
2007.06-11612,0,17908,brent_e_newton,,1533.165,1537.521,"Well, Your Honor, the Framers clearly believed it was an extremely important right for defendants."
2007.06-11612,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1550.187,1551.407,"Thank you, Mr. Newton."
2007.06-11612,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1558.278,1569.618,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The decision whether to have a magistrate judge conduct voir dire is a strategic call that counsel is uniquely qualified to make."
2007.06-11612,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1581.924,1586.202,"Of course, it might be said of the right to plead guilty as well."
2007.06-11612,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1600.541,1601.964,That's correct.
2007.06-11612,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1712.386,1715.76,Did she rule on strikes for cause?
2007.06-11612,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1715.76,1724.007,"They were all by consensus, so yes, she ruled on them in that jurors were excused for various reasons."
2007.06-11612,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1728.566,1741.251,"But that... I mean, that is, I suppose, the most significant power that the judge who is conducting the voir dire or presiding at the voir dire has, to allow or not allow a strike--"
2007.06-11612,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1741.251,1753.682,"Right, and defense counsel's going to have to weigh in any given case whether the magistrate judge is going to rule on any objections and de novo review is possible, but it's difficult as a practical matter, as the court noted in Peretz."
2007.06-11612,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1774.094,1785.619,"Suppose... I know you don't like to contemplate this, but that we accept the Petitioner's position that there has to be, that the client has to waive."
2007.06-11612,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1797.349,1800.005,An implied consent in--
2007.06-11612,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1800.005,1807.625,"Well, he was there, he probably knew and the record shows that he knew what was going on."
2007.06-11612,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1807.625,1809.017,--If an explicit personal--
2007.06-11612,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1809.017,1810.971,"I, frankly, don't think we should go down that route."
2007.06-11612,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1810.971,1814.812,"--If a personal explicit waiver is required, there wasn't one here."
2007.06-11612,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1836.364,1839.004,May I ask how it works in practice?
2007.06-11612,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1848.422,1854.077,"Under this Court's decision in Peretz, there would be de novo review at the end of the process."
2007.06-11612,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1863.618,1873.507,"But in practice, as I understand it, very often the judge will, will review the magistrate's decisions on contested objections."
2007.06-11612,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1873.507,1874.115,--He can.
2007.06-11612,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1899.545,1901.417,How does that work?
2007.06-11612,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1914.709,1916.175,I don't know if it can be done that day.
2007.06-11612,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1920.738,1930.062,"Excuse me, if the Article III judge says, oh, this should not have been excused for cause, then you go back and bump the juror that was seated... I guess that's the way you'd have to do it."
2007.06-11612,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1930.062,1935.603,I think this discussion just shows why a defendant... this would not be a right that he would readily appreciate and understand.
2007.06-11612,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1961.157,1968.652,Do you... do you think the right to a jury trial is something that has to be personally waived by the defendant or can that be waived through counsel?
2007.06-11612,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1968.652,1976.728,--We read a discussion of it in Florida v. Nixon and New York v. Hill including that among the rights that required a personal explicit waiver.
2007.06-11612,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1978.557,1981.508,Were those... was the right to a jury trial at issue in those cases?
2007.06-11612,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1981.508,1988.567,"--No, it was just a descriptive: There are decisions of such moment that the defendant must personally make and this is usually included in the list."
2007.06-11612,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1991.192,2001.252,"When I was researching it, I saw that it was usually included in the list, but I thought it would track back to some case that held that it was, but it never... never does."
2007.06-11612,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2001.252,2007.467,"--Well, whatever is in the list, it's a very small handful and it is something that the defendant--"
2007.06-11612,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2007.467,2008.855,"--It's our list, after all, right?"
2007.06-11612,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2009.323,2020.273,"--It's a very short list, and I just think it's something that a defendant can readily appreciate, even though it may be a strategic call, whether or not he is going to plead guilty or even take the stand."
2007.06-11612,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2045.312,2056.554,"Ms. Blatt, if you, if the Government prevails, what happens to the 11th Circuit's ruling in the... what was it, the Maragh--"
2007.06-11612,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2056.554,2057.011,Maragh--
2007.06-11612,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2057.011,2085.231,"--case where the 11th Circuit said, we're not going to mess with any constitutional question, but under our supervisory power, we're going to tell the district... the magistrate judges, district judges in this circuit; it's a simple thing to do, put on the record that the defendant himself consented."
2007.06-11612,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2093.85,2094.773,--I don't think so.
2007.06-11612,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2097.928,2099.972,You think it would be valid or don't think it wouldn't be valid?
2007.06-11612,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2099.972,2100.49,--I don't think so.
2007.06-11612,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2114.2,2122.182,"They specifically said, we're doing this under our supervisory powers, not under the Constitution."

2007.06-11612,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2149.81,2151.374,"Well, suppose the question would come up."
2007.06-11612,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2161.259,2161.665,--Right.
2007.06-11612,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2162.024,2166.774,"And then we'd have to decide, or the Court would have to decide whether that's a basis for reversal."
2007.06-11612,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2166.774,2167.148,--Right.
2007.06-11612,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2260.035,2272.45,"If Mr. Gonzalez had stood up at some point during the voir dire and said, Your Honor, I've just learned you're not an Article III judge, and I want an Article III judge to preside over the voir dire, what would happen?"
2007.06-11612,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2272.45,2276.26,"Well, our position is the magistrate judge could say sit down."

2007.06-11612,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2334.188,2334.874,No.
2007.06-11612,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2440.66,2441.568,"Thank you, Ms. Blatt."

2007.06-11612,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2463.212,2467.755,Could I just... a question that has troubled me.
2007.06-11612,2,17908,brent_e_newton,,2518.799,2529.792,"It would be enough if the lawyer made no objection, Your Honor, because that is the kind of rule that I described earlier that concerns the heat of the battle of the adversary process, unlike a discreet point in time before."
2007.06-11612,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2529.792,2530.778,I see.

2007.06-11612,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2703.593,2705.309,You can finish your sentence.
2007.06-11612,2,17908,brent_e_newton,,2705.309,2715.12,--I'm asking the Court to avoid that question by interpreting the 3401(b).
