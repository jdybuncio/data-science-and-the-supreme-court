1995.94-1140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.11,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 94 1140, 44 Liquormart, Inc., v. Rhode Island and Rhode Island Liquor Stores Association."
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,14.512,17.173,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--
1995.94-1140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,133.809,145.696,"Well, now, there's no... we don't apply a least restrictive means test in that fourth prong of Central Hudson, so to show that something else might have been done isn't enough, I don't think."
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,145.696,148.477,I'm not arguing for a least restrictive means test.
1995.94-1140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,161.767,164.299,Why isn't that a least restrictive means approach?
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,164.299,175.195,I don't think it is because I think the least restrictive means approach would deal with an array of choices of various degrees of regulation of speech.
1995.94-1140,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,190.415,193.928,Wasn't that a Federal regulation we dealt with--
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,193.928,194.529,"--Yes, it was."
1995.94-1140,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,194.529,194.83,--in Coors?
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,197.631,198.61,That is correct.
1995.94-1140,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,198.61,207.886,And presumably the States have a little more leeway because of the Twenty first Amendment in the area of control of alcoholic beverages sales.
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,207.886,219.604,"I would submit to you that the State's power to control alcoholic beverages sales is not dependent upon the Twenty First amendment, but is inherent in their police power--"
1995.94-1140,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,219.604,225.287,"Well, surely the Twenty First Amendment extends some power to the States that they wouldn't otherwise have in this area--"
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,225.287,226.169,"--Yes, it does."
1995.94-1140,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,226.169,228.019,--with respect to the Commerce Clause--
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,228.019,229.071,"Yes, it--"
1995.94-1140,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,229.071,229.341,--barriers.
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,229.341,242.468,"--Yes, it does, but what I'm suggesting to you, and what I've argued, is that the Twenty first Amendment does not in any way cut back on the force of the First Amendment as it is applied to the States."
1995.94-1140,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,242.468,262.274,"How do you explain this Court's, action in Queensgate Investment Company in 1982, where the Court dismissed for want of a substantial Federal question a case where a State regulation of price advertizing of liquor was upheld?"
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,262.274,270.007,"Well, quite frankly, I can't explain it because the Court did not issue an opinion, and the Court has said in other--"
1995.94-1140,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,270.007,273.52,At least it said there wasn't a substantial Federal question.
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,273.52,286.039,"--That's correct, but the Court has said on other occasions that a summary dismissal of this sort does not imply even agreement with the opinion of the court that is below."
1995.94-1140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,286.039,291.693,It's nonetheless a holding that the appeal raises no substantial Federal question.
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,291.693,291.903,That is true.
1995.94-1140,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,324.624,332.472,Do you think that Posadas is some authority for saying that the State could ban any advertizing at all of alcoholic beverages?
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,332.472,337.314,I don't think that Posadas is quite that strong an authority.
1995.94-1140,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,355.245,360.258,Do you think Rhode Island could ban all advertizing of alcoholic beverages?
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,360.258,372.927,"As I read the Court's jurisprudence with the question put in that fashion, I think the answer is no, because what this Court has said is that States may not ban truthful, nonmisleading advertizing."
1995.94-1140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,382.995,386.966,Even though they could ban any sale or consumption of liquor.
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,386.966,394.161,"Yes, and the reason for that, Your Honor, is that it seems to me that the States must always act in accordance with the Constitution."
1995.94-1140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,394.161,397.173,"Well, how does that square with Posadas, your position?"
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,397.173,405.989,"Well, the way it squares with Posadas is that, first of all, in Posadas the Court was not confronted with a total ban on advertizing."
1995.94-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,422.259,422.95,"Well, it's the same here."
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,424.82,425.762,That's right.
1995.94-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,425.762,428.764,"You can advertize liquor all you like, just not the price."
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,428.764,430.336,"I agree with you, and I think that's why--"
1995.94-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,430.336,432.928,So how is Posadas distinguished?
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,432.928,440.892,--Posadas is distinguished only in that each case must apply the Central Hudson test to the facts that are before it.
1995.94-1140,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,448.715,459.194,"Isn't this case, counsel, more like gambling ads than it is like the price of drugs approved by the FDA?"
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,459.194,460.724,I don't think that it is.
1995.94-1140,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,468.05,468.45,"Well, if we could--"
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,468.45,469.11,--its interest.
1995.94-1140,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,469.11,473.203,"--The State, as you said, could ban any sale of liquor."
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,473.203,475.052,That seems clear.
1995.94-1140,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,475.052,477.616,And it could ban gambling in its borders.
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,477.616,478.695,"That seems clear, too."
1995.94-1140,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,478.695,481.297,But it couldn't ban FDA approved drugs.
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,481.297,483.988,That's probably true as well.
1995.94-1140,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,483.988,486.041,It couldn't ban professional services.
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,486.041,489.753,"I think... well, I'm not sure whether it could or it couldn't."
1995.94-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,489.753,492.096,Are we resurrecting Lochner here?
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,498.501,517.991,"I think... no, I think the State has a great deal of power to ban many things, and that's why I think that the logic of saying, simply because you may have the power to ban something, that you then have the power to ban speech about something that you're not banning, is quite a different proposition."
1995.94-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,517.991,519.582,The State could ban toothpaste if it wanted to?
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,519.582,523.784,"Well, I think at some point you get to a--"
1995.94-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.784,524.406,To what?
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,524.406,525.877,--You get to a point of irrationality.
1995.94-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,525.877,526.758,To a constitutional provision on toothpaste?
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,526.758,530.461,"Well, I would be... I'd be hard--"
1995.94-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,530.461,531.95,"At some point you get to Lochner, is that it?"
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,531.95,533.603,--I don't think so.
1995.94-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,547.462,550.113,"I'm not saying whether it would, I'm saying whether it could."
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,551.615,552.785,--I think that--
1995.94-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,552.785,553.957,I wouldn't want to run on that ticket.
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,554.177,561.52,"--I don't think in Rhode Island you would want to run on the raising the price of alcoholic beverages ticket, either."
1995.94-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,561.52,574.369,"No, but the point is, you would say that if the State could ban toothpaste, and let's assume it could unless you believe in Lochner, it still nonetheless could not ban toothpaste advertizing so long as it did not ban toothpaste."
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,574.369,575.809,That's exactly my... yes.
1995.94-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,575.809,577.542,And you'd say liquor is no different from toothpaste.
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,577.542,578.222,That's right.
1995.94-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,578.222,579.722,"That's a hard position to maintain, I suppose--"
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,579.722,580.533,"Well, I think--"
1995.94-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,580.533,581.443,--that liquor is no different from toothpaste.
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,581.443,598.875,"--Well, I think that the Court has certainly suggested in the Coors case that when analyzing bans on commercial speech, it is not appropriate to recognize some hierarchy of products some of which are entitled to more protection than others."
1995.94-1140,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,598.875,601.527,"Well, may I take us away from toothpaste and back to gambling?"
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,601.527,601.747,Yes.
1995.94-1140,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,601.747,626.123,"If I just look at this Court's precedent and I say, well, there's Virginia Board and that concern, advertizing the price of drugs, and then there's the restriction on advertizing to locals gambling casinos, so it seems to me liquor is closer to gambling casinos than it is to drugs, so why doesn't Posadas control?"
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,626.123,633.3,It doesn't control in the sense that... it controls in the sense that you apply the Central Hudson test to the facts of the case.
1995.94-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,644.246,683.422,"What I wonder is, if... just going back for a second to where you started, suppose that a State thinks the following, people think this in the legislature we don't mind if people buy liquor, but we're worried about them drinking too much, and we don't mind if the price is high or if small retailers make a lot of money, because they're in neighborhoods, and we're afraid that if there are a lot of advertizing for price, all the high school students will run up where they say beer at half price this week, or whiskey reduced 30 percent."
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,711.849,712.37,Well--
1995.94-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,712.37,718.204,"Is it that it can't do anything about this problem that it sees, or it can't implement the position that it's reached?"
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,718.204,724.508,"--I think that under the Central Hudson test, the State would have to show that--"
1995.94-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,724.508,731.034,"The facts are just exactly what I said, and let's also say they go into court and they make out a plausible case."
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,740.538,741.009,"--Well, if--"
1995.94-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,741.009,744.291,Then what's the law supposed to allow them to--
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,744.291,747.393,--If the State were able to show that in fact--
1995.94-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,747.393,750.445,"--What they do is, they go and do what I said."
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,770.117,775.072,"--I think the law is that under the Central Hudson test, they have not satisfied the Central Hudson test."
1995.94-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,775.072,778.114,"Right, so you're saying the State's powerless in that situation."
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,778.114,779.344,"No, I'm saying that the State--"
1995.94-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,779.344,787.12,I want to know what they're supposed to do in order to implement all the hearings before the legislature that bore out those facts.
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,787.12,791.352,"--Well, if there were hearings that bore out those facts--"
1995.94-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,791.352,792.313,Let's assume there are.
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,792.313,800.899,"--And if there were proof that was satisfactory that the State's hypothesis were, in fact, correct--"
1995.94-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,800.899,803.84,I'm trying to get at what the State really should do.
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,809.083,810.315,"--Well, I think--"
1995.94-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,810.315,811.585,And that wouldn't restrict speech.
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,811.585,812.576,--I think--
1995.94-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,812.576,814.086,It would have the same effect and not restrict speech.
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,814.657,838.442,"--That is what I said, but the proposition added a new... the hypothetical added a new factor, which was that the State didn't want to keep the prices high, they just wanted to deter price advertizing because they thought that the presence of price advertizing itself was a stimulant."
1995.94-1140,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,838.442,839.975,"--Yes, specials and all these different--"
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,889.887,902.855,"I think that I do and I also, in reviewing the cases that deal with this type of issue, note that very often these cases simply turn upon logical discourses."
1995.94-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,902.855,924.779,"Yes, but what's worrying me is that so often these turn on, like, lawyer's arguments as, there was 14 inches of proof on this side and 12 files of evidence on the other side, but in the reality, what you do is, you get witnesses who come in and say, sure, kids will buy more liquor if you advertize half price, and others say, we're not certain of that, or how often."
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,932.854,946.424,"Well, I think that going into the hypothetical, and recognizing that it's not the facts of this case, that the question then would turn upon how much the State has to show."
1995.94-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,953.617,955.758,"Everything just comes down to an evidentiary question, then."
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,980.766,983.52,--I... that is the point that I was trying to make.
1995.94-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,983.52,986.7,That the State may not have the motive that Justice Breyer--
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,1004.541,1004.901,Yes.
1995.94-1140,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1004.901,1013.637,"So your answer is ultimately going to have to take into account the evidence on that point, isn't it?"
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,1013.637,1025.606,"Yes, it is, and I would suggest to you that despite the characterization of the First Circuit that the evidence went both ways, when you really look at it, the evidence only went one way."
1995.94-1140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1025.606,1028.478,But we're not here to evaluate evidence.
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,1031.082,1036.816,"Well, the trial court evaluated the evidence and found as a fact that there was no material--"
1995.94-1140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1036.816,1042.058,"And the First Circuit reversed it, and we generally take our facts from the court of appeals."
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,1042.058,1052.133,"--Well, I think that the First Circuit ordinarily would only be able to reverse a finding of fact of the trial court under the clearly erroneous standard."
1995.94-1140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1052.133,1052.974,But in--
1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,1078.092,1104.569,"Well, I think that first of all there may be... if the State... if the State stated a logical proposition, and that was unopposed, perhaps that would be a different case, but in this case there was evidence, and the State's own expert I think agreed that simply changing the price of liquor does not necessarily affect consumption."

1995.94-1140,0,22666,evan_t_lawson,,1140.32,1161.965,"Well, the problem with the State's position on the search time argument, which is the generic problem with the State's position, is that in order for its theory to work, there has to be enough of a shift in prices that there will actually be an effect on consumption."

1995.94-1140,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1597.402,1600.595,Suppose there were testimony... and there isn't.

1995.94-1140,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1862.428,1875.104,"Well, how do you get over the requirement which I thought was expressed in Rubin and Coors and in fact the indication has got to be that the State's interest is... I think the word was materially advanced?"

1995.94-1140,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2263.502,2267.724,"Okay, but I thought... it was the constitutional problems that you alluded to that I was alluding to."
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2274.119,2283.124,"--If I understand your question correctly, why wouldn't a--"
1995.94-1140,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2283.124,2288.557,Why do you have constitutional problems in setting a liquor price when you've got the Twenty First Amendment?
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2288.557,2301.136,"--Historically, in the minimum retail price area the States have been affecting prices in other States and other areas of the country, and that has been held to be improper and unacceptable even with the Twenty First Amendment."
1995.94-1140,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2306.209,2311.204,"If our concern is, how do we keep the price high, let's substitute for a tax."
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2321.439,2329.574,"And it wouldn't work as well, because it wouldn't remove the artificial inducement to consume that an advertizement constitutes."
1995.94-1140,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2330.925,2342.534,"But I thought the artificial inducement was in the price, in the capacity to advertize low prices, not the capacity to advertize as such."
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2342.534,2356.121,"--It is the State's position, and it is a reasonable belief that would support this ban, that those citizens who are already so inclined to consume will purchase no matter what."
1995.94-1140,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2356.121,2362.436,Then it seems to me your argument is showing that the State can perfectly well ban all advertizing of liquor.
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2363.427,2364.686,"Oh, I absolutely think--"
1995.94-1140,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2364.686,2364.876,Okay.
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2364.876,2367.609,--that a State can... a total advertizing ban would be constitutional.
1995.94-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2367.609,2373.923,"Mrs. Partington, can I... I'm not sure what the scope of the concession that you made to Justice Souter earlier was."
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2400.61,2401.912,I think that--
1995.94-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2401.912,2404.303,Is the First Amendment different from other amendments in--
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2404.303,2420.655,"--The rule as I understand it is, and the First Amendment has been afforded a lot of special consideration by this Court, and again, set out in the Dunagin footnote better than I'm saying it today, obviously, is that appellate courts in a First Amendment case bear a special role in reviewing the lower courts."
1995.94-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2422.645,2423.276,--Why is that?
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2429.47,2430.97,And I think in Craig--
1995.94-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2430.97,2431.491,First Amendment's different.
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2439.085,2442.337,"--Well, I think in the past this Court has accepted--"
1995.94-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2442.337,2444.66,"Sort of a privileged amendment, is it... I mean, the First Amendment?"
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2449.293,2451.725,--I think this Court has always held a special place for the First Amendment in the law--
1995.94-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2451.725,2452.105,--In our hearts?
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2452.105,2458.179,"--that I have read it, perhaps other amendments are entitled to a great deal of deference."
1995.94-1140,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2458.179,2460.322,How about in commercial speech cases?
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2467.085,2481.716,"No, and I think that's just the point about the commercial speech doctrine, and that is, the State's position is that it is not as protected because it is proposing a commercial transaction, in this case a transaction, the sale of alcoholic beverages, a highly regulated commodity."
1995.94-1140,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2481.716,2487.49,May I ask this general question in terms of factual basis for the statute?
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2510.017,2525.177,"I think as long as the State's asserted interest in this case is substantial, and is advanced, and the State could reasonably have believed it was advanced, the peripheral effect on the distribution scheme and on the small retailers and the large retailers and their relationship--"
1995.94-1140,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2525.177,2535.823,"No, I'm not saying that's the peripheral effect, I'm assuming from my hypothetical, and I guess it's alleged in one count of the complaint, but that fell by the wayside somewhere, that the real background to the statute is, it's just old fashioned price fixing."
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2542.057,2550.532,"--I think it would under the substantial interest test, or the substantial interest prong of Central Hudson, could protection of the smaller retailers be a substantial interest."
1995.94-1140,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2554.854,2556.987,That's just the question that's bothering me.
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2660.284,2665.687,I think our product is quite special because of this Nation's regulatory history of alcoholic beverages.
1995.94-1140,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2675.335,2677.275,How about bullets and firearms?
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2681.649,2691.074,--I think if we met the Central Hudson test we would then have to create more of a legislative history in this case than we had to in the gun case.
1995.94-1140,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2699.871,2705.765,"Of course, part of the history in the liquor case is that the mom and pop stores want this legislation every badly."
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2705.765,2709.138,"--They intervened on the side of the State, correct."
1995.94-1140,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2720.855,2728.749,"And food products that, eaten in too great an amount, cause diseases, or could lead to overweight, or--"
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2728.749,2731.761,"For instance, like red meat."
1995.94-1140,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2731.761,2737.766,--Or... I don't... anything that's carcinogenic in large doses to small animals.
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2751.794,2763.381,"I think at this point in history, alcoholic beverages stand in a unique position, because of the history and because it's the only grant of power to the States, the Twenty First Amendment, to regulate--"
1995.94-1140,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2763.381,2771.208,But doesn't that just give States more power within the Interstate Commerce Clause area?
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2780.474,2782.245,"--No, you have not."
1995.94-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2810.102,2813.884,I don't see what the Twenty... the Twenty First Amendment seems to me entirely irrelevant.
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2828.464,2829.816,"--Well, as I was saying--"
1995.94-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2829.816,2832.117,"I mean, I don't see what power that gives to the States."
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2842.672,2847.718,--And I think it might be a mistake to limit my position to saying the Twenty First Amendment gives us power.
1995.94-1140,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2857.783,2866.098,I don't think this Court has ever said we weave the Twenty First Amendment in and out of some First Amendment analysis.
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2873.905,2874.884,"--I believe so, Your Honor."
1995.94-1140,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2879.699,2885.842,"What do you say today is the State's ultimate interest here, to reduce consumption of alcohol?"
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2885.842,2893.747,--The State's asserted interest in the statute is the promotion of temperance and the reasonable control in the traffic of alcoholic beverages.
1995.94-1140,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2893.747,2910.727,"Do you think it likely that a legislature, that the Rhode Island legislature would enact direct price control or raise taxes to do that, or does it have to depend on this very indirect way of achieving that goal?"
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2910.727,2927.169,"Well, I would have to disagree with the characterization of this as indirect, because I think as the Fourth Circuit recently said in the Anheuser Busch case, and this Court said, marketing and advertizing are a direct link to consumption."
1995.94-1140,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2944.03,2947.683,But how far... how many commodities has that spread to?
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,2957.659,2974.32,"--I think the line would be those... from my cases, alcoholic beverages is unique, because of, again, the regulatory history of this country and the social problems caused by alcoholic beverages, and the focus that the Constitution has had on alcoholic beverages... two constitutional amendments."
1995.94-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2981.453,2982.875,"Well, but surely that's up to the people of the State."
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,3008.051,3013.686,"--I think the history of alcoholic beverage regulation and the general police powers, I think--"
1995.94-1140,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3013.686,3020.519,"If that's so, if we accept the uniqueness argument... and I think you can make a very good uniqueness argument here."
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,3044.806,3045.627,--No.
1995.94-1140,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3057.886,3068.651,"Then why don't you take that as your argument here because Rhode Island could, in fact, preclude the importation and sale of any liquor whatsoever, it therefore can regulate its advertizing?"
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,3071.335,3075.127,--That has been one of the arguments of the State up until this point.
1995.94-1140,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3095.17,3103.046,As part of your brief you say that price advertizing is the least informative speech concerning a product.
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,3111.771,3114.373,Let me try to explain what I was--
1995.94-1140,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3114.373,3116.163,I was curious to know where you got that.
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,3116.163,3120.076,--What I was trying to say was that it doesn't tell you about the product itself.
1995.94-1140,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3131.063,3138.519,So you were not talking about price information on a scale of priorities of interest of the consumers.
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,3138.519,3138.9,--No.
1995.94-1140,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3139.609,3142.941,"But if you say a fifth of Gilbey's Gin, you know what's in there."
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,3143.132,3145.301,Some people might.
1995.94-1140,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3167.227,3172.81,You were not trying to convey the fact that price is not of vital interest to consumers of most products.
1995.94-1140,1,40138,rebecca_t_partington,,3172.81,3179.456,"Absolutely not, and that takes us back to the reason and the basis for this statute, and that is what the testimony is here."
1995.94-1140,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3186.241,3187.249,"Thank you, Ms. Partington."
1995.94-1140,2,22666,evan_t_lawson,,3190.071,3191.753,I will waive the rebuttal.
1995.94-1140,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3191.753,3193.353,"May I ask you one question, though?"
1995.94-1140,2,22666,evan_t_lawson,,3203.301,3208.654,The State voluntarily stepped in in place of its administrator.
1995.94-1140,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3208.654,3209.295,I see.
1995.94-1140,2,22666,evan_t_lawson,,3209.295,3214.869,I think that the Eleventh Amendment would not be a problem where the State voluntarily--
1995.94-1140,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3214.869,3217.771,And at what stage of the proceedings did they become a party?
1995.94-1140,2,22666,evan_t_lawson,,3217.771,3225.016,--Sort of between the decision of the district court and the case reaching the First Circuit.
1995.94-1140,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3225.016,3227.588,"The appeal was taken in the name of the State, in other words."
1995.94-1140,2,22666,evan_t_lawson,,3227.588,3241.766,"I think it was originally taken in the name of the liquor control administrator, but my memory of this is somewhat dim, but what happened is, I believe--"
1995.94-1140,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3241.766,3244.588,"They voluntarily appeared rather than your bringing them in, is what you're saying."
1995.94-1140,2,22666,evan_t_lawson,,3244.588,3245.537,"--No, I definitely didn't bring them in."
1995.94-1140,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3258.526,3258.977,Thank you.
1995.94-1140,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3258.977,3261.33,"Thank you, Mr. Lawson."
