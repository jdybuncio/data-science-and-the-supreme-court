1980.79-1344,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.323,"We will hear arguments first this morning, in Number 79-1344; Michael M. against the Superior Court of Sonoma County, California."
1980.79-1344,0,25554,gregory_f_jilka,,17.603,19.493,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,133.104,134.634,What was the charge?
1980.79-1344,0,25554,gregory_f_jilka,,140.366,142.726,"No, Justice Rehnquist, it could not."
1980.79-1344,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,164.169,177.524,"So, as you say, the suggestion that force was used is irrelevant because the issue before us is the constitutional validity of the statute on its face--"
1980.79-1344,0,25554,gregory_f_jilka,,177.524,178.102,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1344,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,178.102,178.772,--is that correct?
1980.79-1344,0,25554,gregory_f_jilka,,181.413,182.787,"Well, Your Honor, I--"
1980.79-1344,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,182.787,184.613,"He was not... I mean, if you're right on the first--"
1980.79-1344,0,25554,gregory_f_jilka,,184.613,185.457,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1344,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,185.457,186.207,--the second follows.
1980.79-1344,0,25554,gregory_f_jilka,,186.207,201.748,"I do believe, however, that we have fairly presented a limited constitutional question on the applicability of the statute as applied to a 17 and a half year old female who is charged with sexual intercourse with a 16 and a half year old."
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,1857.251,1865.593,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1344,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1929.347,1934.751,"Mr. Kriegler, do prosecutors in California always press these as felonies?"
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,1934.751,1935.235,"No, Your Honor."
1980.79-1344,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1935.235,1940.139,"Well, where is the line of distinction?"
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,1947.778,1956.118,I believe it was pressed as a felony in this case due to the particular facts involved.
1980.79-1344,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1957.04,1963.099,Well I read the appendix thoroughly and I would say the particular facts would seem to cut the other way.
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,1963.099,1983.576,"--Well Your Honor, the prosecutor obviously disagreed based upon the fact that the victim clearly testified, under oath at the preliminary hearing, that she submitted to the act of intercourse only after being slugged in the face 2 to 3 times with sufficient force to leave bruises."
1980.79-1344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2046.02,2056.109,"Mr. Kriegler, would either of those purposes be served any less well by a statute that was entirely neutral that applied to the female as well as the male?"
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2056.109,2060.841,"Absolutely, Your Honor, particularly in this case."
1980.79-1344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2077.71,2080.428,"Also, she might be less anxious to commit it, too, wouldn't she?"
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2080.428,2087.378,"She may, Your Honor, but in view of the--"
1980.79-1344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2087.378,2089.564,I thought maybe--
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2089.564,2090.174,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1344,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2096.64,2097.687,"--Well, who bought the liquor?"
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2100.545,2101.481,--She was not a willing participant.
1980.79-1344,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2101.481,2104.481,--Well doesn't the Appendix show that she began the intimacies?
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2104.481,2111.07,"Your Honor, she engaged in a certain amount of kissing, apparently, from the record, with the Defendant."
1980.79-1344,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2111.07,2115.648,"Making out, the term was used, and objected to and sustained."
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2115.648,2121.364,I believe that was Mr. Jilka's term that he used in the preliminary hearing.
1980.79-1344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2136.81,2139.435,And you say he was a perfect stranger?
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2139.435,2144.793,I believe the record indicates she may have known the Petitioner.
1980.79-1344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2144.793,2152.898,"When you say the record may show, doesn't the record actually show that she rode around in the police car to pick him out on the street?"
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2152.898,2153.851,That--
1980.79-1344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2153.851,2154.506,Doesn't the record show that?
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2154.506,2155.084,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2155.084,2159.865,"Well you don't go around looking for people that you know, do you?"
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2164.956,2169.891,"Well all I'm saying is, she may have been familiar with the individual, I don't know that she was a personal friend or a close acquaintance--"
1980.79-1344,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2169.891,2178.467,"Well, Mr. Kriegler, if the issue before us is the constitutional validity on its face of this California legislation, what in the world do the facts of this case have to do with it?"
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2178.467,2184.464,--Well we believe the statute is constitutional on its face for the reasons set forth by the California Supreme Court.
1980.79-1344,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2196.506,2204.535,"But if the facts have any relevancy at all, they bear only on the decision of the prosecutor as to whether to prosecute on a felony or a misdemeanor, isn't that so?"
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2216.374,2217.265,We agree.
1980.79-1344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2237.022,2237.616,Well why not?
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2241.426,2243.41,--That is not the facts before this Court.
1980.79-1344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2245.519,2253.954,But do you not defend the constitutionality of the statute as applied to a consensual act between two 17-year olds of opposite sexes who are equally culpable?
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2254.829,2255.53,"--Yes, we certainly do."
1980.79-1344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2255.53,2256.749,They why do we have to argue about anything else?
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2256.749,2262.169,"Because it's important to point out, in this case, the two 17-year olds were not equally culpable."
1980.79-1344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2262.169,2264.104,Well why is it important if you're defending the statute--
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2269.65,2271.102,"That is correct, Your Honor, there has been no trial."
1980.79-1344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2288.907,2299.435,"You say that the reason it serves it better than a sex neutral statute is that after the act has been committed, then there's a greater likelihood that it will be reported by the female?"
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2299.435,2299.763,--Right--
1980.79-1344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2299.763,2308.211,"But in terms of the deterrence of the conduct itself, is it not clear that if the penalty applied to both, there would be less likelihood of the risk-creating conduct taking place?"
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2309.274,2311.21,--I don't think that necessarily follows.
1980.79-1344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2312.147,2319.223,You don't think the female should ever be punished for engaging in this kind of conduct as a deterrent to further examples of the same kind of conduct?
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2319.223,2324.955,"--Well I think the state might... the state legislature might, in the exercise of its sound judgment,--"
1980.79-1344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2324.955,2333.953,"Would it be rational for a parent to say it's perfectly all right for my sons to do this, but it's wrong for my daughters to do this and therefore I will punish my sons but not my daughters?"
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2336.748,2339.686,"--It would depend upon the circumstances, Your Honor, and the act--"
1980.79-1344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2339.686,2342.012,"Well it's always a risk-creating act, isn't it?"
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2342.012,2345.714,"--It is, but the risks are borne uniquely by the female."
1980.79-1344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2346.651,2350.369,"But it takes two participants every time the act is performed, doesn't it?"
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2350.369,2350.963,"--Yes, it does, it certainly does."
1980.79-1344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2350.963,2358.507,"And if it's consensual, why should one be punished and not the other one?"
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2358.507,2375.171,"One should be punished because the California legislature has determined that the female bears these extraordinary risks from the act of intercourse; because of these extraordinary risks which Petitioner has conceded in it's brief, to be compelling state interests, the legislature has reasonably concluded, we believe, that the sexes are not similarly situated."
1980.79-1344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2375.171,2383.73,Has the legislature reasonably concluded that those risks have been sufficient to deter females from voluntarily engaging in this kind of conduct?
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2383.73,2393.914,"Well, the question of deterrence is one that is very difficult to answer; we don't know how many people have or have not been deterred by the existence of this statute, or any other statute."
1980.79-1344,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2393.914,2394.414,Not very many have.
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2408.907,2409.735,I submit--
1980.79-1344,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2409.735,2412.296,--and in order to... and there is no such deterrence with respect to the male.
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2427.79,2429.009,"--Yes, it is, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1980.79-1344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2429.009,2434.304,"Well, Mr. Attorney General, the first statute was passed in 1850, right?"
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2434.304,2436.115,"Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1980.79-1344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2436.115,2440.177,"And it applied to girls 10 years old, right?"
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2440.177,2440.521,That is correct.
1980.79-1344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2440.521,2449.658,Is there any literature that shows that there was a rash of pregnancies among 9 year olds in 1850?
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2449.658,2450.033,No.
1980.79-1344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2461.277,2464.588,Well when did it change to pregnancy?
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2464.588,2466.306,--Well the statute--
1980.79-1344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2466.306,2468.977,And I'm going to ask for a citation when you answer.
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2468.977,2470.835,--Fine.
1980.79-1344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2506.384,2510.632,Have you ever heard of anything more speculative than that in your life?
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2510.632,2517.208,"--Your Honor, there are some additional points I would like to make in regard to the question of legislative intent, if I might?"
1980.79-1344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2517.208,2517.894,Sure.
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2517.894,2524.673,"In 1967, California passed its Therapeutic Abortion Act, and that is cited in our brief."
1980.79-1344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2576.34,2577.542,Did it change its statute?
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2577.542,2578.495,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2582.228,2582.744,Subsequently?
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2582.744,2596.286,"--Yes, in 1970, as a matter of fact, the present edition of the statute, Penal Code Section 261.5, was enacted, it was taken out of the former rape section, and it was called unlawful sexual intercourse."
1980.79-1344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2605.719,2606.641,Three years later?
1980.79-1344,1,41623,sandy_r_kriegler,,2606.641,2608.844,"--Yes, Your Honor."
