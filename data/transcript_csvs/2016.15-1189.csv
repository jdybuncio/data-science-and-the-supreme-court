2016.15-1189,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.34,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 15-1189, Impression Products v. Lexmark International. Mr. Pincus."
2016.15-1189,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,8.34,17.665,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case brings before the Court two questions regarding the patent exhaustion doctrine, also known as the first sale doctrine."
2016.15-1189,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,86.345,90.09,"I'm sorry to interrupt you, but that limitation is critical, right? Enforceable under patent law?"
2016.15-1189,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,90.09,92.66,Enforceable under patent law. We -- there's no question here.
2016.15-1189,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,113.74,121.52,Are there other examples of really important rules that have not been codified? Why hasn't this been codified?
2016.15-1189,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,121.52,123.34,"In the Patent Act, Your Honor?"
2016.15-1189,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,123.34,124.435,Too busy or what?
2016.15-1189,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,124.435,137.27,"Well, I think -- I think that -- that there were a number of -- of -- of patent law rules that Congress didn't codify it fully or either at all in the 1952 Act."
2016.15-1189,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,147.47,151.085,Did that -- did the failure to codify mean we should be somewhat cautious --
2016.15-1189,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,151.085,151.82,I don't --
2016.15-1189,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,151.82,153.57,-- in extending -- in extending it?
2016.15-1189,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,153.57,155.11,"Well, I -- I don't think --"
2016.15-1189,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,155.11,155.83,Or in -- or in interpreting -- you don't --
2016.15-1189,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,155.83,157.05,-- there's a question about extending it.
2016.15-1189,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,214.38,216.99,So it's contributory negligence.
2016.15-1189,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,223.0,233.94,"The misuse doctrine, I don't believe, was -- was codified initially, although there have been some subsequent amendments that have done that."
2016.15-1189,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,271.615,275.805,"Well, the Fed -- Federal Circuit's rule on this is 25 years old."
2016.15-1189,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,278.565,288.18,"Well, the Federal Circuit's rule is old, but it's been subject to dispute, both when this Court decided Quanta and then again when the Court decided Bowman."
2016.15-1189,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,326.63,328.785,"Well, that's certainly a rather risky strategy."
2016.15-1189,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,343.249,354.02,"Well, I think what we -- what -- what people are advising their clients was don't impose restrictions based on the idea that they can be enforced because there's a good chance that they can't be enforced."
2016.15-1189,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,563.815,571.76,And it's somewhat surprising to me that none of the briefs in this case talk about our cases regarding extraterritoriality.
2016.15-1189,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,604.83,646.72,"Your Honor, I don't think this is a question of extraterritorial application anything -- any more than the issue in Kirtsaeng was a question of extraterritorial application of the Copyright Act. The question here is whether the patentee's acts outside the United States have an impact on its ability to enforce its rights within the United States. So that -- no one is saying that the sales outside the United States are governed by the U.S. patent law, they're obviously not, just as the sales outside the United States under the Copyright Act are not governed by the Copyright Act. But the question here is whether if there is an authorized sale outside the United States authorized by the U.S. patentee, whether that should have the same exhaustion consequences as a sale within the United States."
2016.15-1189,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,770.8,777.04,"The argument the other side, which I think is the more difficult part, I absolutely see your point."
2016.15-1189,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,809.53,809.91,Yes.
2016.15-1189,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,809.91,831.995,"Either way, they're suing under American law and this person has violated the patent or he hasn't violated the American patent. And when we start talking abroad, you are quite right, I think, that Lord Coke and his great principle of no alienation on chattels is being laughed at."
2016.15-1189,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,866.935,879.31,"Well, my reaction is that in -- in many of the contexts in which this issue arises, it's really not quite right that the U.S. -- first of all, Justice, to - to be sure we're on the same stage --"
2016.15-1189,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,879.31,879.5,Uh-huh.
2016.15-1189,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,879.5,882.17,-- these are all sales that are authorized by the U.S. patentee.
2016.15-1189,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,886.28,893.565,"All sales were authorized. In the one sale, it was sold in Bavaria under a German patent."
2016.15-1189,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,905.48,917.8,"And -- and so the -- the -- the question here -- I -- I think what your question goes to is, do sales in foreign countries under different laws allow the U.S. patentee to recoup the value of his patent --"
2016.15-1189,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,917.8,918.02,No.
2016.15-1189,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,938.05,939.5,And our submission is no.
2016.15-1189,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,939.5,940.51,I know your submission is no.
2016.15-1189,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,940.51,940.91,And -- and -- but -- but --
2016.15-1189,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,940.91,943.22,And I'm just trying to get your answer to their argument --
2016.15-1189,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,943.22,943.47,But -- but --
2016.15-1189,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,943.47,945.93,"-- in saying whatever you think of the U.S., there's a big difference here."
2016.15-1189,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,947.66,959.48,"And -- and that's why I -- I -- I was talking about there, whether or not they had gotten -- the argument on the other side I think is we haven't gotten the value we would get if we sold our product into the U.S."
2016.15-1189,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1068.54,1068.92,Mr. Pincus.
2016.15-1189,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1068.92,1070.62,-- at least as they're currently written.
2016.15-1189,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1072.42,1081.995,"I've -- I've heard -- I've read and reread that argument, that the patentholder is not receiving value for its German patent."
2016.15-1189,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1128.635,1130.03,I agree with Your Honor.
2016.15-1189,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1148.3,1149.38,"Now, I will say --"
2016.15-1189,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1149.38,1150.09,-- calculation for the patentee.
2016.15-1189,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1150.09,1158.39,-- that -- that there are counter arguments on policy questions here of -- on both sides.
2016.15-1189,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1172.145,1187.715,"Well, I think the principal negative consequence that -- that -- that my friends on the other side and their amici point to is this question of price discrimination, and I think we've talked about that. Another issue that's raised in some of the briefs is safety: Food, drug -- drugs, and medical devices."
2016.15-1189,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1266.365,1279.69,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart."
2016.15-1189,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1279.69,1303.53,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to address the domestic exhaustion issue first, and I'd like to begin by responding to Justice Kennedy's question about why hasn't the exhaustion doctrine been codified. The Court's historic cases in the domestic exhaustion field have located the exhaustion principle in the language of the predecessors of what is now 35 U.S.C. 154(a)(1)"
2016.15-1189,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1609.56,1613.81,Can -- can they put a sticker on -- on the -- on the products --
2016.15-1189,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1613.81,1614.26,Well --
2016.15-1189,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1614.26,1618.785,"-- ""Do not sell""? This would be a great boom to the sticker business, right? (Laughter.)"
2016.15-1189,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1618.785,1642.88,"I -- I do want to be careful to -- to -- to limit the -- to make clear the limits on the principle that we're advocating; that is, we're not advocating a rule under which simply by manufacturing and selling overseas, the patentee could impose continuing downstream restrictions on the use of the good once it has been legally imported and sold into the United States."
2016.15-1189,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1683.89,1698.91,"What about Justice Kennedy's question? I mean, Lord Coke had that very question in mind, I think, that -- that one of the problems with restraints in alienation of chattel is that the buyer may not know, and -- and moreover, it stops competition among buyers."
2016.15-1189,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1704.6,1705.08,"Well, he have --"
2016.15-1189,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1705.08,1709.18,Does he have to put a sticker on every toy? Does he have to put a sticker -- how? How does it work?
2016.15-1189,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1709.18,1723.04,"Again, as -- as I say, if what we're talking about is a sticker that warns -- if the product is sold in Germany and the patentee wants to warn consumers in Germany they can only use the product in the following way, he can put the sticker on."
2016.15-1189,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1726.68,1728.62,"So in other words, the answer is yes."
2016.15-1189,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1731.61,1731.88,No.
2016.15-1189,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1746.82,1748.92,You mean you don't have to -- I didn't understand.
2016.15-1189,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1780.52,1785.91,"Typically, I think it -- it would be an express reservation in the sense of a ban on importation."
2016.15-1189,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1792.385,1795.905,Where and how would it be communicated to the buyer?
2016.15-1189,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1795.905,1804.28,"Well, the -- the initial buyer from the U.S. patentee would enter into a contract with the U.S. patentee, and presumably --"
2016.15-1189,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1804.28,1826.62,"And that -- and you agree you're for that, but that is very much contrary to what 300 years of restraints on alienation had in mind. One of the problems was that people who buy these things, namely, those who go into grocery store or whatever, don't know that they can't bring it back to the U.S., or they don't know that they can't do this or they can't do that or have to have the red sign or whatever."
2016.15-1189,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1828.96,1845.5,"Well, if you wanted -- first, at a certain level, anyone who buys patented products takes the chance that the person who sold those to him has no authority to do so or has transgressed the limits of his authority."
2016.15-1189,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1872.16,1879.29,What is the basis for this compromised position? Is this just a balancing of the policy considerations on both sides?
2016.15-1189,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1879.29,1888.19,"I mean, it's partly policy based, but it has -- to -- to the extent that there has been a rule in the lower courts, this has been the rule for the last hundred years."
2016.15-1189,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1892.65,1894.07,"Thank you, counsel. I'm sorry."
2016.15-1189,2,20165,constantine_l_trela_jr_,,1899.47,1921.93,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We agree with the government, at least in one sense, and that is that Judge Taranto's opinion for the Federal Circuit properly looked to the statute to find the origins and limits on the exhaustion doctrine. The Patent Act defines how patent rights can be acquired, what they cover, and how they are infringed."
2016.15-1189,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2117.025,2125.595,"Why -- why is normal contract law and normal State law inadequate, for your purposes?"
2016.15-1189,2,20165,constantine_l_trela_jr_,,2125.595,2149.315,"Well, here's why, and -- and, actually, I was just getting to that, Mr. Chief Justice. In the -- in the -- the microchip example, the -- the logical or the economically rational outcome, if you can enforce these restrictions, is to sell at a price that makes sense for the video camera maker, at a higher price that will make sense for the computer maker, because they're using more of the capabilities of -- of the new technology."
2016.15-1189,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2166.83,2169.305,Why can't you enforce the contract downstream?
2016.15-1189,2,20165,constantine_l_trela_jr_,,2169.305,2172.44,"Well, because you -- you don't have privity, Justice Breyer."
2016.15-1189,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2172.64,2179.685,"Then why don't you require the person who sells it to just resell it with the requirement that they promise not to, you know, whatever it is?"
2016.15-1189,2,20165,constantine_l_trela_jr_,,2179.685,2182.82,"Well, and that's, in effect, what -- what happens here."
2016.15-1189,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2186.8,2187.08,Sure.
2016.15-1189,2,20165,constantine_l_trela_jr_,,2207.985,2235.91,"Well, let me -- let me comment on that, because it's certainly true that that's what Lord Coke said in the 17th century, but there are a couple of points I'd like to make about that. One is what Lord Coke said in the quote that's in the Kirtsaeng opinion, for example, is that when someone sells his whole interest, he can impose no restraints because his whole interest is out of him. What we're talking about here is not selling your whole interest."
2016.15-1189,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2236.68,2238.44,This is the reserved question.
2016.15-1189,2,20165,constantine_l_trela_jr_,,2244.95,2249.28,"Well, that's your prerogative, of course. (Laughter.)"
2016.15-1189,2,20165,constantine_l_trela_jr_,,2249.28,2252.6,"What we're talking about here, of course, is not selling the whole interest."
2016.15-1189,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2300.85,2324.69,"There -- there -- there are quite -- I mean, I agree that there are all kinds of exceptions. But to go back to your basic point underlying this, of course, any monopolist, including a patent monopolist, would love to be able to go to each buyer separately and extract from each buyer and user the maximum amount he would pay for that particular item."
2016.15-1189,2,20165,constantine_l_trela_jr_,,2370.345,2385.345,"Well, and -- and on the Supreme Court precedent, let me go back to General Talking Pictures, which I started to talk about a few minutes ago. It's clear that a patent owner can limit the licenses it grants."
2016.15-1189,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2723.31,2741.505,"What about the argument on the other side about the complexity of the, you know, products with literally thousands of different patents, and if you're allowed to impose restraints down the line, it just gets too complicated and the consumer will be violating patents all the time without knowing it."
2016.15-1189,2,20165,constantine_l_trela_jr_,,2741.505,2746.39,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think, first of all, again, to the extent we're talking about consumers, it -- it --"
2016.15-1189,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2746.39,2746.7,Yeah.
2016.15-1189,2,20165,constantine_l_trela_jr_,,2746.7,2750.925,-- the -- the comments I made before I think apply no matter where the product started.
2016.15-1189,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2805.59,2808.57,"Well, there's a -- there a -- Nike, two things."
2016.15-1189,2,20165,constantine_l_trela_jr_,,2858.02,2864.78,"Justice Breyer, I don't -- I -- I don't think that that is the real problem."
2016.15-1189,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2972.83,2989.06,How about the point raised by your adversaries that having different rules with respect to copyright and patents will make -- will complicate the checking because many products have both copyright and patent.
2016.15-1189,2,20165,constantine_l_trela_jr_,,2989.06,3021.91,"There -- there is -- there's no question that there are different -- there -- there are a host of different rules for copyright and patent. And -- and one point I would start with, Justice Sotomayor, is that the -- the scope of copyright protection -- although the remedies may vary from country to country -- the scope of the protection is virtually identical to -- on -- in all the countries of the Berne Convention, which is virtually all of them. That is if -- you -- you don't have to guess about what is or is not subject to the copyright."
2016.15-1189,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3559.46,3564.935,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Pincus, you have four minutes remaining."
2016.15-1189,3,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3564.935,3582.1,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just -- just a couple of -- of -- of quick points. I think it's clear that what the Court was saying in the cases my friend averted to was the only remedy available is a -- is a contract remedy in Keeler and these other cases."
2016.15-1189,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3582.1,3583.205,The Hobby case.
2016.15-1189,3,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3583.205,3668.8,"In those -- in those cases. Exactly, Your Honor. And in fact, in -- in the Strauss case, the Court talked in particular about refusing to enforce these kinds of restrictions because they have been obnoxious from Lord Coke's day to our -- to our own. I wanted to talk about this -- this question of the -- the risk to the downstream resellers and buyers, because it's true, in patent law there always is some risk that the initial sale won't be authorized. But I think the difference between the two positions here is once there is an initial authorized sale, that's the end of the inquiry under the test that -- that we propose. Under my friend's test, even if there is an authorized sale, if there are these other restrictions, they continue to flow down, and therefore, the -- the group of downstream users and buyers who are subject to risk becomes much, much greater. On -- on the question of -- of patent and copyright, I think the critical point here is not that the laws differ from place to place, but with respect to an authorized first sale, it would be very sensible to have the same rule apply for authorized -- sales authorized by the U.S. rights holder overseas, for both patent and copyright, because then there would be certainty that once there was an authorized sale, both the patent and the copyright rights were exhausted."
2016.15-1189,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3716.56,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
