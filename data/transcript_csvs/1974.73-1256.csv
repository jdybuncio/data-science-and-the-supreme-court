1974.73-1256,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,38.578,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-1256, Connell Construction Company against Plumbers and Steamfitters."
1974.73-1256,0,29825,joseph_f_canterbury_jr,,39.858,43.22,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1256,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,250.801,260.49,Did Connell have any general policy of limiting its calls for business to non-union --
1974.73-1256,0,29825,joseph_f_canterbury_jr,,260.49,261.475,"No Your Honor, not at all."
1974.73-1256,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,406.158,415.63,"But Mr. Canterbury I gather, it's not just a contract between an employer and the Union, it's a contract between an employer and the Union and the construction industry."
1974.73-1256,0,29825,joseph_f_canterbury_jr,,415.63,416.387,"Correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-1256,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,416.387,421.32,"And there is special statutory provisions of government contracts of that kind, don't they?"
1974.73-1256,0,29825,joseph_f_canterbury_jr,,421.32,425.212,"Your Honor, you are referring to the proviso to Section 8 (e) of the Labor Act."
1974.73-1256,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,425.212,426.795,I think you have to deal with that concern?
1974.73-1256,0,29825,joseph_f_canterbury_jr,,426.795,430.686,"Yes, I would deal with that Your Honor, I certainly will."
1974.73-1256,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1308.367,1340.37,"Mr. Canterbury, when you say they made a employer-employee relationship, do I understand you to mean that it was intended that under the proviso, the first proviso, Section 8 (e) that such an agreement would be exempt from the language of 8 (e), only if the union that was making the agreement was the bargaining representative of employees with the contractor with whom it was making the agreement?"
1974.73-1256,0,29825,joseph_f_canterbury_jr,,1340.37,1340.66,That's exactly what I mean Your Honor.
1974.73-1256,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1340.66,1341.908,Is that what you mean here?
1974.73-1256,0,29825,joseph_f_canterbury_jr,,1341.908,1343.811,Exactly.
1974.73-1256,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1457.668,1462.179,"General Counsel has said why he doesn't file complaints, hasn't he?"
1974.73-1256,0,29825,joseph_f_canterbury_jr,,1462.179,1465.429,"Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan, he said -- he has given his reasons."
1974.73-1256,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1465.429,1470.778,He says that 8 (e) was intended to preserve the status quo of the constructions industry?
1974.73-1256,0,29825,joseph_f_canterbury_jr,,1470.778,1477.474,"Correct Your Honor, but let me just address myself to that quickly what the General Counsel, which his opinion --"
1974.73-1256,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1477.474,1480.177,"But I thought you said earlier, perhaps I misunderstood you."
1974.73-1256,0,29825,joseph_f_canterbury_jr,,1485.306,1486.323,"Oh, I beg your pardon."
1974.73-1256,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1487.515,1488.115,I am sorry.
1974.73-1256,0,29825,joseph_f_canterbury_jr,,1488.115,1490.563,"He has explained his reasons, but I am glad you have raised it."
1974.73-1256,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1586.275,1588.797,Mr. Richards.
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1588.797,1595.846,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1681.79,1685.237,Do you mean by that Mr. Richards there is no Allen-Bradley kind?
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1685.237,1686.691,No Allen-Bradley.
1974.73-1256,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1700.494,1714.32,"So there is no allegation, in other words, in the complaint that the union employers and the union have conspired to gang up on Connell?"
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1714.32,1715.275,None at all.
1974.73-1256,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1725.255,1731.586,It's purely a complaint by Connell on disagreement that was foisted on him by the union?
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1731.586,1733.268,"That's as I understand it, that's all."
1974.73-1256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1764.724,1767.864,"Declaratory and injunctive, Mr. Richards, you mean by that?"
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1767.864,1768.852,No damage claims.
1974.73-1256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1768.852,1771.969,"No damage claim, just to enjoin the enforcement of the contract?"
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1771.969,1772.624,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1256,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1785.259,1786.712,"Excuse me, I am sorry."
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1789.186,1790.699,The injunction against the picketing in the state court --
1974.73-1256,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1790.699,1805.282,"Under the State antitrust law and then you removed it to the Federal Court and then the Federal Court declined it and sent it back to State Court and then the complaint was amended to add a count of Federal antitrust law, is that it?"
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1805.282,1813.517,"Yes, Your Honor with one -- and Connell at the point, the case was not remanded."
1974.73-1256,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1825.175,1825.616,Well --
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1825.616,1827.758,I am glad to say is it finally when you need well.
1974.73-1256,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1833.478,1834.122,Entered the agreement?
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1834.122,1840.047,"Entered the agreement, then challenged it under, amended his complaint to challenge it under the Sherman Act."
1974.73-1256,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1851.161,1854.288,"Well, of course his claim is he was coerced into the agreement?"
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1854.288,1855.772,He was clearly coerced into the agreement.
1974.73-1256,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1856.079,1862.26,"If he is right, I suppose he would be coerced into not rescinding it, isn't that right?"
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1862.26,1864.74,"[Attempt to Laughter] Clearly, he was coerced into the agreement, there is no question of that."
1974.73-1256,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1864.74,1873.648,"Well, and if he terminated to without any coercion, he would be back where he was at the beginning?"
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1873.648,1875.502,Exactly.
1974.73-1256,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1881.444,1887.455,"As far as dealing with anyone, unless your union approved them?"
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1887.455,1890.864,"Well, we would be back where we were and perhaps in the midst of the dispute."
1974.73-1256,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1893.32,1898.515,"Well, was there any inaccuracy in my saying --?"
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1898.515,1901.656,"No, no and I didn't mean it imply that there was."
1974.73-1256,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1908.497,1911.071,"And if they did picket, their whole operation --"
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1911.071,1914.713,"That certainly would have affect on their operations, no question about that."
1974.73-1256,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1962.029,1964.549,He wouldn't have problems on the say to he -- ?
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1964.549,1967.163,"Well, if there were other contractor sites."
1974.73-1256,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1982.228,1990.727,"Is there in this case any claim that Connell is contracting out, farming out work which could be done within his own establishment?"
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1990.727,1993.933,"That was not the contention, no."
1974.73-1256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2004.108,2011.776,"But Mr. Richards the fact of life is that if he brought a non-union sub-contractor on the site, the whole project would shut down."
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2013.483,2024.552,"Well, the fact of life is, that in the past if non-union sub-contractors appeared at a project, local 100 would picket the non-union sub-contractor and that would frequently shut down the project, that's exactly right."
1974.73-1256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2031.677,2032.293,Union contract?
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2032.293,2035.57,Exactly.
1974.73-1256,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2035.57,2041.196,"Not only union contractors, but contractors with this union, or am I -- ?"
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2041.196,2059.966,"Well, that's correct this union, but there is one other fact of life, I guess, in the construction industry that is that trade pass lines which as far as I am aware this is the only union that claims jurisdiction in the Dallas area for performing plumbing and steam-fitting work."
1974.73-1256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2062.71,2063.449,(Voice Overlap) over this?
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2063.449,2068.295,"No, there is no competing union vying for this representation because that's the nature of industry."
1974.73-1256,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2068.295,2070.536,Would it make any difference if there were?
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2070.536,2072.498,"Well, it makes some difference as far as the Labor Board."
1974.73-1256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2119.664,2127.154,"Do I understand Mr. Richards, really what you say this is something exclusively for the cognizance of the National Labor Relations Board?"
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2127.154,2127.833,We have said
1974.73-1256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2127.833,2151.649,"That the dispute is -- and that if it is arguably that, that precludes any antitrust or any other, and if the board were to find that in some respects you were not protected by the proviso, then the board has to pursue its remedies which are, as I would call it injunction or Connell has a 303 action for damages."
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2151.649,2160.143,We do say that this dispute is totally invalid by the provisions of Section 8 (b) (4) (a) of the act which either protects it or prohibits it.
1974.73-1256,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2194.233,2207.553,"Perhaps Mr. Richards anything related to draw that to our attention would be to leave the copies with the clerk and with your friend and because I suspect, November 7, it wouldn't be available in the service yet."
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2207.553,2209.382,"No, it's not yet in the services."
1974.73-1256,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2385.42,2393.58,I thought this -- that you said a moment ago that there was no doubt of the coercion involved here as against Connell?
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2393.58,2396.902,"In the official obtaining of the agreement, I meant to say."
1974.73-1256,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2396.902,2399.389,"Well, what form was the coercion?"
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2399.389,2404.467,It took the form of picketing by local 100 to secure this agreement.
1974.73-1256,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2404.467,2409.51,But then I thought you said a minute ago and perhaps I misunderstand to say that the 8 (e) doesn't allow that sort of picketing?
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2409.51,2410.663,I am sorry.
1974.73-1256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2441.017,2446.098,"And you said you seek to enforce it by whom, brought by whom?"
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2446.098,2448.671,Local 100 in this instance wanted to enforce this agreement.
1974.73-1256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2454.176,2466.923,"That's to be distinguished from the NLRB suit where there has been a violation found, where there has been no protection of the proviso, is that it?"
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2466.923,2467.496,Exactly.
1974.73-1256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2479.172,2481.583,In that circumstance Connell will have a 303 action against -- ?
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2481.583,2486.26,And Connell will have a resulting 303 damage action for any injuries that he suffers as a consequence.
1974.73-1256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2486.26,2494.447,"But if it violated the National Labor Relations Act, it would also lose its defense under the antitrust act, wouldn't it?"
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2494.447,2496.674,I wouldn't think so.
1974.73-1256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2502.145,2503.495,But exclusive remedy is?
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2503.495,2516.432,"Well, [Attempt to Laughter] I am not sure if I want to say -- I do want to say that clearly in our view the determination of Sherman Act violation doesn't turn upon whether or not it's protected or prohibited by Taft-Hartley."
1974.73-1256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2555.058,2558.833,I would like to get this -- your decision clear about this Mr. Richards.
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2589.185,2590.189,I'm sorry.
1974.73-1256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2602.077,2605.69,And intended thereby to exclude any antitrust sanctions?
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2605.69,2610.008,"That's the clear message, it seems to me, in the congressional history of the statute."
1974.73-1256,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2610.811,2627.106,"But you say then of there is any remedy under the National Labor Relations Act against the union for its conduct, the fact that such a remedy exists under the National Labor Relation Act, precludes a remedy under the antitrust act across the board?"
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2627.106,2628.222,"On the facts this case, yes."
1974.73-1256,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2628.222,2629.482,"Well, but I meant to the facts of this case?"
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2629.482,2643.047,"Well, what I'm trying to say, it's conceivable to me if you are dealing with this as one part of broader overall Allen-Bradley kind of conspiracy, you would have the kind of case in which there could perhaps involve antitrust action, but that is not what we are dealing with."
1974.73-1256,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2652.938,2657.554,But you don't take that position categorically with respect to any conceivable violation?
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2657.554,2661.067,"No, of course not as to any conceivable violation, I do not."
1974.73-1256,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2665.835,2683.136,"If the union had agreed with the multi-employer bargaining unit to attempt to use its best efforts to get these kinds of agreements from one unionized general contractors, you might have a little tougher case here, I suppose?"
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2683.136,2690.494,"If this case was embellished with any claim of a conspiracy or predatory purpose, it would be a different case."
1974.73-1256,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2691.894,2697.499,"Of course, if everything might be different, what would be the result under the antitrust law?"
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2697.499,2698.82,"Well, I suppose --"
1974.73-1256,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2698.82,2703.403,Even though it might be perfectly vulnerable under the labor law?
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2716.452,2725.689,I cannot exclude the possibility that a fact situation could exist that involved this agreement law with other aspects which would give rise to antitrust violation.
1974.73-1256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2764.577,2774.807,Mr. Richard do you have a antitrust problem here if the Favored Nation Clause were in the case?
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2774.807,2777.945,I do not – my own view of it is Connell would not be a position to complain about it.
1974.73-1256,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2803.921,2808.406,"There were actually two contracts involved in this case, weren't there?"
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2866.817,2871.346,Well first there is no evidence of that in this record.
1974.73-1256,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2892.854,2894.118,That is the benefit to the union --
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2894.118,2902.232,That is the direct benefit and that is what we were dealing with here.
1974.73-1256,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2950.837,2953.357,I see the union's interest very clearly.
1974.73-1256,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2963.915,2975.356,Well there is no suggestion that we were trying to create a monopoly for that favored group in this record; and that was the nature of the contention.
