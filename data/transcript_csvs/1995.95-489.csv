1995.95-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.599,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-489, the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. Federal Election Commission."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,12.361,13.152,That is correct.
1995.95-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,13.152,13.751,Mr. Baran.
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,13.751,17.584,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1995.95-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,99.657,110.706,"Well, Mr. Baran, I thought there was another possible question here, which is whether the statute as presently drafted covers this expenditure at all."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,152.622,164.119,"If the Court reached such a decision, Justice O'Connor, it would still leave section 441a(d) as limiting some form of speech, speech by my client."
1995.95-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,164.119,171.646,"Well, it would, but what do you think our doctrines are on reaching constitutional issues unnecessarily?"
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,171.646,196.161,"I believe that in prior cases involving restrictions on campaign speech the Court has addressed specific statutory limitations, including, of course, most expansively in the Buckley decision, but it did so also in the NCPAC decision in terms of evaluating a particular statute under a declaratory judgment request by a party such as my client."
1995.95-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,196.161,217.497,"You had a separate counterclaim asking for declaratory judgment and making a facial attack on the statute so that even if we found against the Government's claim, against the Republican Party, we would still have to adjudicate the disposition that was made of your claim against the Commission, which was a facial challenge, as I gather."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,217.497,219.437,"Yes, Justice Scalia, that is our position."
1995.95-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,229.342,238.869,"And your grievance here is not just that you were punished for this violation, but you don't think you should be subject in the future to this provision at all."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,238.869,239.95,"Yes, that is--"
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,239.95,253.949,"For purposes of the counterclaim, is it your position that subsection (d) covers any expenditure that the party might make which is not a coordinated expenditure?"
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,253.949,280.606,"--That is the interpretation of the statute that we have agreed with the Government on, that this limitation as it was intended, and certainly as it is applied by the Federal Election Commission, applies to both coordinated contributions which are, in fact, coordinated with the candidate and also contributions that may not factually be proved to be coordinated."
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,280.606,285.879,"Well, I thought the Government's position was that all of your expenditures were coordinated."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,285.879,289.482,"As a de jure matter, yes."
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,289.482,289.742,Yes.
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,291.034,298.799,"Well, we concur with the congressional judgment that a de jure coordination is good policy, because it precludes what would otherwise--"
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,298.799,303.283,"No, but I just want to know what your position is in the litigation under your facial challenge."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,310.746,312.068,"--As a matter of law, yes."
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,313.948,319.931,Well... I'm not quite sure where I go from there.
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,319.931,320.442,"Well, we--"
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,320.442,320.783,If it's a matter of--
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,324.746,332.1,"--Well, we have what everyone seems to acknowledge is a unique relationship with candidates."
1995.95-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,333.422,337.473,"Yes, but I thought you took the position here that this wasn't a coordinated expenditure."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,349.842,361.79,"--We have pointed out in our briefs, Justice O'Connor, that whether... there was no inquiry by the Federal Election Commission as to whether or not this particular expenditure was coordinated."
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,361.79,362.971,"No, but this is the facial challenge."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,377.241,378.821,"We accept that proposition, Justice Souter."
1995.95-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,378.821,385.035,"Well, Mr. Baran, you can't just walk in off the street and make a facial challenge to a statute."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,388.638,399.003,"Well, I don't believe there's any dispute that my client, the Colorado Republican Party, wishes to and indeed does engage in express advocacy in support of its candidates."
1995.95-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,399.003,408.132,"But you say even though we find the statute wouldn't apply to the activities that you've been challenged on here, nonetheless you can challenge it facially?"
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,408.132,417.856,I believe that the declaratory judgment procedure has afforded parties... allows them to raise a claim that seeks--
1995.95-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,417.856,422.341,"Yes, but you have to have some sort of standing to challenge a statute even facially."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,422.341,435.497,"--Well, we are a State committee, as defined by this statute, which specifically applies to State political parties and specifically limits our ability to spend money for some defined speech."
1995.95-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,436.339,451.039,"In this case you did not name... you did not name the Democratic candidate that you were opposing because the Democratic candidate hadn't been... or the Republican candidate that you were favoring because the Republican candidate hadn't even been named yet, isn't that right?"
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,458.893,461.505,--That was the claim in the district court when we made the--
1995.95-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,461.505,462.516,And this provision would prevent it.
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,462.516,470.331,--I don't think there's any dispute that this provision would apply to us or any other State committee that wished to engage in covered speech.
1995.95-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,470.331,478.587,Even if you won... even if you won with respect to the as applied challenge.
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,478.587,478.835,Yes.
1995.95-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,478.835,487.303,"Even if you won with that, you'd still be subject to the limitation that you cannot support a Republican candidate except within the limitations of 421(d)."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,487.303,488.345,That is correct.
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,488.345,498.663,"But even if you made the expenditure that Justice Scalia referred to, you still take the position that it may be treated, as the Government says, as a coordinated expenditure."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,498.663,499.134,Yes.
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,500.773,528.552,"Does it follow from that... and I'm not sure that I'm understanding the terms that everybody uses, so forgive a question that maybe I shouldn't have to ask, but does it follow from your position that if everything that you might expend should be treated as a coordinated expenditure, that therefore every expenditure you make should be treated for constitutional purposes as a contribution to someone?"
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,528.552,535.615,It's our position that it should be evaluated in two ways.
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,545.563,547.896,"No, but I thought we've gotten beyond that."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,573.722,580.835,"--It should be treated for constitutional purposes under the strict scrutiny that this Court requires, whether--"
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,580.835,583.797,"Well, how about a yes or no answer?"
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,585.878,594.125,--We don't believe that it should be treated as a contribution in terms of a shorthand resolution of whether or not this satisfies First Amendment--
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,594.125,614.028,"Then explain to me the sense of coordinated expenditure that you're using, because I take it you are not using coordinated expenditure to mean coordinated with a particular named candidate, because at the time in question here, and I suppose at other times, there won't be one, so in what sense is it a coordinated expenditure?"
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,614.028,623.725,"--I believe the answer, Justice Souter, is that it's a coordinated expenditure by virtue of the predicament or situation that political parties in... are in that no one else is in."
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,623.725,626.907,"No, but tell me what you mean by coordinated expenditure."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,631.399,638.294,"Well, as I'm using the term, it can be in two contexts, because they are used interchangeably."
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,654.854,657.094,"But that didn't happen in this case, I take it."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,657.094,658.096,--Er--
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,658.096,659.498,There wasn't any candidate.
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,659.498,666.902,"--There were three nameless candidates which were referred to in the record, and which are cited in the passages of the Government--"
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,666.902,680.75,"Well, would it be proper in this case, then, and hence in considering the facial challenge, to consider the expenditure as being coordinated with them and to treat them as candidates?"
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,680.75,681.361,"--Yes, Justice--"
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,681.361,681.661,Would that be fair?
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,681.661,682.442,"--Yes, I think--"
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,682.442,682.722,All right.
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,687.615,688.096,--Mm hmm.
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,688.096,712.043,"--Then why isn't it the case that every expenditure that would be subject to your facial challenge is one which for constitutional purposes should be treated as a contribution, from which it would follow that, in judging the facial validity of the statute, we're really talking about a statute that regulates contributions rather than expenditures."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,715.884,724.292,I don't believe that the contributions expenditure dichotomy that's articulated in Buckley falls neatly into this type of situation--
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,724.292,725.141,"Well, then I'm--"
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,725.141,725.952,--by virtue of our--
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,725.952,750.097,"--I'm just having trouble understanding the argument, because I thought you had... you have agreed that it's a coordinated expenditure, that it's coordinated in the sense that it is to be attributed at least to the three, or perhaps to the ultimate winner of the three, and I don't see, once you get to that point, why we're not, for constitutional purposes, talking about contributions, and hence the challenge goes to... is a challenge to a limit on contributions."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,753.49,757.782,"--It can be viewed in that light, Justice Souter."
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,763.265,765.067,"Well, it... I'm not saying what the conclusion is."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,765.067,765.678,I understand that.
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,765.678,775.193,"I'm just saying, what is the problem about which we must come to a conclusion, and it seems to me that, based upon the premises that you agree to, it must be a problem about contributions."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,775.193,804.805,"I would say that it could be in the same context as a limit by... on a candidate which, of course, was reviewed by this Court in Buckley, and whether the candidate spends his or her own money, or whether a candidate does it in coordination with his or her campaign committee doesn't seem to have any constitutional significance once the analysis is conducted of strict scrutiny regarding what kind of speech and what kind of spending is affected by the restriction."
1995.95-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,804.805,807.238,"We reserved this precise question in Buckley, did we not?"
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,807.238,809.569,"I believe that is correct, Justice Scalia."
1995.95-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,809.569,817.034,"So evidently we did not deem that, if it is considered a contribution, that's an end of the matter."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,817.034,821.658,"That would be our position and, obviously, our hope, Justice Scalia."
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,827.251,833.435,"I take it it's your position that even if it is treated as a contribution, the limit is still unconstitutional."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,844.242,861.293,"I think it presents difficulty either way because of the nature of the party, the nature of what is being limited here, and it's still... there's no other participant in political debate, or politics, that is in our shoes, none."
1995.95-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,865.477,867.075,Not only not a political action committee.
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,869.278,871.541,They do not nominate candidates.
1995.95-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,889.964,891.876,"So it's like a candidate expenditure, you're saying."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,891.876,906.746,"--I believe the closest analogy to this limit is with respect to the relationship of a candidate to his or her own campaign, and the campaign is the candidate's own effort."
1995.95-489,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,917.202,928.73,"But there's this difference, is there not, Mr. Baran, that one who contributes to the candidate is not thereafter blocked from also contributing to the party, so you can't just put them all in the same pot."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,928.73,942.139,--I believe that there... the candidates are... in their campaigns have to raise their money subject to contribution limits and all the same prohibitions.
1995.95-489,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,942.139,951.303,If I cede my... if I make up to the limit my contribution to the candidate I can nonetheless make an independent contribution to the party without exceeding the candidate limit.
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,951.303,958.109,"Only if you do not designate or condition your contribution to the party, and there is a specific provision--"
1995.95-489,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,958.109,958.529,Yes.
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,958.529,970.339,"--that says that you cannot go to the party and say, I would like to give you now my $5,000, and I would like it to be used only for the benefit of Candidate Smith, who already has received my $1,000 contribution."
1995.95-489,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,970.339,981.085,"But let's assume we're already into the election season, the candidate has been nominated, is being sponsored by the party, I make my contribution to the candidate, I can make another contribution to the party."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,981.085,997.375,"As a statutory matter, Justice Ginsburg, I believe that this restriction on contributions of that sort apply at all times, and cannot be earmarked for the benefit of any candidate without counting towards the contributor's $1,000 contribution limit."
1995.95-489,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,997.375,1003.93,"Yes, but I'm just trying to establish the basic point that they're not one and the same."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,1015.758,1017.969,That is correct.
1995.95-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1017.969,1019.02,But there's a limit on the party.
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,1019.02,1020.392,There is a limit... it was--
1995.95-489,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1020.392,1021.642,A limit on the amount you can give to the party.
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,1021.642,1023.024,"--I'm sorry, I didn't--"
1995.95-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1023.024,1024.844,Isn't there a limit on the amount you can give to the party?
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,1024.844,1026.156,"--Yes, there are limits."
1995.95-489,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1072.617,1078.75,It does remain under your theory that... you say the political party is unique.
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,1117.014,1119.876,"I don't believe that is the case, Justice Kennedy."
1995.95-489,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1197.188,1199.248,But maybe it should work the other way.
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,1214.029,1237.944,"--I'm not aware of any precedent that characterizes political party speech as the State's speech, in that we are actually speaking for ourselves and our adherents, and hopefully with the support of the candidates who have agreed to associate with us and to run for public office."
1995.95-489,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1237.944,1242.828,"But that's even more true of private groups, organizations that contribute through PAC's, is it not?"
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,1242.828,1274.589,"Well, each group is going to have to be evaluated in terms of how they relate to the compelling Government interest that is being advanced to justify what everyone has to acknowledge is a restriction on our speech, and to that extent, is the relationship of a political party in terms of its activities different than that of a PAC, is it different from that of a corporation or a union or an individual contributor?"
1995.95-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1311.817,1311.915,Well--
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,1311.915,1313.497,--to the public you become subject to this limit.
1995.95-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1313.497,1322.022,"--In exchange for not being subject to the other limit... and you want to get out of this one and not get into the other one, right?"
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,1322.022,1322.282,Well--
1995.95-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1322.282,1327.746,"I mean, there are other limits that apply to PAC's which the Government has tried to present its case as presenting that one--"
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,1327.746,1330.428,"--Well, we are put in the--"

1995.95-489,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1423.871,1440.935,"Mr. Baran, there's a basic question I wonder if you would indulge, and that is, you have conceded, I think, that the statute calls this a coordinated expenditure, and it ranks it specifically as a contribution."
1995.95-489,0,29078,jan_w_baran,,1456.683,1466.469,"I believe that even as a contribution under this situation, the Government has not justified this burden, and it would have to be declared unconstitutional."

1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1578.726,1589.835,"That's correct, and the Federal Election Commission has pointed out that there's nothing in the act that requires that there have been a nominee selected before this principle applies."

1995.95-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1636.585,1650.343,"--But the party's point here is that if you regard it as an entirely separate entity from the candidate, yes, you can view it as a contribution, but the party is itself running, in a way."
1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1663.693,1677.813,"Well, I understand their position, but this Court has held that if we're talking about contribution limits, Congress had a compelling justification for imposing such limitations in order to prevent corruption or the appearance of corruption."

1995.95-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1730.666,1731.067,I don't think too much.

1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1768.793,1792.118,"--I do acknowledge that, but this Court in the California Medical Association case was confronted with the same argument, that the PAC there served as a buffer, or a filter, between contributions by the medical association to the candidate, and this Court rejected that argument and nevertheless saw that as a problem for preventing evasion of the limitations on individual contributions."
1995.95-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1792.118,1804.697,But in Massachusetts Citizens for Life the Court narrowed a reading of the statute because it felt that not for profit corporations were in a different position than corporations for profit.
1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1804.697,1805.858,Yes.
1995.95-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1807.259,1816.224,So we have accounted for differences in... factual differences with... either... different readings of the statute.

1995.95-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1851.95,1856.872,--That construction was given because a nonprofit corporation was involved.
1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1862.726,1881.366,"That's certainly correct, but Mr. Chief Justice, what the party... what the petitioners are arguing for here is an unlimited right to spend funds that are coordinated either in fact or in theory, without any of the limitations that presently exist under the act."

1995.95-489,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1946.669,1949.491,So what is the line at which this statute starts to run?
1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1956.127,1972.986,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I don't know whether there's any precise temporal point, but one can imagine an ad run by the party with respect to Tim Wirth that says, we disagree with Tim Wirth's position and by the way, he's likely to run for the Senate and therefore we want you to know about this."
1995.95-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2007.892,2031.125,"General Days, isn't your argument broad enough, though, that if the morning after this senatorial election was over the Republican Party in Colorado started running advertisements generally favoring Republicans and disfavoring Democrats... there's not going... there isn't going to be another election for at least 2 years."

1995.95-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2041.183,2051.629,"Then how do we draw this line, because I mean, I thought your answer to Justice Ginsburg might be, well, there's no line to be drawn, but if there is going to be one to be drawn, how do we draw it, or how does the FEC draw it?"

1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2072.362,2077.105,"They're viewed as expenditures but they're not coordinated, because there's no one to be coordinated with."

1995.95-489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2462.671,2463.382,--as interpreted.
1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2463.382,2463.722,Yes.

1995.95-489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2505.279,2505.939,Well--
1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2505.939,2507.681,--as to how that operates here.
1995.95-489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2507.681,2513.533,"--That would leave room for lots of independent expenditures, in my view, and maybe it leaves open all negative ads--"

1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2528.035,2553.381,"--Yes, but I think, Justice O'Connor, what the Federal Election Commission has done in interpreting the act has 1) concluded that any expenditures are coordinated expenditures and are contributions, and then what we have in 4a(d)(3) is really an authorization for the parties to spend more money than any other entity can, or it could under the regular provisions of the act."
1995.95-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2604.365,2607.317,Going back to 441a(d)(3) that Justice O'Connor just asked you about--

1995.95-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2608.206,2614.591,--it says a political party may not make an expenditure in connection with the general election campaign.
1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2625.348,2642.57,"Mr. Chief Justice, I suppose one could read it that way, but we come back to the role of the Commission in the scheme, and the Commission is entrusted by the act with the responsibility for interpreting the act and enforcing it."
1995.95-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2642.57,2649.944,"Well, when you're dealing with the First Amendment, I think some of our cases say that even an agency interpreting the act has to go kind of slowly."
1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2649.944,2659.872,"Well, that's certainly the case, but there's nothing in the act that suggests that the reading that you are proposing is the correct reading."
1995.95-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2659.872,2672.81,"But if you ask people on the street what do you mean when you say the general election campaign has started, I think you would say, a lot of people would say, well, it's when the two major parties have chosen their candidates."
1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2676.111,2689.56,I think the reality that the Congress was looking at and that the Commission has viewed suggests that there should be a larger room for the applicability of 441a(d)(3).
1995.95-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2689.56,2690.892,"Well, it doesn't say during the general election campaign anyway."

1995.95-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2692.883,2697.084,You can spend money before that campaign begins that's directed to that campaign as far as the text is concerned.

1995.95-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2762.528,2762.898,But it can't resolve this case.

1995.95-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2782.255,2783.074,You think we should just--
1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2783.074,2791.882,"--I think that we have volunteers all over the place, Justice Stevens, who might in some future set of circumstances want to do something that the law does not allow."
1995.95-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2791.882,2792.661,--So you say they have no standing.

1995.95-489,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2816.195,2822.37,"--You say they have no right controversy because they've never... although in theory they could certainly not give the money to the national party, they--"
1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2822.37,2822.61,--That's right.
1995.95-489,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2823.742,2824.531,--So it's premature.
1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2824.531,2825.692,--Absolutely.

1995.95-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2890.874,2908.827,"Well, where does your corruption argument go, because I thought your strongest corruption argument was that if you declare the statute unconstitutional in effect they can make a bypass of the limitation on contributions to candidates, and now you're saying, I think, no, they couldn't do that."
1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2908.827,2909.677,No.
1995.95-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2926.328,2926.698,Well--
1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2926.698,2932.382,--the fact that Congress viewed that as an exception to the otherwise--

1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2938.677,2948.582,"--Well, the end run argument has to do with the fact that they would be allowed to make unlimited contributions to the candidate, but that does not necessarily follow."
1995.95-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2948.582,2951.634,"Okay, so that's... you're not resting your position on that--"

1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2974.68,2974.871,--Yes.
1995.95-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2974.871,2980.645,"That assumes that if subsection (3) falls, subsection (1) remains."
1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2982.174,2982.415,That is in--
1995.95-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2982.415,2983.476,--Is it your position--

1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2985.147,2988.259,441a(a) is... if we're talking about the same provision.
1995.95-489,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2988.259,2989.411,Yes.
1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2993.133,2993.494,Yes.
1995.95-489,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2993.494,2995.435,And then you're back to the beginning of the statute.

1995.95-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3006.241,3006.532,Right.
1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3006.532,3006.822,Of course.

1995.95-489,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3008.104,3009.774,I thought you were talking about the major statute.
