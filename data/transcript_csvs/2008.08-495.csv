2008.08-495,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,3.868,We will hear argument first this morning in Nijhawan v. Holder.
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,7.487,26.131,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: At issue in this case is an aggravated felony definition, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), one that serves both as a ground of deportation and as an integral part of a Federal criminal statute."
2008.08-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,109.719,110.204,Another--
2008.08-495,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,110.204,111.504,Under the time-honored--
2008.08-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,111.504,112.856,"--No, please."
2008.08-495,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,112.856,129.366,"--Under the time-honored approach, if the jury verdict necessarily -- or not necessarily, but did in fact refer to the amount involved and it was over $10,000, would that be part of the time-honored approach and then the statute would be fulfilled?"
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,129.366,132.485,"I -- under those circumstances, Justice Kennedy, yes."
2008.08-495,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,138.655,156.7,"Well, in that connection, at some point in the argument -- and you may be a little early because you're talking about the statute -- I'd like to know either anecdotally from your experience or -- or because it's written somewhere, how often do juries give special verdicts?"
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,177.114,178.732,"Well, I -- I--"
2008.08-495,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,178.732,181.85,But you may reach that after you've talked about the statute.
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,181.85,191.79,"--Yes, but let me -- certainly among the State statutes that we cite, the State statutes where it's clear that a loss amount is an element, the jury is going to be instructed they have to return that, and they do."
2008.08-495,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,213.869,227.527,"And if you -- if you do extend that lifeline to the government, aren't you conceding that the amount of the loss is not an element of the offense, and aren't you conceding that it is not necessary for the loss amount to be an element of the offense?"
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,227.527,229.462,"--No, Justice Alito."
2008.08-495,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,252.677,254.21,"Well, let me give you a concrete example."
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,288.833,289.767,"--In those cases, no."
2008.08-495,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,293.385,293.852,In this--
2008.08-495,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,293.852,294.102,And then--
2008.08-495,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,294.102,299.206,"--In this case, how many of the defendants were alien?"
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,308.562,313.632,"I believe two in addition to Mr. Nijhawan, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.08-495,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,329.058,340.866,Then the judge wouldn't distinguish -- it would not be relevant for the -- for the defendants who were not aliens because it would have no consequences for them.
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,361.696,373.337,"Well, under -- under those -- under those circumstances, Justice Ginsburg, Mr. Nijhawan actually himself had asked for a charge with -- with respect to loss."
2008.08-495,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,403.873,410.962,"But before you go on to that, we're talking about (M)(i)."
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,441.815,450.771,"Well, actually, Justice Ginsburg, under this Court's decision in Boulware, a deficiency is indeed a necessary element of that--"
2008.08-495,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,450.771,453.039,"A deficiency, but not the amount of the deficiency."
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,453.039,453.473,--But -- no.
2008.08-495,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,463.662,466.531,But is the amount -- there's a deficiency.
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,476.071,478.288,"--No, it doesn't have to find that, but it may."
2008.08-495,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,526.521,541.514,"--What is the -- What is the difference between a defendant's saying during a guilty plea colloquy, the loss was -- I admit the loss was more than $10,000; and the defendant's agreeing for sentencing purposes that the loss was more than $10,000?"
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,541.514,559.642,"--Because, Justice Alito, in the sentencing context we're truly dealing with a post-verdict situation where the government in terms of having to prove loss is up against a far lesser amount -- a far more liberal standard, a preponderance of the evidence standard."
2008.08-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,562.177,564.977,"Well, if he's admitting it, what does the standard of the evidence matter?"
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,564.977,569.764,"--He's admitting it here, Justice Souter, under these circumstances."
2008.08-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,576.937,582.072,"Well, he's not saying, I admit to a degree of preponderance of the evidence that it was over 10,000."
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,588.293,596.832,"--No, but he's -- but he's doing this in the context of resolving, of resolving a disputed issue with respect to--"
2008.08-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,596.832,598.517,And he definitively resolves it by admission.
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,598.517,607.956,"--But he does so certainly in the context here of reserving, of reserving his right to contest that and to make the arguments that we're making here."
2008.08-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,607.956,611.241,"No, I understand the facts of this case."
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,619.847,634.071,"No, I submit -- I submit that there -- there really is a -- a profound difference under the circumstances of someone being in a situation before, before conviction, and then someone being in a postconviction situation."
2008.08-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,648.497,668.411,"All right, that really gets to the question that I was going to ask, and that is, I don't see how the modified categorical approach is something that you could admit would be sufficient because, as I understand your argument -- and it is in part an argument based on sort of standard grammatical construction -- you're saying that in the definition"
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,715.775,721.212,I don't think necessarily.
2008.08-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,746.428,747.113,"Okay, how about this one."
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,764.658,771.645,"Certainly if it does, then under the statutes involved here we would prevail."
2008.08-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,771.645,779.668,"Well, yeah, you would prevail, but you would prevail, it seems to me, at the expense of this objection, and the government makes it."
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,829.351,836.187,"Well, I think the government vastly understates the statutory provisions that were involved here."
2008.08-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,853.466,865.357,"Well, once you get into the State statutes you get into the further problem of an utter and I would suppose unjust patchwork of statutory reference to which this would apply."
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,879.966,886.52,"--But what Congress has done here is to provide for a uniform test, in effect."
2008.08-495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,886.52,898.678,A uniform test that produces both unjust results and I would suppose strangely unsatisfying results to a Congress that wanted to expand the concept of deportable offense.
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,898.678,907.851,"But what -- but what -- if I can just go back for a moment, Justice Souter, to the original premise that it under all circumstances has to be an element."
2008.08-495,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,923.71,929.097,"But the problem is that there's no pattern to it, The point that Justice Souter made."
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,977.113,993.973,"What -- Justice Ginsburg, I think what Congress did here was to create a uniform test, a uniform test in the sense you look to see if -- if someone has been convicted of both these requirements, fraud or deceit or the loss."
2008.08-495,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,998.943,1003.062,But it's treating people who do the identical thing differently.
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,1003.062,1022.326,"--But Congress chose under these circumstances, Congress chose under these circumstances to -- swept broadly to, swept broadly to State statutes in addition, in addition, in addition to, in addition to encompassing the Federal statute."
2008.08-495,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1022.326,1040.353,"But what you're saying is you're not denying that people who commit the identical theft or deceit or fraud will be treated differently depending on whether the statute under which they're convicted has this ""in which"" clause?"
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,1040.353,1058.499,"What I believe, what I believe that I am conceding is that it will determine -- as with any of the criminal cases that lead to deportation, it will determine -- it will be determined on the basis of how the prosecution chooses -- excuse me -- chooses to charge."
2008.08-495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1058.499,1059.115,Mr. Moseley--
2008.08-495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1059.115,1062.351,"Mr. Moseley, can I get your help on a question I really have difficulty with."
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,1096.19,1104.796,"The -- the statute -- the statute says that someone has to be convicted of -- of both these aspects, both of--"
2008.08-495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1104.796,1107.332,But the statute doesn't say anything about conviction.
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,1107.332,1121.222,"--If, Justice Stevens, if you read it in conjunction with the conviction requirement -- in other words, to -- to be deportable, to be deportable, that's in -- in 6a."
2008.08-495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1131.697,1147.873,"--I don't -- I don't understand how you squeeze your -- your modified categorical approach, which seems to be a deus ex machina which is intended to blunt the government's argument that very few statutes would be covered by this."
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,1191.586,1203.626,"--I think under those circumstances, though, particularly if you look at the statutes which make gradations of sentencing on the basis of loss amounts, you clearly would be convicted of that."
2008.08-495,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1244.286,1247.322,"Can we go back to my question, which I don't think you've fully answered?"
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,1268.586,1275.508,"Well, the jury -- under those circumstances, it will depend upon how the government chooses, Justice Ginsburg, to prosecute the case."
2008.08-495,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1289.732,1290.284,I know.
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,1303.925,1309.663,"Well, they -- they are -- they are meant to operate the same way."
2008.08-495,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1334.38,1357.06,"Did you have any authority for the -- the idea that a trial judge in a criminal case should ask the jury to answer a special interrogatory regarding a question that has no bearing on the conviction, but may have a bearing on the future immigration status of the defendant, which is what you're suggesting should be done in these tax cases?"
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,1357.06,1377.54,"What -- what I am suggesting in the tax case is that it would be perfectly appropriate for the government to seek such a special interrogatory if they wish to establish the tax loss, which is an element of the -- which is a necessary component of the offense, if they wanted to establish it -- if they wanted to establish it for -- for purposes -- for whatever purpose they wanted to establish it."
2008.08-495,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1377.54,1384.127,"But I can see that if there are multiple defendants in the case, some of the defendants might say that this is unnecessary, it's inflammatory."
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,1384.127,1397.287,"That's -- that's -- that -- again, that is going to depend on -- that's going to depend upon how the government chooses to -- to prosecute under these particular--"
2008.08-495,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1397.287,1399.787,But all that just underscores the fact that--
2008.08-495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1399.787,1409.845,--your earlier -- your earlier assertion that it was necessary to -- that -- that it would be necessary to get that -- that amount specified for sentencing purposes is simply not true.
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,1421.402,1422.035,"--No, I--"
2008.08-495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1422.035,1429.156,"So if you don't have a jury determination, you can still sentence on the basis of the amount taken, even though that was not found by the jury."
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,1429.156,1430.674,--I -- I understand.
2008.08-495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1564.278,1572.284,I hope in rebuttal you'll address the argument about deferring to the agency's finding about what it means.
2008.08-495,0,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,1573.251,1575.503,The -- I will -- I will--
2008.08-495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1575.503,1576.403,You can save it for rebuttal.
2008.08-495,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1576.403,1577.438,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1584.174,1605.088,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner's reading of subparagraph (M)(i) implausibly excludes the mainstays of Federal fraud prosecutions and applies at best to a tiny handful of outlying offenses: Thefts of major works of art, extreme cases of government contract fraud, and some frauds obtaining confidential phone records and--"
2008.08-495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1605.088,1606.957,"Well, except -- except for his modified hangout."
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1614.544,1629.202,"--Well, I -- I think, Justice Scalia, that he does offer this -- this variation on a so-called modified categorical approach by saying that we could use extraneous facts in guilty pleas in order to satisfy the categorical approach."
2008.08-495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1636.873,1639.075,And also interrogatories to the jury.
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1639.075,1646.996,--He does seem to contemplate that interrogatories for the jury might also achieve the same purpose.
2008.08-495,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1704.102,1707.637,"But this -- but this defendant did ask, didn't -- he asked the judge."
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1707.637,1711.772,"--Well, he did not ask the judge for a finding of loss."
2008.08-495,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1735.823,1746.445,"Well, but then you just -- you, the government, says -- you know, you'll have a little debate about what the special interrogatory, how it is phrased, and your objection there could be dealt with on -- during that negotiation."
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1746.445,1764.056,"--Well, and at that point he -- he -- we -- we presumably wouldn't want to have to prove up a loss at that point that's irrelevant for purposes of the criminal guilt proceeding, although it may well become relevant for the sentencing proceeding, as it did become relevant here, and there was a sentencing stipulation."
2008.08-495,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1764.056,1766.008,And -- and why would you be reluctant to do that?
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1767.542,1771.412,"Well, I -- I think that it could confuse the jury."
2008.08-495,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1922.627,1933.685,"Could I ask you this, does this -- which is not exactly on point to the issue here, but does the government have a theory about how the loss is measured for purposes of this statute?"
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1945.826,1952.48,"--Yes, we think that it is not necessarily the same as the loss determination that would be made for sentencing."
2008.08-495,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1969.391,1987.92,"What if you have somebody who participates in a -- in a scheme involving $100 million, the total loss is $10,000, but this person had no way of reasonably anticipating that this would be the -- the total amount of the loss, this was a minor participant, and -- where would the -- how would that come out?"
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1987.92,1997.343,"--Well, I think that the text of the statute here in subparagraph (M)(i) talks about an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000."
2008.08-495,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2020.191,2044.323,"Does the judge, when he arrives at the restitution amount, have discretion to say, as to this particular defendant, he was just an accountant with the company that was committing the fraud, he didn't put anything into his own pocket except the salary they paid him, so I'm going to exclude him from the restitution order?"
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2044.323,2054.547,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg, in general the -- the judge does have discretion to -- to adjust aspects of the restitution order on the basis of the facts of the underlying offense."
2008.08-495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2064.403,2068.189,"You -- you wouldn't allow that exclusion to have any effect on deportation, would you?"
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2068.189,2072.343,--It would depend upon the facts of the underlying case.
2008.08-495,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2089.685,2090.47,So in -- in my very hypothetical--
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2090.47,2102.528,"Depending upon the facts of the case, yes, Justice Ginsburg, in your hypothetical if we can prove by clear and convincing evidence that the amount of loss associated with a fraud offense was more than $10,000, we think that would satisfy."
2008.08-495,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2102.528,2108.516,--Even -- even though this defendant did not pocket any gain?
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2108.516,2109.299,Yes.
2008.08-495,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2159.363,2177.574,"What about the defendant's argument that at least as far as his admission for sentencing purposes, he did that only because otherwise the government wouldn't ask for a downward departure?"
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2177.574,2198.071,"Well, I -- I think that we are not taking the position that the -- the stipulation for sentencing purposes, which was pursuant to (6)(B)of the guidelines and was for stipulation purposes -- we're not arguing that that is -- is dispositive in the -- in the civil removal proceeding."
2008.08-495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2229.359,2253.225,"But your position -- I want to be sure I understand it -- is that if the record in this case had been -- let's say it's a mail fraud case, they proved one mailing and one victim lost $30, and that's all the trial established, but as a matter of fact you could establish this was part of a scheme, just like the one we've got here, in which millions of dollars were lost, you could prove that independently and he would still be required to be deported?"
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2253.225,2255.342,"--Not necessarily, Justice Stevens."
2008.08-495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2262.596,2265.965,"But the scheme -- the evidence of the scheme consisted of just two mailings, say."
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2287.831,2288.898,--It's possible.
2008.08-495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2295.753,2297.969,You can determine exactly what you proved in this case.
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2297.969,2318.183,"--Well, I -- if we had that amount of evidence in this case, we had sentencing stipulations and all sorts of determinations at the time of the sentencing where the defendant did not even try to argue that this wasn't actually the amount of loss associated with his offense and conviction, then we probably would be able to establish by clear and convincing that the--"
2008.08-495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2318.183,2319.785,I'm not -- I -- I'm losing you.
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2326.539,2331.591,"--I -- I thought, Justice Scalia, that that was the premise of Justice Stevens' question."
2008.08-495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2332.107,2332.941,"Yes, it was."
2008.08-495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2332.941,2333.474,"Oh, I didn't--"
2008.08-495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2333.474,2335.309,But it didn't describe the dimensions of the scheme.
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2355.539,2362.96,--Well -- I think that it's unlikely if we didn't have the evidence contemporaneous with the trial.
2008.08-495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2362.96,2364.328,"You had the evidence, but you didn't need it."
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2364.328,2374.434,"Well, I -- if it were like this, we had the evidence contemporaneous with sentencing, with $100 million stipulations and things like that, and that makes it obviously much easier for us to prove the extent of the underlying fraud."
2008.08-495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2374.434,2376.286,I know it's easy; I'm wondering if it's necessary.
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2385.059,2394.331,"If -- if that were, in fact, the scope of the conviction, because it was for -- for the entire fraudulent scheme, then that may well be so."
2008.08-495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2420.047,2430.338,"No, my -- he pleads guilty to the mammoth scheme proved, the evidence before the court or on the plea colloquy, whatever is described is enough to show that he was guilty."
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2430.338,2431.521,--Well I--
2008.08-495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2431.521,2434.722,"But then as I understand it, you can prove the size of the scheme later on."
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2434.722,2439.876,--I -- in those circumstances I -- I think that we may well be able to prove that in the second proceeding.
2008.08-495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2439.876,2452.953,"--Well, I would -- I thought that was the whole case we had before us, Where you haven't proved either as an element or -- or by a separate jury finding how much money was involved."
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2455.086,2455.738,Well--
2008.08-495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2455.738,2456.938,You can establish that later.
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2456.938,2462.742,"--Yes, that's right, Justice Scalia, and as long as it is the scope of the scheme that -- that he was convicted--"
2008.08-495,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2462.742,2469.213,"I suppose your answer, it's your first argument, it's the -- it's the offense."
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2469.213,2471.765,"--Yes, yes, Justice Kennedy."
2008.08-495,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2471.765,2485.424,"And if for Blockburger purposes or for double jeopardy purposes, you couldn't retry him for those other -- for that additional loss, then that's -- I assume your argument is that that's included within the offense for which he was convicted."
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2485.424,2511.307,"As long as the offense were in fact the scheme rather than an individual instance of a mailing, that's correct; and so I think that that -- that that is consistent with Justice Stevens' hypothetical and that we would in those circumstances be able to -- attempts to prove by clear and convincing evidence in the civil removal proceedings that the loss associated with the offense, which was the scheme rather than just an individual mailing, then -- then we would be able to prove that."
2008.08-495,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2511.742,2526.418,"Your position is that in ancillary, subsequent proceedings anything you prove that's within the offense convicted -- say, as measured by double jeopardy purposes, as protection against multiple prosecutions, that you can make that showing?"
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2526.418,2532.405,"--Well, with -- here it's -- we're not trying to prove a separate criminal offense."
2008.08-495,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2534.322,2534.772,That's my point.
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2534.772,2535.357,--Yes.
2008.08-495,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2535.357,2537.04,I take it that that's your whole argument.
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2537.04,2540.076,"Yes, that it -- this is the offense of conviction."
2008.08-495,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2564.674,2567.559,But the appropriate burden of proof was beyond a reasonable doubt.
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2574.065,2575.815,--Yes.
2008.08-495,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2575.815,2583.688,"--the relationship, domestic relationship had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, which is not the standard that the BIA used."
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2583.688,2589.409,I -- I think it was beyond the reasonable doubt in the context of the 922(g)(9) prosecution--
2008.08-495,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2589.409,2590.309,Yes.
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2590.309,2592.694,"--because that was itself a criminal proceeding, and that's right, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.08-495,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2592.694,2593.477,"Yes, yes."
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2593.477,2601.882,"We think that if this definition were -- were to be applied in the criminal context, then we would need to prove this aspect, the loss threshold."
2008.08-495,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2601.882,2616.476,"That's what you're talking about, the alien who is convicted of a qualifying crime, an aggravating felony, then tries -- then comes back illegally."
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2622.963,2632.688,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, just to be clear it's -- there's already a 10-year statutory maximum that applies under 1326(b)(1) for the prior conviction for a felony."
2008.08-495,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2706.733,2714.137,"Mr. Gannon, we're dealing with the definition of a particular term, aggravated felony."
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2742.307,2743.023,Well--
2008.08-495,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2743.023,2747.793,And yet that's all you have to prove with the protections of the criminal law as opposed to the civil.
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2747.793,2757.899,"--Well, I think we have to prove for purposes of the relevant proceeding in which we're trying to establish that it is an aggravated felony that it also exceeded the $10,000 threshold."
2008.08-495,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2757.899,2761.268,But not subject to the protections of criminal law that you have to show.
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2761.268,2762.47,No more--
2008.08-495,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2762.47,2766.005,"Beyond the reasonable doubt, with the jury protections."
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2766.005,2773.159,"--Well, we would need to prove that if it were relevant to a criminal proceeding, but in the civil removal proceeding those protections aren't there."
2008.08-495,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2774.176,2789.001,"Yes, I guess what I'm saying, the only thing that makes this aggravated, the $10,000, in contrast to the other things, which are aggravated by virtue of elements that you have to approve -- you have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt -- is that it's fraud ir deceit."
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2793.672,2807.165,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there are several other statutes here that have extra limiting factors that are necessary to make the crime an aggravated one for purposes of the aggravated felony, but don't have to be proved as an element of the original offense."
2008.08-495,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2808.115,2809.701,"Well, that's just -- I think that's kind of begging the question."
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2826.877,2827.412,--Well--
2008.08-495,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2827.412,2835.582,"And when you're talking about firearm offenses, or child pornography, yes, that's aggravated; but fraud and deceit is kind of a run of the mine felony."
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2835.582,2841.153,"--Well, but for many of the offenses it's things that as Petitioner acknowledges, would never be proved as elements of the offense."
2008.08-495,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2864.252,2865.954,"Well, I guess I don't understand how that's responsive."
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2866.804,2867.688,--Well--
2008.08-495,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2867.688,2868.989,--crime of violence.
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2874.374,2875.957,--But not according to Congress.
2008.08-495,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2895.037,2898.072,"I -- I guess I don't understand the answer, and I'm sorry if it's--"
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2898.072,2899.972,"Well, I'm the one that's sorry."
2008.08-495,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2899.972,2900.872,--I'm hard to get through.
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2929.192,2930.711,Well -- and I think that's--
2008.08-495,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2930.711,2934.013,What makes it aggravated is something as to which you have a much lighter burden.
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2934.013,2955.509,"--Well, it's -- it's not a much lighter burden in the sense that we do, for purposes of the civil removal proceeding, need to establish it by clear and convincing evidence, and -- and it is, in -- in a subsequent criminal proceeding, there will be all the constitutional protections that you're talking about, just like the domestic relationship prong of the -- of the crime that the Court considered in Hayes."
2008.08-495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2955.509,2964.682,"I -- I would have thought you would not accept the Chief Justice's premise, that a crime of violence is an aggravated felony."
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2964.682,2965.298,"Well, I--"
2008.08-495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2965.298,2966.134,It isn't.
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2966.134,2975.989,"--I tried to explain that it is not as long as there isn't a sentence that is imposed of at least 1 year according to Congress's way of determining what is an aggravated felony, and Congress has determined that--"
2008.08-495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2975.989,2988.647,"But the -- but the Chief Justice points out that the facts that make the fraud aggravated are facts that you do not have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, which takes back to your opponent's argument."
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2997.753,3001.39,"--Well, that's correct, Justice Stevens, but in -- in that regard--"
2008.08-495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3001.39,3006.025,So you were not convicted of the aggravated offense that -- the issue in this case.
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3006.025,3014.548,"--Well, no, we think that you were convicted of the offense, which is an offense that involves fraud or deceit, and then there is the further limitation that Congress has imposed, not as an element--"
2008.08-495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3014.548,3023.553,But the -- but you hadn't been convicted of the aggravated offense until you established its aggravation by proof of less -- not under a reasonable doubt.
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3026.255,3039.33,--But it -- it can't have that same meaning with regard to all of these other things in all of these other offenses in which Congress has determined they're not an aggravated felony until those other criteria are also satisfied.
2008.08-495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3072.903,3075.188,It depends on how you read the language.
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3101.403,3101.922,--And we--
2008.08-495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3101.922,3103.155,--and that's basically what we're arguing about.
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3103.155,3104.055,--And we think--
2008.08-495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3104.055,3108.159,"No, but the word ""convicted"" -- the question is whether the word ""convicted"" applies to the word ""aggravated""."
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3136.394,3155.557,"--Well, for purposes of a civil removal proceeding, that's true, and that's no different from the limiting factors in several of the other provisions, like the sentence that was imposed -- the potential sentence -- whether there was an exception for a first offense that involved family members, for the alien smuggling and document fraud, crimes in (N) and (P)."
2008.08-495,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3235.759,3236.759,"Thank you, Mr. Gannon."
2008.08-495,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3236.759,3237.627,--The court of appeals should be affirmed.
2008.08-495,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3237.627,3244.197,"Mr. Moseley, you have 4 minutes remaining."
2008.08-495,2,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,3244.197,3255.589,"With respect to the issue of deference, the fact that this is part of a Federal criminal statute I believe doesn't get us -- cuts off the inquiry, and we don't get to Chevron deference here."
2008.08-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3325.916,3334.172,"To come back to the deference point, you say -- is this relevant to the criminal conviction?"
2008.08-495,2,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,3345.746,3346.229,But--
2008.08-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3346.229,3346.848,--right?
2008.08-495,2,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,3346.848,3357.304,"--But what the government has said, if they're going to do a prosecution under 8 U.S.C. 1326(b), that they would seek to prove this amount de novo in the underlying criminal proceeding."
2008.08-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3364.024,3367.41,"Well, in that later criminal proceeding, they would have to prove it undoubtedly--"
2008.08-495,2,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,3367.41,3368.262,"--Right, and that--"
2008.08-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3368.262,3371.88,--But this is not a later criminal proceeding; this is an administrative proceeding.
2008.08-495,2,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,3379.902,3391.377,"--It shouldn't, Justice Scalia, because we deal with a dual use statute, as this Court said in Leocal, which indeed was also a civil removal proceeding, or Lopez-Gonzalez, which was a civil removal proceedings."
2008.08-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3397.447,3411.839,But there -- was it not true that there the interpretation placed upon the statute by BIA would also be the interpretation necessary to secure the criminal conviction?
2008.08-495,2,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,3413.39,3427.3,"--But it was -- but in Lopez-Gonzalez, there was a -- there was a Board of Immigration Appeals decision, Matter of Yanez, which was directly opposite to what this Court held and ultimately rejected in that decision."
2008.08-495,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3448.38,3451.416,I frankly couldn't understand the government's concession on that point.
2008.08-495,2,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,3462.306,3463.056,No--
2008.08-495,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3463.056,3464.023,I don't understand that.
2008.08-495,2,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,3464.023,3466.675,"--Well, that may be a separate issue, Justice Kennedy."
2008.08-495,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3485.187,3485.52,I see.
2008.08-495,2,43101,thomas_e_moseley,,3485.52,3487.689,--they would prove that loss de novo in Federal Court.
2008.08-495,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3488.957,3489.957,"Thank you, counsel."
