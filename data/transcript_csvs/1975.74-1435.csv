1975.74-1435,1,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1301.036,1304.375,Well we think that Congress said that in Section 313 (Voice Overlap) Pardon me.

1975.74-1435,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1336.494,1337.956,(Inaudible)-- difficult.

1975.74-1435,1,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,1363.091,1364.437,"Yes, I suppose that is true."
