2016.15-1262,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.96,"We'll hear argument in Case 15-1262, McCrory v. Harris. Mr. Clement."
2016.15-1262,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,5.96,58.82,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves the -- the constitutionality of two congressional districts in North Carolina that should be familiar to the Court because they've been before the Court on multiple prior occasions. Even though the two congressional districts here -- and they're both North Carolina congressional districts -- the issues presented by the two districts are actually quite distinct. With respect to Congressional District 12, it is different from both the House of Delegates districts in the previous case and Congressional District 1, because this was not a district that was drawn with an avowed intent to create a majority-minority district to comply with the Voting Rights Act; rather, with respect to Congressional District 12, this was avowedly a political draw. Now, if that all sounds familiar, it's because it's the exact same dynamic that was before this Court in Cromartie II."
2016.15-1262,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,139.08,170.78,"Mr. Clement, that passage in -- in Cromartie II says in a case like this one. And -- and it's pretty clearly following off analysis of -- in a case with purely circumstantial evidence, rather than direct evidence of race-based districting. I think you would have heard it, and it would have sounded different if the Court had really meant that in every case where the question was, is this politics or is this race, there was a requirement to present maps."
2016.15-1262,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,173.485,185.16,"I respectfully disagree, Justice Kagan, for at least two reasons. One is, there was direct evidence in Cromartie II; and, indeed, the direct evidence is eerily similar."
2016.15-1262,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,197.75,201.76,"In talking about that, I guess that's why I say I was the problem. (Laughter.)"
2016.15-1262,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,201.76,205.68,What I wrote was in a case such as this one.
2016.15-1262,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,209.98,219.415,"By the time we reach the Alabama case, there is a need seen by a majority of the Court to try to bring clarity."
2016.15-1262,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,260.95,261.71,"Well, just --"
2016.15-1262,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,261.71,262.785,Do I not do that?
2016.15-1262,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,262.785,270.54,"No, in the following respect, which is Alabama and Cromartie II are different cases."
2016.15-1262,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,270.54,270.81,Uh-huh.
2016.15-1262,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,270.81,285.33,"And I'll take your point that Alabama is this Court's last, best guidance on how to deal with a case like Alabama and like Congressional District 1 where you have a State that says, why did we do it? The Voting Rights Act made us do it."
2016.15-1262,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,322.745,327.53,"Well, the question is: Is it? Right? I mean, that's the question that the district court was trying to answer."
2016.15-1262,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,382.455,384.2,And I would say yes.
2016.15-1262,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,418.88,429.18,"But it's also a big thing to ask plaintiffs to come in with their own maps, if they have direct evidence that the State is doing race-based rather than politics-based districting."
2016.15-1262,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,429.18,439.24,"Well, I'm -- I guess I'm a little less troubled by being demanding of plaintiffs than I am of putting sovereign State legislatures in a difficult position."
2016.15-1262,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,462.21,466.325,"Not so easy, because we know that race and politics correlate."
2016.15-1262,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,500.105,524.66,"Well, Your Honor, just to be clear, that -- that -- the direct evidence of the map drawer actually is incredibly helpful for my clients as to CD12, because the same guy who had no problem saying as to CD1, it's above 50.1 percent, also testified that he had exactly the opposite instructions for drawing CD12, and that when he drew the map he didn't even look at racial data."
2016.15-1262,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,535.15,535.345,Didn't --
2016.15-1262,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,535.345,535.96,I'm sorry.
2016.15-1262,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,535.96,544.5,Didn't he say that he was told specifically to not consider race except with respect to Guilford County?
2016.15-1262,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,544.5,545.09,Well --
2016.15-1262,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,545.09,549.42,Which is probably the most important piece of this discussion.
2016.15-1262,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,549.42,562.03,"No, that's not what he said. He didn't say -- he -- he basically was -- said, look, do it as a political draw, and then you're going to have to, essentially, check what you did in Guilford County with the African-American community, because Guilford County is a covered jurisdiction."
2016.15-1262,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,562.03,568.99,"We can go back to the original deposition testimony, which is what the district court -- I think what the court below relied on."
2016.15-1262,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,568.99,569.8,Absolutely.
2016.15-1262,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,718.84,719.33,But isn't -- isn't it --
2016.15-1262,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,719.33,719.93,You would want the maps.
2016.15-1262,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,720.37,735.12,"Isn't there substantial evidence that Congressman Watt comes in and he sits on the witness stand and he says, I had a conversation with the map drawer and the map drawer said that my bosses told me I have to get up over 50.1 percent black votes."
2016.15-1262,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,735.12,736.15,So it --
2016.15-1262,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,736.15,737.65,That seems like substantial evidence.
2016.15-1262,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,748.56,749.31,"Well, no."
2016.15-1262,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,761.62,773.89,But wasn't there a credibility finding? Didn't the district judge say -- the three-justice court say they credited Watt and not Rucho?
2016.15-1262,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,773.89,785.23,"They -- they -- they did say that, but that only gets you to the point that -- okay. I mean, maybe -- even if Rucho said that, it didn't get translated to the map drawer."
2016.15-1262,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,827.93,830.305,I understand the problem of Cromartie II.
2016.15-1262,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,844.825,845.27,We --
2016.15-1262,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,845.27,865.605,"By the time as time progresses, as time progresses, we face what you see and I see as the problem right now, which is a set of standards that district courts can't apply, which will try to separate sheep from goats, without us spending the entire term reviewing 5,000-page records."
2016.15-1262,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,879.865,898.775,"I think it's determinative, because you didn't just say ""in a case such as this one."" You said ""in a case such as this one where"" it's a majority-minority district or a close approximation, and race and politics are closely correlated. And I'll even give you a third criteria, which is in the cases where the -- the legislature's stated goal was politics, not race."
2016.15-1262,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1017.39,1047.33,"What you want me to say is even though the district court listened to the map drawer and believed him, and his statements are pretty much against you, and then they heard two of the State senators, and they were pretty much against you, and it's up to the district court to evaluate the strength of witnesses, and came to the conclusion on the basis of fact that, in fact, it was -- race was really the explanation. Despite that, everyone who comes in has to have an alternative map."
2016.15-1262,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1059.32,1076.01,"Well, first of all, I don't think that the direct evidence here is of a character that is materially different from Cromartie II itself. And I would say that, look, you're trying to give district courts directions for a whole bunch of cases. Everybody is going to be able to say, I have direct evidence."
2016.15-1262,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1168.94,1169.07,But --
2016.15-1262,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1169.07,1172.895,If they really just wanted to help the Democrats hurt the Republicans or vice versa --
2016.15-1262,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1172.895,1173.2,Mr. --
2016.15-1262,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1173.2,1175.5,-- they could have done it with a completely different racial balance.
2016.15-1262,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1175.5,1187.86,"What do we do with our statements in Miller, that what the evil we're trying to address is the use of race? And once it's met, you don't need a manifestation of it."
2016.15-1262,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1253.25,1272.85,"Well, Your Honor, I think that, sure, at the end of the day in these districts where you basically have one party saying it was politics and the other party is saying it's race, you do ultimately have to have a mechanism for determining which one it was. And our humble point is everybody agrees that they're highly correlated."
2016.15-1262,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1477.88,1497.845,To what extent and what circumstances does Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act require that a contiguous district be drawn in order to comply with strict scrutiny? Assume that you're using race and then you have to comply with strict scrutiny. To what extent do you think the VRA requires a compact or contiguous district?
2016.15-1262,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1497.845,1501.02,I think it requires a reasonably contiguous district.
2016.15-1262,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1591.665,1595.945,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Elias, welcome back."
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,1595.945,1644.41,"Feel like I never left. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to actually jump in and just go through District 12, as -- as my colleague did, and then talk about CD1. The problem that the State has in CD12 is that the finding of predominance was more than amply supported by the record that the trial court found, and we are under a clear error standard. The question as, Justice Breyer, you -- you pointed out is whether race was a dominant and controlling factor in moving a significant number of voters in or out."
2016.15-1262,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1682.69,1683.865,"Well, why not?"
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,1683.865,1689.025,"Because in each of these cases, and in Alabama, they offered no alternative map."
2016.15-1262,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1711.005,1719.035,"Did they -- did they in respect to this district, District 12? Because when I go back to Cromartie II, I think he's right."
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,1744.3,1745.24,"It does, Your Honor."
2016.15-1262,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1745.24,1756.77,"So what -- what -- what is it that you suggest? My having been quite strong for following stare decisis in this, but what do you suggest about that? Are you going to say this isn't a close case?"
2016.15-1262,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1756.77,1760.61,Are you going to say we should overrule that? What -- what is it you want to say?
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,1760.61,1770.74,"I would say two things, Justice Breyer. The first is, I'm taking issue when they suggest that trial courts are confused and that this is a reversal on trial -- of the trial courts."
2016.15-1262,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1776.43,1789.59,"Explain why isn't -- not a map, but some kind of -- of evidence that they could have achieved their political objectives with less reliance on race."
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,1791.475,1792.44,"I think, Your Honor --"
2016.15-1262,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1792.44,1796.37,"Are you saying it doesn't really say that? You could say -- I mean, there are many things you might say."
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,1809.345,1810.16,Your -- Your --
2016.15-1262,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1810.16,1811.8,I want to hear what you think.
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,1811.8,1812.45,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-1262,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1881.85,1887.345,Did they say that that map served political ends to the same degree as the map that's before us?
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,1887.345,1890.59,I don't know what it -- Your Honor --
2016.15-1262,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1890.59,1892.13,"If they -- if they didn't say, then --"
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,1892.13,1892.4,That's --
2016.15-1262,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1892.4,1912.02,"-- the fact they were able to draw another map doesn't -- doesn't really prove anything. If -- if a legislature says, this was done on -- based on politics, and there's no way we could have achieved our political objective without doing this, they can't prove a negative. So it makes sense to turn to the other side and say, prove that that's wrong."
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,1922.19,1930.935,"Your Honor, I think the problem with the reading -- that reading and the reading that's being offered, is it puts the constitutional cart before the horse."
2016.15-1262,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1944.33,1949.37,"No, but the question is, what was the basis for it? Was it politics, as they say, or was it race?"
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,1949.37,1950.01,"Precisely, Your Honor."
2016.15-1262,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1950.01,1961.15,"So if there isn't -- if no one can point to a way of achieving the political objective, other than through the map that was drawn, then that's evidence that politics was the reason for it."
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,1961.15,1963.045,"It -- Your Honor, it may be evidence of it."
2016.15-1262,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1972.61,1972.83,Okay.
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,1973.19,1973.55,-- on the other side.
2016.15-1262,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1973.55,1978.855,"Would you accept that a map is necessary, except in a case where there is quite strong evidence --"
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,1978.855,1979.565,I don't -- I --
2016.15-1262,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1979.565,1980.73,-- that race was the basis?
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,1980.73,1986.065,I don't think that this Court needs to define out the strength of the evidence.
2016.15-1262,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1997.59,2001.295,"Well, how much weight do you think the absence of a map is entitled to?"
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,2001.295,2004.13,I think the absence of a map is entitled to no weight.
2016.15-1262,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2102.01,2110.335,"I think the -- the evidence with respect to Guilford County is your strongest evidence; but beyond that, the rest of it is not very strong."
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,2110.335,2114.765,"Your Honor, but that is where the -- where race predominated."
2016.15-1262,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2145.355,2152.2,Did the State ever put on any evidence that that was necessary to avoid a retrogression problem under Section 5?
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,2152.2,2152.39,No.
2016.15-1262,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2155.32,2160.76,"And why is that? I mean, it seems like -- as though that's what they would say. Why -- why wasn't that at issue?"
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,2160.76,2177.6,"Whether it was a strategic litigation decision made by the trial lawyers that they wanted to put all of their eggs in the -- so to speak, in the politics, not race basket, or whether their expert wouldn't support that this was actually necessary to comply with the Voting Rights Act, I don't know."
2016.15-1262,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2211.21,2213.44,I think they -- they did make the case.
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,2219.265,2219.61,Well --
2016.15-1262,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2219.61,2224.6,"-- and we want to get all the Democratic voters in one district, so the 15 that are Republican."
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,2229.41,2230.19,What it -- what --
2016.15-1262,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2230.19,2230.975,What about that?
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,2230.975,2245.735,"What Mel Watt was told is that he, as a respected African-American, was going to be expected to sell to the African-American community. That's what he said. He's going to be expected to sell to the African-American community that this needed to be over 50 percent to comply with the VRA."
2016.15-1262,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2291.535,2310.39,"Well, can I go back to -- to Congressman Watt's testimony? Now, you referred to something other than what I thought you highlighted in your brief. What you highlight in your brief is double hearsay: Congressman Watt said Rucho told him that somebody else told him something, and none of those people is actually the person who drew the map."
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,2316.44,2318.495,"Well, Your Honor, it was admitted."
2016.15-1262,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2407.59,2412.84,"Mr. Elias, I'd like to ask you about the procedural issue in this case."
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,2412.84,2413.14,Yes.
2016.15-1262,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2413.14,2420.7,There was another case -- it was in the State court -- the same issues; just decided the opposite way.
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,2461.42,2464.9,"Your Honor, I think two responses."
2016.15-1262,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2490.95,2494.41,"Well, but Justice Ginsburg can pursue and protect her own question."
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,2499.61,2519.735,"Well, so -- and the -- the second point I would make -- I said there were two points. The second point I would make, Justice Kennedy, is that the State case was really quite a different case, in several respects. First of all, the State case was predominantly -- to use a word that's come up a lot, was predominantly about the State lines."
2016.15-1262,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2653.58,2655.07,It's not a question of deferring.
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,2665.345,2677.3,"They do, Mr. Chief Justice, but it is also an equally well-established principle that this Court judges findings the fact by lower courts under clear error. Whatever the State of North Carolina --"
2016.15-1262,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2677.3,2687.73,"Well, it doesn't seem responsive to the point you just made, which I understood to be that we ought to give greater deference to the Federal court's findings and rulings than we would with respect to a decision from a State court."
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,2687.73,2690.32,"Then I misspoke, Your Honor. I'm not saying we should give greater deference."
2016.15-1262,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2746.94,2752.925,"Do you think we should give any consideration to the State court decision, or should we proceed as if it never occurred?"
2016.15-1262,1,62677,mark_e_elias,,2752.925,2761.77,I think you can read that decision in the way in which you would read any other decision of a lower court that may be of interest to the Court.
2016.15-1262,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2819.855,2832.55,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky."
2016.15-1262,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2832.55,2837.06,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start with Congressional District 12."
2016.15-1262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2995.325,3009.585,"What -- what do you have to say about the Voting Rights -- I mean, the clear error standard with respect to the State court decision as well? I mean, it is certainly something of a fortuity that we have the Federal case before us and not the State case."
2016.15-1262,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3026.675,3036.04,"Well, a couple of responses. First of all, the way that the Court deals with potential two-bites-at-the-apple problems is through the Res Judicata/Claim Preclusion and issue preclusion doctrine."
2016.15-1262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3043.11,3048.22,"What does that mean? Whichever one was decided first, or whichever one arrives here first?"
2016.15-1262,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3048.22,3057.045,"Well, I think you would have to ask whether the -- the res judicata principles had -- it -- it would have been the State court being decided first, but you have to ask whether res judicata principles were met."
2016.15-1262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3057.045,3061.725,"So you're saying we should apply the res judicata principles, and that leads us to favor the State court?"
2016.15-1262,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3061.725,3063.505,"No, I'm not saying that."
2016.15-1262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3063.505,3065.145,"Well, what -- I don't understand."
2016.15-1262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3065.145,3067.255,State court was decided first.
2016.15-1262,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3067.255,3067.5,Right.
2016.15-1262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3067.5,3068.81,And then you say we should apply res judicata.
2016.15-1262,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3070.435,3077.22,"Well, the -- the application of res judicata would depend on North Carolina law in this instance because it was a case out of the North Carolina courts."
2016.15-1262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3091.7,3099.965,"You want us to apply res judicata to decide this question, and you don't have a position on what the answer is?"
2016.15-1262,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3099.965,3114.765,"Well, I think if the Court worried about the State court having some effect, that it would ask there whether there was a res judicata bar. And there would be three hurdles, I think, that the State would have to overcome in order to prove -- in order to show that there was a res judicata bar: First of all, whether the argument was waived."
2016.15-1262,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3167.59,3169.49,"What do you mean, you would have --"
2016.15-1262,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3169.49,3176.21,"Just on District -- just on District 12, you say there was racial predominance. Strict scrutiny fails because?"
2016.15-1262,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3176.21,3179.95,Because the State didn't give any reason to pass strict scrutiny.
2016.15-1262,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3195.37,3198.06,What is your view of when maps should be required?
2016.15-1262,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3198.06,3205.2,So we don't read the Court's decision in Cromartie II to require a map any time a political motive is asserted.
2016.15-1262,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3254.92,3258.92,"But if there's not strong direct evidence, would a map be necessary?"
2016.15-1262,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3258.92,3264.61,"Well, we think that this Court has tried to give flexibility in terms of proving racial predominance."
2016.15-1262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3281.03,3284.4,"But, what -- what exactly is going on, in part, is a very tough matter."
2016.15-1262,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3286.165,3286.615,Yes.
2016.15-1262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3286.615,3308.78,"There were many States that had many black citizens and had no black representation, and there was a thing called -- let's have majority-minority districts. And the problem is, how does the law permit the creation of that, and at the same time, prevent the kind of packing that might appear in other cases, which is gerrymandering? And -- and no one, I think, has a good answer to that question."
2016.15-1262,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3335.11,3335.4,Yes.
2016.15-1262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3344.43,3345.69,It's not just the States' interest.
2016.15-1262,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3353.905,3354.4,Right.
2016.15-1262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3442.82,3446.705,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement, you have four minutes remaining."
2016.15-1262,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3446.705,3461.18,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. A few points in rebuttal. First of all, it is worth recognizing that six trial court judges looked at Congressional District 12, and four out of the six said that politics, not race, prevailed."
2016.15-1262,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3651.81,3654.49,But I think they would -- they did present both theories.
2016.15-1262,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3673.62,3680.635,"If I may respond: To get them to 50 percent. And here's the thing: If they focused on Guilford County, they would have had two problems."
2016.15-1262,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3684.74,3685.17,"Yeah, but the other --"
2016.15-1262,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3685.17,3691.84,But because Senator Rucho apparently believed doing so was necessary to avoid retrogression for Section 5 purposes.
2016.15-1262,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3692.08,3693.19,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2016.15-1262,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3694.96,3696.505,You didn't respond to it.
2016.15-1262,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3696.505,3711.04,"Everything that they said about CD12 was a concern about retrogression, which is why, when Senator Rucho talked about CD12 and -- and -- and Guilford County, he didn't say, and so we drew it as a majority-minority district."
2016.15-1262,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3732.32,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
