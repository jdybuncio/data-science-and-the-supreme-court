1960.126,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,13.739,"Number 126, Laurens Federal Savings and Loan Association, Petitioner, versus South Carolina Tax Commission."
1960.126,0,24608,frank_k_sloan,,17.737,22.866,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.126,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,460.33,469.83,"The effect of that is to say that, to view the 1933 Act, would be to tax -- the state can tax but they can only do so under discriminatory basis."
1960.126,0,24608,frank_k_sloan,,469.83,471.885,"Yes, that's correct, sir."
1960.126,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,555.247,556.156,I don't understand.
1960.126,0,24608,frank_k_sloan,,565.02,585.005,"The question raised by the State, in its brief, Mr. Justice Whittaker, is that the -- that it is not discriminar -- discriminatory because the state savings and loan association would have to pay it and this relieves only the federal savings and loan association."
1960.126,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,585.005,589.733,(Inaudible) use that why you apply the states act to say if there's an exemption.
1960.126,0,24608,frank_k_sloan,,589.733,591.926,"That -- we do not agree that they do, sir."
1960.126,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1227.947,1230.006,Mr. Windham.
1960.126,1,33539,james_m_windham,,1230.006,1233.429,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.126,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1795.755,1801.498,"The economic incidence of the tax certainly ends up in the bank, doesn't it?"
1960.126,1,33539,james_m_windham,,1801.498,1811.912,"I wouldn't think so, sir, Your Honor, except insofar as there may be some interference with the ultimate use of the money for that purpose."
1960.126,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1838.928,1839.895,Mr. Windham.
1960.126,1,33539,james_m_windham,,1839.895,1840.701,"Yes, sir?"
1960.126,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1840.701,1853.109,Does the statute ought to be burdened require the Home Owners' Loan Bank to take notes evidencing the (Inaudible)?
1960.126,1,33539,james_m_windham,,1853.109,1855.529,You say does the bank have to take these notes?
1960.126,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1855.529,1856.054,Yes (Voice Overlap) --
1960.126,1,33539,james_m_windham,,1856.054,1857.532,"Yes, sir, Your Honor."
1960.126,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1865.124,1877.947,"That means the bank can only make the advances when evidenced by notes, and you tax the notes, have you not then taxed the advance?"
1960.126,1,33539,james_m_windham,,1877.947,1893.244,"In that -- in that process of reasoning, in all honesty, I would have to say yes, sir, but I would go on to add that, if so, it is an indirect tax, sir and not a direct tax upon the bank."
1960.126,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1893.265,1897.522,"Now, isn't that exactly the question ruled by the Court in the Pittman case?"
1960.126,1,33539,james_m_windham,,1897.522,1898.004,"No, sir."
1960.126,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1902.581,1904.595,(Voice Overlap)
1960.126,1,33539,james_m_windham,,1904.595,1915.178,"To answer your question now, sir, I think that there is a difference between the ruling in the Pittman case and the situation which is an issue here."
1960.126,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2199.922,2208.537,Is that to say Congress has consented that they may be taxed but at no greater than other similar (Voice Overlap) --
1960.126,1,33539,james_m_windham,,2208.537,2211.098,That is the contention that we would place upon it.
1960.126,2,24608,frank_k_sloan,,2512.259,2515.358,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1960.126,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2703.424,2710.662,Was the point presented by South Carolina here presented in that case?
1960.126,2,24608,frank_k_sloan,,2710.662,2720.028,"No, because the question of the exemption of 1464 (h) did not apply to this precise loan transaction, you see."
1960.126,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2764.999,2765.354,I thought they were --
1960.126,2,24608,frank_k_sloan,,2765.354,2766.511,We've reached none of these.
1960.126,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2766.511,2773.178,I thought they were raising the question as to which statute governed as to tax immunity.
1960.126,2,24608,frank_k_sloan,,2773.178,2787.212,"The -- their position that -- that they take is that 1464 (h), which permits the State to tax associations, carries over into the transaction exempted by 1433."
1960.126,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2819.574,2820.913,"May I ask you, sir."
1960.126,2,24608,frank_k_sloan,,2820.913,2821.588,"Yes, sir, Mr. Justice?"
1960.126,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2821.588,2833.344,"Is not our question, the question we have to decide, whether this is a tax on savings and loan association or a tax on the bank?"
1960.126,2,24608,frank_k_sloan,,2835.536,2843.137,"Essentially, yes, and we say that, as this Court has said in the Pittman case, that you can't split up the loan."
1960.126,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2853.982,2858.596,"Is there any distinction, in that, this is one degree removed from (Voice Overlap) --"
1960.126,2,24608,frank_k_sloan,,2858.596,2870.359,"I do not see the distinction because, in the first case which had an identical exemption statute, the loan was made directly to an individual."
1960.126,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2939.127,2945.608,We'll recess now.
