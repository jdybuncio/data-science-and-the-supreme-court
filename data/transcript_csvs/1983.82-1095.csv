1983.82-1095,0,36867,michael_d_wellington,,76.048,77.666,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1095,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,279.128,294.805,"Mr. Wellington, I would like to ask you if at some time you would explain to us in your view what is the procedure that California courts follow in the review of death cases."
1983.82-1095,0,36867,michael_d_wellington,,305.029,306.229,"--Certainly, Justice O'Connor."
1983.82-1095,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,351.94,352.44,All right.
1983.82-1095,0,36867,michael_d_wellington,,360.379,380.277,"What I am saying, Your Honor... I am saying that in essence and perhaps I had best step back just for a second to explain what I perceive proportionality review to be, to explain how the California courts are constituted to give it and has been giving it, in fact, where it has been asked for."
1983.82-1095,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,396.469,397.436,Proportionality to the crime.
1983.82-1095,0,36867,michael_d_wellington,,397.436,408.61,"--Proportionality in the way this Court defined proportionality last term in Sollin v. Helm which includes, Your Honor an examination of whether it is proportional to the crime."
1983.82-1095,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,447.319,458.443,"May I ask, further on Justice O'Connor's question, does that mean they do not, in the California appellate system, compare this sentence with other similar cases throughout the state?"
1983.82-1095,0,36867,michael_d_wellington,,458.443,465.014,"Not on what Professor Amsterdam has called a cross-case comparative basis, Your Honor."
1983.82-1095,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,506.608,512.412,I thought they said that the California courts had started to do that after this case had been appealed.
1983.82-1095,0,36867,michael_d_wellington,,512.412,514.613,"That is inaccurate, Your Honor."
1983.82-1095,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,515.229,519.85,They are inaccurate or my reading of the opinion is inaccurate?
1983.82-1095,0,36867,michael_d_wellington,,519.85,522.969,The California courts have not--
1983.82-1095,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,522.969,525.421,Because the Ninth Circuit was inaccurate in thinking--
1983.82-1095,0,36867,michael_d_wellington,,525.421,526.437,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1983.82-1095,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,526.437,528.456,"--But, the Ninth Circuit did think they were doing that."
1983.82-1095,0,36867,michael_d_wellington,,528.456,530.575,That is apparent from the Ninth Circuit opinion.
1983.82-1095,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,530.575,531.258,Okay.
1983.82-1095,0,36867,michael_d_wellington,,531.258,542.383,"The Ninth Circuit read two California Supreme Court cases, Frierson and Jackson, to constitute a promise by the State of California to conduct proportionality review."
1983.82-1095,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,688.376,691.978,And is not a cross-case comparison.
1983.82-1095,0,36867,michael_d_wellington,,691.978,695.513,"That is correct, Your Honor, it is not a cross-case comparative analysis."
1983.82-1095,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,756.004,771.097,"Mr. Wellington, from the way you describe the California Court's approach to proportionality on the basis of In re Lynch, I take it one could have a proportionality review of a 50-year jail sentence under the--"
1983.82-1095,0,36867,michael_d_wellington,,771.097,772.397,"--Exactly, Your Honor."
1983.82-1095,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,772.397,773.882,--if it is Sollin against Helm you are talking about.
1983.82-1095,0,36867,michael_d_wellington,,773.882,774.749,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1095,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,789.725,793.427,So you still have the constitutional argument to make.
1983.82-1095,0,36867,michael_d_wellington,,794.213,795.013,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1095,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,827.7,835.79,"Mr. Wellington, am I right in thinking that the Ninth Circuit opinion didn't even cite our case against Jurek against Texas?"
1983.82-1095,0,36867,michael_d_wellington,,835.79,840.074,"That is correct, certainly not in what could be called the holding, Your Honor."
1983.82-1095,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,1980.548,1986.785,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1095,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2063.904,2065.954,Eighth Amendment allows or compels?
1983.82-1095,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,2070.058,2078.746,"The Eighth Amendment compels, California law allows Eighth Amendment review, proportionality review."
1983.82-1095,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2174.375,2181.045,"Mr. Amsterdam, is that a state constitutional provision which you refer to as the California prohibition against exclusive punishment?"
1983.82-1095,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,2181.045,2181.662,State.
