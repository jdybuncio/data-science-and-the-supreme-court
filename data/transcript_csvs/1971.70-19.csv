1971.70-19,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,33.713,"We will hear arguments next in number 19, United States against Marion and Cratch."
1971.70-19,0,39326,r_kent_greenawalt,,37.022,39.932,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-19,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,393.063,396.54,Mr. Greenawalt there is the general five year statute limitation.
1971.70-19,0,39326,r_kent_greenawalt,,396.54,397.082,"Yes, yes Your Honor."
1971.70-19,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,397.082,398.282,And that was --
1971.70-19,0,39326,r_kent_greenawalt,,398.282,399.417,That was applicable.
1971.70-19,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,399.417,400.481,General statute was applicable to this case.
1971.70-19,0,39326,r_kent_greenawalt,,400.481,401.463,"Yes, yes."
1971.70-19,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,401.463,404.957,Did it not use to be three years?
1971.70-19,0,39326,r_kent_greenawalt,,404.957,412.0,"Yes, I think originally it was two years and then it was made three years and then made five years."
1971.70-19,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,412.0,414.2,"How long ago was it made five years, do you know?"
1971.70-19,0,39326,r_kent_greenawalt,,414.2,416.058,I do not recall Your Honor.
1971.70-19,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,419.981,423.698,"And then there are some special statutes and limitations I think for some criminal, federal criminal offenses."
1971.70-19,0,39326,r_kent_greenawalt,,423.698,427.089,"Yes, I think some many types --"
1971.70-19,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,427.089,429.812,And I think in homicide there is no statute limitation.
1971.70-19,0,39326,r_kent_greenawalt,,429.812,430.71,That is correct.
1971.70-19,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,661.625,662.899,Mr. Greenawalt.
1971.70-19,0,39326,r_kent_greenawalt,,662.899,663.13,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-19,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,663.13,672.243,"I hate to interrupt you but was there any of this before Judge Hart,  any of this argument?"
1971.70-19,0,39326,r_kent_greenawalt,,680.825,683.086,That is correct Mr. Justice Marshall.
1971.70-19,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,683.086,688.848,"So, he did not have the benefit of any of this?"
1971.70-19,0,39326,r_kent_greenawalt,,688.848,713.277,"Let me make two points in response to that Mr. Justice Marshall. First, the argument I am making now is not an argument about this particular case, but an argument as to whether in general, the Sixth Amendment should be read to say that a speedy trial -- that one becomes an accused for speedy trial purposes at some point before formal accusatory action is made by the Government."
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,1417.28,1420.734,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1558.778,1578.735,"Mr. Jackson, did you say the day after the crime has been discovered and the government says five years after the crime has been discovered, where do we come down?"
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,1578.735,1579.725,Our --
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1579.725,1583.795,Do you agree that there is no evidence in either one side or the other?
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,1589.982,1590.63,That is correct.
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1590.665,1594.627,"And we have just the fact of the date, that is all we have."
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,1594.627,1595.88,"Well, we submit Your Honor that the --"
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1595.88,1602.73,"You know, we will send in (Inaudible), it would come down to two-and-a-half, would it not?"
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,1602.73,1602.736,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1602.736,1605.612,But we can not do that -- we can not do that with constitution.
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,1605.612,1609.439,We do not expect that that will be the result in this case or it should be the result.
1971.70-19,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1620.345,1626.735,"Well, we are not compliant to that explanation if we -- for the matters we can judicially notice, are we?"
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,1630.377,1637.271,"I think that is correct Your Honor, but it is the only explanation that the government has offered throughout for its delay and bringing the prosecution in this case."
1971.70-19,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1637.271,1645.28,"Well, we will have no trial, so there was no occasion to give them anything here except the legal arguments."
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,1645.28,1651.218,"But the government did not proffer or offer any explanation other than what it is, what it --"
1971.70-19,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1651.218,1666.402,"I do not read this record to the judgeâ€™s action of indicting anybody to go into the facts, you cut off by saying the prejudice is bound to have occurred."
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,1666.402,1666.905,I think he did.
1971.70-19,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1666.905,1672.126,And probably an invitation to pursue the inquiry.
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,1672.126,1693.436,I think his conclusion was that he himself took judicial notice if you will of the fact that there is an attrition of human memory over the lapse of time particularly of one of the magnitude of which we are speaking here and that he did not need any formal demonstration from the witness stand of actual prejudice.
1971.70-19,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1884.496,1891.59,"They all have -- I think if you had played in the world series of 1967, he remembered the details very well."
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,1891.59,1894.637,If indeed you had played that and there is no showing that Mr. Marion played --
1971.70-19,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1894.637,1897.391,And your client guarantedly was involved in this case.
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,1897.391,1898.03,That is correct.
1971.70-19,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1898.03,1902.832,"It was in the side line, high standards for a newspaper reader."
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,1902.832,1906.301,"Well, that remains to be seen Your Honor since the case is not been tried."
1971.70-19,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1906.301,1909.475,I think the allegation is that your client was involved in this.
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,1909.475,1916.074,"It was -- and that he was involved, yes, whether or not he was involved in the so called criminal activities; it is another matter."
1971.70-19,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1916.074,1918.322,"And that is we tried, of course."
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,1918.322,1947.518,"These articles however, were filled with anonymous quotations attributed to the United States Attorney to the effect that a special fraud squad had been setup that the chief of that fraud squad had been relieved of all other duties and was to be concentrating on these cases, thereafter exclusively, and that he also indicated or is quoted as having indicated that he expected indictments within two weeks."
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2001.643,2005.213,"As of that time, should he be indicted then?"
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2005.213,2009.845,"Your Honor, our position is that it is a rule or ought to be a rule of reason."
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2023.757,2027.21,Was your rule was the conspiracy?
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2027.21,2029.202,I am sorry Your Honor; I did not understand the question.
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2029.202,2038.006,"There is a possibility of eight people conspiring, you assume there is one, you do not know the other seven. You can not indict that one right then and there?"
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2038.006,2044.089,"I do not think so Your Honor, I think again that would be one of the factors to be considered and when the government ought to proceed for an indictment."
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2044.089,2054.379,"But do you think that every indictment now, that you expect the Court to find out whether it should have been handed up in June instead of August?"
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2054.379,2055.078,"No, Your Honor."
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2056.538,2061.797,"Well, what is your -- this is the third time, I am still trying to get what is your rule?"
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2061.797,2065.4,Our rule --
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2065.4,2079.574,"The rule that we believe ought to be applied is one of notice, simple of notice to the government, consisting with all of the various factors which bear upon the rapidity with which a case ought to be brought to prosecution."
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2079.574,2083.344,Federal Trade Commission did not give notice?
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2083.344,2084.813,It did give the defendant notice --
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2084.813,2087.824,It gave you a cease-and-desist notice.
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2087.824,2093.322,"Our position is that, it is the notice to the government, when does the government objectively know --"
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2093.322,2100.883,But did not the government assume that you had ceased-and-desisted?
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2100.883,2111.192,"I am sure that it could assume that it had ceased-and-desisted, yes sir, yes Your Honor and that in fact was the case."
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2111.192,2113.257,"They did not have to indict then, did they?"
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2113.257,2114.469,I do not believe so Your Honor.
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2114.469,2115.396,"Well, when?"
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2115.396,2117.688,Within a reasonable time thereafter.
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2117.688,2119.853,What time?
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2119.853,2141.872,"Again, it would be consistent with all of the facts of the case that the government have -- was there a fugitive defendant, for example."
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2141.872,2156.01,"Well, I assume that you said to the District Court, to Judge Hart, that two-and-a-half years is pro se too long period."
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2156.01,2176.14,"No, Your Honor."
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2176.14,2179.189,"Per se, I mean per se?"
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2179.189,2191.477,"Per se, except to the extent that prejudice maybe inferred or presumed from the lapse of time in the attrition of his memory, his ability to respond to these stale charges."
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2191.477,2201.495,So now if that rule is applied then anybody that is indicted four years after the crime automatic files a motion and is dismissed?
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2201.495,2206.91,"I do not believe so, Your Honor."
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2206.91,2211.103,All mail fraud cases?
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2211.103,2219.212,"Again, not in all mail fraud cases."
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2219.212,2225.33,The means burden put on the government to show why it took four years?
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2225.33,2237.122,"I think the burden, ultimately, would devolves upon the government to show why they have waited after the defendant had assumed the burden of showing that the government had objective notice of the existence of the crime and that it --"
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2237.122,2242.654,"And that was four-and-a-half years after that, clearly, that is all the defendant shows?"
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2242.654,2247.325,"In a case such as this, I would think so."
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2247.325,2250.892,And if the government does not remand it this way?
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2250.892,2260.892,"If the government does not sustain its burden of explaining why the delay was as extensive as it was, given those circumstances."
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2260.892,2263.931,You got any case you can cite on this?
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2263.931,2280.677,"Well, Your Honor, perhaps, the most recent exposition of the considerations involved is Mr. Justice Brennan's concurring opinion in the Dickey versus Florida case in which all of these considerations are explored."
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2280.677,2284.425,Did he say per se automatically?
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2284.425,2287.234,"No, Your Honor I do not believe he said per se."
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2287.234,2288.678,(Inaudible)
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2288.678,2299.336,"He did not say that it was a per se rule but we are not contending for a per se rule, we are simply contending for a rule in which there is a rule of reason as to the time which the government is to be advised to go forward."
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2299.336,2316.566,"(Inaudible) that most stop fraud and other types of cases, in mail fraud cases, they barely get it in before the statute of limitation."
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2316.566,2331.79,"If the government had had a reason for delaying four years in this case, it could have been advanced before Judge Hart and was not."
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2331.79,2338.096,"Yes, but that is not the ground that you did listed, you just listed on the grounds that two-and-a-half years is too long; that is what he said."
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2338.096,2346.255,He found that there was bound to have been an attrition of the memory of the defendants in this case.
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2346.255,2350.272,Do you want us to sustain that?
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2350.272,2351.254,"Yes, Your Honor I do."
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2351.254,2357.768,Which means it makes way to all two-and-a-half year indictments to go out as of now?
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2357.768,2365.038,"Well, I do not know where the period two-and-a-half years derives, Your Honor, that last event charged in the indictment, charge occurred in January of 1967."
1971.70-19,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2365.038,2370.33,"Well, all four-and-a-half years indictments go out."
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2370.33,2394.604,I do not believe that this requires a per se rule as to four year delays.
1971.70-19,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2394.604,2400.871,On what evidence did Judge Hart break make that finding?
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2400.871,2404.044,The finding as to the attrition of the individualâ€™s memory?
1971.70-19,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2404.044,2404.637,Yes.
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2404.637,2406.264,I think he presumed it.
1971.70-19,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2406.264,2410.044,Yes.
1971.70-19,1,42864,thomas_penfield_jackson,,2410.044,2434.206,"He had no evidence, that is correct, no testimony as to actual prejudice."
1971.70-19,2,39326,r_kent_greenawalt,,3182.638,3444.502,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-19,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3444.502,3449.043,Thank you Mr. Greenawalt.
