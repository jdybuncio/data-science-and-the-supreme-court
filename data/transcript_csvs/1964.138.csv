1964.138,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,2902.571,2904.206,May it please the Court.
1964.138,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3000.535,3019.082,[Inaudible]
1964.138,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,3019.082,3026.593,I do not believe Your Honor and it is not my concept that the National Mediation Board would be bound to accept that.
1964.138,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3027.692,3031.708,[Inaudible]
1964.138,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,3031.708,3044.701,What has basically happened in these situations is that the so-called agreements have fallen within the craft or class lines that the Mediation Board has laid down and that's exactly and precisely what happened here.
1964.138,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3074.196,3089.254,"You mean, therefore [Inaudible] statutory for this craft or class that [Inaudible]"
1964.138,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,3089.254,3091.811,"Yes, I think -- I think that's the way I interpret Your Honor."
1964.138,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3097.839,3102.836,And you say that the question is one ultimately be determined by the Board rather than by the employees --
1964.138,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,3102.836,3102.858,Right.
1964.138,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3102.858,3104.085,-- and to that extent you differ with the Solicitor General?
1964.138,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,3104.085,3105.195,That's right.
1964.138,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3106.131,3114.233,(Voice Overlap) the Board has rejected -- have there been instances where the Board has rejected employees' definitions of craft or class?
1964.138,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,3114.233,3114.441,Oh!
1964.138,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3235.097,3244.349,"Well, does it necessarily to follow that -- that it's not someone -- they would have rights to be heard or participate in the hearing instead of getting this a review?"
1964.138,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,3244.349,3244.791,No.
1964.138,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3250.077,3251.11,This would be the [Inaudible]
1964.138,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,3251.11,3263.591,-- of what is heretofore been considered rights and I think it will and it will encourage lawsuits just as you have a lot of lawsuits now pending I understand in the District Court as the result of these lawsuits.
1964.138,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3272.305,3284.505,"This is because -- is this because you the rule might be that -- that carrier has a right to be heard by the Board, it doesn't mean that after the Board has acted, that it can be second guessed by the Court?"
1964.138,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,3284.505,3297.001,"Well, it does mean Your Honor very clearly that any carrier can come in on any representation dispute and demand a hearing and under those circumstances, the statutory requirement of 30 days would be impossible to --"
1964.138,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3297.001,3303.142,"Yes, unless -- unless you put there's going to be a judicial review, you don't need to talk about two and a half years."
1964.138,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,3303.142,3321.616,"Well, in this case Your Honor, before we ever got to the point of judicial review, almost nine months had elapsed in this situation because of the -- what had been going on between the Board and the parties."
1964.138,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3321.616,3324.238,Mr. Bernstein.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,3324.238,3326.942,"May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice."
1964.138,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3513.863,3518.682,What is the difference between you being a party and a witness as far as putting the fact before the Board?
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,3518.682,3522.072,"Well, the fact of the matter is that it makes no difference, as de facto it makes no difference --"
1964.138,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3522.072,3531.609,"If you want to -- I mean if you want to cutoff the judicial review part of it of which the witness couldn't get, what difference does it make whether you're a party or a witness?"
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,3531.609,3534.15,"Well, the fact of the matter is that we -- this is why that it's taking --"
1964.138,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3534.15,3534.994,-- or either?
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,3534.994,3536.31,-- I agree with you Your Honor.
1964.138,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3548.583,3549.926,But you didn't get either here?
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,3549.926,3551.785,"We got neither, we got neither."
1964.138,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3625.332,3627.553,Is this in your brief?
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,3627.553,3630.254,I have the reference but not the quotation.
1964.138,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3663.421,3665.965,What does that -- what does necessary mean?
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,3665.965,3667.917,"Well, it was certainly necessary there where there was --"
1964.138,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3667.917,3668.045,"No, I mean what --"
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,3668.045,3669.301,-- a dispute between the carrier --
1964.138,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3669.301,3671.912,-- what's necessary here?
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,3671.912,3672.664,Yes sir.
1964.138,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4032.667,4041.619,"In your view of the statute, whose element function is it to determine the -- a craft or class in any given case?"
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4041.619,4045.46,"The determination, the duty and power is that of the National Mediation Board."
1964.138,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4045.46,4046.333,Of course that's where you just (Voice Overlap) --
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4046.333,4046.863,No question.
1964.138,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4046.863,4047.781,-- with the Solicitor General.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4047.984,4048.622,That's right.
1964.138,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4048.622,4050.398,-- he says the function of the employees or their --
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4050.398,4050.661,That's correct --
1964.138,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4050.661,4051.257,-- representative?
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4051.257,4057.892,And I -- I would like to delve into the legislative history a bit to establish clearly that it was not the employees who had that right.
1964.138,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4069.913,4071.912,You've got -- you've got to qualify what you just said.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4071.912,4072.24,Yes sir.
1964.138,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4072.24,4085.153,"It maybe that -- that maybe the Board is holding the authority where there's a dispute, but what is it -- is it still your position that the Board may disagree with every union that's involved in the case?"
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4085.153,4085.462,It may.
1964.138,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4085.636,4094.817,"All unions come in and agree that -- that the unit should be so and so, or the craft should be so and so, then you'd say the Board still has the authority."
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4094.817,4095.02,The Board still --
1964.138,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4095.02,4095.853,That's what the Solicitor General's point --
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4095.853,4096.497,Yes.
1964.138,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4096.497,4099.3,"-- I thought that when they all agree, the Board is out of it."
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4099.3,4102.243,"He says, when they all agree, the Board cannot do anything else."
1964.138,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4102.243,4102.497,That's right.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4102.497,4103.094,That's what he says.
1964.138,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4103.91,4110.086,"Well, except for example, if the unions agree that they're going to include supervisors --"
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4110.086,4110.095,Oh yes.
1964.138,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4110.095,4111.115,-- then the Board might say no.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4111.115,4113.296,"Oh, of course, we're talking about employees who fall within the definition."
1964.138,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4113.296,4113.827,Right.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4113.827,4115.519,"Yes sir, of course."
1964.138,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4125.425,4125.64,But if this --
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4125.64,4126.207,-- this very thing.
1964.138,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4126.207,4133.096,-- those other cases we're talking about where they agreed to -- where they agreed to have a narrower unit.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4141.211,4149.678,"Well sir, I have cited one example which I read earlier from the NLRB itself where there was -- and the Solicitor also says that there's only one union involved and that's enough also."
1964.138,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4152.144,4152.587,Alright --
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4152.587,4153.684,This Northeast case --
1964.138,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4153.684,4157.22,-- (Voice Overlap) the one -- so there was no dispute and the one union wanted a narrower unit.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4157.22,4162.319,"That one union wanted a broader unit in the case I cited and the employer protested, and the hearing was held on the point."
1964.138,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4162.319,4162.938,And -- and the Board --
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4162.938,4165.41,And the Board came out with something else actually.
1964.138,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4165.41,4167.192,So it -- it did overrule the --
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4167.192,4167.296,That's correct.
1964.138,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4167.296,4167.844,-- overrule the other --
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4167.844,4167.942,That's correct.
1964.138,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4167.942,4168.68,-- union involved.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4168.68,4169.082,That's correct.
1964.138,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4171.294,4173.241,And what is it you're referring to this language of (Voice Overlap) --
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4173.241,4175.269,Page 60 of this -- yes.
1964.138,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4665.069,4675.801,Do you think that this case is just a -- this Board or something or the Board really -- do you think it barred the policy about hearing carriers?
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4675.801,4676.346,I --
1964.138,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4676.346,4677.547,How about this case?
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4679.2,4682.303,This is the 1963 case which came up after our case.
1964.138,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4682.81,4685.908,But still they quote in variables [Inaudible]
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4685.908,4689.62,"Yes, but however the Board did allow the carrier to participate."
1964.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4711.553,4714.431,"Your argument is based on the constitutional ground, isn't it?"
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4714.431,4715.779,"Yes sir, ultimately, ultimately."
1964.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4743.103,4745.922,But you don't claim the statute applies here?
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4745.922,4748.248,The statute does not require a hearing per se.
1964.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4762.064,4771.383,"If you process this further -- a hearing, why wouldn't [Inaudible] judicial review of it?"
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4771.383,4782.008,"Well sir, we -- we -- I think it would require judicial review if after hearing, you came out with an arbitrary decision, but I think if the Board did here (Voice Overlap) -- pardon sir."
1964.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4782.008,4783.728,Most of the hearings are based on based on that.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4794.466,4797.307,"I -- sir, I do not believe it does."
1964.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4826.518,4828.968,"But the union would have the same right, wouldn't it?"
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4828.968,4829.341,No sir.
1964.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4830.922,4837.723,You mean the union -- you are holding that the constitution requires a hearing to be given to the company but not given to the union?
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4837.723,4838.262,You held in this --
1964.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4838.262,4839.322,Is that your argument?
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4839.322,4841.535,"My argument is -- yes, that's correct at this point."
1964.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4841.535,4845.91,"Well, why would the company have any more right to a hearing than the union?"
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4845.91,4846.009,The union --
1964.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4846.009,4847.51,Constitutionally speaking.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4847.51,4861.119,"Constitutionally speaking Your Honor, the union has no constitutional right to be a collective bargaining representative and this is what the basis of the holding in the Switchmen's case because the observation was made that the right had been created by Congress."
1964.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4877.399,4878.237,I --
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4878.237,4878.493,We're not asking for that.
1964.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4878.493,4883.628,I don't see how if you're entitled to a hearing by the constitution.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4891.206,4897.96,I think that the difference is Your Honor that you could set it aside on our petition only if we could demonstrate that it was absolutely contrary to any of the evidence that was presented --
1964.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4897.96,4898.457,You mean --
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4898.457,4899.304,The ordinary standard.
1964.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4899.304,4900.642,-- arbitrary unreasonable?
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4900.642,4902.287,"That's correct, that's correct."
1964.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4902.287,4906.99,"That can always be alleged and you got to look all of it, I don't see why -- maybe it's right, it should (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4906.99,4907.844,Yes.
1964.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4907.844,4913.527,But I don't see why your argument doesn't leave the fact that you're hearing to each side.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4917.805,4919.341,It may well --
1964.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4919.341,4919.86,What if they (Voice Overlap) --
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4919.86,4924.065,The fact of the matter is Your Honor that the Board has always accorded the union hearing.
1964.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4926.048,4926.678,That was in fact --
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4926.678,4926.913,-- (Voice Overlap) in this case.
1964.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4926.913,4928.343,-- the constitutional argument.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4928.343,4930.356,"No, but that would be a statutory argument."
1964.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4932.581,4933.765,But yours is a constitutional argument.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4933.765,4934.514,That is correct sir.
1964.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4966.149,4966.173,We're not asking --
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4966.173,4966.91,-- to exercise its duty.
1964.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4966.91,4968.76,-- about the overruling of Switchmen's.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4978.978,4979.867,Well --

1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4980.802,4986.207,"Well sir, it may well be but I -- it seems to me that it is not necessary to get to that point because we are not asking --"
1964.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4986.207,4986.352,Not yet?
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4986.352,4991.702,-- for any substantive determination of our -- a review of any substantive determination of the Board.
1964.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4997.766,4998.912,That's all you have now.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,5007.405,5009.165,"Well Your Honor, we may come to that."
1964.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5010.598,5014.102,I'm not saying that's not a wise thing or a good thing.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,5014.102,5028.372,"The Switchmen's case as you know has created a great deal of trouble in this area, but I don't think we have to overrule that to get to this point because the Switchmen's case was a review of a subsequent request for a review of a substantive determination which we are not asking."
1964.138,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5028.372,5034.465,There's no contention in Switchmen's that you need to file for not having a hearing before the Board?
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,5034.465,5035.485,Full and exhaustive hearings.
1964.138,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5035.485,5040.923,So the contention that the mere ground [Inaudible]
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,5040.923,5041.44,That's correct.
1964.138,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5041.44,5042.682,[Inaudible]
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,5042.682,5042.874,That's correct.
1964.138,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5042.874,5051.795,And your claim is really a dignified claim to right to intervene.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,5051.795,5055.954,"Well, toward that sir, we think we're a party to the craft or class aspect of this dispute."
1964.138,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5055.954,5057.913,So it comes down to that.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,5059.543,5060.044,Alright.
1964.138,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5080.759,5083.846,"Well would you -- that's what they did recently in Eastern Airlines, don't they?"
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,5083.846,5084.222,Yes.
1964.138,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5084.222,5084.905,And --
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,5084.905,5086.347,They're doing it right now with United Air Lines --
1964.138,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5086.347,5086.635,Yes.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,5086.635,5087.464,-- and in other cases.
1964.138,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5087.464,5090.786,And yet -- would you'd be content with that?
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,5090.786,5092.135,"Well certainly, we could contend with that."
1964.138,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5093.988,5100.371,"Presumably -- presumably though, you were not a party then you would not have a right to seek review with any adverse decision either."
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,5100.371,5101.238,"Well, there is -- so long as --"
1964.138,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5101.238,5103.627,Any decision that displeased you if you were not a party.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,5103.627,5109.141,"Mr. Justice Stewart, so long as Switchmen's stands, I think it is -- as Mr. Justice Black points out, there is -- there is no review --"
1964.138,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5109.141,5109.53,Right.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,5109.53,5110.78,-- by a union or anybody.
1964.138,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5110.78,5110.997,Right.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,5110.997,5113.987,There's simply no review of any determination of the Board.
1964.138,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5115.795,5120.365,"And the Board just lets you in there as a -- as a witness, would that satisfy you?"
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,5120.365,5122.846,If they let us in to make our position clear.
1964.138,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5122.846,5124.815,And if -- and if they listen to you?
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,5124.815,5126.741,"That's right -- and listen to it, pay some attention to us (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.138,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5126.741,5128.087,That's all that you're asking now.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,5128.087,5128.865,We -- that's correct.
1964.138,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5155.493,5166.666,Then the Switchmen [Inaudible]
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,5166.666,5169.001,"Well sir, we're in a little different position."

1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,5269.945,5270.634,Which aspect sir?
1964.138,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5271.88,5273.757,Not voting is the same as voting no.
1964.138,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,5273.757,5274.251,That's correct.

1964.138,3,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,6296.988,6300.041,We're looking at the ballot on page 64 of the --
1964.138,3,15399,alex_l_arguello,,6300.041,6320.04,There's ballot on page 111 and 112 -- or 112 and 113 of the transcript of this case from the Court of Appeals that sets forth the ballot itself and the instructions to the ballot which is a clear one.
1964.138,3,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,6343.274,6349.586,The wording is at page 64 of the Solicitor General's brief.
1964.138,3,15399,alex_l_arguello,,6349.586,6352.437,"It states, no employee is required to vote."
1964.138,3,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,6480.147,6489.614,"Well, isn't this rather hypothetical in your organization when you're advising the people, I would take it as you have a right to as to what their rights are."
1964.138,3,15399,alex_l_arguello,,6493.32,6498.189,"Well, the answer to that is simply this Mr. Justice."
1964.138,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6642.199,6642.578,What would you say --
1964.138,3,15399,alex_l_arguello,,6642.578,6643.438,-- their opinion.
1964.138,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6643.438,6650.907,-- the union involved brought in signed contract by majority and no election was ever held.
1964.138,3,15399,alex_l_arguello,,6654.101,6665.872,"I think in that situation, if the National Mediation Board made a decision to proceed by taking up signed cards that this was -- is within the rights of the Board."
1964.138,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6702.057,6703.52,Pursuant to the Board policy?
1964.138,3,15399,alex_l_arguello,,6703.52,6704.01,Yes.
1964.138,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6704.01,6704.634,[Inaudible]
1964.138,3,15399,alex_l_arguello,,6704.634,6716.437,"So I think, however, we're not concerned with that problem because here, the Board decided that it was going to have an election, what they might have done otherwise, we're not objecting certainly."
1964.138,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6716.437,6731.984,"Do you really think it isn't equivalent at this stage United's instruction that the employees could not be simply told, Don't cast the ballot, don't take a ballot or if you do one, don't mark it in depositing, do you think that there's something (Voice Overlap) --"

1964.138,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6734.642,6735.766,-- (Voice Overlap) in the present situation.
1964.138,3,15399,alex_l_arguello,,6735.766,6741.556,"Yes, and I think that the -- there are two reasons from my feeling that way."
1964.138,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6751.292,6753.455,But that isn't what this says.
1964.138,3,15399,alex_l_arguello,,6759.848,6764.633,That's correct and this creates in my mind a great area of confusion.
1964.138,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6794.085,6797.696,What's unclear about this statement is it is perfectly clear.
1964.138,3,15399,alex_l_arguello,,6804.652,6826.142,"Well, I think the Solicitor in his brief, his reply brief on page 5 agrees with me that the work of the Mediation Board has become and will be considerably more complicated in view of the finding in the Virginian case."
1964.138,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6839.285,6839.793,This Court permitted --
1964.138,3,15399,alex_l_arguello,,6839.793,6841.466,-- and its answer to it is --
1964.138,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6841.466,6848.055,The Court permitted a less prescriptive test and the Board has now imposed upon itself.
1964.138,3,15399,alex_l_arguello,,6849.8,6868.662,"Well, the reason is [Attempt to Laughter] that the Board then goes on to say that this being the case that they will have to remain free, especially in the situation in which the balloting did not produce an absolute majority of the voting members for one union or another."
1964.138,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6918.987,6920.696,Mr. Solicitor General.
1964.138,4,15704,archibald_cox,,6920.696,6929.306,"Mr. Chief Justice, I will be very brief; just a few points with respect to craft or class that I think I should address myself to."
1964.138,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7068.971,7076.064,"Mr. Solicitor General, what can be obtained that the -- that the problem we're talking about didn't happen with others --"
1964.138,4,15704,archibald_cox,,7076.064,7086.567,"I think if you look and I'm sure you will in the brief, if you find the one union cases, there are four of them, are not at all this case."
1964.138,4,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,7168.218,7171.24,What about the [Inaudible]
1964.138,4,15704,archibald_cox,,7171.24,7179.186,"The impending case as I understand it, there are two unions and they are taking conflicting positions."
1964.138,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7219.57,7219.845,Well --
1964.138,4,15704,archibald_cox,,7219.845,7231.202,"The preceding sentence was one which said, the Court did not err when it dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction under the Railway Labor Act, only the Mediation Board."
1964.138,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7231.202,7238.427,"Well, in your case, the conflict can be pursued with the employer may properly [Inaudible] admitted whether they're witness or a party."
1964.138,4,15704,archibald_cox,,7238.427,7248.265,The Board's practice when it wanted to get information from him has been to invite him to participate.
1964.138,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7266.846,7269.025,Is the union a party?
1964.138,4,15704,archibald_cox,,7269.025,7270.29,"The unions are parties, yes."
1964.138,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7270.29,7272.021,And that's after the term --
1964.138,4,15704,archibald_cox,,7272.021,7275.976,The unions are made party by the statute.
1964.138,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7288.431,7292.258,So you think -- do you think that means they would have to do this voting?
1964.138,4,15704,archibald_cox,,7292.258,7302.47,I think any union having an interest would have to be heard and the reason I say the carrier is not entitled to be heard in this case because I think there's no open substantive issue.
1964.138,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7302.47,7319.101,"Mr. Solicitor General, just so I can get your position clearly, you say that its not only the practice of the Board is to follow what the union say when there's no dispute but you, you go further and say that the Board is duty-bound."
1964.138,4,15704,archibald_cox,,7319.101,7327.708,"That's the way I read the statute, provided -- with only one classification and it's very slight -- I think this does have to be a cognizable craft --"
1964.138,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7327.708,7328.04,Or between that?
1964.138,4,15704,archibald_cox,,7328.04,7337.811,"-- or class, yes."
