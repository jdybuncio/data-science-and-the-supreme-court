2018.17-1702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.28,8.89,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 17-1702, the Manhattan Community Access Corporation versus Halleck. Mr. De Leeuw."
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,8.89,36.505,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Careful adherence to this Court's state action cases is necessary in order to preserve the lines between government action and private conduct. The challenged conduct -- the purpose of the test is to determine whether it is -- whether private action falls into the very rare exception of conduct that is fairly attributable to the state."
2018.17-1702,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,73.45,73.68,But MNN --
2018.17-1702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,73.68,74.53,"Well, you say --"
2018.17-1702,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,74.53,96.985,"-- was engaged by the city to administer a scheme that was determined by state and city law, that is, to afford access on a first-come, first-served basis, giving MNN no independent judgment about what will air or when it will air."
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,112.525,116.605,"Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg, that's not quite correct."
2018.17-1702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,151.83,152.36,I'm sorry.
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,193.125,209.94,"So the -- the -- the answer to that is that MNN does have discretion on the placement rights on -- which are not placement rights that the city has but placement rights that, through the grant agreement, are directly to MNN. And MNN does have the power to --"
2018.17-1702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,209.94,213.165,Only because it's the agent directly of the state.
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,221.92,224.64,"Well, that's not quite true, Justice Sotomayor."
2018.17-1702,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,263.84,264.26,Mr. De Leeuw --
2018.17-1702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,264.26,270.97,"Are these -- the facts that you've been talking about in terms of your cure -- that you curate the content, are they disputed in the case?"
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,270.97,271.58,Yes.
2018.17-1702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,271.58,274.505,In the case that you point out comes before us on the pleadings.
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,274.505,276.92,"Well, again, these issues were not on the pleadings."
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,308.66,311.035,"Sorry, were you finished?"
2018.17-1702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,311.035,311.805,Yeah.
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,311.805,331.875,"Look, your brief, the PSC regulations require that content on public access channels be ""non-commercial"" and that access must be ""on a first-come, first-served non-discriminatory basis."" So what is your discretion?"
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,331.875,337.15,So our discretion is based on -- that -- that is what the regulation says.
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,337.15,338.29,And that's what you say.
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,338.56,339.19,"Well, that's what we say and --"
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,339.19,340.23,-- so what is your discretion?
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,340.23,341.47,And what the regulation says.
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,360.51,379.33,"Well, put -- putting shows on Channel 14 rather than Channel 16 wouldn't seem like relevant discretion, would it? I mean, what's broadcast out, whether it's 14 or 16, is absolutely determined by this rule."
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,382.6,385.825,That -- that's true. We do not prescreen videos.
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,390.03,390.42,All right.
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,392.32,392.41,Okay.
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,392.41,394.21,-- which I can't get out of the brief.
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,398.42,399.515,Correct.
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,399.515,402.985,And two of them are chosen by the government?
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,402.985,403.89,Correct.
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,403.89,405.835,How are the other 13 chosen?
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,405.835,408.18,The other -- the other 11 are chosen through a --
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,408.18,408.63,"Eleven, yeah."
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,408.63,415.69,"-- I believe there's a nominating committee on the Board that nominates people from media, from entertainment, from --"
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,415.69,418.08,And who creates the nominating committee?
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,418.08,419.23,The -- the Board.
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,420.84,434.155,So -- but why -- then that's your -- the -- the -- it's a self-perpetuating board? The other members are chosen by a nominating committee.
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,443.17,445.13,That's -- they're not even chosen by the government.
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,445.61,450.62,Are the other 11 members governmental people or have no governmental connection?
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,450.62,452.0,They have no governmental connection.
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,455.93,457.63,"Well, why didn't you put that in the brief?"
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,457.63,458.54,Nominated.
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,458.99,460.01,Did you put that in your brief?
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,460.01,471.82,"I believe it's in -- I believe it's in there somewhere, but the -- the -- the -- the dispositive issue was that the -- that the city of -- the borough president only has the ability to nominate two out of the 13."
2018.17-1702,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,471.82,472.48,Suppose that --
2018.17-1702,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,472.48,493.19,"Mr. De Leeuw, what would you think is the right result if you had the obligation that you think you don't have? In other words, just assume for the moment that you did have to follow a first-come, first-served rule and that you didn't have the discretion that you think you have over programming. What would then the right answer be?"
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,493.19,505.87,"The right -- the right answer, Justice Kagan, would be that the Respondents or -- or any other producers that have a complaint with us go to the Public Service Commission, which has a specific cause of action that one can bring if you go --"
2018.17-1702,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,505.87,508.6,"Well, I guess I'm going back to Justice Ginsburg's question."
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,525.02,537.44,"Well, I think that -- I think that it just -- it doesn't do that because there's a long line of cases from this Court that said that regulation of a private entity is not enough to bring it within the ambit of a state action."
2018.17-1702,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,537.97,539.9,So you would say it's because you're private?
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,539.9,540.85,We are private.
2018.17-1702,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,540.85,541.15,Yeah.
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,559.095,565.385,So the issue of whether there is a property right is certainly something that was not addressed below.
2018.17-1702,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,592.98,637.815,"Well, you can talk about it as an easement or you can just talk about it as a contract right, but -- but these cable operators would not be able to function unless the government had given them these public rights-of-way. And in exchange for giving them these public rights-of-way, the government says: Well, we're going to take certain stations and we're going to decide what the programming for those stations will be. And, you know, given that the whole thing doesn't get off the ground unless the government gives the cable operators the rights-of-way and that it -- it exacts a quid pro quo for that, why isn't there, call it what you want, a property right coming from a contract or an easement or whatever?"
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,637.815,677.025,"Well, specifically, the -- the -- Justice Kagan, what the contracts don't do is that they don't give the city the right to choose what content is going to be on the public access channels. The -- the -- the city -- the -- pardon me, the franchise agreement specifically gives the government the right to decide what's going to be on the government and education channels, which are -- are -- are different. And it says that those actually have to be overseen by a committee of the -- appointed by the city. The -- the other side of that is the public access, which is a different concept. Public access, there is no requirement that the government operate it."
2018.17-1702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,722.07,725.395,"The city can kick you out at any time, right?"
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,725.395,726.79,I don't know that that's true.
2018.17-1702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,734.33,744.7,"Well, I don't know that it's the same principle in this context, but at -- at least with respect to federal appointees, usually the power to appoint carries with it the power to -- to fire."
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,744.7,747.52,"And, again, I -- we don't know the answer to that."
2018.17-1702,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,779.88,804.03,"Well, maybe all this depends on whether there's some sort of recognized property interest involved, but maybe it doesn't. And if we step back and ask who owns, in the colloquial sense at least of the word, these channels, is it the cable company or is it the government, what would your answer be?"
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,804.03,806.07,My answer would definitely be the cable company.
2018.17-1702,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,806.07,814.5,"How can that be? The -- I mean, the cable company didn't decide that it wanted to dedicate these channels to this purpose, and it doesn't control what's on these channels."
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,822.67,834.49,"But the ownership right of the entire cable system -- and I don't think this has been disputed -- is the cable -- is the cable operator, so in this case Charter. Now -- what's that? Pardon me?"
2018.17-1702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,834.49,839.015,"Physical goods, that's like the railroads owning the railroad track."
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,839.015,839.65,Correct.
2018.17-1702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,839.65,856.805,"But for decades now -- not for decades -- for centuries, our cases have recognized that the railroad can own -- can own the tracks, it can own the switches, it can own the depots, but there's still a government access right to the use of the rail -- of the -- of the tracks."
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,856.805,856.94,Right.
2018.17-1702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,857.09,865.76,"So, here, the government controls the content of what's on those cables."
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,865.76,866.42,No.
2018.17-1702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,873.0,874.89,That's never -- that's always the case with property.
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,874.89,875.29,Sure.
2018.17-1702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,875.43,888.34,Property is a right -- a prop -- a property right is a right or privilege to use something to the exclusion of others or to the exclusion of the other owners.
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,891.27,891.615,Right.
2018.17-1702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,896.69,900.06,Did you want to -- did you want to complete your answer to Justice Alito?
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,900.06,908.67,"So -- yes, I'm sorry. Justice Alito, the -- the -- to us, the issue is about control and who is controlling the public access channels."
2018.17-1702,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,919.37,928.66,"Well, suppose the city appointed MNN to decide who would have access to a facility in Central Park."
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,928.66,929.53,Okay.
2018.17-1702,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,929.53,935.94,Would you say MNN is not -- MNN is not then a state actor in exercising that authority?
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,935.94,946.42,"So, if I understand the hypothetical, so the idea is that MNN is taking on a role of managing parades or something in Central Park?"
2018.17-1702,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,946.42,953.555,"Well, let's say there's a place where people can go and speak in Central Park or there is a -- a facility where concerts are put on."
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,953.555,953.72,Right.
2018.17-1702,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,953.72,961.78,"And -- and the city enters into exactly the kind of agreement it has with MNN, MNN, and says you -- you -- you're in charge of this."
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,961.78,962.395,Right.
2018.17-1702,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,963.1,964.41,Are you then a state actor?
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,964.41,968.065,I think it's a much closer call because of the public function test.
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,985.535,986.23,What is the -- the -- the --
2018.17-1702,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,986.23,989.825,What is the difference between Justice Alito's hypothetical?
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,989.825,994.77,"Well, so the main difference is that the public function test has never been read broadly."
2018.17-1702,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1000.765,1008.13,"Well, let's say that the city has decided we want a public theater. And so it creates a public theater."
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1028.055,1037.05,"So I guess the other -- the -- the one additional fact I'd want to know in the hypothetical is, is it -- is it city property? Is it a theater that is owned by the city?"
2018.17-1702,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1037.05,1037.33,Right.
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1039.48,1039.59,Okay.
2018.17-1702,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1039.59,1043.08,"-- is, is it property, and then we're back to the question that we started with."
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1043.08,1043.22,Right.
2018.17-1702,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1043.69,1044.91,But put that aside for a moment.
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1044.91,1048.43,"Putting that aside -- putting that aside, I would say that the answer is no."
2018.17-1702,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1068.39,1071.88,"Well, the government says we set the rules about how this is going to operate."
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1099.38,1111.2,"Well, again, in -- in this Court's decision in Jackson versus Metropolitan Edison, a regulation like that, even -- even pervasive regulation of a private entity, does not convert that private --"
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1111.2,1111.39,All right.
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1130.57,1131.15,Yes.
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1131.15,1143.45,"Do you have the power to say this evening we wish to discuss subways; tomorrow at 4:00, we will discuss the public schools? All right."
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1166.14,1172.58,So we have the power to -- to put on shows at specific times.
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1175.45,1175.93,Shows.
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1199.4,1203.03,We have the -- we have the power to organize it to some degree.
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1203.03,1204.55,What -- to what degree? (Laughter.)
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1204.55,1210.87,"Well, so to the degree related to the -- to -- to the grant in the grant agreement, which allows --"
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1210.87,1211.87,That doesn't help me.
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1211.87,1212.22,Okay.
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1212.22,1215.04,"You see, I have a simple factual question."
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1223.81,1224.755,Okay.
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1224.755,1227.765,"Now do you have to let me, yes or no?"
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1227.765,1230.82,"Well, it would depend on who else has submitted tapes and whether or not --"
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1230.82,1235.92999995,"Well, somebody else has submitted a tape that they'd like to discuss schools."
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1241.06,1241.25,Right.
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1241.25,1242.52,What is it?
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1242.52,1246.72,"Well, your -- I mean, I think the -- the answer is that your show will -- will get on."
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1248.1,1248.27,All right.
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1248.27,1249.35,-- you want it to? No.
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1249.35,1252.785,But I -- I will come third.
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1252.785,1253.16,Okay.
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1253.16,1253.94,"First-come, first-served, is that right?"
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1253.94,1254.61,Correct.
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1254.61,1256.15,So it has to be a jumble?
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1256.15,1257.75,"Well, it doesn't have to be a jumble."
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1258.31,1260.57,"Of course -- of course, it might be coincidence that it isn't --"
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1260.57,1260.68,No.
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1261.04,1263.25,-- but you have no power not to make it a jumble?
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1263.25,1268.42,"No, that's not true. We do have power to have some -- some ability to organize our channels."
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1268.42,1268.905,What?
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1268.905,1280.93,The -- we can decide that shows that are appropriate for children will be shown in the morning and shows that are appropriate for adults will be shown at night. We can decide that we will cluster a series of shows about New York hot dogs.
2018.17-1702,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1289.51,1302.29,"Does your -- does your argument depend on having editorial discretion? In other words, if you have no editorial discretion at all, do you still win under Jackson? Is that your theory?"
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1302.29,1304.49,We -- we still win under Jackson.
2018.17-1702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1332.235,1340.135,But none of those cases involved the state or the government designating something a public forum.
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1356.49,1359.92,"Well, so the government makes a lot of decisions."
2018.17-1702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1367.76,1370.77,But not all of them are designated public forums.
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1370.77,1371.01,"No, that's --"
2018.17-1702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1371.01,1372.625,Many of them are limited.
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1372.625,1374.15,"That's true, but to -- but to create --"
2018.17-1702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1374.15,1375.58,But this one is very different.
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1384.33,1384.59,Right.
2018.17-1702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1427.86,1427.92,So --
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1427.92,1428.78,"And to have that, you need state actors."
2018.17-1702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1428.78,1441.395,"-- what's the difference -- if we go back to the questions my colleagues asked earlier, the city rents a theater, doesn't own it, but rents it or leases it or somehow takes possession of it through contract."
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1458.13,1459.28,"Well, I -- I --"
2018.17-1702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1459.28,1460.885,I -- I -- I don't understand.
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1463.6,1465.53,"Who is ""they"" have to clean it? The -- the private owner?"
2018.17-1702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1465.53,1469.55,"The administrator has to get it cleaned, has to provide security --"
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1469.55,1469.76,Yeah.
2018.17-1702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1470.0,1498.25,"-- has to sort of organize the -- the hours, et cetera, but, nevertheless, the city says this -- we've -- we rent the property, we have the power to tell you keep it open, keep it free, keep it first-come, first-served; your only ability to restrict is time, place, and/or obscenity and other illegal conduct."
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1498.25,1521.58,"Well, it sounds like -- like that situation would be different than ours because it sounds like it would be closing in on Burton versus Wilmington Parking Authority, where there is a symbiotic or joint connection between what the city is doing and what the private entity is doing. Now there's no allegations with regard to MNN that there's anything like that, no symbiotic relationship, no entwinement with the city at all."
2018.17-1702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1521.58,1523.33,But why do you need that?
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1523.33,1524.16,"Well, that's -- that's --"
2018.17-1702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1524.16,1535.6,"If the city rents it, says this is how we're going to use it, this is the way it's going to be used, why do you need anything more? What greater control do you need?"
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1535.6,1542.44,"The greater control you need is you need the -- the -- the forum to be operated by a state actor, by someone that can be --"
2018.17-1702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1542.44,1542.7,So now --
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1542.7,1543.7,-- fairly said to be so called --
2018.17-1702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1543.7,1552.28,-- now we have the state eluding responsibility by simply figuring out how to have adequate independence.
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1552.28,1553.56,"Well, I don't think that that --"
2018.17-1702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1553.56,1561.445,"In designating public functions, all it has to do is say we're just going to tip it over the line a little bit."
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1561.445,1563.48,"Well, I don't think that that's a particular concern."
2018.17-1702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1563.48,1564.99,Or keep away from the line a little bit.
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1564.99,1571.98,"There are -- first of all, I don't know of many designated public fora that are controlled by -- by independent parties."
2018.17-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1575.08,1576.16,"Well, a prison, for example?"
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1576.16,1578.44,What's that? So prisons are -- prisons are different.
2018.17-1702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1592.71,1593.41,"Thank you, counsel."
2018.17-1702,0,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,1593.41,1598.34000015,Thank you.
2018.17-1702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1598.34000015,1604.91,Mr. Hughes.
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1604.91,1614.675,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is a public forum because New York has generally opened property that it controls for speech."
2018.17-1702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1632.335,1634.09,"Well, I think they just did dispute it."
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1649.81,1651.44,"So -- so two things about that, Your Honor."
2018.17-1702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1670.22,1678.48,"Well, but it seems to me a significant departure from first-come, first-served in that they can -- the programming -- they're curating the programming."
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1692.705,1694.75,"Well -- well, let me use an example, Your Honor, that may help."
2018.17-1702,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1724.49,1725.82,"I don't -- I mean, my goodness."
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1746.465,1751.86,"No, of course not, Your Honor, because public forums are limited to those forums that the government itself chooses to hold --"
2018.17-1702,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1751.86,1752.05,All right.
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1755.56,1756.32,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1702,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1756.32,1763.2,That these are the features that they -- that -- that lead someone to say it's not governmental or it is.
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1770.39,1771.3,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1702,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1771.3,1771.54,All right.
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1835.995,1836.2,Yes.
2018.17-1702,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1836.2,1845.5,"I'm suggesting that I am genuinely uncertain about this, and I brought out the issues to try to get you to focus on them."
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1845.5,1846.12,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1702,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1965.14,1967.91,You referred to public function.
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1975.78,1976.305,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1702,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1976.305,1980.265,How do you suggest that this qualifies under those precedents?
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1980.265,1992.51,"So, Your Honor, I think what the exclusive public function test looks to is really two factors. First, is this the kind of function that requires a delegation of state sovereign authority? If it is, it's the kind of thing that exclusively states can do."
2018.17-1702,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2034.1,2046.025,I don't understand why leasing or operating a public access channel is -- is akin to one of these traditional public functions that are described in the cases.
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2047.1,2047.84,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1702,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2072.72,2073.25,Why isn't this --
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2073.25,2073.86,-- orthopedic services.
2018.17-1702,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2073.86,2074.36,Sorry to interrupt.
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2094.24,2099.785,Both the two factors that -- that I think are necessary for exclusive public function are missing in the utility context.
2018.17-1702,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2120.99,2121.08,Does --
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2121.08,2121.99,-- constitutional obligations.
2018.17-1702,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2121.99,2128.925,"-- does your position depend on our finding a governmental property interest and, if so, what is the interest?"
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2128.925,2151.17,"Your Honor, I think our position is certainly strengthened by the fact that the government controls in all relevant respects. We do think that the Court needs to draw lines between where the government can designate a property as public forum and -- and -- and where it cannot. And one line that's been suggested by Justice Thomas's opinion in Denver Area is a place, a property where the government can legitimately control as its own."
2018.17-1702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2162.09,2174.305,"Your -- your idea that you can control, is that based solely on your power which your -- your friend called into question to terminate the operator?"
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2174.305,2183.29,"So it's -- it's several things, Your Honor, just to walk through how this -- where the control comes from. First, it's the state and the city that decide even if public access exists."
2018.17-1702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2188.97,2189.16,Okay.
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2191.61,2196.635,"Well, once we have somebody in place, many cities in New York run this themselves."
2018.17-1702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2208.66,2208.75,Okay.
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2210.24,2210.72,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2222.07,2222.35,Right.
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2227.36,2228.59,"It -- yes, Your Honor, it does."
2018.17-1702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2228.59,2232.385,"So, because you have the power to terminate, you have the power to select programming?"
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2232.385,2242.58,"Your Honor, it's -- I'm not sure the city has the -- they've delegated that power to select programming in -- in the short term, but, again, there's really no power to select programming because anybody's program who wants to be -- who wants to run --"
2018.17-1702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2242.58,2254.26,"Well, we've already established that there's some wiggle room at least in that since you can have the hot dog program, and you can have the subway program, regardless of whether the subway people wanted their shows before the hot dogs."
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2254.26,2262.475,"The critical thing is, if the hot dog program wants to come on, there's nothing MNN can do to say you cannot access this forum. It's the same way of going to Central Park."
2018.17-1702,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2268.86,2275.69,"But your -- your brief puts a lot of weight on the fact that this is a -- this has to be first-come, first-served. But suppose it wasn't."
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2282.535,2288.29,"If it has discretion so it can exercise editorial control, then it would not be a public forum."
2018.17-1702,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2288.29,2293.955,"Editorial control. See, here is -- if I think back, maybe you can help me with this."
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2360.515,2360.93,And --
2018.17-1702,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2360.93,2364.46,"You see, that's -- so -- so what do you -- have you ever thought about that? What is the --"
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2364.46,2378.995,"Yes, Your Honor, and let me address that directly, because, in our view, the states and localities have complete control as to decide whether they want to have a system that New York has that leads to these First Amendment consequences or if they prefer to have a system, for example, as California has. California has no first-come, first-served requirement."
2018.17-1702,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2389.12,2389.3,"Well, this --"
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2389.3,2389.87,-- that exercises control.
2018.17-1702,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2389.87,2393.825,-- this comes back to what I wanted to follow up with on the question that I asked before.
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2418.3,2422.96,"Well, Your Honor, I think it just depends if the state/locality has chosen to create a public forum."
2018.17-1702,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2443.5,2450.77,"If -- if the government is running something and it allows people to speak, it seems to me there -- there are two possibilities."
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2461.745,2462.75,"No, Your Honor."
2018.17-1702,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2464.82,2465.09,If -- all right.
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2468.865,2469.5,"Well, I think --"
2018.17-1702,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2469.5,2479.14,"So you're not -- you just -- they -- they empower the administrator to decide who's going to talk, and the administrator chooses the viewpoints that it likes."
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2480.85,2483.12,"If -- so that would be a private forum, Your Honor."
2018.17-1702,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2511.16,2526.12,"It's not so modest, because it seems to me what would make sense here is that you have to go to the state. You're claiming that you come here because there is the very obligation that you want, imposed by state law and the state."
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2526.12,2526.92,But --
2018.17-1702,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2526.92,2528.39,And that's the reason you're up here.
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2550.62,2555.05,"But, Your Honor -- and to take the example of Good News Club and -- and Lamb's Chapel --"
2018.17-1702,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2555.05,2555.11,Yeah.
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2555.11,2563.92,"-- and school access cases, and Christian Legal Society and all of those cases, those are cases that turn on underlying state determinations. The -- this Court was clear in Good News Club."
2018.17-1702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2589.085,2610.715,"So can you explain the flip of what I think may be troubling -- I may be wrong -- Justice Breyer is -- and -- and Justice Alito? If this is the administrator for the state -- I know you sued the state, the city here, but you then dismissed your case against it."
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2610.715,2611.13,Right.
2018.17-1702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2611.13,2614.045,Could you have just sued the city and not MNN?
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2614.045,2621.335,There was a claim initially brought against the city that was dismissed for failing to show the city directly caused this under Monell.
2018.17-1702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2627.63,2630.755,So you think the city would be protected by Monell theories?
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2630.755,2638.81,"I think that's right, Your Honor, because the actor who's choosing to -- to engage in the activity that's -- engaging in viewpoint discrimination is MNN in this context, but they are acting --"
2018.17-1702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2638.81,2642.16,"Its agent, its -- its administrator as agent?"
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2642.16,2643.42,"That's -- that's correct, Your Honor."
2018.17-1702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2643.87,2646.92,So it would be like the police officer who uses excessive force?
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2646.92,2647.83,"Correct, Your Honor. Yes."
2018.17-1702,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2647.83,2658.33,"Where -- where's the line that -- that you think -- I mean, what you said, essentially, is the -- the administrator has no discretion."
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2689.755,2695.295,So -- so this just turns on the Court's limited and unlimited public forum cases.
2018.17-1702,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2759.61,2761.715,Go back to Justice Sotomayor for a question.
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2775.835,2775.87,MNN.
2018.17-1702,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2775.87,2776.035,MNN.
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2785.875,2790.01,"Well, so, Your Honor, what Petitioners have suggested is that we turn to the Public Service Commission."
2018.17-1702,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2802.37,2804.545,Could you get court review of that under New York law?
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2804.545,2805.24,"Sorry, Your Honor?"
2018.17-1702,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2805.24,2808.66,Can you get court review of that adverse decision by the Public Service Commission?
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2808.66,2811.85,"I'm not aware of any private cause of action in that context, Your Honor."
2018.17-1702,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2824.43,2832.45,"No, no, but I want to know what you think on this, because it could be that this rule, first-come, first-served, is just hortatory, if there's no remedy for it."
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2832.45,2835.5,"Well, Your Honor, I think it's the --"
2018.17-1702,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2835.5,2838.09,Or a violation of it. You're saying they violated it.
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2843.07,2870.63,"Well, a few things to say about that, Your Honor. First, Petitioners point to the Public Service Commission case of Amano, which they suggest shows that they have discretion. But, when you read Amano, that's -- which is the regulator here, it says the reason that Brooklyn's access stations were permissible is because they had channels that were operated on a first-come, first-served basis, and that the -- the petitioners in Amano had not pointed to any content that anybody had asked that channel to run that was not actually put over the airwaves."
2018.17-1702,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2905.69,2906.71,I'm your client.
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2910.575,2913.63,"I'm not aware of any remedy that you would have in state court, Your Honor."
2018.17-1702,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2918.015,2918.23,You --
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2918.23,2918.645,So --
2018.17-1702,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2918.645,2921.37,You've referred a few times to the school access cases.
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2923.735,2925.49,"That's right, Your Honor. So I think our --"
2018.17-1702,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2925.49,2931.32,"So, here, just to make sure I'm following, MNN is a private company, correct?"
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2931.32,2931.76,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1702,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2931.76,2939.14,"And operating a channel on a cable system that's also private, privately owned?"
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2939.14,2940.55,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1702,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2940.55,2945.745,"And it's heavily regulated by the state, right? So it's not government property."
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2967.195,2967.86,"Well, Your Honor --"
2018.17-1702,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2967.86,2969.0,It's government property there.
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2969.895,2972.1,"Well, two things just about the school access cases."
2018.17-1702,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3002.53,3023.695,"My point is simply it's a private company operating a channel on another private company's system, and it's forced in terms of how it exercises its discretion to do so in a particular way by the government. But that just means it's heavily regulated in terms of its editorial discretion. You're melding, I think, the public forum question with the state action question."
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3023.695,3028.92,"Well, I think the utility, though, that Your -- Your Honor's referencing is -- is akin to the cable operator."
2018.17-1702,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3031.94,3035.01,"I think the question, Mr. Hughes, is what property interest does the government have?"
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3035.01,3040.97,"Yes, and so -- so, to get to that, Your Honor, thank you, the property interest that is -- is quite distinct here is the interest in the channel."
2018.17-1702,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3046.64,3052.62,"And it obtained that interest when it gave the rights-of-way to the cable operator, is that right?"
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3052.62,3053.15,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1702,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3053.15,3059.6,What it took back or what it reserved for itself was a property interest in these public access channels?
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3059.6,3068.47,"Yes, Your Honor, in the franchise agreement, part of the quid pro quo agreement where the -- the city gives the cable operator the access to public rights-of-way, which is critical to them constructing their system."
2018.17-1702,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3075.24,3078.54,So what you're saying is this is not just a lot of regulation.
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3087.99,3089.02,"Absolutely, Your Honor. That's --"
2018.17-1702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3089.02,3089.27,Tell me --
2018.17-1702,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3089.27,3089.82,But doesn't that have --
2018.17-1702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3089.82,3092.07,-- what is the interest that it reserved for itself?
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3092.07,3111.645,"The interest it reserved for itself is to control a select number of channels and to place the content that it wishes over those channels. In many cities in New York, like Buffalo and Scarsdale and others, the cities have retained that property interest and operate, administer that property interest themselves. The question in this case is when they administer -- when they delegate that administrative right."
2018.17-1702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3111.645,3117.885,Where -- where does it say that they retain the interest over the content on the channel?
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3117.885,3121.81,"Sorry, on -- on -- when -- when the administration of the delegation occurs, Your Honor?"
2018.17-1702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3121.81,3124.635,"Yeah, I thought that's where you were telling me they reserved that property right."
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3130.79,3137.28,"Well, so, Your Honor, what has happened in this context is the city has set the speech rules, which includes the first-come, first-served, which we believe is critical."
2018.17-1702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3137.28,3137.51,Okay.
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3160.68,3162.52,"What it means is it's general access, Your Honor."
2018.17-1702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3190.42,3191.58,So whenever it says --
2018.17-1702,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3191.58,3191.92,Talk more --
2018.17-1702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3191.92,3196.91,"In -- in your brief, whenever it says first-come, first-served, I should substitute the words ""general access""?"
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3196.91,3199.74,"That's what we -- is the relevance of first-come, first-served, yes, Your Honor, to us."
2018.17-1702,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3199.74,3205.16,"So, if the government imposes a first-come, first-served requirement on a private company --"
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3205.16,3207.62,So I think that's a very different --
2018.17-1702,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3207.62,3213.53,"-- what happens then? Because that's some of the hypotheticals, as you know, raised in the amici briefs about Twitter and YouTube and the like."
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3213.53,3213.9,Absolutely.
2018.17-1702,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3213.9,3214.16,So what's --
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3214.16,3222.19,"Absolutely, Your Honor. So, of course, there has to be a balance between the sovereign's authority to designate non-traditional forums and -- and private property. There are two ways the Court can approach that."
2018.17-1702,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3223.185,3229.31,"But I thought you said to the Chief Justice that the reservation of first-come, first-served is what gave you the property interest."
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3229.31,3229.57,Yeah.
2018.17-1702,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3236.75,3241.69,"Well, that's -- that's -- but what gave you the property interest if it's something other than the first-come, first-served? It seems certain --"
2018.17-1702,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3241.69,3252.475,What gives you the property interest is that you've given over the rights-of-way and you've kept access to -- to -- you've kept the rights to determine how to use public access channels.
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3256.58,3256.96,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1702,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3268.84,3277.405,"So, if a utility gets rights-of-way from the local government, does that give the local government the -- does that make the utility a state actor?"
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3277.405,3287.975,"I -- I don't think it makes the utility a state actor in that context because there's no performance of the public function that requires, again, delegated sovereign authority in exercise of something that is carefully tied to a constitutional obligation."
2018.17-1702,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3291.06,3298.1,The language -- I'm repeating myself -- but the language that we've used in the cases is traditionally exclusively a public function.
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3307.12,3312.85,"But -- but, Your Honor, that's, again, why I don't think one can define this away by coming up -- by plucking out some activity that's not traditional."
2018.17-1702,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3342.44,3355.99,"But you -- you agree -- if you prevail here, you agree that it would be different if it were a private company -- we all agree it's a private company -- that operates in open forum, Justice Breyer's General Motors example."
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3355.99,3356.46,Absolutely.
2018.17-1702,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3356.46,3361.37,"The government can't require first-come, first-served on that, and --"
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3361.37,3376.825,"Absolutely, Your Honor. And that's either because there's a blanket rule saying you cannot impose a public forum on government -- on property the government cannot control, or one would look to Justice Rehnquist's opinion in PruneYard, where Justice Rehnquist says there are takings and compelled speech problems. I think those two results probably -- those two approaches probably come to the same result."
2018.17-1702,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3379.6,3398.625,"But it's not so clearly different because, in the United States, there are vast numbers of different kinds of arrangements between government and private people, ranging from agency to General Motors. And, of course, if you say public park, if that's what it is, you win in my opinion."
2018.17-1702,1,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3412.52,3413.81,"Just very brief, Your Honor."
2018.17-1702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3421.26,3423.575,"Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. De Leeuw."
2018.17-1702,2,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,3423.575,3424.6,Thank you.
2018.17-1702,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3525.6,3532.35,But the city retained the right in the franchise agreement to dedicate this to the public use?
2018.17-1702,2,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,3532.35,3533.09,"Well, I want to --"
2018.17-1702,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3533.09,3535.19,To designate this a public forum?
2018.17-1702,2,63097,michael_b_de_leeuw,,3535.19,3541.49,"Well, the -- the -- the franchise agreement does not dedicate this as a public forum."
2018.17-1702,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3624.04,3625.035,"Thank you, counsel."
