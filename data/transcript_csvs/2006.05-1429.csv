2006.05-1429,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.606,"We'll hear argument next in 05-1429, Travelers Casualty and Surety Company versus Pacific Gas and Electric Company."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,11.991,14.76,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1429,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,84.837,87.689,Can you tell me... this is just basic bankruptcy.
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,119.343,120.827,"It depends, Justice Kennedy."
2006.05-1429,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,125.212,132.968,"It's the standard, it's the standard attorneys' fee provision, all attorneys' fees in connection with collection of this note and enforcement of the terms of this note."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,132.968,135.587,"--Then, yes, Justice Kennedy, I would say it probably would be covered."
2006.05-1429,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,138.17,141.823,Is there something where I can look that up in Collier?
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,146.025,147.342,"--Yes, Justice Kennedy."
2006.05-1429,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,174.145,174.645,"No, no."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,179.497,180.616,"--Yes, Justice Kennedy."
2006.05-1429,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,205.481,206.849,Could you just back up just for a second?
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,215.789,216.505,Right.
2006.05-1429,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,216.505,226.577,"Now, in that case, are you saying that routinely the lawyer recovers fees in the bankruptcy case even if the debtor, the debtor was insolvent?"
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,230.631,238.368,"Exactly, yes, Justice Stevens, if in fact, though, the creditor bothers to assert the claim for fees in the bankruptcy case."
2006.05-1429,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,252.395,253.747,"Well, why wouldn't it be worth... I know here."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,259.048,265.971,"Well, because there's a transaction cost in actually filing the additional claim setting forth the amount that you've incurred."
2006.05-1429,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,274.91,280.731,"Are you telling me just based on your experience that in Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, normally, no fees are recovered?"
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,280.731,284.849,"Normally, there's no distribution on unsecured claims in most bankruptcy cases."
2006.05-1429,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,285.433,295.407,"But assuming in those cases where there's some distribution, is it correct, as I'm assuming your answer to Justice Kennedy's question, that the normal practice is you don't bother because there is not enough involved?"
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,295.407,297.274,"Typically, Justice Stevens, that is correct."
2006.05-1429,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,301.811,316.404,"Just in the hypothetical, I would think that in many cases, there's going to be some payout for the promissory note, and the holder of the note tells his attorneys: Make sure I get that claim in bankruptcy."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,327.645,330.664,"--For the work done in performing, filing the proof of claim, that's correct."
2006.05-1429,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,342.672,346.756,"The pre-petition contract, but not out of pre-petition conduct."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,346.756,348.208,"--That's correct, Justice Stevens."
2006.05-1429,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,358.247,366.17,"Okay, but you're one step ahead of that here, because here there hasn't been any, in effect, any exposure."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,388.333,391.535,"Justice Souter, it's different in this sense."
2006.05-1429,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,401.26,403.226,"And so far as we know, it won't."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,403.226,406.045,"But it has, because when PG&E filed for bankruptcy--"
2006.05-1429,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,406.045,409.847,"Well, it has, but that depends on a totally circular argument."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,426.059,429.41,"--Justice Souter, you can visualize bankruptcy itself as being a default."
2006.05-1429,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,433.629,439.016,"You can call bankruptcy a default, but that's not what I mean, and you know that's not what I mean."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,442.67,443.187,"--Yes, sir."
2006.05-1429,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,443.187,451.693,"There has been no default on the workers comp obligation, and because they intend to keep on running this business, there is reason to suppose that there will not be."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,451.693,456.661,"Well, by analogy, Justice Souter, in the LTV case, the same posture at the beginning of the case."
2006.05-1429,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,461.182,464.584,"Yes, and maybe you don't have a claim at the beginning of the case."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,478.343,483.228,--But that's precisely the point of why claim is defined so broadly to include contingent claims.
2006.05-1429,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,483.228,488.616,"But if it is defined as broadly as this, we're in a situation exactly like this."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,499.507,501.457,"Absolutely false, Justice Souter."
2006.05-1429,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,510.045,516.385,"All right, in this case, $167,000 has been spent to come to the conclusion, as I understand it."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,533.745,541.601,"No, Justice Souter, because if you look at what Section 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code does, it provides that a plan of reorganization binds all parties."
2006.05-1429,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,552.141,555.343,But that's not what this bankruptcy court thought about the claim.
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,560.562,563.999,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but I think we need to distinguish two different things."
2006.05-1429,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,580.809,588.248,And I don't... there was never a time that the plan said we are not going to pay our workers' compensation.
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,588.248,591.533,"The problem, Justice Ginsburg, is that the plan said nothing at all."
2006.05-1429,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,628.559,632.593,I thought there was a section of the code that preserved subrogation rights.
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,632.593,635.128,"--That's Section 509, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-1429,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,635.128,635.512,Yes.
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,635.512,637.497,But that's not what I was speaking of just momentarily.
2006.05-1429,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,690.463,702.607,"Let's assume, let's assume that one of the recipients of comp payments had come forward and said: I object to the plan, I have a claim for comp payments and I object to the plan because it doesn't provide for them."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,724.853,726.22,We would not have done that work.
2006.05-1429,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,729.971,730.506,"No, I know it."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,735.375,739.529,"Well, with respect to the, the treatment of the workers under the plan, no."
2006.05-1429,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,741.229,743.314,With respect to any interest of Travelers?
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,743.314,744.014,"--Yes, Justice Souter."
2006.05-1429,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,744.014,746.95,"If that had been done, would Travelers have asserted a claim?"
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,746.95,747.633,"Yes, Justice Souter."
2006.05-1429,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,747.633,748.052,What?
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,748.052,755.956,"We would have said, in our proof of claim, as we did: If we must make payment in the future, we are entitled to two things."
2006.05-1429,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,826.885,828.051,Correct me if I'm wrong--
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,828.051,828.701,That's how bankruptcy works.
2006.05-1429,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,828.701,849.298,"--In... in this case, I thought that if a contingency claim for indemnification is not allowed, but if it becomes fixed at some time, then the claim can be made and is not lost."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,849.298,850.231,"No, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-1429,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,858.904,861.856,I'm talking about 502(e)(1).
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,861.856,871.414,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, if your reimbursement claim is contingent, it will be disallowed, subject to reconsideration under Section 502(j)."
2006.05-1429,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,909.622,917.526,"In any case, this has nothing to do with the, Fobian, so-called Fobian issue, whether the Ninth Circuit drew the bright line."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,917.526,918.895,"Correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-1429,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,927.334,927.834,Are they--
2006.05-1429,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,927.834,928.283,Question--
2006.05-1429,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,928.283,932.785,"--Let me just ask you about the Fobian, and I know Justice Breyer has a question."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,941.641,942.693,"--It depends, Justice Kennedy."
2006.05-1429,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,946.295,947.462,In this case.
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,947.462,950.314,"--In this case, that would be a determination under State law."
2006.05-1429,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,952.632,960.805,"So... so if the bankruptcy judge isn't sure of what the amount is, he looks to State law to determine the amount?"
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,960.805,962.255,"Yes, Justice Kennedy."
2006.05-1429,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,964.49,967.059,But the bankruptcy court does determine reasonableness.
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,967.059,969.927,"--If State law provides for it, and all States do."
2006.05-1429,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,976.764,979.599,--I'm sort of back where Justice Kennedy started on this.
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1018.658,1019.26,The security--
2006.05-1429,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1019.26,1023.645,And there must be other instances in which there wasn't any security.
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1038.137,1039.188,--And in--
2006.05-1429,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1039.188,1045.328,"Overage in the secured case, and the whole claim in the unsecured case."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1048.946,1049.696,"--Absolutely, Justice Breyer."
2006.05-1429,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1049.696,1057.718,"My question is, I have 19 professors on the other side coming to tell me that that's never happened."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1091.69,1093.141,Justice Breyer it happens all the time.
2006.05-1429,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1102.997,1103.53,"No, no."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1108.401,1108.868,"Correct, Your Honor."
2006.05-1429,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1108.868,1113.638,"The cost of filing the claim, the cost of talking to the bankruptcy judge, et cetera."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1113.638,1114.222,"Correct, Your Honor."
2006.05-1429,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1134.418,1138.337,"But what I don't... there is a body of law on the other side of that issue, too, isn't there?"
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1138.337,1140.322,"--There is, Justice Stevens, but those are lower court decisions."
2006.05-1429,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1140.322,1140.722,Yes.
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1143.324,1145.99,"Well, compared to this Court, certainly, Justice Stevens."
2006.05-1429,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1145.99,1146.859,That's exactly right.
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1157.132,1165.737,"Justice Stevens, I think it's important to say that the alternative rule that PG&E asked for is one that every court of appeals to have addressed has rejected."
2006.05-1429,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1196.875,1202.863,"You would have thought that the one group of people who ought to know this thoroughly, or at least have a view are the bankruptcy bar."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1202.863,1203.146,Well--
2006.05-1429,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1203.146,1210.366,"And, and yet there are no briefs from them; there are not... there is no article that I could find in Bankruptcy Journal."
2006.05-1429,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1210.366,1215.336,"Well, there may be no briefs from them because it isn't the question on which we granted cert, is it?"
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1215.336,1216.686,"--Chief Justice Roberts, that's correct."
2006.05-1429,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1231.246,1236.5,But it would be proper to remand for the Ninth Circuit to consider those other arguments?
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1236.5,1237.25,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-1429,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1259.282,1264.853,On both their statutory interpretation and the contract?
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1264.853,1267.555,"The contract, reasonableness, all of those issues."
2006.05-1429,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1324.939,1326.324,"One quick question, if I may."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1335.329,1336.513,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
2006.05-1429,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1339.881,1340.715,"Thank you, Counsel."
2006.05-1429,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1340.715,1343.917,Thank you.
2006.05-1429,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1343.917,1345.233,Mr. Rosenkranz.
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1345.233,1348.119,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1429,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1357.141,1366.83,"And can we be, take one step before that and tell us if you are conceding that the Fobian rule has no basis in the statute and is wrong?"
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1366.83,1371.9,"--Your Honor, the Fobian rule reaches the correct conclusion in this case, but Your Honor is correct."
2006.05-1429,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1385.208,1391.529,"Well, if you say it doesn't go far enough then I infer from that you say that it's valid as far as it goes?"
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1391.529,1397.183,It is valid as far as it covers this case but not on the rationale of the Ninth Circuit.
2006.05-1429,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1412.692,1420.148,"I'm not sure I agree, Counsel, that the Fobian rule is both narrower and broader than the question you try to present."
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1426.535,1427.002,"No, Your Honor--"
2006.05-1429,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1427.002,1428.321,Why... it doesn't?
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1428.321,1430.304,"--No, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-1429,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1443.097,1454.186,"So if you're an oversecured creditor with a claim for attorneys' fees arising under solely issues of matters of Federal bankruptcy law, the Fobian rule doesn't prevent that?"
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1454.186,1455.138,"No, Your Honor."
2006.05-1429,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1460.375,1461.042,"Well, not everyone."
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1461.942,1463.327,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2006.05-1429,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1477.068,1481.622,"If it is a rational predicate, we might have expected to hear about it in the opposition to certiorari."
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1481.622,1482.256,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1429,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1531.721,1537.792,"No, it's an ambush and it is smuggling in the sense we don't have a court of appeals decision one way or the other on that question, do we?"
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1537.792,1549.433,"Your Honor, we do have court of appeals decisions on this precise question, not in this case because the court of appeals had Fobian and the rule that underlay Fobian for 20 years."
2006.05-1429,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1551.166,1553.802,Justice Ginsburg has a question I'm very interested in.
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1555.67,1556.72,"--We do not, Your Honor."
2006.05-1429,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1566.644,1573.798,"Well, why then isn't the proper disposition of this case to send it back to the Ninth Circuit to consider all these other arguments?"
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1573.798,1579.035,"--Well, Your Honor, because this issue has been fully ventilated among the lower courts."
2006.05-1429,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1579.035,1583.171,"Yes, but we are not a court of first view and you know that very well."
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1595.712,1597.414,"Yes, I understand that, Your Honor."
2006.05-1429,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1600.949,1603.401,I understand that because they have the Fobian rule.
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1603.401,1603.785,--Yes.
2006.05-1429,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1664.725,1665.775,Let me ask you a question about that.
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1677.116,1681.585,"--Your Honor, we would dispute the contractual interpretation, but yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1429,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1681.585,1683.337,"But assuming, assuming the contract provides that."
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1683.337,1684.403,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1429,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1684.403,1689.84,And if that's true... and the reason for that I suppose is that doesn't impair the rights of the general creditors at all.
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1689.84,1692.292,That's one logic of the--
2006.05-1429,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1692.292,1699.981,"If that's so, why isn't their argument that, well, your client is solvent, the complete answer to your position?"
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1699.981,1702.298,"--Well, Your Honor, because Congress didn't say that."
2006.05-1429,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1724.878,1726.913,They argue it in their reply brief here.
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1726.913,1729.615,"Yes, Your Honor, and that is absolutely incorrect."
2006.05-1429,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1746.91,1751.362,"Well, how do you avoid... what about their statement from Collier?"
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1751.362,1763.253,"Your Honor, the statement that Travelers quotes from Collier is about a proposition that we don't dispute, which is whether it is a pre-petition claim."
2006.05-1429,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1764.454,1764.921,No.
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1801.528,1810.65,"Your Honor, my response is I urge you, Justice Breyer, to look back at Colliers, because that is absolutely accurate and it doesn't apply to this case."
2006.05-1429,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1810.65,1811.167,Because?
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1811.167,1821.958,"Because, Your Honor, that is a statement about whether it is a pre-petition claim, not about whether the claim is allowable or not, which is what we are arguing about."
2006.05-1429,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1821.958,1823.577,Then you explain that to me?
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1823.577,1824.543,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1429,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1849.708,1854.762,"Well, that's because 506 had to do that in order to tell the bankruptcy courts--"
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1857.381,1858.048,"--No, Your Honor."
2006.05-1429,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1858.048,1866.987,"That doesn't... and then you have the negative inference or the exclusio unius argument, whatever, which I think is misplaced in this context."
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1866.987,1883.846,"Your Honor, Congress put 506(b) in the code for one purpose and one purpose only, and that was to allow claims that are not elsewhere allowed, because if it doesn't do that 506(b) serves no purpose at all."
2006.05-1429,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1888.317,1894.637,Why doesn't it serve the purpose of saying that the fees will be covered by the security?
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1915.385,1923.323,"Your Honor, the answer is 506(b) does not say anything about whether the allowed claim is secured or not."
2006.05-1429,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1975.856,1979.743,"Of course, that is exactly what's puzzling me."
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2009.762,2010.746,"Your Honor, Congress said--"
2006.05-1429,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2010.746,2012.648,Same puzzlement.
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2012.648,2015.683,"--Your Honor, Congress has said no such thing."
2006.05-1429,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2040.949,2047.285,Suppose I sell you a house and I make a promise that I'll fix any leaks in the bathroom.
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2058.56,2059.779,"--Your Honor, that is a claim."
2006.05-1429,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2060.594,2061.445,It is a contingent claim.
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2062.731,2065.414,--I'm saying... they are saying this is a contingent claim.
2006.05-1429,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2105.141,2105.524,No.
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2115.247,2117.699,"--Well, Your Honor, I was just going to get there."
2006.05-1429,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2130.373,2135.841,"Well, Timbers cited, as the Chief Justice indicates, the interest section in--"
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2140.062,2146.483,"Your Honor, Timbers has the structural argument that focuses on what the purpose of 506(b) is."
2006.05-1429,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2195.898,2200.85,"Well, are those 15 places... do they involve attorneys' fees as administrative expenses?"
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2207.123,2213.86,"--Your Honor, as to creditors, four of them apply to attorneys' fees as administrative expenses."
2006.05-1429,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2229.387,2230.637,What's the answer to my question?
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2237.725,2242.194,"Your Honor, for the, for creditors there are only six that apply."
2006.05-1429,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2244.262,2244.796,"All right, so six."
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2244.796,2245.379,Yes.
2006.05-1429,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2245.379,2254.168,"So six are administrative, and then the remaining two say that the creditor can collect it as an unsecured debt?"
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2254.168,2254.52,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1429,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2254.52,2255.737,Which are those two?
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2255.737,2256.287,"Well, one of them does."
2006.05-1429,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2256.287,2256.754,Which is that?
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2256.754,2264.543,That is the provision that Travelers cites... and I apologize it's not in any of the appendices... 502(b)(4).
2006.05-1429,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2293.395,2302.251,"That seems to cut the other way because it says it's disallowed insofar as it's unreasonable of course, and therefore it would be allowed insofar as it's reasonable."
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2302.251,2302.834,"Well, yes."
2006.05-1429,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2310.005,2311.69,"No, attorney for the debtor."
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2311.69,2315.391,"An attorney for the debtor and, Your Honor, the code is clear it's noteworthy."
2006.05-1429,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2315.391,2318.01,"Yes, but I mean you don't have exactly what I was driving to."
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2335.472,2336.072,Fair enough Your Honor.
2006.05-1429,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2336.072,2336.838,--irrelevant thing.
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2336.838,2338.174,"Fair enough, Your Honor."
2006.05-1429,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2356.901,2364.991,"Counsel, your brother in his reply brief said that no court of appeals has endorsed your theory, and I... earlier you told me one had."
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2366.074,2374.513,"Your Honor, the First Circuit... there are three courts of appeals that have addressed the question, all in dictum but in very extensive dictum."
2006.05-1429,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2395.593,2403.532,So you really want us to reach out and decide a question that's not presented when there has been no holding of the court of appeals one way or the other on the issue?
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2403.532,2407.568,"Your Honor, we didn't come here asking this Court to address this question."
2006.05-1429,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2410.32,2413.638,"If you thought the Fobian rule was wrong, you could have said that."
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2413.638,2420.744,"--Well, Your Honor, it would have made no sense for us to argue that Fobian was wrong when we were trying to defend the judgment below."
2006.05-1429,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2444.026,2445.309,How... can we decide?
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2476.063,2476.413,--That's exactly--
2006.05-1429,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2476.413,2477.915,That's an added complication.
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2484.902,2487.937,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
2006.05-1429,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2487.937,2490.337,So we still have to decide the Fobian issue.
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2503.613,2517.373,"Your Honor, I appreciate that, and I apologize for not having raised it in the cert petition, cert opposition, we were simply focused on why it is that this little sliver of the Fobian rule was not worth this Court's attention."
2006.05-1429,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2605.912,2610.447,"Yes, but that's not the facts of this case."
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2610.864,2611.747,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2006.05-1429,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2611.747,2619.136,"This will not have any adverse, if I understand the facts, any adverse impact whatsoever on any unsecured creditor."
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2619.136,2626.174,"--Your Honor, on the facts of this case if the rule had been otherwise, we don't know whether PG&E would have been solvent at all."
2006.05-1429,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2635.681,2646.12,"No, but just looking at this case itself, if there is plenty of money there to pay a State law obligation, why shouldn't just ordinary rules of contract law apply?"
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2646.12,2657.528,"Well, Your Honor, the answer is, Congress dealt with this issue and decided that no one gets to get in line and get their attorneys' fees, regardless of whether they're solvent or not."
2006.05-1429,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2658.078,2666.0,"--You're raising a provision that says just that, it's the absence of a provision for attorneys' fees that you're relying on."
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2666.0,2666.967,"--Well, no, Your Honor."
2006.05-1429,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2686.03,2690.749,Where is the provision that generally disallows attorneys' fees?
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2690.749,2691.601,I'm sorry.
2006.05-1429,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2715.299,2720.085,"Well, on that point you disagree with the Collier citation at page 9 of the reply brief then?"
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2720.085,2728.857,"--Yes, Your Honor, I disagree with Colliers, but I don't think Colliers comes out one way or another on this particular question."
2006.05-1429,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2736.047,2742.117,"Well, it says if the creditor incurs the attorneys' fees post petition in connection with protecting a pre-petition claim--"
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2742.117,2742.617,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1429,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2742.617,2743.434,--the fees will be pre-petition.
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2743.434,2744.653,That was the same--
2006.05-1429,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2744.653,2747.854,So you disagree with that?
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2747.854,2749.487,"--I don't disagree with that, Your Honor."
2006.05-1429,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2784.111,2788.646,You're saying this particular set of pre-petition obligations.
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2798.953,2799.753,"--No, Your Honor."
2006.05-1429,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2805.624,2813.963,"Oh, in other words what he implies, if I ready the whole page I'll see, although he just said what we quoted, the whole page means, by the way, I'm not telling you if you get the money or not?"
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2813.963,2817.415,This was a completely different discussion on a--
2006.05-1429,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2817.415,2818.232,"Sorry, I'll--"

2006.05-1429,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2820.684,2837.595,"--I think your 506(b) argument, I see your point, I see your point, is there... I mean, and you'd have to say well, 506(b) simply repeats 506(a), as sometimes provisions do, and then it becomes somewhat superfluous, somewhat not."

2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2938.861,2942.432,"Your Honor, I don't understand why a surety is different from any other contract."
2006.05-1429,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2986.794,3002.47,"Well, of course the argument here is that this is something different from the general abuse that you're describing, because the plan didn't make any provision here for, for paying the workers comp obligation at all."
2006.05-1429,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3003.753,3007.188,"Your Honor, my response is that is absolutely wrong."
