1985.84-1555,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,61.523,"Mr. Jett, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1985.84-1555,0,45120,wayne_jett,,61.523,64.021,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1555,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,148.315,153.984,"Mr. Jett, may I inquire just a moment."
1985.84-1555,0,45120,wayne_jett,,163.527,163.762,That is correct.
1985.84-1555,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,163.762,165.808,And not the employers?
1985.84-1555,0,45120,wayne_jett,,165.808,166.495,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1555,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,166.495,176.507,And you challenged below the determination that the plan was a defined benefit plan?
1985.84-1555,0,45120,wayne_jett,,176.507,177.319,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1555,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,177.319,177.804,And lost.
1985.84-1555,0,45120,wayne_jett,,177.804,181.35,"That was under the 1974 statute, that is correct."
1985.84-1555,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,181.35,186.143,"Okay, and that issue has been resolved against you and it's not part of this case?"
1985.84-1555,0,45120,wayne_jett,,186.143,186.784,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1555,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,188.596,197.905,So what's your interest as trustee in arguing the imposition of the withdrawal liability on the employers?
1985.84-1555,0,45120,wayne_jett,,197.905,200.419,"--Your Honor, it is this interest."
1985.84-1555,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,257.927,258.677,"Well, whose rights?"
1985.84-1555,0,45120,wayne_jett,,273.858,288.087,"--Well, Your Honor, as far as the trust and the relationship between the trust and the employer, the trust agreement establishes the trustees as responsible for the administration of the fund, including the integrity of the trust document."
1985.84-1555,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,305.627,311.264,"Well, in this case has the liability of the employers been determined?"
1985.84-1555,0,45120,wayne_jett,,315.981,317.231,Your Honor--
1985.84-1555,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,317.231,331.663,"It wasn't clear to me at all from reading the briefs whether we're just looking at this on the basis that there will be some liability imposed, but we don't know how much, or whether something has already been determined."
1985.84-1555,0,45120,wayne_jett,,339.083,349.124,"--The trustees have assessed, according to the statute, a liability against the particular employer who has intervened in this case and against other employers as well."
1985.84-1555,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,350.655,352.436,What about premiums?
1985.84-1555,0,45120,wayne_jett,,352.967,358.543,--The premium statute requires the payment of premiums by the trustee.
1985.84-1555,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,359.698,362.838,"But if you win this case, the premium... you don't pay premiums?"
1985.84-1555,0,45120,wayne_jett,,362.838,363.338,--That is correct.
1985.84-1555,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,363.338,366.477,"Well, isn't that a fairly substantial interest?"
1985.84-1555,0,45120,wayne_jett,,366.477,369.774,"Yes, Your Honor, that is certainly another interest that we have in it."
1985.84-1555,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,385.095,387.14,And isn't that one of the questions--
1985.84-1555,0,45120,wayne_jett,,387.14,388.187,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1555,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,388.187,389.109,--raised in this case?
1985.84-1555,0,45120,wayne_jett,,389.109,389.421,"Yes, it is."
1985.84-1555,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,389.421,401.495,"Do you mind going back to my question, then, and telling me how much has been determined that the employer here would have to pay?"
1985.84-1555,0,45120,wayne_jett,,401.495,412.131,"Woodward Sand Company has been assessed a liability of something in excess of $200,000, about 201, I believe, thereabouts."
1985.84-1555,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,423.58,427.126,Has there been judicial review of that amount yet?
1985.84-1555,0,45120,wayne_jett,,427.126,428.454,There has not been.
1985.84-1555,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,434.936,449.306,"How does that differ in total amount from what would have been determined had it been a defined contribution plan, a defined benefit plan?"
1985.84-1555,0,45120,wayne_jett,,449.306,455.21,"--Well, Your Honor, under that determination it treats the plan as a defined benefit plan."
1985.84-1555,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,464.533,465.142,"Yes, I misspoke."
1985.84-1555,0,45120,wayne_jett,,469.407,474.295,"It would have been zero, because a defined contribution plan would not be covered by this statute."
1985.84-1555,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,619.189,632.95,"Why is this much different than the Social Security Act that Congress passed in 1937, that says after such and such a date all employers pay such and such a tax for every covered employee that's covered by it?"
1985.84-1555,0,45120,wayne_jett,,635.245,646.271,"That, Your Honor, you see, is a statute, as we have cited in our brief, the Darlington case, in which it takes effect from that day forward and you go forward."
1985.84-1555,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,659.454,663.0,But haven't we held that some tax acts can be retroactive?
1985.84-1555,0,45120,wayne_jett,,663.0,669.028,"There can be... well, I would have to say this."
1985.84-1555,1,39274,richard_m_freeman,,1121.237,1124.846,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1985.84-1555,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1234.784,1238.595,"Mr. Freeman, may I ask you the same question I asked Mr. Jett."
1985.84-1555,1,39274,richard_m_freeman,,1245.53,1246.795,No.
1985.84-1555,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1251.747,1253.496,It's the money you have to pay?
1985.84-1555,1,39274,richard_m_freeman,,1253.496,1259.603,It's either the money we have to pay or the entire assets of the employer that have to be liquidated in order to pay that money.
1985.84-1555,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1260.728,1274.206,"And to clarify what you've just said a moment ago, there is to be no appeal from the arbitration award of the calculation of liability."
1985.84-1555,1,39274,richard_m_freeman,,1281.547,1282.39,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1555,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1399.234,1401.905,Were the ones here involuntary?
1985.84-1555,1,39274,richard_m_freeman,,1401.905,1403.171,Yes.
1985.84-1555,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1443.295,1468.848,"Well, nevertheless, I suppose that if you can't reach an agreement with the union at the next bargaining time and there's an impasse, would the entire withdrawal lability be assessed if you said: Look, I'm willing to go right ahead and make the payments based on what I have been paying."
1985.84-1555,1,39274,richard_m_freeman,,1468.848,1471.19,"Your Honor, that is exactly what the law provides."
1985.84-1555,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1548.285,1573.822,"Well, in looking at the taking clause cases in determining the issue that you raise, is it... do we normally look at whether there is some valid reason why Congress has imposed this liability on employers generally, rather than on the public at large?"
1985.84-1555,1,39274,richard_m_freeman,,1573.822,1575.228,"I would say no, Your Honor."
1985.84-1555,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1575.228,1575.494,No?
1985.84-1555,1,39274,richard_m_freeman,,1578.727,1586.881,"I would say that that's what the Government would like the Court to do, that somehow there is a rational basis for this, or under the due process clause."
1985.84-1555,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1587.849,1596.36,"Well, but is that part and parcel of the inquiry that's made to determine the takings issue routinely?"
1985.84-1555,1,39274,richard_m_freeman,,1596.36,1597.86,--I would say no.
1985.84-1555,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1671.925,1686.215,"Would it be your view, just to get it thought through, that there could never be a valid statute imposing withdrawal liability on an employer unless there was sufficient advance notice to let him out of the pension fund cost-free?"
1985.84-1555,1,39274,richard_m_freeman,,1686.215,1687.995,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1555,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1694.352,1698.351,"But apart from the advanced notice, you'd say, and no matter how small the obligation?"
1985.84-1555,1,39274,richard_m_freeman,,1711.283,1723.152,"--Yes, Your Honor, it would, because it would involve taking property from one party, transferring it to another, for a reason totally beyond the control of the party who is being deprived."
1985.84-1555,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1723.152,1726.73,May I ask if the record shows what your rate of contributions are?
1985.84-1555,1,39274,richard_m_freeman,,1729.369,1740.397,"I think the record will reflect that Woodward Sand Company contributed over 500 or $600,000 to the pension fund in the history that it had with the trust fund."
1985.84-1555,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1740.397,1742.458,"How much would that be per year, roughly?"
1985.84-1555,1,39274,richard_m_freeman,,1742.458,1745.801,"Approximately maybe $100,000 a year."
1985.84-1555,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1754.766,1755.578,Mr. Fellner.
1985.84-1555,2,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,1755.578,1764.309,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1985.84-1555,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1870.219,1875.92,"Precisely what conduct of the employer are you referring to, Mr. Fellner?"
1985.84-1555,2,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,1875.92,1883.511,"The conduct of the employer, Mr. Chief Justice, involved here is an inchoate business decision."
1985.84-1555,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1931.133,1968.79,"Well, I guess the worry here is the fact that the plan may have been one which is sponsored and effectively controlled by the union, not the employer, and the employer may have been induced to join it be representations by the union that their liability would be limited in accordance with the terms of the plan, and in fact their withdrawal may be automatically imposed without the fault of the employer, and yet here is this vast potential liability."
1985.84-1555,2,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,1974.053,1977.13,Those are the hard facts that are not before the Court.
1985.84-1555,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2005.821,2012.068,"Well, there is certainly evidence of an expectation that the liability would be limited."
1985.84-1555,2,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,2012.068,2015.068,That expectation flowed from contract.
1985.84-1555,3,45120,wayne_jett,,3442.725,3445.928,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1555,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3512.791,3522.069,"Can I ask you, do you have any response to your colleague's disagreement with you about withdrawal liability in a strike?"
1985.84-1555,3,45120,wayne_jett,,3522.069,3522.319,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1985.84-1555,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3536.533,3539.375,"That's certainly what you said before, and he heard you, but he disagrees with you."
1985.84-1555,3,45120,wayne_jett,,3539.375,3540.53,No question about it.
1985.84-1555,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3546.434,3547.528,"Well, let's assume he's right."
1985.84-1555,3,45120,wayne_jett,,3555.539,3558.477,All you have to do is leave.
1985.84-1555,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3565.661,3579.498,--But what if there was no withdrawal liability assessed except that you had to go on paying at the same rate you did with respect to the employees you had up to that date?
1985.84-1555,3,45120,wayne_jett,,3579.498,3581.592,"Your Honor, it still is a taking of property."
1985.84-1555,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3581.592,3582.184,Right.
1985.84-1555,3,45120,wayne_jett,,3582.184,3585.199,It is a taking by the statute that would not exist otherwise.
1985.84-1555,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3600.677,3613.891,"Mr. Jett, is it true that the trustees have agreed that none of these employers will be liable for anything on withdrawal liability because the withdrawal was before the effective date of the Act?"
1985.84-1555,3,45120,wayne_jett,,3613.891,3615.687,"That is not true, Your Honor."
1985.84-1555,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3622.716,3626.932,The trustees have not conceded that there would be no liability?
1985.84-1555,3,45120,wayne_jett,,3626.932,3627.353,"--No, Your Honor."
1985.84-1555,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3643.098,3644.331,"Your time has expired, counsel."
