2018.17-1717,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,17.96,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 17-1717, the American Legion versus the American Humanist Association, and Number 18-18, the consolidated case, Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission versus the American Humanist Association. Mr. Katyal."
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,17.96,40.24,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are four important facts about the memorial at issue, the Peace Cross, that explain why it should not be dismembered or destroyed. First, families and the Legion built it 93 years ago to commemorate 49 brave souls who gave their lives in World War I, and it has stood for -- since that time without challenge. Second, it's no ordinary cross."
2018.17-1717,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,67.72,90.56,"Do you know how many other parks are like this one? I've looked at pictures, and this is an unusual park because there's major highways dividing it up. It's almost as if the city artificially designed an area that's huge to encompass other plaques and declared it a park."
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,105.08,107.0,"Oh, no, you actually can. I've done it."
2018.17-1717,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,119.68,120.24,All right.
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,120.24,120.32,-- Justice Sotomayor.
2018.17-1717,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,120.32,125.08,"And you said ""dismember or destroy."" You can move it."
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,125.08,125.44,You could --
2018.17-1717,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,125.44,129.52,"You could transfer the land to private entities, correct?"
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,129.52,134.12,"Well, you could -- those -- those would be hypothetically possible, but the record shows that both --"
2018.17-1717,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,134.12,136.16,So is destruction and -- and anything else.
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,136.16,147.36,"Well -- well, Justice Sotomayor, the record -- this is at Court of Appeals Appendix Joint -- Joint Appendix 623 and 1585 -- say if you move it, because of the cracks in this cross, it very well may be destroyed."
2018.17-1717,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,148.2,149.88,Then give it back to the Legion.
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,149.88,150.56,And give it back to the Legion.
2018.17-1717,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,164.44,167.04,They could -- they could speak to that.
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,182.12,191.4,"Not at all, Your Honor. We think this memorial, from start to finish, has been about honoring those 49, plus all World War I veterans."
2018.17-1717,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,191.4,217.8,"Is it -- are you just grandfathering this, or are you claiming that today, let's say, for the Vietnam War, that any government, local or state, could build a cross 40 feet high, not put any emblem on or some sectarian emblem, and say we are dedicating this to all the soldiers who have died in the Vietnam War?"
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,217.8,221.16,"So we're not at all saying that, grandfathering or anything like that."
2018.17-1717,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,227.32,228.88,"No, no, but answer my question."
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,254.2,256.48,"So, Justice Sotomayor, I'll make two different arguments."
2018.17-1717,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,305.92,327.12,"What would happen if all the facts that you gave were the same, except for the 93 years? In other words, a community decides, for whatever reason, we don't have a World War I memorial; we want to put up exactly this to memorialize the -- the -- the war dead from -- from World War I, but now."
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,327.12,327.28,Right.
2018.17-1717,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,343.56,353.96,And -- and does that answer apply not just to memorials for World War I soldiers but to memorials for soldiers from any armed conflict?
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,353.96,361.96,"Well, I think that -- I think that it probably would, that there's a tradition of using these crosses with respect to any conflict, but it would have to look like this one."
2018.17-1717,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,361.96,390.16,"But, Mr. Katyal, what about, not a World -- World War or any war memorial, but a memorial to a tragic event, let's say, a mass shooting at a school? Could the local community then decide it wants to put up a cross in front of that school to honor the children and the teachers who died in the mass shooting?"
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,390.16,395.56,"Well, I think the test, Justice Ginsburg, would be whether there is a independent secular purpose."
2018.17-1717,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,419.44,422.6,But my -- my example was nothing that was found in the rubble.
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,429.16,429.36,Right.
2018.17-1717,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,440.64,445.12,The purpose -- the purpose is to honor those who died in the tragedy.
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,445.12,445.52,Yes.
2018.17-1717,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,445.52,448.72,"So -- yeah, so, no, could you --"
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,448.72,451.76,I don't think purpose is what this Court's decisions turn on.
2018.17-1717,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,454.0,454.64,"Well, I'm sorry, but I --"
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,454.64,455.56,-- objective meaning.
2018.17-1717,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,455.56,459.2,-- I thought you just said that the test is whether there's a secular purpose.
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,459.2,462.4,"I meant objective meaning, I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice."
2018.17-1717,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,475.36,476.04,"Well, would that be --"
2018.17-1717,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,476.04,480.0,So it would be okay then -- it would be okay to put up in front of the public school --
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,480.0,483.28,"Well, I think we'd need to know more about the facts of that particular hypothetical, but --"
2018.17-1717,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,483.28,486.08,"Well, here are some facts, Mr. Katyal, from that hypothetical."
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,530.24,544.44,"And, Justice Kagan, if it does have the same hallmarks as this type of cross, we think that that would be permissible, that is -- and I think that's a natural consequence of what this Court's already said in Buono in the plurality and the Van Orden opinion."
2018.17-1717,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,544.44,572.64,"I thought -- I read your brief to put a lot of weight on the fact that the cross here has more than a sectarian meaning, because, as your history sets forth, the cross was a symbol throughout the battlefields in World War I. Now I'm wondering why that doesn't limit your argument in -- so that, in such a case, as Justice Kagan hypothesized, you would not accept that?"
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,572.64,578.44,"Mr. Chief Justice, we certainly agree that all of that tradition, the Fields of Flanders and stuff, make this a very easy case."
2018.17-1717,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,580.24,588.84,"In the Field of Flanders, are all of the graves marked by crosses? Are there not graves marked by Stars of David?"
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,588.84,605.48,"There certainly are some. But I think the dominant image of the time, everything from that poem to art, to the war bond advertisements that the United States Government put, to the 1924 congressional resolution, all did use this cross. And that's why we agree, Justice Ginsburg --"
2018.17-1717,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,605.48,613.2,"And I visited some of those battlefields, and there are Stars of Davids marking the graves of Jewish --"
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,613.2,613.72,Quite --
2018.17-1717,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,613.72,614.32,-- soldiers.
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,614.32,614.96,-- quite true.
2018.17-1717,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,625.32,639.32,"What do you say to the Jewish war veterans brief that say and for those Jewish soldiers, the government's decision to honor only the salvation that Christians believe is hurtful, wrong, and not in keeping with the promise of the Constitution? What do you say to them?"
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,639.32,670.48,"I -- I'd say three things, Justice Kavanaugh, and then if I could reserve the balance of my time. The first is that, factually, one of the main proponents in fundraisers of this particular cross was J. Moses Eldovich, who himself was a Jewish veteran. Second, there's a -- there's a contrary tradition that the Retired Flag Officers brief at page 9 says that some Jewish vets were actually put and buried under the cross and wanted to be. And, third, I don't think this Court has ever adopted the view that, if some people disagree with something, that that itself creates an Establishment Clause violation."
2018.17-1717,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,670.48,670.56,If -- if the Chief would per --
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,670.56,672.36,"Rather, the test is objective meaning."
2018.17-1717,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,672.36,674.44,If the Chief would permit me.
2018.17-1717,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,698.6,701.88,"Justice Sotomayor, my answer would be the same as the third part to Justice Kavanaugh."
2018.17-1717,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,717.96,724.24,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Carvin."
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,724.24,761.92,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: While the Peace Cross should be upheld under any sensible Establishment Clause analysis, we submit the Court should analyze it under the Town of Greece coercion test, which prohibits tangible interference with religious liberty, as well as proselytizing, for a number of reasons. We think this is the simplest route. You would simply extend Town of Greece rule for religious speech to symbolic speech and it would provide, in a situation where the chances for coercion and proselytization are much less than in the communal prayer --"
2018.17-1717,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,761.92,800.64,"Mr. Carvin, could you explain -- you have this coercion theory that you think you're urging us to adopt. But, if that's what the Establishment Clause prohibits, only coercion, how does this offer -- how does this office differ from the Free Exercise Clause? That is, can you suggest a practice that would be unconstitutionally coercive under the Establishment Clause and yet be inoffensive under the Free Exercise Clause?"
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,800.64,803.68,"Yes, Your Honor, forcing us to pay threepence to a minister."
2018.17-1717,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,841.56,846.92,What -- what counts as proselytizing? I think I understand what coercion means better than what proselytizing means.
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,846.92,848.68,"Well, I think it's actually very straightforward."
2018.17-1717,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,855.6,858.8,What's the difference between that and an endorsement?
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,858.8,859.28,"Well, there's --"
2018.17-1717,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,859.28,863.92,You tell us we should abandon Lemon's endorsement test because it's become a dog's breakfast.
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,863.92,864.04,Right.
2018.17-1717,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,864.04,865.56,And nobody knows how to apply it.
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,865.56,865.92,Right.
2018.17-1717,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,865.92,867.52,"The circuit courts are confused, you tell us."
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,867.52,867.92,It's not that --
2018.17-1717,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,867.92,873.76,And then you replace it with coercion but now maybe proselytizing in the reply brief.
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,873.76,874.52,Right.
2018.17-1717,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,874.52,877.72,I'm -- I -- I don't see the daylight between proselytizing and endorsement.
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,878.76,881.16,"We think there's a fundamental difference, Justice Gorsuch."
2018.17-1717,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,892.24,893.2,"Well, suppose a city --"
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,893.2,894.96,-- all sectarian symbols are unconstitutional.
2018.17-1717,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,894.96,905.36,-- suppose a city erected a cross not for purposes of memorializing the war dead or -- but just to emphasize the values of Christianity.
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,908.04,915.88,"I think, again, that stays very close to the hypothetical that Justice Kennedy put in the Allegheny County dissent where you've got a permanent Latin cross on top of City Hall."
2018.17-1717,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,915.88,916.04,Right.
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,917.08,917.36,I think --
2018.17-1717,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,917.36,918.72,-- on top of City Hall.
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,918.72,919.08,Yes.
2018.17-1717,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,919.08,920.28,"This one is, you know, in a park."
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,920.28,920.6,Oh.
2018.17-1717,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,925.16,931.12,"It's just a cross. This is -- they want to emphasize the values of Christianity, so they put up a cross."
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,931.12,953.76,"I think it would be a very rare case, or unless you were sort of conditioning access to government services, like the one on City Hall would certainly suggest, that that would either constitute de facto establishment or de facto coercion. And I don't think the other side can provide a real-world hypothetical involving a cross that could be misused for proselytizing purposes, which is why I think the endorsement standard is --"
2018.17-1717,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,953.76,963.28,"Well, I guess what -- what -- what I was trying to suggest was that this was something that indicated that the city was aligning itself with one particular religion."
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,971.8,972.0,Again --
2018.17-1717,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,972.0,973.8,But it's -- it's not on top of City Hall.
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,976.16,976.32,Well --
2018.17-1717,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,976.32,977.56,Maybe there are two crosses.
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,981.0,981.16,Well --
2018.17-1717,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,981.16,983.84,But that's why the -- the -- the city is doing it.
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,987.2,987.56,Right.
2018.17-1717,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,994.04,994.8,"Well, is there?"
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,994.8,1002.84,"Again, in these circumstances, I need to know was this, for example, suggested by people who were honoring the victims of a school shooting."
2018.17-1717,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1005.68,1006.68,It's just a -- it's just a cross.
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1016.08,1023.04,"Oh, again, if that's the -- if that's the announced purpose and effect, of aligning ourselves with Christianity, then I would think it would sound --"
2018.17-1717,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1023.04,1024.04,"Well, suppose --"
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1024.04,1025.4,-- much like proselytizing.
2018.17-1717,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1025.4,1035.28,"-- suppose after this case Hyattsville puts up a cross and College Park puts up a cross and the surrounding communities put up crosses, and they -- there's mixed purposes."
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1044.32,1048.92,"Again, I think sectarian symbols are presumptively valid, Justice Kavanaugh, because --"
2018.17-1717,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1048.92,1051.88,Presumptively valid and can -- that presumption can be overcome when?
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1051.88,1055.92,"Again, if you show that there isn't a legitimate non-proselytizing purpose --"
2018.17-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1055.92,1056.32,Counsel --
2018.17-1717,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1056.32,1057.32,"Well, I guess then that's where I --"
2018.17-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1057.32,1076.36,"I was just going to say you start out with what you -- you advertise is a pretty concise test, but it degenerates pretty quickly into, well, I need to know about this, I need to know about that, and becomes kind of a fact-specific test rather than the -- the -- the crisper one that you propose in your brief."
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1076.36,1098.8,"Your Honor, we could have a bright line test that only formal coercion is prohibited, but I don't think that would satisfy this Court because the dangers of the Establishment Clause posed by coercion, which is tangible threat to liberty, may -- could be reached indirectly through the sorts of things I'm talking about. And it is true, of course, that every test that this Court adopts needs to focus on context, purpose, and effect."
2018.17-1717,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1102.88,1103.64,"Well, I don't --"
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1103.64,1104.08,We're not asking --
2018.17-1717,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1104.08,1106.56,That's where -- that's where I -- I'm just stuck.
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1106.56,1107.2,Okay.
2018.17-1717,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1107.2,1109.56,And -- and to say I endorse something --
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1109.56,1109.88,Right.
2018.17-1717,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1110.36,1123.04,"-- is -- what's the difference between saying I endorse something and I proselytize or promote, perhaps, is another synonym, something? It seems to me that you are taking us right back to the dog's breakfast you've warned us against."
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1128.08,1129.92,Fair enough.
2018.17-1717,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1136.44,1136.88,Justice Scalia once --
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1136.88,1138.0,The free exercise --
2018.17-1717,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1138.0,1141.48,-- Justice Scalia once asked a question when somebody gave that example.
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1145.48,1148.76,"And, again, that's actually a very nice illustration of the distinction."
2018.17-1717,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1173.48,1182.96,"Why am I not proselytizing religion when I say ""In God we trust"" but I am when I say ""In Jesus Christ we trust""? I'm just proselytizing religion in a more generic sense."
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1182.96,1186.64,"That -- that's fair enough, and I think Justice Scalia would respond in this --"
2018.17-1717,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1186.64,1187.32,"Well, there we are."
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1187.32,1193.04,"No -- no, but the difference between promoting religion versus irreligion and promoting one sect over another --"
2018.17-1717,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1193.04,1193.6,What -- what --
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1193.6,1198.48,-- which I think the sectarian point would obviously lend itself to proselytizing.
2018.17-1717,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1205.28,1205.52,What --
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1205.52,1206.16,-- religious symbol.
2018.17-1717,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1206.16,1213.32,-- what's your answer -- what's your answer to the cross on City Hall? I didn't get whether your answer is that's unconstitutional or constitutional.
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1213.32,1218.0,"Again, we're seeking to have this Court adopt Justice Kennedy's dissent in Allegheny County."
2018.17-1717,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1218.28,1222.2,"And in that dissent, he said that a cross on City Hall would be unconstitutional."
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1222.2,1222.88,Because it's --
2018.17-1717,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1222.88,1222.92,Do you --
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1222.92,1223.28,Because it --
2018.17-1717,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1223.28,1223.96,Do you agree?
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1223.96,1227.16,"Because it constitutes proselytizing, and we certainly do agree."
2018.17-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1262.2,1264.28,"Well, but if you look at his -- of course, you have."
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1266.6,1266.68,Right.
2018.17-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1266.68,1270.48,-- that he'd say would be -- and it starts out with the government establishing a church.
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1270.48,1270.8,Right.
2018.17-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1270.8,1271.68,All right. We'll give you that.
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1271.68,1272.32,Right.
2018.17-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1272.32,1279.36,"You know, the -- the requiring people to pay for the church, prohibiting -- imposing burdens on people who don't believe."
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1284.76,1285.36,Yes.
2018.17-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1285.36,1289.12,But you're certainly -- I don't understand your position to be limited in that way.
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1289.12,1310.08,"Again, we could certainly say that kind of direct formal coercion is the only thing reached by the Establishment Clause. Both of the opinions we rely on, Town of Greece and Allegheny County, go a bit further, and they say in the real world, we want to make sure we're not creating the same dangers when the government is trying to create indirectly what it couldn't do directly. Again, this will be a rare exception, and they can't provide a real-world hypothetical."
2018.17-1717,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1310.08,1311.84,So we go back to Justice --
2018.17-1717,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1311.84,1312.76,But do I --
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1312.76,1316.44,If the Court doesn't want to go that far --
2018.17-1717,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1316.44,1318.24,So we go back to Justice Gorsuch.
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1318.24,1318.52,Yes.
2018.17-1717,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1318.52,1325.76,"I hear you using the word ""de facto"" -- ""extreme proselytization,"" ""de facto coercion."""
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1325.76,1326.32,Right.
2018.17-1717,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1326.32,1331.76,"""Excessive promotion or proselytization."" It is the endorsement test."
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1331.76,1332.16,Again --
2018.17-1717,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1332.16,1344.28,"Now you may make an argument like your colleague that this has to do more with tradition than it does with coercion, but it is endorsement."
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1344.28,1349.64,"To make it as simple as I can: Under the endorsement test, a sectarian symbol of a creche is no good."
2018.17-1717,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1353.12,1355.4,So you would overturn Allegheny under that theory?
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1355.4,1361.32,"I would endorse the Town of Greece test, which says sectarian prayer, purely sectarian prayer, is okay."
2018.17-1717,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1362.76,1365.72,But would you proselytize that test?
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1365.72,1366.68,Excuse me?
2018.17-1717,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1366.68,1368.04,You endorse the test.
2018.17-1717,1,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1370.08,1376.88,"We -- we -- we -- we are actually adopting the word ""proselytize"" from the Town of Greece test."
2018.17-1717,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1396.44,1403.12,"Thank you, counsel. General Wall."
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1403.12,1418.64,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Three points: First, under Town of Greece, the memorial cross is permissible because it falls within our nation's long tradition of accommodating religious speech or symbols in civic life. Second, adhering to Town of Greece would easily resolve --"
2018.17-1717,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1418.64,1428.6,"In all places? Meaning I don't know of a founding father, town or state, that put up a 40-foot cross on government property."
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1464.0,1471.04,"Well, two different -- two things, Justice Sotomayor. First, obviously, this symbol has a unique history, as the Buono plurality detailed."
2018.17-1717,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1479.2,1479.48,But you're --
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1479.48,1480.72,-- that it took on to that generation.
2018.17-1717,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1480.72,1492.88,"But you limited your point to one generalized point, which means we could put it up today to memorialize all Vietnam vets, despite the fact that all Vietnam vets were not Christian --"
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1492.88,1492.92,Oh --
2018.17-1717,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1492.92,1494.4,-- and that many of them would feel --
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1494.4,1532.16,"Yes, just as Mr. Katyal said, when they found the cross at Ground Zero in the rubble and that became a makeshift shrine in the weeks after 9/11, I don't think that that violated the Establishment Clause, just as it doesn't now when it sits in the 9/11 museum owned by the Port Authority. But the second point I'd make is I understand Town of Greece and the Allegheny County dissent to say you either trace a practice back to the founding or you look to see whether it's akin to the kind of acknowledgments that the founders and the early generation thought were permissible, and you ask whether it presents any greater dangers than that. Here, crosses have been memorials since before the founding."
2018.17-1717,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1535.92,1537.6,Does it make any difference --
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1537.6,1540.08,-- the one that incorporated --
2018.17-1717,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1540.08,1559.92,"-- the change from the founding, this was an almost overwhelmingly Christian country, but now we're told that 30 percent of the U.S. population does not adhere to a Christian faith, does -- does that change make any difference?"
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1559.92,1588.52,"I don't think it affects whether the cross took on in the wake of the Great War a secular meaning and whether that's the meaning for which the mothers erected it and the commission now maintains it. So, when Canada gave us the Canadian Cross of Sacrifice to honor Americans who went north and joined the Canadian forces to fight in the war before America entered, I have no reason to believe that all of those Americans were Christian or that Canada thought they were, but it thought that a cross with a sword running down it in Arlington would commemorate all of them."
2018.17-1717,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1595.2,1601.72,Isn't a cemetery substantially different than the middle of a town where something is 40 foot high?
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1601.72,1602.28,Well --
2018.17-1717,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1602.28,1604.04,"I mean, I have pictures of this cross."
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1610.16,1625.48,"I mean, with all -- all respect, Justice Sotomayor, and, obviously, this is more under the reasonable observer test and we've asked the Court to apply Town of Greece, but having been out to the site, it is certainly a -- a tall cross, but it has words on it that are visible from hundreds of feet away that are secular words."
2018.17-1717,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1640.96,1642.24,"So, Mr. Wall, just to --"
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1642.24,1643.24,-- and all of the surrounding context.
2018.17-1717,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1643.24,1654.52,"-- figure out where you want to draw the line, just take a lot -- I'm going to give you an example of a bunch of different crosses. So one is World War I cross erected many, many years ago."
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1681.4,1683.76,I think the first three are clearly permissible.
2018.17-1717,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1700.2,1700.64,And the fifth?
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1700.64,1704.84,The last strikes me as -- as potentially quite problematic.
2018.17-1717,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1714.12,1715.6,Even though all five --
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1715.6,1717.28,-- are you offended or excluded.
2018.17-1717,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1729.12,1730.6,But -- but all five crosses --
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1730.6,1730.96,-- without any clear secular reason --
2018.17-1717,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1730.96,1731.24,Excuse me.
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1735.88,1737.12,"Well, no."
2018.17-1717,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1737.88,1742.84,"Of course, the purpose articulated, unstated or stated, but not visible, might be different."
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1749.84,1751.76,Maybe I misunderstood the hypotheticals.
2018.17-1717,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1770.6,1776.32,"So, if that's put up as a war memorial but it doesn't have words around it, that has to come down?"
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1776.32,1790.04,"Justice Kavanaugh, I'll grant you that that's the -- the hardest case, and where the town just says we're putting it up as a war memorial, it -- it may be permissible, as long as the other side will grant that all of the hard cases on this test are imaginary."
2018.17-1717,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1792.68,1792.96,Could --
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1792.96,1796.48,The problem with the current law is that all of the current cases are hard.
2018.17-1717,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1803.08,1816.76,"Could you take the -- the examples I gave that are neither the first nor the fifth, in other words, just the memorial crosses but not any particular relationship to World War I, and -- and erected now."
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1837.8,1842.48,I think the theory is and the real-world example I'd give is the cross at Ground Zero.
2018.17-1717,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1844.44,1849.16,"I think that that's an odd kind of case, so I -- I think let's -- let's not talk about that one."
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1857.76,1858.88,"Well, my point is just that's a --"
2018.17-1717,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1858.88,1863.88,-- an ordinary municipal decision to erect a cross as a way to memorialize some group of citizens.
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1863.88,1867.36,And my -- my only point was there aren't a lot of these war memorials going up.
2018.17-1717,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1885.72,1893.2,"And -- and I guess I ask, why is that? Is it because the cross has become a symbol that's universal? Is that what your -- your claim is?"
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1893.2,1903.56,"I think because, as the Buono plurality said, it has taken on a secular meaning associated with sacrifice or -- or death or commemoration."
2018.17-1717,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1908.32,1923.4,"I mean, it is the foremost symbol of Christianity, isn't it? It invokes the central theological claim of Christianity, that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for humanity's sins and that he rose from the dead."
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1933.16,1936.8,"So I'm not going to dispute that, obviously, it's the preeminent symbol of Christianity."
2018.17-1717,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1951.08,1951.76,And does it -- does it matter --
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1951.76,1953.96,So we know that context has to matter.
2018.17-1717,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1953.96,1965.84,-- does it matter in this particular case that this cross was put up to commemorate the deaths of 49 real people and that this was done in the wake of World War I?
2018.17-1717,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1965.84,1969.08,"I think, Justice Alito, it makes it an easier case."
2018.17-1717,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2014.12,2017.72,"Thank you, General. Ms. Miller."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2017.72,2094.84,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think we can all agree that the Establishment Clause at the very least prohibits the government from preferring one religion over another religion. And the Commission is arguing essentially that its cross does not violate the central command of the Establishment Clause because it's essentially a non-religious, non-Christian symbol that honors everyone, irrespective of their religion. Yet, I don't think anyone here would deny that it would be unconstitutional and inappropriate to go into Arlington and place a Latin cross over the grave of every person there, every fallen soldier, irrespective of their religion. In fact, in 1924, everyone in the congressional debate about the overseas markers was in agreement that it would be completely inappropriate and even sacrilegious to put a cross over the burial of a Jewish fallen soldier. But the Commission is here arguing today, as well as the other Petitioners, that it is, you know, telling Jews, telling Muslims, telling humanists that the cross honors them, when they emphatically say it does not. And it's telling Christians that their most preeminent and -- and sacred symbol of Jesus Christ actually, in fact, also symbolizes atheism."
2018.17-1717,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2094.84,2100.6,Could I -- could I ask a question that picks up on a question that Justice Ginsburg asked earlier?
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2100.6,2100.8,Yes.
2018.17-1717,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2100.8,2107.24,"So let's say there is a shooting at a church, and Christians are targeted and killed."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2147.44,2150.0,"Your Honor, I think it depends, of course, on the context."
2018.17-1717,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2171.88,2193.96,"Well, that -- that raises for me -- that -- that answer raises for me a question about standing. Is it too loud? Is the Star of David too loud? Is it too offensive? There aren't many places in the law where we allow someone to make a federal case out of their offensiveness about a symbol being too loud for them."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2232.0,2232.68,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1717,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2265.8,2275.08,"Well, just to follow up on Justice Gorsuch's question, what if you had one letter from one person who purported to be offended by it? Would that be enough to support your argument?"
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2275.08,2276.2,"Well -- well, no, Your Honor."
2018.17-1717,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2334.72,2354.8,"I mean, this would be a different case if some of those 49 soldiers whose names are associated with this monument were Jewish or -- or Muslim or a member of some other non-Christian faith and the town insisted on putting their names on a monument in the form of a cross."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2357.28,2358.2,Well --
2018.17-1717,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2358.2,2358.76,Is that right?
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2358.76,2363.64,"-- two things, Your Honor: One, we don't know the names -- we don't know the -- the religious beliefs of those on the cross."
2018.17-1717,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2372.96,2373.12,All right.
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2381.08,2381.52,There --
2018.17-1717,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2381.52,2384.36,"-- for their fallen family member, do we?"
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2384.36,2410.08,I think there's an inference that can be made from the fact that the government's records refer to 52 to 54 Prince Georgians who died in World War I and they only have 49 names on the cross. But I would also submit that the government has basically forfeited that argument by having this elaborate and public rededication ceremony to rededicate the cross as a memorial for all veterans of all wars. That's how the town's treated it. The Commission's here today saying that this is an everyone memorial for --
2018.17-1717,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2410.08,2414.96,"I mean, there are cross monuments all over the country, many of them quite old."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2418.16,2418.96,"No, Your Honor."
2018.17-1717,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2423.16,2425.68,So which ones do you think can stand?
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2425.68,2427.04,"Well, certainly, the two in Arlington."
2018.17-1717,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2452.68,2469.0,"Yeah, and that's the way this sort of thing is being handled today in a pluralistic society in which ordinary people get along pretty well and -- and are not at each other's throats about religious divisions. But let me ask you about some others that are not in Arlington."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2476.72,2477.12,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1717,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2498.44,2499.0,What about --
2018.17-1717,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2499.0,2501.28,May -- may I ask about this cross -- I'm sorry.
2018.17-1717,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2501.28,2508.88,"I was just going to ask, I understand Native American totems have spiritual and religious significance."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2515.0,2520.92,"I would say no, Your Honor, but I -- I would -- I would think that we'd need some sort of expert testimony to sort of talk about what that means."
2018.17-1717,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2521.68,2530.12,"Well, it has spiritual and religious significance for Native Americans, similar to, let's say, religious symbols, a Star of David, a cross."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2530.12,2531.44,It -- it's difficult.
2018.17-1717,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2555.2,2565.68,"So, if the -- if the local government in the community were Native American, whether it's on the reservation or a -- a native village in Alaska, that would make a difference?"
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2565.68,2579.92,"You know, I think we would have to understand more about the symbolism and what it means if there is some sort of dual secular meaning, such as with the Ten Commandments, how it's basically shorthand for law itself, so if, in context, it's intended for the secular aspect to predominate, perhaps, but I -- it's hard to say with --"
2018.17-1717,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2579.92,2580.56,"So this cross, Ms. Miller --"
2018.17-1717,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2580.56,2583.48,So are you suggesting all Ten Commandment -- I'm sorry.
2018.17-1717,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2583.48,2585.92,"This cross, Ms. Miller --"
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2585.92,2586.48,Yes.
2018.17-1717,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2586.48,2591.64,"-- it's very old, was erected almost 100 years ago, right after World War I."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2654.52,2656.24,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think you can say that --"
2018.17-1717,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2656.24,2658.56,Or the particular religious content?
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2658.56,2664.88,I don't think -- I'm not aware of any case or reason to say that a large Latin cross can be stripped of its religious meaning.
2018.17-1717,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2670.36,2670.88,"Well, hold on."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2681.32,2689.92,"Well, as far as I'm concerned, I'm not aware of any secondary meaning that's derived from the Latin cross. Its meaning as a war memorial is distinctly for Christians."
2018.17-1717,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2691.4,2693.24,"Well, I guess what I'm -- what I'm suggesting --"
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2693.24,2693.36,Yes.
2018.17-1717,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2693.36,2722.28,"And I really did mean to confine it to this World War I context, because I think there's something quite different about this historic moment in time when -- so if you look -- you know, if you look at all the crosses that are war memorials, they're basically all World War I memorials, that this was sort of the -- because of the battlefields and the way the crosses were erected there, this became the preeminent symbol for how to memorialize the war dead at that time. Why isn't that important?"
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2722.28,2727.84,"Well, Your Honor, I -- it's -- factually speaking, the doughboy statue was by far the most common."
2018.17-1717,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2781.32,2783.24,I -- I take your point that it's a religious symbol.
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2819.08,2820.08,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1717,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2844.2,2845.96,What about the Ten -- the -- I'm sorry to interrupt --
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2845.96,2846.48,Okay.
2018.17-1717,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2846.48,2847.6,-- but the Ten Commandments then?
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2847.6,2854.84,"With respect to the Ten Commandments, I realize that that is something that this Court has routinely recognized as a dual meaning symbol."
2018.17-1717,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2861.96,2866.44,Were those statues built by private people and placed in the parks? If I'm remembering --
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2866.44,2867.4,The -- the Ten Commandments?
2018.17-1717,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2867.4,2868.04,Yes.
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2868.04,2903.44,"I believe the Eagles was the primary donator of -- of most of the Ten Commandments displays at issue, and my understanding, especially in reading Justice Breyer's concurrence, was that the fact that the -- the Ten Commandments didn't predominate in the setting, you know, they weren't the largest, they were in line with all these other displays, that the secular aspect of the Ten Commandments, the one that says, you know, this is how law was founded, this is symbolic of law, predominated. But there's nothing in either the plurality or Justice Breyer's opinion that I read to say that -- that -- that context can somehow strip a Latin cross of its sectarian meaning."
2018.17-1717,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2903.44,2914.12,"They have 54 in the briefs, 54 examples of things that people might bring cases and, if you win, tear them down. Well, there may be more."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,2956.32,2957.24,"Sure, Your Honor."
2018.17-1717,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3046.0,3068.6,"Well, but that's one of the main criticisms of the -- of the Lemon test, that different people are going to process that in different ways. I mean, you heard from one of your friends on the other side that one of the major fundraisers of this was a Jewish individual. So he was obviously observing it or anticipating it in a different way."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3068.6,3090.72,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I think that we cannot take one person's example, again, someone who's probably one of maybe the only Jewish people in that county at a time when there was an active Klan burning crosses, burning Jewish buildings or Jewish, you know, businesses at a time when atheists couldn't run for office, Jews had to swear that they believed in an after-life in order to qualify, I mean --"
2018.17-1717,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3090.72,3091.08,Ms. Miller --
2018.17-1717,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3091.08,3092.36,There were 12 --
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3092.36,3093.04,-- I can't --
2018.17-1717,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3093.04,3093.92,-- why does it even matter --
2018.17-1717,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3093.92,3096.24,-- there were 12 -- are there 12 African-American soldiers among the 49?
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3096.24,3097.84,I believe there are.
2018.17-1717,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3099.56,3109.8,And do you think that the -- that the -- the -- the situation of -- of African Americans in Prince George's County at that time was worse -- was better than the situation for Jews?
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3109.8,3111.44,Here's what I'll say to the plaque.
2018.17-1717,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3128.04,3155.0,"Ms. -- Ms. Miller, I -- I've been struck, some of these questions about how people process these symbols and what messages they convey, that you've sort of accepted this idea that that's what we should be thinking about. But why isn't it enough to just say: Does erecting a symbol like this align the government with a particular religion and not align it with every other religion?"
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3155.0,3158.96,"That's right, Your Honor. That is actually more the test that we put forth in our brief."
2018.17-1717,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3186.44,3186.88,You do --
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3186.88,3187.4,There's --
2018.17-1717,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3187.4,3200.92,"-- you do suggest we -- at various points we should consider how people process things and whether they're offended and elsewhere you don't. And I guess I am curious in response to Justice Kagan, you say we shouldn't apply Lemon in this case."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3231.6,3233.36,"No, Your Honor, I do not think so."
2018.17-1717,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3245.68,3262.16,"But, if you don't find it useful in this case and you don't want the Court to apply it in this case, what about all those poor court of appeals judges who are left still with confusion? We haven't overruled it, but we never use it anymore, except for when we might have 25 years ago."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3278.96,3282.44,"On the contrary, Your Honor, I think that Lemon is very useful."
2018.17-1717,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3289.96,3290.12,But how --
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3290.12,3290.32,-- Lemon --
2018.17-1717,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3290.32,3300.8,"-- how can it be useful when we haven't used it in the most important cases that are on point here, cases like Town of Greece, it's not used."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3320.52,3328.92,"Your Honor, I would submit that the Court really hasn't had the proper opportunity to apply Lemon since Van Orden, although remember that Van Orden was decided as a --"
2018.17-1717,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3328.92,3334.88,"Well, Town of Greece was certainly a case, and that's about prayer before a legislative meeting."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3334.88,3360.12,"Well, Town of Greece was -- was extending Marsh, which had jettisoned Lemon, but there's -- but the Court comes back to saying in, for instance, Trump versus Hawaii that reiterating the large -- the Larson test, which is that, you know, the clearest command of the Establishment Clause is one denomination can't be preferred to another, that case relies on Lemon. But, more importantly, I think that, like I said, I think everyone agrees that purpose and effect are critical inquiries under the Establishment Clause."
2018.17-1717,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3369.24,3369.72,I think you --
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3369.72,3370.24,-- about entanglement.
2018.17-1717,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3370.24,3373.76,"-- I think you alluded to this earlier, but I wanted to ask it so I'm clear."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3377.52,3378.64,Is -- is twofold.
2018.17-1717,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3424.12,3435.2,"Well, along those lines, would it be a violation of the Establishment Clause for the state to promote secularism or humanism as opposed to religion?"
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3435.2,3442.16,"Human -- humanism, yes. If the government decided to put up a giant happy humanist symbol, that's our -- it's like this man with little hands."
2018.17-1717,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3448.8,3456.48,"Well, let me take you back to Justice Breyer's question, which is an interesting question to me, and your response was he's wrong on the numbers."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3475.84,3478.72,"Well, I don't think, Your Honor, that they need to be knocked down at all."
2018.17-1717,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3487.24,3492.68,"All right, take -- move -- moved, taken down, but they're -- they're taken down one way or the other."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3494.12,3495.4,"Well, you're also --"
2018.17-1717,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3495.4,3502.44,"That -- that my promote a particular world view, but is that -- is that consistent with the Establishment Clause?"
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3502.44,3509.92,"Your Honor, with respect, I think you're forgetting the third option, which is transferring the underlying property, which this Court sanctioned in Buono, as well as the Ninth Circuit sanctioning in --"
2018.17-1717,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3509.92,3510.4,Wait a minute --
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3510.4,3511.08,-- the Trunk case.
2018.17-1717,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3511.08,3511.88,-- let -- let's just take that.
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3511.88,3512.08,Okay.
2018.17-1717,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3512.08,3514.12,"I mean, we're fighting the hypothetical, counsel."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3514.12,3514.68,Okay.
2018.17-1717,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3514.68,3515.68,Now I love doing that too.
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3515.68,3517.12,Yeah. (Laughter.)
2018.17-1717,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3517.12,3519.32,But let's just stick with the hypothetical.
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3519.32,3519.52,Sure.
2018.17-1717,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3519.52,3520.84,You can't transfer it.
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3533.0,3533.64,That's right.
2018.17-1717,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3533.64,3536.64,"Because they endorse religion, proselytize."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3538.24,3538.64,Yes.
2018.17-1717,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3538.64,3540.12,-- Justice Alito's question.
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3540.12,3540.44,Sure.
2018.17-1717,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3540.44,3541.64,"If you could answer it, I -- I'd be grateful."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3541.64,3541.88,Yes.
2018.17-1717,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3541.88,3542.64,That would help me.
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3542.64,3542.96,Yes.
2018.17-1717,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3580.96,3582.64,It's not just an argument.
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3597.32,3601.32,"With respect to -- well, I think the hypothetical is so difficult because I don't believe --"
2018.17-1717,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3601.32,3602.56,It's not a hypothetical.
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3602.56,3602.8,Okay.
2018.17-1717,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3602.8,3611.32,"I'm saying, a very good book, the Law & Its Compass, Lord Radcliffe, all our liberties come from freedom of religion."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3643.56,3654.6,"Well, I think that there are ways to display a historical cross in a way that isn't the government currently being the mouthpiece for that sectarian speech. The 9/11 cross that Petitioners speak of is a perfect example."
2018.17-1717,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3673.04,3673.2,What if --
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3673.2,3674.52,-- a historical artifact.
2018.17-1717,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3674.52,3682.96,-- what if -- what if -- what if other cities replicated the 9/11 cross? It's a different world.
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3702.4,3711.28,"So just so I understand, you're saying they commission a cross that looks like the rubble -- a piece of rubble, and then -- you know, I think it depends on how they're displaying it."
2018.17-1717,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3711.6,3714.96,Didn't you answer that it doesn't exist in splendid isolation?
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3714.96,3716.48,Exactly.
2018.17-1717,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3719.48,3722.68,"No, no, it's -- it's -- my question is, it's a 9/11 memorial."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3722.68,3723.24,Yes.
2018.17-1717,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3723.24,3728.12,"And that's the predominant thing, and there might be some names on it, just like our Bladensburg cross."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3728.12,3728.92,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1717,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3738.68,3742.0,Can we go back outside of hypotheticals to this case?
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3742.0,3742.6,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1717,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3742.6,3755.04,Mr. Katyal said that the only way to have a remedy here is to destroy -- change the cross or destroy it.
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3763.2,3763.96,I don't agree.
2018.17-1717,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3784.4,3789.2,I do understand also that the cross is falling apart and has to be fixed anyway.
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3789.2,3789.88,"Well, that's --"
2018.17-1717,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3789.88,3795.04,So whether it's fixed in a move or fixed in place in situ is irrelevant.
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3796.44,3797.72,That's -- that's right. Exactly.
2018.17-1717,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3817.08,3840.48,"May -- may I go back to the question that's been underlying some of my colleagues' points and points you've been trying to make. It is contextual, the endorsement test is always contextual, and, according to you, contextually, the 50 crosses that Justice Alito and Breyer are worried about, you don't think it's 50?"
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3840.48,3840.64,I --
2018.17-1717,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3840.64,3844.04,You still think it may be only 10 or 20.
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3887.32,3887.88,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1717,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3939.48,3939.96,Can I --
2018.17-1717,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3939.96,3952.44,"Well, I was just going to say, if -- if I were, I once was, a lower court judge and I get that type of analysis, I'm just going to throw my hands up. Those are 20 different facts, how big is it, where, you know, is it located."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3964.84,3975.8,"I mean, I think it's very difficult and I think that's why the Court hasn't come up with that one, you know, singular test, because the cases are complex. That's the Establishment Clause. And I think it actually helps us, you know, deal with each cross."
2018.17-1717,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3990.96,3995.04,"You raised -- so you just said no other cross has to be torn down, just this one."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,3998.36,4002.16,"I mean, with respect, this Court has done that."
2018.17-1717,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4007.52,4012.44,Say we're going to write an opinion and we're going to say this cross is particularly bad.
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,4017.28,4018.76,I don't know why --
2018.17-1717,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4018.76,4019.88,Is that what you just said?
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,4019.88,4021.2,"No, Your Honor, that's not what I said."
2018.17-1717,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4021.72,4021.8,Okay.
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,4022.8,4038.64,"-- that this Court says, you know, cases are ill-suited for sweeping pronouncements and categorical rules. So, when the Court says that it says, you know, not every cross is going to be torn down, not every cross is going to be held -- upheld, and I think that's an appropriate way to leave room for exceptions or leave --"
2018.17-1717,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4038.64,4040.52,Your -- your argument sounds in liberty.
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,4081.76,4083.52,"I mean, liberty's absolutely important."
2018.17-1717,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4117.2,4132.92,"I guess my question was, in thinking about our role, what is the role of this Court in a case like this? Should it matter that we know that the Bladensburg council, the state legislature of Maryland, the Maryland constitution, are all there, or is that irrelevant to how we think about this?"
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,4132.92,4133.6,May I?
2018.17-1717,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4133.6,4135.04,You have a couple minutes left.
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,4135.04,4137.72,Okay.
2018.17-1717,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4143.84,4155.0,"The fact that there are other ways in which the cross -- other bodies that can decide the cross is too much, the Maryland -- the local council could, the Maryland legislature."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,4162.04,4166.8,"So if, like, the Maryland legislator decides that the cross is universal or?"
2018.17-1717,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4166.8,4168.16,"No, that the cross should come down."
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,4168.16,4168.96,I see.
2018.17-1717,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4168.96,4171.8,"In other words, the Bladensburg council could transfer the property --"
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,4171.8,4171.84,Oh.
2018.17-1717,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4171.84,4173.08,-- to the Maryland legislature.
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,4176.44,4177.84,"The remedy, is that what you're getting at?"
2018.17-1717,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4177.84,4178.08,Yeah.
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,4178.08,4178.44,Yes.
2018.17-1717,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4185.48,4186.32,I think the question --
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,4186.32,4187.52,-- is this constitutional.
2018.17-1717,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4187.52,4200.28,"-- is different. I think the question is do we think that -- since there are other avenues available, that the Constitution doesn't require this floor --"
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,4200.28,4201.56,I see -- I see.
2018.17-1717,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4201.56,4206.0,-- as a constitutional floor for an Establishment Clause violation.
2018.17-1717,3,63101,monica_l_miller,,4208.08,4215.76,"Oh, then the answer is no, I don't think that that's relevant at all. I mean, the Establishment Clause is -- you know, trumps statutes and -- and so forth."
2018.17-1717,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4220.28,4223.12,"Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Katyal."
2018.17-1717,4,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,4223.12,4227.56,Thank you. Ours is a middle path between my three excellent friends.
2018.17-1717,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4246.48,4247.4,But does --
2018.17-1717,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4247.4,4248.32,"Mr. Katyal, how --"
2018.17-1717,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4248.32,4255.68,"-- the cross really have a dual meaning, Mr. Katyal? It is the preeminent symbol of Christianity."
2018.17-1717,4,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,4262.2,4264.84,"We don't disagree with any of that, Justice Ginsburg."
2018.17-1717,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4290.92,4291.84,Mr. Katyal --
2018.17-1717,4,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,4291.84,4292.32,-- and the like.
2018.17-1717,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4292.32,4297.6,-- there's a call and a discussion about undoing Lemon altogether.
2018.17-1717,4,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,4297.6,4298.28,Right.
2018.17-1717,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4298.28,4303.04,"Substituting something like a coercion test, whatever, with or without limits."
2018.17-1717,4,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,4306.88,4307.72,We profound --
2018.17-1717,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4307.72,4310.08,-- on behalf of the commission -- of --
2018.17-1717,4,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,4310.08,4312.72,We profoundly disagree. We think it's unnecessary and unwise.
2018.17-1717,4,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4333.8,4334.12,Well --
2018.17-1717,4,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,4334.12,4335.24,-- yields the same result.
2018.17-1717,4,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4335.24,4345.12,"-- you're -- you're -- you're in the same boat, though, saying apply Lemon -- keep Lemon, keep it -- keep it around for a rainy day, but please, please, please, do not apply Lemon to this case."
2018.17-1717,4,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,4345.12,4346.76,"Well, we're happy with you applying Lemon."
2018.17-1717,4,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4353.32,4353.68,What if we think --
2018.17-1717,4,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,4353.68,4354.48,-- the most important ones --
2018.17-1717,4,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4354.48,4358.0,-- what if we think it's unconstitutional under Lemon? What's your view then?
2018.17-1717,4,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,4358.0,4363.88,"Well, I think it would be very impossible for reasons that the -- for -- for reasons our brief explains to find it."
2018.17-1717,4,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4363.88,4366.52,And what if -- what if it's unconstitutional under Lemon?
2018.17-1717,4,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4366.52,4366.68,Yeah.
2018.17-1717,4,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,4369.48,4379.36,"Yeah, so, I mean, we -- if it's unconstitutional, then -- you know, then I think we would say, you know, you should take a look at Lemon because then it would be necessarily presented. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1717,4,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4379.36,4381.12,Right.
2018.17-1717,4,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,4381.12,4381.36,Right.
2018.17-1717,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4428.84,4430.88,"Thank you, counsel."
