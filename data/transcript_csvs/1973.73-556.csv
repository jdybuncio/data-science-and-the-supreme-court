1973.73-556,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,0.0,24.028,Number 73-556 Florida Power and Light Company versus International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,24.028,29.853,Mr. Justice Douglas and may I please the Court.
1973.73-556,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,147.618,152.877,"Mr. Come, the case you’re actually arguing here is the Florida Power and Light, is it not?"
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,154.024,156.957,The Board is arguing both cases.
1973.73-556,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,180.632,184.7,In other words there was a grant in Illinois Bell Or in the --
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,184.7,191.14,There was a grant of the Board’s petition which covered both Illinois Bell and Florida Power.
1973.73-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,374.727,375.518,May I ask you a question?
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,375.518,375.821,Yes?
1973.73-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,375.821,377.537,(Inaudible)
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,377.537,378.569,What’s that Your Honor?
1973.73-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,378.569,381.681,The same Union in both cases?
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,381.681,385.006,They were different locals of the IBEW.
1973.73-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,385.006,386.195,The same international?
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,386.195,397.564,The same international is involved in the -- they belong to the same international.
1973.73-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,963.422,966.109,"The Employer may nevertheless insist, he wants to --"
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,966.109,966.82,He may nevertheless --
1973.73-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,966.82,970.462,And actively do wrong and may dismiss them indeed.
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,970.462,970.647,He may.
1973.73-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,970.647,971.957,Whoever union members?
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,971.957,986.338,"He may but the practicalities are that in these industries, if he is strong enough to do that, he may not get a contract or --"
1973.73-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,986.338,994.147,(Inaudible) so often certainly the telephone industry that’s true that the supervisor have drawn from the rank-and-file.
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,994.147,999.119,That is correct or he might not be able to find other supervisors.
1973.73-556,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1022.003,1033.089,"Mr. Come, you said supervisory, they are not performing supervisory duties, am I right?"
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1033.089,1061.065,"We submit that during a strike, whatever the supervisor is called upon to perform his part of his normal supervisory or management functions, because during a strike, the supervisor is called upon to help out in any way that the -- that is necessary to keep the plant going."
1973.73-556,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1061.48,1064.897,"Well, if he is sweeping the floor, he is the supervisor?"
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1064.897,1069.734,He will be acting in the interest of the employer --
1973.73-556,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1069.734,1072.477,He would be acting in the supervisory capacity?
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1072.477,1073.026,That is correct.
1973.73-556,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1073.026,1077.01,"They are just using words now, aren’t they?"
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1079.892,1082.418,That is --
1973.73-556,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1082.418,1094.211,"He is a member of the union to protect and by doing it, he deliberately interferes with the union."
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1094.211,1095.711,Well that is --
1973.73-556,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1095.711,1096.839,Of his own religion.
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1096.839,1126.856,"That is true but he is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea, because unlike a regular employee you cannot be discharged for striking a supervisor, he is a management representative and his first loyalty, at least this was Congress’s intention in amending the Act in 47, is supposed to be to the employer."
1973.73-556,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1126.856,1129.748,And the secondary is to the union?
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1129.748,1130.219,That is correct.
1973.73-556,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1130.219,1132.548,Which the union is trying to enforce?
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1132.548,1143.876,"That is correct, and we submit that that upsets the balance that Congress drew in 1947."
1973.73-556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1144.401,1161.183,"Did the union -- Mr. Come, could the union consistent with the Act have a rule that required one of its rank-and-file members who became a supervisor to leave the union?"
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1166.388,1170.959,"Yes, yes they could; yes they could."
1973.73-556,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1179.872,1188.029,"Mr. Come, you couldn’t be serious in response to my brother Marshall’s question that he is performing supervisory duties during the strike."
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1203.285,1203.621,I think --
1973.73-556,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1203.621,1214.285,"And it’s into the interest of management to keep the business going, both for ordinary business reasons and also for strategic and tactical reasons in the strike."
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1214.285,1214.582,I think that --
1973.73-556,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1214.582,1217.217,"He cannot supervise it, there is management duty."
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1217.217,1223.259,"I think that, that’s a more accurate way of putting it Mr. Justice Stewart."
1973.73-556,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1276.248,1290.446,So you’re saying that finding them for doing management duties during the strike is to coerce them in their collective bargaining role later?
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1290.446,1291.649,That is correct that there is a like --
1973.73-556,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1291.649,1292.889,Is that the argument?
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1292.889,1299.989,Yes that there is a likely to be a lingering effect or a spill over effect.
1973.73-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1333.947,1341.059,"Well that confrontation, well I gather in the place of the supervisor, is more likely to be in the next with adjustment of grievances."
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1341.059,1341.882,That is correct.
1973.73-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1341.882,1343.358,And in collective party?
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1343.358,1344.764,That is correct.
1973.73-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1349.644,1359.934,"Yes, but then subsection (b) speaks of coercion for the purposes of the collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances."
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1359.934,1364.4,"Yes, the adjustment of grievances would be at the more --"
1973.73-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1364.4,1365.434,"Well, likely one."
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1365.434,1366.609,The more likely.
1973.73-556,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1367.518,1372.305,"Mr. Come, you have to take this position in order to bring your self within the meeting of the statute."
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1372.305,1374.154,That is correct Your Honor.
1973.73-556,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1374.154,1380.552,And am I correct that the Board took exactly the opposite position until 1968?
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1380.552,1382.639,No Your Honor.
1973.73-556,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1454.681,1455.834,But it is moot.
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1455.834,1456.928,It is moot.
1973.73-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1458.742,1461.437,"Can I get back to this section again, Mr. Come?"
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1461.437,1462.896,Yes.
1973.73-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1462.896,1480.957,"I gather do you parse this restrain or course; one, and employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or; two, an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of the adjustment of grievances as two separate --"
1973.73-556,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1480.957,1482.356,Yes Your Honor.
1973.73-556,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1585.032,1586.452,Mr. Muller.
1973.73-556,1,39986,ray_c_muller,,1586.452,1591.14,"Mr. Justice Douglas, may it please the Court."
1973.73-556,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1899.006,1907.129,"But one thing, he wasn’t doing and he wasn’t supervising, because he did not have anybody to supervise."
1973.73-556,1,39986,ray_c_muller,,1908.276,1910.332,He had no one to supervise but he was --
1973.73-556,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1910.332,1913.289,So he couldn’t be doing supervisory work.
1973.73-556,1,39986,ray_c_muller,,1913.289,1917.184,He was performing a management function.
1973.73-556,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1917.67,1918.231,Other than?
1973.73-556,1,39986,ray_c_muller,,1918.231,1919.165,-- management function.
1973.73-556,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1919.165,1920.764,Other than supervising.
1973.73-556,1,39986,ray_c_muller,,1920.764,1926.658,"Other than supervising, that’s right."
1973.73-556,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1943.33,1948.103,What did Florida Light & Power tell the supervisors when the strike began?
1973.73-556,1,39986,ray_c_muller,,1948.103,1952.475,"Mr. Justice White, it was left to their discretion whether they would come in or not."
1973.73-556,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1955.599,1958.39,It is in the record about in the Bell case I think.
1973.73-556,1,39986,ray_c_muller,,1958.39,1959.942,Yes it is.
1973.73-556,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1959.942,1965.581,"Well now, you said to your supervisors, you may come in or stay away."
1973.73-556,1,39986,ray_c_muller,,1965.581,1966.771,That’s right.
1973.73-556,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1966.771,1971.53,"If you want to honor the picket line or obey a union rule, go ahead."
1973.73-556,1,39986,ray_c_muller,,1971.53,1975.722,They were encouraged to come in but there was no compulsion put on the supervisors to come in.
1973.73-556,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1978.88,1980.038,So you left it up to them?
1973.73-556,1,39986,ray_c_muller,,1980.038,1980.677,Yes.
1973.73-556,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1980.677,1983.944,"If you want to obey the union rule, go ahead and obey it."
1973.73-556,1,39986,ray_c_muller,,1983.944,1993.762,"Not particularly in the union rule sense, more in the sense if you feel a loyalty sense, but for any reason, you don’t want to come in with sense."
1973.73-556,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1993.762,2004.486,"But if the union has got membership rules, you don’t cross picket line during a strike, you left it up to the supervisors to whether to obey that rule."
1973.73-556,1,39986,ray_c_muller,,2004.486,2008.585,"Your Honor, it is a difficult situation this Court has currently before."
1973.73-556,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2009.109,2010.472,But you did leave it up to them?
1973.73-556,1,39986,ray_c_muller,,2010.472,2015.85,Yes.
1973.73-556,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2015.85,2031.197,So that you are not being deprived at anything that you insisted on by the union action against the supervisor.
1973.73-556,1,39986,ray_c_muller,,2042.542,2043.957,Mr. Justice White --
1973.73-556,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2043.957,2046.818,You didn’t file him to a labor practice judgment?
1973.73-556,1,39986,ray_c_muller,,2046.818,2047.491,"We did, yes."
1973.73-556,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2047.491,2048.656,You did?
1973.73-556,1,39986,ray_c_muller,,2050.202,2059.774,As to free our supervisors and the company really from this coercion if you like.
1973.73-556,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2062.976,2066.148,"Well, it’s not as coercion if you said stay if you want."
1973.73-556,1,39986,ray_c_muller,,2066.148,2070.867,Well I’m simplifying it just as you are simplifying it to me.
1973.73-556,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2078.523,2080.969,Protection of the management.
1973.73-556,1,39986,ray_c_muller,,2080.969,2081.632,Right.
1973.73-556,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2081.632,2084.748,That’s right.
1973.73-556,1,39986,ray_c_muller,,2084.748,2087.779,May I digress a minute for your question?
1973.73-556,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2087.779,2090.55,You go ahead I have got all I need.
1973.73-556,1,39986,ray_c_muller,,2090.55,2095.116,I may say this that we are in a right to work state in Florida.
1973.73-556,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2157.837,2160.494,Mr. Cohen.
1973.73-556,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2160.494,2164.027,Mr. Justice Douglas and may it please the Court.
1973.73-556,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2363.851,2371.559,Well I gather Mr. Cohen really what you are saying is that (b) the emphasis sought to be in the word selection.
1973.73-556,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2371.559,2373.44,That is what we think Congress intended.
1973.73-556,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2373.491,2384.259,"We have no further than to say that a union could not dictate to the employer whom it should have as the head of the personnel department, or the foreman, or vice president, president, or anything else?"
1973.73-556,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2384.259,2389.015,We think that is precisely what Congress had in mind and all that it had in mind.
1973.73-556,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2460.555,2477.706,You would say that take the same argument about a fine composed by the union for a supervisor in the process of handling a grievance construing the contract in a certain way?
1973.73-556,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2477.706,2481.022,"Our principal position here does not, Mr. Justice White."
1973.73-556,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2518.587,2523.806,Could Congress leave no latitude for the Board to construe that language in your opinion?
1973.73-556,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2523.806,2530.452,We believe Mr. Justice Rehnquist that Congress intended to read the Board completely out of the picture.
1973.73-556,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2596.718,2604.689,Except that the union could not pressure the employer to replace one’s supervisor with another.
1973.73-556,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2604.689,2606.646,Of that there is absolutely no question.
1973.73-556,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2608.795,2615.84,"And that puts the Board right into it, because 8 (b) (1) (B) creates an unfair labor practice which is for the Board is acceptable."
1973.73-556,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2615.84,2629.511,"Which is, as we submit, a very narrowly defined unfair labor practice, but we are taking the principal position here, and I am certainly willing to argue it on that basis that the Board may prohibit under 8 (b) (1) (B)."
1973.73-556,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2652.035,2655.267,8 (b) (1) (B) doesn’t use the word supervisors at all?
1973.73-556,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2655.267,2656.57,It does not.
1973.73-556,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2656.57,2658.256,It’s representatives in that.
1973.73-556,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2658.256,2661.811,"Representative for two purposes, collective bargaining and grievance adjustment."
1973.73-556,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2661.811,2664.958,And it’s in the strike part of collective bargaining?
1973.73-556,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2664.958,2671.793,"Under insurance agents, it is true that a strike he is part of the collective bargaining process."
1973.73-556,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2690.913,2698.22,"Supposing you have a -- supposing in the Florida strike, you had a group of rank-and-file employees who cross the picket line."
1973.73-556,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2704.497,2706.067,It is a completely different case.
1973.73-556,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2778.796,2781.767,On what basis needed to draw that?
1973.73-556,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2781.767,2793.809,"Because when a supervisor is in fact directing the work force, doing what he normally does, he is performing at the very least, a supervisory duty as that is defined in 2 (11)."
1973.73-556,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2793.809,2798.261,"Well then you do, then you do accept --"
1973.73-556,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2798.261,2798.845,Oakland Mailers?
1973.73-556,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2798.845,2800.328,Yes.
1973.73-556,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2800.328,2801.165,Very reluctant.
1973.73-556,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2811.386,2820.916,But the only way you accepted is by saying that the union would be influencing rather than replacing them if they find this board.
1973.73-556,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2820.916,2838.888,"To use the Board’s word would be interfering with the right of the employer to have this loyalty which we do not believe fits within 8 (b) (1) (B) at all, but if it does, it certainly fits no further than that."
1973.73-556,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3182.474,3183.828,Mr. Gold.
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,3183.828,3187.88,Thank you Mr. Justice Douglas and may it please the Court.
1973.73-556,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3739.524,3745.527,With this position that you just state now will lead you to disagree with Oakland Mailers?
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,3745.527,3754.953,The position that I’m stating now does not require a disagreement with Oakland Mailers.
1973.73-556,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3842.86,3857.503,"Of course, it strikes me that that one possible difficulty with your position is if you read the language very narrowly and say that the Board has virtually no power to expand on it."
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,3871.656,3913.035,"Well, I think the reason they can’t go the last step is the argument that I started off with and that is that whatever power the Board may have to interpret and expand a provision, it can't interpret or expand provisions into an interdiction or prohibition of the use of a lawful economic weapon during the strike unless there is a specific warrant in the legislative history, because this was the most sensitive area of the whole statute and the very point of Insurance Agents and Curtis Brothers is the point I’m just making, the point that’s embodied in Section 13."
1973.73-556,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4009.713,4020.166,"Putting it the other way, Mr. Gold, what you’re saying is, I gather that Mailers has nothing whatever to do with the effect on the right to strike."
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4020.166,4021.131,That’s right.
1973.73-556,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4021.131,4024.57,"And that in this instance, there’s very much to do with it."
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4026.894,4027.389,That’s right.
1973.73-556,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4027.959,4031.88,Therefore you ought not give an expansive reading that 8 (b) (1) (B) are not account.
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4031.88,4039.064,"That’s right, or to expand it to that degree, now whether they are -- it can be expanded in other areas where the admonitions contained."
1973.73-556,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4039.064,4044.686,Whether it might be expanded in any area where it doesn’t adverse the effect the right to strike --
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4044.686,4045.32,Is another question.
1973.73-556,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4045.32,4046.085,Another question.
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4046.085,4051.974,Right and because the determinants are different and the determinants of Congressional action were different.
1973.73-556,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4055.35,4075.914,"May I have -- well, I have interrupted you, and now, in what respect do you say that this kind of discipline -- now giving it the more expansive reading in this situation does adversely affect the right to strike?"
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4075.914,4079.112,"Well, the right to strike --"
1973.73-556,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4079.112,4082.237,"For instance, it all comes out of the guarantee of Section 13."
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4082.237,4084.504,Right.
1973.73-556,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4101.572,4103.536,"Even though it’s post strike, usually."
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4103.536,4104.212,Right.
1973.73-556,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4104.212,4109.211,"In fact, I gather here these fines are levied at the strikes were all over --"
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4109.211,4133.854,"Well, but as just normally, the case -- the use of a power of that kind is intended to influence conduct and the very fact that it’s there is an ingredient in the strike if it was known that that could not be done, the trike would not have that support of weapon."
1973.73-556,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4172.881,4182.532,Is -- has the Board indicated that the union could or could not expel the supervisor for crossing the line.
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4182.532,4186.698,My understanding is that we cannot even expel them.
1973.73-556,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4189.403,4193.076,Does that both -- are both expressly involved in the case?
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4193.076,4197.168,"Well, Florida Power -- in Florida Power & Light, there were expulsions."
1973.73-556,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4197.478,4198.228,As well as fine.
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4198.228,4212.195,"So, we have -- not only has the Board arrived in a situation which this weapon to support the union’s strike is struck from its hands but it’s also caused the Union to keep this people in."
1973.73-556,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4212.195,4212.419,Mr. Cohen says --
1973.73-556,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4212.419,4214.23,"Yeah, I thought Mr. -- excuse me."
1973.73-556,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4214.23,4214.803,Go ahead.
1973.73-556,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4214.803,4224.462,I thought Mr. Cohen had indicated that that is a general policy at least the union could insist that supervisors get out of the union when they become supervisors.
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4224.462,4234.05,"Well, I take it that the distinction he would make would be that whether it’s a general policy they can’t do it as a disciplinary act."
1973.73-556,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4234.05,4238.876,"And that if they were going really -- if they’re really serious about it, they would have to expel everybody."
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4239.766,4239.904,That’s right.
1973.73-556,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4239.904,4241.339,-- and not just the ones who crossed the picket line.
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4241.339,4255.378,"Yes, and the same that can or cannot have a disciplinary connotation depending on the time it’s employed, the circumstances would set and so on and I certainly concede that distinction."
1973.73-556,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4424.29,4431.46,"For instance, Mr. Gold, did the 8 (b) (1) (B) comes chronologically after 2 (3), 2 (11) and 14 (a)."
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4431.46,4437.604,"Yes, the evolution was that the Case Bill treated the Packard problem in terms of status."
1973.73-556,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4522.193,4526.912,"As I recall on history, some Jones & Laughlin Mines example --"
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4526.912,4527.114,That’s right.
1973.73-556,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4527.114,4530.658,"-- where supervisors refused to leave the mine, or something like that."
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4530.658,4544.774,Right and they quoted -- we’ve quoted it in our brief if I can find it.
1973.73-556,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4623.353,4641.853,"Well, the union of course, explicitly under Section 13 has the right to strike but surely the employer has the right to use self-help and to do whatever he can to keep the business running during a strike, isn’t he?"
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4641.853,4642.924,Yes.
1973.73-556,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4643.569,4647.66,And indeed has the right of certain circumstances to lock up.
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4647.66,4651.523,That’s correct as you stated in American Ship and Brown Food.
1973.73-556,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4651.523,4656.343,And it seems to me that really this part of your argument is almost a question begging.
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4657.822,4658.528,"Well, no."
1973.73-556,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4798.066,4800.9,And what this case is about is what can the union do!
1973.73-556,3,34498,laurence_gold,,4800.9,4801.269,That’s right.
1973.73-556,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4865.479,4870.185,"Time about to expire, do you have few things to say, Mr. Cohen?"
1973.73-556,4,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,4870.185,4875.131,I just have one or two brief comments.
1973.73-556,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4875.131,4878.148,You’re going to cover the Insurance Agents in effect with the --
1973.73-556,4,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,4878.148,4887.318,"Yes, that’s what I intended to address myself to."
1973.73-556,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5133.826,5134.552,Thank you gentlemen.
