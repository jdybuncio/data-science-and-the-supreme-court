1966.781,0,16666,arnold_ordman,,0.0,7.758,-- appeals for the Fifth Circuit which denied enforcement to a board order.
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1319.485,1326.76,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1405.458,1410.726,"I gather -- I gather in such a suit, you would deny liability for any vacation pay?"
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1410.726,1445.457,"It's -- it's -- we probably would, Your Honor but if there's a question and we recognize there's a question and we pointed this out to the union in our letter to them that since there was a question that we thought it was a matter which should be resolved through negotiation as to what those rights might be to try the one, answer the 301 suit and two, to not cause this action to arise and it may be well remembered that the union would not even discuss this matter at the bargaining table even though there were bargaining sessions being held throughout this period of time."
1966.781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1445.457,1446.567,To go and sue them.
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1446.567,1447.333,Yes sir.
1966.781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1447.333,1447.78,Excuse me.
1966.781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1447.78,1454.792,Why did the employer then it wouldn't make these payments to some -- make payments to the others?
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1468.238,1469.362,"Yes, sir."
1966.781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1469.362,1470.809,-- why did it make any payments to anybody?
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1470.809,1473.984,"Well, I think we're all from the premise that we pay it out in the contract."
1966.781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1490.3,1493.209,"Yes, but you didn't make payments to all the employees."
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1493.209,1496.509,"No, because of this qualifying which this plan adopted."
1966.781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1505.123,1508.795,"Yes, but that was -- you were making payments for prior years."
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1508.795,1513.163,"Well, sir, it was not here -- here is the practical problem that you have in this such question."
1966.781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1544.391,1545.73,"When -- I was going to ask you, Mr. Bowden."
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1545.73,1545.969,"Yes, sir."
1966.781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1545.969,1549.069,"When the strike was finally settled, when in December of the year, I think."
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1549.069,1550.811,Yes.
1966.781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1550.811,1556.645,And I suppose it was after the settlement there was a new collective bargaining agreement.
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1557.324,1557.723,"No, sir."
1966.781,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1578.905,1580.231,So there's no --
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1580.231,1581.172,There's none.
1966.781,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1581.172,1582.711,There is no bargaining agreement anymore?
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1582.711,1583.352,That's correct.
1966.781,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1583.352,1586.954,I see.
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1586.954,1590.205,"Now, there's other --"
1966.781,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1590.205,1602.986,"Well, I just wonder and if -- if they cancel the contract and at the time they cancelled it that there are wages due to them, you'd have to pay them as wages, wouldn't you?"
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1602.986,1604.008,"I would say, yes, Your Honor."
1966.781,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1604.008,1606.156,"Well, then there wouldn't be any question about it."
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1606.156,1607.599,That's correct.
1966.781,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1607.599,1624.937,"On -- now, on the other hand, they had worked -- worked according to their contract and had earned certain vacation rights at that time they terminated but why wouldn't they -- why wouldn't they be entitled to that also?"
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1624.937,1640.46,"Your Honor, the question was, had they qualified under the agreement, and this was the problem that we tried to get the union to the bargain table to discuss, this is the problem that we advised their attorney about by letter in July that there was a question in my mind where they had any rights under that agreement."
1966.781,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1640.46,1644.838,Isn't that a question of law for the Labor Board to determine?
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1644.838,1645.201,"No, sir."
1966.781,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1658.59,1664.344,"Suppose you haven't paid them their wages, would they have any relief for the Board?"
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1664.344,1669.137,"I don't think they would as an independent isolated matter, I'd say no."
1966.781,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1738.23,1742.276,Let me just see if I understand you.
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1769.783,1770.157,Your Honor --
1966.781,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1770.157,1772.21,-- or isn't it?
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1772.21,1774.977,-- it's going to depend on what position of the party.
1966.781,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1776.308,1779.45,"Well, let's take -- just take the position that I gave you."
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1791.676,1793.161,I would say no.
1966.781,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1793.161,1797.183,They'd have to go -- they'd have to sue under 301 and some other --
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1797.183,1804.188,"They have the relief be that if they had to violate contract, they would have relief to the greatest procedure and the other function there."
1966.781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1830.829,1833.554,"You really mean it, the refusal to pay accrued wages --"
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1833.554,1834.243,Yes.
1966.781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1834.243,1839.346,"-- because people were on strike, is not an unfair labor practice?"
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1839.346,1842.36,"Well, I don't know that that was the exact question."
1966.781,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1842.36,1843.596,That was the exact question.
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1843.637,1848.416,"Yes, sir and if you refuse to pay vacation wages to all or some."
1966.781,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1848.416,1850.214,I was talking about wages.
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1855.649,1865.07,"Yes, but are you referring to, a refusal to pay any wages or part wages and part -- they did not pay?"
1966.781,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1865.07,1866.904,"Well, I'm not sure aware."
1966.781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1866.904,1867.843,All or any part.
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1875.594,1886.233,"I'm speaking now that when you say all or part, you mean that some of the striker or some of the employees received while some did not receive."
1966.781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1890.503,1896.186,"Clearly, clearly if you refuse to pay because they were on strike, there would be an open and shut unfairly labor practice."
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1896.186,1896.74,That's right.
1966.781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1896.74,1902.318,"But if you refuse to anybody his wages, that would simply be a breach of contract."
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1902.318,1902.769,That's correct.
1966.781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1902.769,1903.549,"That's your point, wasn't it?"
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,1903.549,1904.823,I agree with you.
1966.781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2049.065,2054.818,But at least you have had to give the increase to everybody who was back at work at that time?
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,2054.818,2055.748,"Yes, sir."
1966.781,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2061.083,2072.636,Were the nonstrikers paid on the basis of computation that would have been the same as -- that was the same as if it had been made under the contract?
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,2072.636,2073.371,"Yes, sir."
1966.781,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2073.371,2085.728,So that what happened here is that the nonstrikers were paid on the basis of the contract formula or its equivalent and the strikers were not?
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,2085.728,2090.28,"Yes, sir, that's correct."
1966.781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2280.065,2291.06,I never did understand that why it was the company adopted this vacation plan?
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,2291.06,2292.593,"Well, the reason that they --"
1966.781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2292.593,2295.284,And I assume that there was no -- say no contractual obligation here.
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,2295.284,2295.818,Yes.
1966.781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2295.818,2300.571,At least that was your position and so the company decides to be what?
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,2300.571,2310.358,"Well, you have to remember and keep in mind that during this period of time, even though there was a strike in progress and there were replacements being made, there were negotiations."
1966.781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2310.358,2310.996,Yes.
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,2310.996,2319.002,There were certain offers by the company and certain offers by the union on the Board being negotiated.
1966.781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2327.255,2331.423,Even it was a good business policy to put in a vacation pay plan.
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,2331.423,2349.528,"Yes, this was a proposal and -- so this was put into effect because there were employees who were inquiring about it as a matter of some concern about who was going to get vacation pay and what the policy on vacation would be."
1966.781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2381.415,2394.729,What was the purpose of adopting the July 1 cut-off for employees when the vacation pay was in the new plan and there actually lose payments for the year before?
1966.781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2395.677,2408.385,It's for the year before and a lot of people might have -- had worked the same period of time before which the vacation pay was made who didn't get the vacation pay.
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,2408.385,2408.927,That's correct.
1966.781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2409.476,2412.3,So what was the purpose of adopting the July 1 --
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,2412.3,2423.324,"The July 1 date and this goes back in history, as we've pointed out, there have been negotiations and contract relationship between this union and this company for more than 20 years."
1966.781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2439.201,2441.459,"Well, has anybody figured out what it is yet?"
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,2441.459,2467.238,"No, they have not but I think the only -- the only -- the only reason I see it for being there that someone in the negotiation period that in as much as that contract was expiring on May 16 that the fact that they had a subsequent -- they were receiving the money, might be some bargaining too later used to keep it from being kept."
1966.781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2467.238,2478.621,For what period at time where the vacation payments made to those to whom they were made for the year prior to what date?
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,2478.621,2484.541,For the year prior to July 1.
1966.781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2484.541,2487.979,Or it wasn't for the year prior to May 16?
1966.781,1,37371,o_r_t_bowden,,2487.979,2489.725,"No, for the year prior to July 1."
1966.781,2,16666,arnold_ordman,,2592.292,2594.004,Only two very brief comments.
1966.781,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2626.859,2628.713,"Would you speak a little louder please, Mr. Ordman?"
1966.781,2,16666,arnold_ordman,,2628.713,2629.305,"Yes, sir."
1966.781,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2668.038,2671.354,"That has to be your argument, the future effects, future strikes."
1966.781,2,16666,arnold_ordman,,2672.578,2673.288,"Yes, sir."
1966.781,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2673.288,2676.374,And that does make it different from Erie Resistor not only in the --
1966.781,2,16666,arnold_ordman,,2676.374,2676.811,That's correct.
1966.781,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2676.811,2686.65,Not only in the quantum of the -- of the -- of the favor to them shown by between super seniority and vacation pay.
1966.781,2,16666,arnold_ordman,,2693.895,2701.302,"As we see this case in the balancing consideration that this Court talked about in the Erie Resistor, the weights on both sides --"
1966.781,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2701.302,2701.596,Yes.
1966.781,2,16666,arnold_ordman,,2701.596,2706.538,-- are correspondingly less but it must be viewed in that context.
1966.781,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2706.538,2708.384,Very well.
