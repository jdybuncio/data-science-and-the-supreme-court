1960.219,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,12.447,"Carl Schnell et al., versus Peter Eckrich & Sons, Number 219."
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,12.447,12.727,If the Court --
1960.219,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,12.727,13.858,Mr. Merriam
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,13.858,50.909,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and if the Court please, this case arose from two patent infringement cases brought in Fort Wayne, Indiana against Peter Eckrich & Sons, who were -- who were and are an Indiana corporation and resident in Fort Wayne and against the Allbright-Nell Company which was an Illinois corporation having its main place of business in Chicago and not normally subject to service of process in Indiana."
1960.219,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,290.158,291.5,What is that case Mr. --
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,291.5,297.201,"That is Lovejoy against Murray, 3 Wall. 1, 18."
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,427.486,433.028,"Of the -- the respondent isn't a real party in interest, is he?"
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,445.266,446.868,"I think we would, Mr. Justice Frankfurter."
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,446.868,448.519,In this case?
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,449.878,451.165,"Well, not jurisdiction in that state, no."
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,451.165,451.617,"Well, All right."
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,451.617,453.582,-- no right.
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,453.771,462.041,That's my point and you're really -- the whole controversy is centered around the venue provision and whether or not it's been waived.
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,462.041,463.515,"Well, I think that's so."
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,463.515,473.741,"Therefore, and I don't see how to talk about real party in interest helps you any because if it is a real party in interest, then certainly you haven't got venue in the Seventh Circuit."
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,473.741,475.931,In the -- in Indiana we would've in --
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,475.931,476.534,In Indiana.
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,476.534,478.6,-- and in Illinois which is still the same circuit.
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,478.6,480.125,I beg your pardon.
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,482.091,486.073,"No, we would not if we had sued merely the Allbright-Nell Company in Indiana."
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,486.073,490.044,Although in -- in the sense it is the real party in interest to this litigation?
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,490.044,491.403,That's right.
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,491.403,496.883,"So that's -- what that looks to me is that either have a technical question, isn't it?"
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,503.604,514.235,"Well, actually, of course in the proceedings in this case where it is controlling the situation and has come in to the Court and take an advantage of its processes --"
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,514.235,516.789,"Well, how could it come in, who brought him in?"
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,516.789,519.71,"No, it came in, in the first case before we brought the man."
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,534.419,538.167,"Well, did they come in and any -- in any technical venue sense?"
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,538.167,538.499,No.
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,556.383,568.135,"Suppose you hadn't named them and they had conflict -- they had conference that's able or actively had conducted the litigation, would that have been a waiver?"
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,568.135,580.5,"Well, under the Ocean Accident case in 143 F.2nd which where that same thing happened, they held that they could name there was a party even after the case was over."
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,612.872,617.658,The defended meaning that they actually (Inaudible) comfort to charge him a litigation?
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,617.658,618.551,"Yes, sir."
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,618.551,622.752,And that's what is called defending a suit for venue purposes.
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,622.752,625.044,"For venue purposes, they held that in that case, the --"
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,625.044,628.36,In that circuit (Inaudible)
1960.219,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,628.36,648.511,"Do I understand, Mr. Merriam that after you brought this and it should join Allbright-Nell, some type of process is extended to (Inaudible) the -- it thereafter came in and moved to quash, the court sustained the motion to quash that process?"
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,648.511,649.958,That's correct.
1960.219,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,649.958,655.737,"And thereafter, it moved to dismiss and that case is dismissed, is it correct?"
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,655.737,656.758,"Yes, sir."
1960.219,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,656.758,676.067,"Now then, is it your claim that party did thereafter in defending the Peter Eckrich Company under this contract constituted an entry of appearance by the Allbright-Nell Company in the case?"
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,676.067,684.598,"No, it's our position that what is done theretofore in defending on behalf of Peter Eckrich & Sons constituted a general appearance."
1960.219,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,732.837,734.472,I'm not sure I understand.
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,742.383,742.947,"Yes, sir."
1960.219,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,742.947,750.436,"Now, what it had done before was its own defense wasn't it, moving to quash, and then to defend?"
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,750.436,752.824,"No, there had been other proceedings, Your Honor."
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,783.536,789.556,But were -- were all the -- all the other actions taken in the name of Peter Eckrich?
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,789.556,792.901,"Yes, sir."
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,792.901,804.341,Then how -- how do you charge those against Allbright except that they were naturally interested under their agreement and as the whole of the tracking (Inaudible)?
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,804.341,818.705,It is our position that they under their contract were appearing in a situation where they were acting as a party as defined by this Court in Lovejoy against Murray.
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,818.705,821.761,"That's the question, whether it was a party."
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,821.761,822.184,"Well, in Lovejoy --"
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,822.184,825.544,"A party is a very technical term, isn't it or a concept?"
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,825.544,826.738,The language which I read in --
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,826.738,831.181,"I know language, I know -- I mean language but let's analyze this, Mr. Merriam."
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,837.217,841.434,"No, a party who is under a contract to do it and does so in the --"
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,841.434,841.512,Does so.
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,841.512,849.092,-- in case and acts in such a way as to become bound the result of the litigation.
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,849.092,876.89,"Well, it maybe that the consequence over the -- the whole process of a litigation may bind them on -- on that theory to what extent to that runs, but where the threshold here, namely whether the mere fact that he's carrying out his contract of the customer makes him a party and the venue set for the term and Congress has darn good reasons that made these localizing provisions or limitations."
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,876.89,877.659,That is correct.
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,882.652,886.435,"I've done my share in favor of getting waiver, Mr. Merriam."
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,886.435,887.301,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.219,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,887.301,908.45,"Mr. Merriam, would your rule, if I understand it, not make every indemnitor, every liability ensure then a party to -- a direct party to every suit for damages within the coverage of the policy?"
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,908.45,915.113,Not unless he did in fact go in and take over the litigation in his own interest.
1960.219,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,915.113,918.709,"Well, don't they always do that even that the policy so provide."
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,918.709,921.383,I think that the policies normally do so to provide it.
1960.219,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,936.181,943.016,"Well, your law doesn't allow direct suits against liability insurance, doesn't it, in Illinois?"
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,943.016,961.115,"Well, I -- that's not my phase of the practice but it's my understanding that you're not -- that you're correct and you're not even allowed, as I understand it, to name the insurance company or to utter any statement about the fact there is an insurance company to the jury."
1960.219,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,961.115,968.775,Only one state provides momentarily more like it does and that is Louisiana.
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,968.775,987.858,"The situation so far as authority's goal is that there are -- the case below or is against me with the dissenting opinion of Mr. -- of Judge Platt, there is the Ocean Accident case in the Sixth Circuit in my favor."
1960.219,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1017.75,1019.271,What is that citation?
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,1019.271,1026.292,"281 F.2nd 292, Dow Chemical against Metlon."
1960.219,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1096.449,1123.407,"Mr. Merriam, do you make any distinction at all between the case of a mere indemnitor such as an insurance company and a -- and a, say, an automobile accident case and this case where it is claimed that -- that the indemnitor himself was a tortfeasor and a proper party in -- in the case had he been in the jurisdiction."
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,1123.407,1129.788,"I haven't tried to, Mr. Chief Justice but I think one might well be done and a distinction might be made."
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1275.339,1283.826,"Those might be argued, aren't you going to -- if Allbright have the principal people then why don't you go into their jurisdiction and sue them there?"
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,1283.826,1301.852,"Well that -- actually, the time this suit was filed, the device was in Indiana that we were suing on, and at that time, it was the only one, but of course now, the -- we could sue Allbright-Nell in Chicago, we couldn't sue the Eckrich Company there who was a party with conspiracy."
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1301.852,1305.798,"Well, after all by this (Inaudible) sending forth."
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,1305.798,1317.074,"Yes, and this happens or the Eckrich Company has agreed that it will go to Illinois if we ever go there but that should have nothing to do with the rights and we were the ones who selected the forum in the beginning and -- and started there."
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1321.644,1330.301,"And you are suggesting -- what kind of a question is -- and determined by some ultimate principles, a very tricky character."
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,1330.301,1332.742,"Well, sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't, Your Honor."
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1337.07,1347.806,"No, no, I understand that but I mean even the general considerations on an ultimate consideration that you -- the patent venue statute is a particular statute, isn't it?"
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,1347.806,1348.527,"Yes, sir."
1960.219,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1348.527,1353.437,With particular provisions deferring from other venue statutes (Inaudible)
1960.219,0,19644,charles_j_merriam,,1353.437,1362.949,"Well, this Court has so held."
1960.219,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1362.949,1367.665,Mr. Rathburn.
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1367.665,1372.364,May it please the Court.
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1529.284,1531.572,Is that the clear tort distinction that he made?
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1531.572,1532.844,That's the distinction that he makes.
1960.219,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1532.844,1535.543,Just naming it as a party --
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1535.543,1535.95,He -- I think --
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1535.95,1544.787,-- although concededly -- although concededly venue precludes bringing it into Court --
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1544.787,1544.997,That's it.
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1544.997,1546.637,-- if it conducts to the effect?
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1546.637,1548.175,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1558.69,1566.715,How many -- how many Court of Appeals cases have flatly adjudicated this problem?
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1566.715,1569.458,"There are four that I am familiar with, Your Honor."
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1569.458,1569.897,And --
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1569.897,1577.988,One is the Freeman Sweet case which is cited in our brief.
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1577.988,1578.677,What are they (Voice Overlap) --
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1578.677,1580.525,The Freeman's --
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1580.525,1585.876,-- hurry up.
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1585.876,1591.975,The second one is the Dow Chemical case which is decided in the Fourth Circuit.
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1591.975,1593.686,That's this -- this 281?
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1593.686,1614.911,"Yes and there's a case in the Eighth Circuit which is cited at -- which is 25 -- no this, no I'm sorry, Your Honor, 96 F.2nd 979."
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1614.911,1616.257,That's the Maine case (Inaudible)
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1616.257,1621.236,Kresge versus Winget Chemical Kickernick Co.
1960.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1621.236,1622.417,It's not in your brief?
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1622.417,1622.769,Yes sir.
1960.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1624.394,1626.637,How do you spell that?
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1626.637,1639.064,"Kresge Company, S. S. Kresge Company versus Winget Kickernick Company at 97 F.2nd 979, that's cited at page 11 of our brief."
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1644.689,1647.502,"What's the fourth, that -- that's three as I count it?"
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1647.502,1648.951,"The fourth one is this case, Your Honor."
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1648.951,1649.953,"Oh, I beg your pardon."
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1654.796,1655.931,It has -- I --
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1655.931,1657.636,What -- what I want to know is this?
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1659.746,1660.178,Yes.
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1660.178,1666.235,"-- which deal precisely -- explicitly with this problem, what is the decision of the four?"
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1667.611,1669.653,"Yes, sir."
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1669.653,1671.779,What about District Courts?
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1671.779,1672.832,About what?
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1672.832,1672.964,District Courts.
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1672.964,1674.858,District Courts?
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1675.637,1676.589,Of course there and those four --
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1676.589,1676.756,Yes.
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1676.756,1680.78,"-- had come up in the District Court, any -- any District Court that didn't go up?"
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1680.78,1704.752,"Yes there are two District Court cases in Illinois which petitioners rely on, both of which were appealed but in neither of which was this point raised on appeal and the court below speaking of them said that they could not be considered as adjudicating the point here in issue."
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1704.752,1713.416,"Now, when you say patent law so patent practice, so why do you depend on what might be called practice."
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1713.416,1714.803,Yes.
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1714.803,1721.859,Are there any other -- any other relevant material except the four decisions?
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1728.774,1734.288,I don't think there has been any comment on it by writers on this particular problem that we have here.
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1734.288,1734.502,It calls upon --
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1734.502,1738.542,And whether you waive venue by this particular conduct.
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1738.542,1743.631,How -- how recurrent is this?
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1743.631,1752.091,"Well, the first to these cases that I've cited goes back to 96 F.2nd, Your Honor and those are all the cases that we've been able to find."
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1782.322,1785.934,"Well, the -- controlling the defense isn't decisive as you indicate?"
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1785.934,1787.283,It is a res judicata.
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1787.283,1787.805,Yes.
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1787.805,1787.868,Yes.
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1787.868,1792.709,But I mean for that -- but it doesn't -- that doesn't take care of the venue problem.
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1792.709,1793.984,"No, it doesn't."
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1793.984,1798.465,So that the differentiation is the fact that you're a main defendant.
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1798.465,1799.288,"Yes, sir."
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1799.288,1799.981,But of course that is --
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1799.981,1801.127,That is their position.
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1801.127,1804.822,That's the way the law grows by having lawyers take a new (Inaudible)
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1804.822,1809.48,"Yes it is, Your Honor."
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1879.739,1884.117,"I -- I didn't quite follow, he can get a declaratory judgment in his home?"
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1884.117,1885.943,In the patent owner's home.
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1885.943,1887.216,In the patent owner's --
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1887.216,1890.631,Which maybe foreign to the manufacturer's home forum.
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1933.92,1937.74,"What do you say to the -- well, I'm interrupting?"
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1937.74,1937.93,If -- no.
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1937.93,1938.555,You go on ahead.
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,1941.114,1946.052,"No, I -- I think that petitioner's arguments on the other side are -- are largely words."
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2044.778,2045.11,Either the --
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,2045.11,2046.138,-- this question -- excuse me.
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2046.138,2055.663,"Do you agree that if this litigation on the merits had gone against Eckrich, it would've found Allbright?"
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,2055.663,2056.885,Absolutely.
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2056.885,2105.722,"Well, then one naturally ask this question which I take it was rather the -- who makes that, Mr. Merriam's argument, namely if a non-technical party is so involved in the litigation into which he could not have been subject and in which -- into which he could not have been drawn and into which he is not a formal party, yet he is so involved and related with it, inexplicably tied up with it that the judgment is foreclosed against him, why withdraw practical purposes before the Court."
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,2105.722,2124.707,"Because if res judicata is the only problem he has, there will have to be a new suit brought against him in his home jurisdiction where he is present and where an accounting will have to be held."
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2267.242,2268.237,I quite --
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,2268.237,2268.451,I beg your pardon.
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2268.451,2269.841,I beg pardon your.
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,2275.005,2275.709,Yes.
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2275.709,2308.187,"But what's still -- I'd like to get enlightment indictment on is why if Allbright are so committed to this litigation on purposely using different words, if they're so committed to this litigation by their conduct in it but a human practical conduct in it that the fate of their interest is depending on the outcome of this litigation, that's what I'm asking, am I not?"
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,2308.187,2309.051,Yes.
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2309.467,2341.3,"Why if that is so, why isn't such commitment, such -- such dependence of their interest of safeguarding of their interest in this litigation to which they're not a party, so intrinsically joining up with an entering into a -- a relationship to, that that's the best use of the term to the litigation that one case say they waive the right to abstain from being so involved."
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,2341.3,2349.455,"Because Your Honor, they have preserved the right not to be made a formal party so that they can't get out."
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2372.224,2372.657,"Well, they may --"
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,2372.657,2374.187,They are flexible as long as --
1960.219,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2374.187,2378.356,They may think this isn't a good case on which to go up if this was against him.
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,2378.356,2380.607,That -- that is correct.
1960.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2609.131,2609.934,In which case?
1960.219,1,36559,m_hudson_rathburn,,2609.934,2617.54,"Stonite, 315 U.S., decided in our brief at Page 566."
1960.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2961.5,2965.311,Mr. Merriam.
1960.219,2,19644,charles_j_merriam,,2965.311,2980.379,"Mr. Rathburn in stating that the plaintiffs were residents of Chicago has overlooked the fact that Mr. Schnell who is one of the petitioners is a German resident who lives in near Stuttgart, Germany."
1960.219,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2982.424,2984.476,"What was that, I didn't get that?"
1960.219,2,19644,charles_j_merriam,,2984.476,2990.591,"The petitioner Carl Schnell is a German resident, a national living near Stuttgart, Germany not in Chicago."
1960.219,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2990.591,2993.813,"You can't get him anyhow, even in Indiana or in Chicago?"
1960.219,2,19644,charles_j_merriam,,2993.813,2995.822,"Well, as a plaintiff he could go to either place."
1960.219,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2995.822,2997.866,He could incidentally.
1960.219,2,19644,charles_j_merriam,,2997.866,3012.854,The Winget case which Mr. Rathburn has referred to was one in which the defending corporation was not named as a party and that appears from the opinion itself.
1960.219,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3104.67,3110.398,"Mr. Merriam, before you sit down, I wondered if you'd say a word more about the Merriam case."
1960.219,2,19644,charles_j_merriam,,3117.803,3134.769,"Well, his -- his argument, as I read it was that the petitioner or the plaintiff had put his ground on the basis that there was res judicata and he said this is not a proper argument that there is no res judicata."
1960.219,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3134.769,3159.31,"Yes, but there -- why do you -- a great deal of your argument unless I am doing injustice to it, a great deal or -- or forcible part of your argument is that in as much as res judicata would operate against Allbright, it's little unreal is that the face the actualities of life to say that they're not before the Court."
1960.219,2,19644,charles_j_merriam,,3160.807,3162.417,"I think not, but there is this difference."
1960.219,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3162.417,3174.46,"Now, if that is so and Justice Pickering says, ""There are good reasons for -- for having res judicata applied, the litigation comes to an end."""
1960.219,2,19644,charles_j_merriam,,3206.091,3210.054,"Well, I think that this -- there is this distinction Your Honor."
1960.219,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3243.627,3245.119,"Well, are we --"
1960.219,2,19644,charles_j_merriam,,3245.119,3254.462,"The -- the argument which I am making was not made there whether it could've been or not, I would say that under the situation where it was a supplemental bill, they couldn't have made the argument."
1960.219,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3260.437,3278.63,"All I'm suggesting is that it would be a still nice requirement to -- to suggest to the Court that that if you originally joined a non-coercible party, as a party, then you're before the Court if you really defend."
1960.219,2,19644,charles_j_merriam,,3287.757,3288.14,I think not.
1960.219,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3288.14,3292.589,And that there hasn't been and as to as if you Ogilvie and Meyer.
1960.219,2,19644,charles_j_merriam,,3311.921,3320.767,"Well, I think a defendant has a choice once he is named as a party, they know what he's going to do from that time on and it's important in that -- in that phase of it."
1960.219,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3321.264,3328.146,"And we had the plain choice on -- on Ogilvie and Merriam and they neither he could've come in without -- if nobody would've objected, he would've been in."
1960.219,2,19644,charles_j_merriam,,3328.146,3337.507,"Well, he said, I'm not in anymore when it came to the supplemental bill and that's one of the reasons he want to get out but didn't pass on that and he said it was too late."
