1973.72-1162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,43.109,"We will hear arguments next in 72-1162, Federal Power Commission against New England Power Co."
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,47.354,50.506,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1162,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,94.52,97.565,"Well, it’s not only similar but it does raise the same issue, doesn’t it?"
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,97.565,100.26,"One of the issues is identical, Mr. Justice Douglas."
1973.72-1162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,513.077,518.816,"Mr. Jones, before you do, and I’m asking this primarily simply out of curiosity."
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,555.494,557.842,"Well, frankly, I don’t know the answer to that question."
1973.72-1162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,572.758,573.642,Your impression is--
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,573.642,574.531,That’s my impression.
1973.72-1162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,575.647,583.099,"That these are perhaps the only two agencies that do it in this way, apart from filing fees."
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,583.099,591.193,It may be that other agencies have recently imposed such fees or are giving serious consideration to doing so.
1973.72-1162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,597.62,601.086,Thank you.
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,601.086,608.831,Before turning to a discussion of the kinds of issues that were discussed under Title V in the previous case.
1973.72-1162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,763.017,765.744,Where is the statute?
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,766.364,772.011,"In our brief, it’s on pages 2 and 3."
1973.72-1162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,772.011,772.729,Alright.
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,779.417,780.145,That’s right.
1973.72-1162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,788.058,801.74,"To or for any person, and the parenthetical material simply makes clear that the definition of a person is a broad definition."
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,803.122,803.511,That’s correct.
1973.72-1162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,803.511,808.706,That your argument ultimately has to be then that a whole industry can be a person.
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,810.324,813.188,"Well there, I suppose, would be two parallel arguments."
1973.72-1162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,830.084,834.806,Because it’s to or for any person.
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,844.752,847.135,Definition or an elaboration of the meaning.
1973.72-1162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,847.135,849.505,"In other words, “person.”"
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,863.579,869.451,"Well, as I say, the fee of course is not imposed on the industry qua-industry."
1973.72-1162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,871.712,873.232,Each constituent.
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,873.232,883.302,"Clearly, each company is a person, so that in that sense, a fee as to each member of the industry would clearly seems to be authorized under Title V."
1973.72-1162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,883.302,887.972,"Well, this thing of value performed, furnished, provided, granted, prepared, or issued--"
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,887.972,889.877,"The question would be, I suppose, whether the word “performed--"
1973.72-1162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,889.877,891.305,To or for any person.
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,891.305,897.835,-- for the industry” is for each member of the industry.
1973.72-1162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,897.835,915.772,"It’s whether or not the thing of value to or for any person can be read because of this parenthetical phrase to mean “to or for an industry,” isn’t it, or “all the persons in the industry” be generally."
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,915.772,919.501,"Well, I think I understand you and I think I agree with you, Your Honor."
1973.72-1162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,920.028,928.019,The question is not -- but I wondered if that isn’t the question as a matter of statutory construction?
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,928.019,950.857,"Well, I think the question is a matter of statutory construction, as it arises in this case, is whether an industry-wide benefit, that is a benefit or work performed for the whole industry indivisibly, nevertheless is a benefit to or for the constituent members of that industry for purposes of Title V."
1973.72-1162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,978.623,992.613,"So long as I’ve already interrupted you, Mr. Jones, could -- how much of a problem would it be for you to supply us, after sometime, within a reasonable time of the practices of the --"
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,992.613,993.077,We could make a --
1973.72-1162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,993.077,997.391,-- of the other major agencies like the CAB and the SEC and the --
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,997.391,999.396,We could make a survey of that kind and let you know.
1973.72-1162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,999.396,1003.358,-- [Voice Overlap] about whether or not they charge their -- the industries.
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1010.293,1012.09,We will be happy to do that and supply the Court with an admission.
1973.72-1162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1012.09,1019.494,"In doing that, Mr. Jones, let me just enlarge on it a little bit, if I may."
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1074.215,1075.181,I think the answer to that --
1973.72-1162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1075.181,1083.709,-- I think that that should be included with your information about what agencies have proceeded to exercise this authority?
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1083.709,1093.281,"Well, the origin of the fees in these two cases is fairly clear from the statement of the facts in the respective briefs."
1973.72-1162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1126.468,1133.167,"Title V does this for many years, so there has been no Department of Experiments --"
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1133.167,1133.704,That’s right.
1973.72-1162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1133.704,1134.786,In a 20-year period.
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1134.786,1136.585,That’s right.
1973.72-1162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1136.585,1139.146,"But it hasn’t been exercised until now, is that not?"
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1139.146,1148.231,"It’s been a discretionary authority which, at least by these two agencies, has not been exercised in this manner in the past."
1973.72-1162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1163.82,1171.182,"Of course, the Post Office has been doing this, I guess, since the first year violation, isn’t it, or something similar to that?"
1973.72-1162,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1171.182,1179.404,"It certainly imposes a user fee, that’s correct."
1973.72-1162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1724.563,1731.685,Very well.
1973.72-1162,1,41776,stanley_m_morley,,1733.434,1738.146,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1162,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1853.035,1854.678,"What page is that, sir?"
1973.72-1162,1,41776,stanley_m_morley,,1854.678,1865.364,"This is in, Your Honor, in the Government’s petition for certiorari and the Appendix A."
1973.72-1162,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1871.986,1872.912,Thank you.
1973.72-1162,1,41776,stanley_m_morley,,1872.912,1900.143,"And you will notice there in the footnote that the Court did determine the Hope and CATCO cases to be controlling in as much as it is concluded that the only benefits derived from the Federal Power Commission’s rate making actions is for the public benefit, namely, the ultimate consumers of the natural gas for whom the Gas Act was enacted."
1973.72-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2016.383,2023.232,"Well I suppose a regulatory agency can, and they sometimes do change their minds about these things, don’t they?"
1973.72-1162,1,41776,stanley_m_morley,,2023.232,2025.995,"Well, no doubt about it, Your Honor."
1973.72-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2103.985,2105.686,What page are you on there?
1973.72-1162,1,41776,stanley_m_morley,,2105.686,2119.208,"I am on our brief, the green one, and that is Appendix B pages 3a through 5a."
1973.72-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2262.899,2265.358,"You have to watch that microphone, Mr. Morley."
1973.72-1162,1,41776,stanley_m_morley,,2267.891,2274.691,"-- was adopted on February 1, 1956 pursuant to Senate Resolution No. 140."
1973.72-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2458.69,2467.243,"How could you really separate those things into tight little compartments in a regulatory agency, Mr. Morley?"
1973.72-1162,1,41776,stanley_m_morley,,2479.77,2482.765,"There’s no question about it, Your Honor."
1973.72-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2499.309,2504.787,"Now, doesn’t that benefit both the public and the utility?"
1973.72-1162,1,41776,stanley_m_morley,,2504.787,2506.107,"Not in my opinion, Your Honor."
1973.72-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2506.107,2507.057,It doesn’t?
1973.72-1162,1,41776,stanley_m_morley,,2513.443,2516.009,"No, it doesn’t."
1973.72-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2525.962,2528.215,"Well, some of it depends on management then."
1973.72-1162,1,41776,stanley_m_morley,,2528.215,2528.763,I beg your pardon?
1973.72-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2528.763,2538.859,"Some of it depends on management, but within the framework, it’s -- there is a formula that is designed to give a profit, is there not?"
1973.72-1162,1,41776,stanley_m_morley,,2538.859,2547.909,"Well, I think the situation is more or less, like Mr. Justice Brennan put it earlier, that this isn’t sort of a Blue Cross plan."
1973.72-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2549.101,2554.802,Mr. Justice Stewart’s conception of Blue Cross Blue Shield --
1973.72-1162,1,41776,stanley_m_morley,,2554.802,2556.146,Excuse me.
1973.72-1162,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2622.939,2646.947,"Mr. Morley, in your brief that the statement of Congressman Yates that you are reading from earlier in Appendix B at page 4a, the first kind of home spun example he gives of the type of thing he is talking about there at the end of the first paragraph on 4a is the Chicago Elevator Inspection Program in his hometown."
1973.72-1162,1,41776,stanley_m_morley,,2666.886,2676.974,"Well, if Your Honor please, I don’t consider this apropos of the problem of a natural gas industry being regulated in its rates."
1973.72-1162,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2686.714,2693.444,"And yet, that’s the example he thought as being referred to (Inaudible)?"
1973.72-1162,1,41776,stanley_m_morley,,2693.444,2696.814,"Well, he has more -- this is sort of on a side."
1973.72-1162,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2724.733,2734.034,"But on the point of benefit, there simply isn’t real benefit to the elevator owner."
1973.72-1162,1,41776,stanley_m_morley,,2734.034,2737.481,"Well, there’s a benefit to the extent that he’s permitted to operate his elevator."
1973.72-1162,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2737.481,2755.248,"Well, you can say that about any type of thing I suppose, but so far as conferring some sort of an affirmative benefit, this would strike me at any way as being something that’s completely for the public and, yet, Congressman Yates thought it was clearly the kind of thing that would be included under Title V?"
1973.72-1162,1,41776,stanley_m_morley,,2755.248,2773.964,"Well, it’s our view that the ultimate consumers who are the beneficiaries of rate regulation under the federal power -- under the Natural Gas Act, the activity has been undertaken for them, the benefit goes to them and, they’re the ones that should pay for it."
1973.72-1162,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2786.689,2792.893,"Well, the elevator owner can make exactly the same point though, can’t he and yet, apparently that wouldn’t have been good enough for Congressman Yates?"
1973.72-1162,1,41776,stanley_m_morley,,2792.893,2804.769,"I don’t think so because, in my view and with all due deference to your own view, I think this is more analogous to a certificate applicant before the Federal Power Commission."
1973.72-1162,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2815.648,2823.379,The analogy that Congressman Yates saw perhaps was what follows in the very next succeeding paragraph.
1973.72-1162,1,41776,stanley_m_morley,,2858.784,2859.539,"I do, Your Honor."
1973.72-1162,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2859.539,2860.275,Right.
1973.72-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2860.275,2867.72,"Mr. Morley, I think, you’ve a minute, if my calculations are that you’re impinging on Mr. Debevoise’s time now."
1973.72-1162,1,41776,stanley_m_morley,,2867.72,2888.15,"I just want to say one thing that in connection with the request of both Your Honor and Mr. Justice Stewart, that the ICC does assess fees for activity such as are mentioned here in center are that Congressman Yates’ statement."
1973.72-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2952.096,2953.679,Mr. Debevoise.
1973.72-1162,2,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2953.679,2958.55,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1162,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3021.648,3026.275,From what source is that competition that you’re suggesting?
1973.72-1162,2,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,3026.275,3031.516,"It’s from the other parts of the industry, Your Honor."
1973.72-1162,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3089.064,3108.972,"When you say they’re not protected from competition, do you mean within their own area or they’re not protected from competition in the sense that they can’t expand into areas where, for example, REA or TVA is operating on municipal ownership?"
1973.72-1162,2,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,3108.972,3114.39,"Well, Your Honor, I’m speaking of it in FPC terms."
1973.72-1162,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3360.231,3372.339,"Mr. Debevoise, neither -- no counsel up to now has intimated that the Fifth Circuit might have been correct and that the DC Circuit might have been correct."
1973.72-1162,2,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,3398.857,3421.91,"Mr. Chief Justice, to turn directly to your question, it is our position that if the certificate of compliance, as discussed this morning, is a license or a certificate, there is no conflict between the two circuits."
1973.72-1162,3,33866,keith_a_jones,,4529.378,4531.209,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1973.72-1162,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4750.481,4751.509,"Thank you, Mr. Jones."
