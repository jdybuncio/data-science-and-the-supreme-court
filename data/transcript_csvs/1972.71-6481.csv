1972.71-6481,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,31.824,"We’ll hear arguments next in Number 71-6481, Davis against the United States."
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,34.86,37.693,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-6481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,103.22,107.67,"Was it a trial of him alone, I notice there were two others indicted?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,107.67,111.457,"There were two others, they were separately charged Your Honor, they were separate."
1972.71-6481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,111.457,112.85,So this trial was of him alone?
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,112.85,113.66,Yes sir.
1972.71-6481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,113.66,115.381,Thank you.
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,115.381,120.537,He was sentenced to 14 years and the conviction was affirmed on appeal by the Fifth Circuit.
1972.71-6481,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,175.336,191.889,"Mr. Wulf, in as much as he professes to have made that objection, then I take it you must concede that he knew he had the right to object to the composition of the grand jury before trial?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,191.889,199.553,"Well, all I would concede about his claim that he made it is that he didn’t intend to waive it, and it might also imply that he knew he had the right to make it."
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,310.595,320.269,Would you make any allegations as to why it wasn’t waived?
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,320.269,322.465,What he said was a pro se petition Your Honor.
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,350.489,356.403,Let's assume a case whether it's raised that -- that it wasn't raised?
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,356.403,357.235,Yes.
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,357.235,378.221,"Would you say that in a habeas corpus petition or 2255 petition, we should make some -- if it -- then you should make some allegations that I didn’t -- either that I didn’t know or even if I knew there were -- there was a reason for not raising it, so that you can create some -- for having a hearing?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,378.221,380.538,If those were the facts.
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,389.574,399.426,"That’s all was alleged, that was it raised and the Court determines on the basis of the record that there's no real issue of the fact, why should there be a hearing?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,399.426,405.066,He also claimed Your Honor that he’d -- that had -- that he did not waive it in the motion.
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,405.066,409.5,"As he claimed that -- so now you move to another issue and says, I did not waive it."
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,409.5,411.19,Yes.
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,411.19,418.532,Don’t you suppose that he should say that why he didn’t raise it?
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,423.663,426.255,I think the original burden is on the government Your Honor and then --
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,426.255,436.114,"Well, I thought it is 2255 petition --"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,436.114,438.631,"Well, initially it’s on the shoulders of the petitioner."
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,438.631,440.978,He didn’t even allege it.
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,440.978,441.117,Well.
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,442.795,446.15,He did not claim it.
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,452.35,468.719,"No, he did not say why, but it’s ambiguous of course because although he said he didn’t waive it, he supported that by saying that not only had he not waived it, but his lawyer had in fact raised it."
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,515.504,524.997,"Now, I take it then you are saying, either are you in any position or willing to say that this (Inaudible) if he didn’t waive it, why he didn’t?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,524.997,527.304,I frankly don’t know Your Honor why he didn’t raise it.
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,527.304,527.678,(Inaudible)
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,527.678,529.078,Yes.
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,549.264,567.725,"What if the -- what if it -- assume that the (Inaudible) represented by counsel and counsel knew what the rule was and did not raise it, assume that, (Inaudible)?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,567.725,569.484,"Again, given the fact that --"
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,569.484,572.699,Do you have to say automatically a hearing?
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,572.699,573.497,Yes.
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,574.147,576.219,"You would have to, to maintain it."
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,576.219,578.322,"Well, I think as a matter of fact one would have to."
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,638.793,659.045,"You would say that in a criminal trial or a civil trial, if you don’t demand a jury that you can later say, I didn't intend a waiver except for a hearing, even though you know perfectly well that (Inaudible) given to you?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,659.045,665.57,"I think that there would have to be a factual question on the waiver there, yes sir."
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,670.367,678.277,"So it doesn’t make any difference if the rule says and you know about it, but if you don’t make the demand if you indeed waive?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,678.277,680.654,No.
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,682.358,682.971,Exactly.
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,682.971,684.007,That’s right.
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,684.007,689.445,"Doesn’t make any difference, even though you know that and you know that you don’t raise --"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,689.445,694.764,"Even though you knew it, yes sir."
1972.71-6481,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,694.764,709.133,"How do you distinguish that from the hypothetical that you posed of the man who decides as a matter of tactics, he decided not to raise it but save it."
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,711.081,742.732,"Well, because the man, in responding to Justice White’s questioned, the defendant himself might know about it, but his lawyer might without consultation waive it, without consulting with the defendant, and if he does not consult with the defendant and get his explicit agreement to the waiver, certainly of a very important constitutional right, certainly one of the dimension involved in this case, I think that the question of waiver is still a live question on a post-conviction procedure."
1972.71-6481,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,742.732,748.84,What good is the rule?
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,748.84,751.666,The rule serves the purpose of --
1972.71-6481,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,751.666,756.984,"I mean, under your hypothesis, what good is the rule?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,756.984,763.439,"Well, the rule serves the purpose of encouraging defense counsel to discuss the issue with their client, that’s the purpose it serves."
1972.71-6481,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,785.715,786.034,And what do you do --
1972.71-6481,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,786.034,792.177,"Do you think that the other attorneys will read our decision rather than read the rule, they haven’t read the rule yet?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,792.177,794.235,"Well, we could only hope they read the decisions Your Honor."
1972.71-6481,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,794.235,798.183,"Well, I understand in your decision maybe they didn’t read the rule."
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,801.564,805.296,"Well, we can only assume that they always read your opinions Your Honor."
1972.71-6481,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,807.936,826.925,"I understand that your position is that the defendant knows what the rule is, the lawyer knows what the rule is, and if they fail to communicate together, they have an automatic 2255."
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,826.925,836.912,"If they don't communicate and if the lawyer does not secure the explicit waiver of the defendant on that claim, yes sir."
1972.71-6481,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,836.912,840.905,Automatically?
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,840.905,843.818,"Automatically, I think so."
1972.71-6481,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,880.393,884.553,"In this case, did he allege that lawyer didn't talk to him?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,884.553,888.118,"No, in this case he alleged that the lawyer made the motion in fact."
1972.71-6481,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,888.118,891.629,But he didn't allege that the lawyer didn’t talk to him?
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,891.629,906.284,"No, it would be inconsistent to allege that -- well, it wouldn't necessarily be inconsistent, it’s the -- the motion is silent, the record is silent about the extent of their conversation."
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,989.807,1008.94,Do you view the issue here about challenging the grand jury differently from the issue in Henry against Mississippi insofar as a necessity consultant for the defendant is concerned?
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1018.518,1028.436,"Well, according to Henry and according to Humphrey v. Cady, I think that this Court has told lawyers that they certainly have to consult with their clients about substantial constitutional issues."
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1028.436,1032.476,"Well, it was of substantial constitutional issue in the Humphrey, wasn't it?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1032.476,1033.791,Yes.
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1033.791,1036.487,"Well, what did the Court say there?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1036.487,1043.194,"It said that the lawyer had a consultant that he hadn’t -- and since they haven’t consulted, they haven’t waived."
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1043.194,1044.04,Oh!
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1049.335,1050.697,Yes sir.
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1050.697,1057.329,What if they did?
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1057.329,1062.145,I’m afraid I haven’t reviewed Humphrey v. Cady close -- closely enough to respond.
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1062.145,1067.985,You just think that there is -- at least you say that this grand jury point is something -- is an issue they must consult on?
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1067.985,1070.257,"Yes, yes sir."
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1076.69,1080.867,Henry was after Noia.
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1083.005,1084.053,"Well, but Henry too --"
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1084.053,1087.822,"-- must consult about everything, that rule hasn’t survived, has it?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1087.822,1096.111,"Well, as I recall Henry, Henry said that there had to be an explicit finding of waiver by the defendant."
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1096.111,1100.585,"What constitutes a waiver, and what constituted a waiver in Henry?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1110.062,1117.673,"No, I would think that there would be knowledge and failure to object in consultation with the defendant."
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1117.673,1119.081,Yes.
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1119.512,1143.357,"I mean, that’s -- obviously, obviously it’s a hard -- it’s a -- might be a burden on defense counsel, but where fundamental and substantial constitutional rights are concerned it may be a burden that has to be imposed in order to vindicate the constitutional rights of defendants in criminal cases."
1972.71-6481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1222.344,1242.367,"There is nothing new about the idea that in order to preserve an error for appellate or even collateral review you have to raise it in a timely manner, that's I would guess certainly as old as a substantive rule that you can refer to, isn’t it, as a doctrine in this Court?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1242.367,1258.423,"Yes, but there's a whole course of decisions from this Court beginning with Noia and including Kaufman and Noia itself there, although that wasn't a procedural default at trial, that was a default in appeal which cut him off from state remedies."
1972.71-6481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1284.946,1289.478,"Well, certainly there was an opportunity, at least theoretically?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1289.478,1290.243,There always is.
1972.71-6481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1290.243,1290.621,Yes.
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1290.621,1291.886,There's always an opportunity for --
1972.71-6481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1291.886,1297.238,But I mean a specific opportunity given by the rule.
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1297.238,1303.243,But there's a specific opportunity for a counsel to raise all constitutional objections all along the course of trial.
1972.71-6481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1303.243,1306.542,"And if he doesn’t do it, it’s a -- it’s just common ground."
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1311.997,1313.492,"Well, not where a constitutional rights are concerned."
1972.71-6481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1313.492,1315.825,"Well, no, that’s -- where constitutional rights are concerned."
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1315.825,1317.536,"Well, that’s certainly wasn’t the case in Kaufman."
1972.71-6481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1369.762,1373.755,"Well, they are, every term of this Court, as you know?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1373.755,1375.137,"But they weren’t in Kaufman, they weren’t in --"
1972.71-6481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1375.137,1379.228,"No, they weren’t in those two cases but it’s a --"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1379.228,1388.125,"Well, I can only -- I rely on those two cases obviously, and I also rely on the claim that constitutional rights are too important to be forfeited simply because --"
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1388.125,1396.715,"Well, Mr. Wulf, would you say that the lawyer and client consulted and they both agreed that well we’d rather save this for a federal habeas?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1396.715,1398.247,"That’s a waiver, that’s obviously a waiver."
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1398.247,1399.525,Why is it a waiver?
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1399.525,1405.038,"Well, because it's a deliberate bypass in Noia’s terminology, it’s a deliberate --"
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1405.038,1409.886,You mean you have to have some other reason?
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1409.886,1410.286,I think --
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1410.286,1411.708,Some other good reason?
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1411.708,1412.73,I think the fact of the matter --
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1412.73,1421.292,"If you are going to say that you must say then that there are some reasons that, that will be -- it will excuse not raising it and other reasons it will, will not."
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1427.776,1428.261,Well --
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1428.261,1429.355,Give me one.
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1429.355,1436.522,The best one is in this very case arising in Mississippi on behalf of a Black defendant and there are a whole course of decisions --
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1436.522,1440.223,"Alright, now, finally, you're going to say what their excuse was?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1440.223,1441.024,"No, I’m not --"
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1441.024,1442.378,Do you think they should allege that?
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1442.378,1443.41,I’m saying that’s a possible excuse.
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1443.41,1454.318,But do you think they should allege that in a habeas corpus petition rather than burden some Federal Court with having a hearing in every case just to find out what the reason is?
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1454.318,1455.78,"I think if it’s a pro se petition and that, that --"
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1455.78,1462.523,"But you concede there are some reasons that are no good and other reasons that are fine, don’t you?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1462.523,1463.498,"Surely, if I were to join the --"
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1463.498,1465.133,"Well, why don’t you say one reason then?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1465.133,1486.448,"If I was -- If I were to join the petition Your Honor I would like to think that I would plead what the reason was, but Davis drew his own petition, as do so many post-conviction petitioners, and if they're going to be held to the fine art of pleading as lawyers can properly be, they're going to be out of court all the time."
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1486.448,1502.047,"Why wouldn’t you accept then an immediate ground, you dismiss the petition, but with the leave to refile, saying what the reason is, rather than having to hold a hearing?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1502.047,1524.187,"If the district courts would do that explicitly in such a way that a pro se petitioner might be informed of the reason for the dismissal, I suppose that would be quite agreeable, but in the absence of that --"
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1524.187,1525.444,So it would be alright to view the --
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1525.444,1526.682,The only --
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1526.682,1531.638,"-- said we affirm, but without leave -- without prejudice to refiling, stating a reason?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1531.638,1544.09,"I might not argue against that very much, but that was not the position taken by the district court here of course."
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1546.595,1551.14,"Well, of course he can always refile?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1551.14,1554.528,"He could, but he chose to take an appeal however."
1972.71-6481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1554.528,1554.945,"No, but if --"

1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1556.982,1557.676,I’m sorry?
1972.71-6481,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1557.676,1565.017,"If there were an affirmance here, couldn’t you file it in 2255 in the form that you would have filed it, tomorrow?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1565.017,1567.74,"I think so Your Honor, yes."
1972.71-6481,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1567.74,1574.548,"Mr. Wulf, where is this thing about his lawyer didn’t talk to him?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1574.548,1583.523,"It isn’t that his lawyer didn’t talk him, it was Your Honor was that, his lawyer raised the issue."
1972.71-6481,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1585.831,1586.831,Where?
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1586.831,1597.786,"On top of Page 8 he alleges, petitioner avers that he has not waived nor abandoned his right to contest a grand jury array as set forth in Rule 12 (b)."
1972.71-6481,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1597.786,1603.604,"If ever there was a conclusion of the law that is, right?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1603.604,1604.573,Right.
1972.71-6481,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1604.573,1607.092,No facts at all.
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1607.092,1613.952,Except insofar as waiver itself is a fact of --
1972.71-6481,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1613.952,1615.622,The waiver --
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1615.622,1619.66,He had a little legal knowledge which may have misled him in that sense.
1972.71-6481,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1619.66,1633.21,"Well, you’ve been saying that your main point is that he knew what his rights were, but that his lawyer didn’t talk to him, and you used a phrase, lack of communication, well, where is that in this record?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1633.21,1634.608,It’s not here explicitly.
1972.71-6481,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1634.828,1635.803,Where is any --
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1635.803,1642.245,Only insofar as it's -- that’s the implication in paragraph five of his petition.
1972.71-6481,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1642.245,1645.513,Paragraph five says that his lawyer didn’t come to him?
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1645.513,1645.841,No.
1972.71-6481,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1654.086,1658.071,"Well, is that a pleading of a fact in your view?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1658.071,1659.621,By a pro se petitioner it --
1972.71-6481,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1659.621,1660.611,Right.
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1660.611,1667.271,"-- it might well be considered as an adequate pleading, I would think so."
1972.71-6481,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1699.501,1705.107,Did Davis had any legal training at all?
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1705.107,1707.125,I don’t know Your Honor.
1972.71-6481,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1707.125,1716.329,"Well, where did he get the word avers from, waived from, abandoned, grand jury, array?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1716.329,1716.45,Well --
1972.71-6481,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1716.45,1723.979,"As set forth in the federal rules of criminal procedure, Rule 12 (b)?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1723.979,1730.605,He either has some legal knowledge or he secured some while he is in the penitentiary.
1972.71-6481,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1736.126,1740.966,What I’m confused is to what this is all about?
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1740.966,1742.835,What this is all about --
1972.71-6481,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1742.835,1749.341,"Is -- the man filed a piece of paper and says, one, I was tried and something was wrong with the jury."
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1749.341,1751.586,"Well, it wasn’t all it was Mr. Justice Marshall."
1972.71-6481,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1791.898,1793.692,"But this was tried in a Federal Court, wasn’t it?"
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1793.692,1795.54,"This was tried in a Federal Court, yes sir."
1972.71-6481,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1880.289,1881.559,I think your time is up Mr. Wulf.
1972.71-6481,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1881.559,1890.483,Thank you.
1972.71-6481,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1890.483,1891.846,Mr. Korman.
1972.71-6481,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,1891.846,1911.347,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, the issue presented in this case is not as the petitioner alleges in his reply brief whether the right to grand jury indictment, whether this Court should assign the prohibition against racial discrimination in grand jury selection to the dustbin."
1972.71-6481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2338.301,2351.706,But what if -- what would you say if there was an allegation in this case that are the other reason for not raising the matter and knowing -- and the -- to backup this claim of no waiver.
1972.71-6481,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2358.951,2368.2,"Well, I think under Rule 12 (b) the judge has wide discretion to grant relief from the waiver provisions, and if he gave -- if he came up with the reason that moved the Court to exercise this discretion."
1972.71-6481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2368.2,2369.988,What would be a good reason in your --
1972.71-6481,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2369.988,2372.048,I think the reason that Your Honor suggested.
1972.71-6481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2375.444,2380.213,What about -- what about a reason that it would annoy the judge?
1972.71-6481,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2380.213,2382.492,"I wouldn’t think that, that was an adequate reason."
1972.71-6481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2382.492,2383.104,You wouldn’t?
1972.71-6481,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2383.104,2384.742,No.
1972.71-6481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2384.742,2392.838,So what about the state cases in CA 5?
1972.71-6481,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2392.838,2401.432,"Well, as I’ve indicated, all of the state cases until the most recent one, in Winters versus Cook, all involved claims with respect to both the grand and petit jury."
1972.71-6481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2415.768,2417.989,If made outside the presence of the jury?
1972.71-6481,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2417.989,2418.617,Pardon me?
1972.71-6481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2418.617,2421.458,If the objection is made outside the presence of the jury?
1972.71-6481,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2421.458,2435.294,"No, what I’m saying is that the right is simply more significant and therefore before waiver is implied perhaps there might be a greater showing or less of a requirement that ought to be made in terms of explaining a waiver than in cases of grand juries."
1972.71-6481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2441.215,2447.011,So that you -- there should have been a hearing in this case if he had made an allegation of a sufficient reason?
1972.71-6481,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2447.011,2451.226,"If it were sufficient on its face and it was not contradicted, I would assume that, that perhaps --"
1972.71-6481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2451.226,2452.109,It was contradicted.
1972.71-6481,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2452.109,2452.749,If it was contradicted.
1972.71-6481,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2452.749,2453.25,(Voice Overlap)
1972.71-6481,1,22634,edward_r_korman,,2453.25,2455.793,Yes.
