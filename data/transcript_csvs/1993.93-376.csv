1993.93-376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.977,"We'll hear argument next in Number 93-376, Key Tronic Corporation v. United States."
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,8.886,12.569,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.93-376,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,79.103,82.855,"Because that has already occurred, hasn't it, prior to the stage that we're dealing with here?"
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,82.855,85.606,"Yes, Justice Souter, in this case that has already occurred."
1993.93-376,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,85.606,109.093,"And it may have... indeed, have occurred because of action commenced by non-Government parties, but there's sort of an obvious reference to them as enforcers in the citizens' suit provision, so it's not, on the face of it, obvious that a person in the position of your client is enforcing as opposed simply to spreading the burden of liability."
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,109.093,117.188,"In the context of a Superfund, Justice Souter, the meaning of the word ""enforcement activities"" does include the activities of a private party."
1993.93-376,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,134.43,135.341,That's the citizens' suit provision.
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,135.341,136.89,No--
1993.93-376,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,136.89,137.451,I'm sorry.
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,137.451,137.842,"--No, Justice Souter."
1993.93-376,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,167.561,170.233,May I ask you one other question?
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,175.626,177.356,"Yes, Justice Souter."
1993.93-376,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,201.562,204.213,"Can they get investigators' fees, and so on?"
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,204.213,205.595,"--No, Justice Souter, they cannot."
1993.93-376,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,205.595,206.236,It's strictly limited to counsel.
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,206.236,219.124,"The only monetary reimbursement that a citizens' suit plaintiff can recover under section 9659 are the attorneys' fees enforcing the EPA to act, no other monetary reimbursement."
1993.93-376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,263.154,269.025,"What happens if a party does not think it's liable at all, but thinks that parties A, B, and C are?"
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,269.025,279.023,That would be an enforcement activity if that nonliable party is able to establish that the other parties are liable under the statute to pay portions of the response costs.
1993.93-376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,279.023,282.245,And does he bring a suit other than for money?
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,282.245,284.196,"No, Justice Kennedy."
1993.93-376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,303.42,312.235,"The Government's right to recover attorneys' fees comes from still a different section, doesn't it, under the legal studies section?"
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,312.235,314.526,"Mr. Chief Justice, that's correct."
1993.93-376,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,402.393,410.009,"Doesn't the word ""enforcement action""... ""enforcement activities"" usually refer to Government action, action by Government agencies?"
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,410.009,411.639,"--No, that is not correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.93-376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,434.203,435.856,"Well, but that's quite different."
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,459.01,472.01,"With all due respect, Justice Scalia, under the Clayton Act, a party is taking steps to enforce the liabilities against those parties who have undertaken activities prohibited by the antitrust statute."
1993.93-376,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,499.887,530.247,"Can you give another example of a Federal statute where enforcement action, or enforcement activity, is... the actor is someone who is himself liable for violating some prescriptions of the statute, who has a liability as distinguished from someone who is either a private attorney general or has been injured in fact and is bringing a claim against a wrongdoer?"
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,530.247,543.137,"--Off-hand, Justice Ginsburg, I cannot think of another example, but CERCLA is a unique statute which uses the word 101(25) which is a definitional section."
1993.93-376,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,629.232,636.436,"You want us to construe the term under the policy of the amendments, which was to induce private parties to act."
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,664.236,670.688,"Justice Souter, with all due respect, in this particular case Key Tronic acted... well, Key Tronic has never been held liable."
1993.93-376,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,676.193,677.773,It didn't contest liability.
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,677.773,679.393,--No action had been brought.
1993.93-376,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,685.708,694.935,"I'll grant you that, but isn't it fair to say that basically what your client was doing was essentially what might be called a preemptive strike?"
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,700.348,706.592,"--Justice Souter, there's nothing in the record which would support that statement, but regardless of what happened in this particular--"
1993.93-376,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,706.592,707.794,"Well, why else was it doing it?"
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,717.788,721.902,"--We don't argue that it would have been free of liability, but a case was never brought."
1993.93-376,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,787.617,791.817,"You're implicitly arguing, I guess, that two pockets are better than one, and that's what the public gets."
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,791.817,796.351,"Justice Souter, I am arguing that in the context of--"
1993.93-376,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,796.351,798.402,"Which I don't think is a bad argument, having just made it myself."
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,803.046,803.555,"--Well, it is--"
1993.93-376,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,803.555,808.46,"The public does get something, because it gets another pocket to go after if the first one is not full enough."
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,808.46,813.912,"--Absolutely, and the reason Congress used the word enforcement activities ""and not"" attorneys' fees"
1993.93-376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,826.262,836.897,"Mr. Schneider, is the term 107(4)?"
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,836.897,840.98,"--Yes, Justice Scalia, it's used in a number of other places within the statute."
1993.93-376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,840.98,869.949,"Well, I think your argument would be a lot stronger if the only place in which the term occurred was in this provision, because then that specification that it includes enforcement activities would have to be referring to this section, but if it appears elsewhere, there might well be what Justice Souter and I would call genuine enforcement activities, in other sections that are involved."
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,869.949,887.222,"The... Justice Scalia, the problem with that argument is that if Congress had wanted only to give the right of attorneys' fees to EPA, it could have done so by using the terms EPA... for example, in section 104(b)... but it didn't do that."
1993.93-376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1007.589,1010.422,You're talking about subsection (25) now?
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,1010.422,1010.732,--Yes.
1993.93-376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1014.025,1024.51,"Well, certainly the way the section... that (25) starts out, the term ""respond"" or ""response"" means ""remove"", ""removal"", ""remedy"", and ""remedial action""."
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,1024.51,1025.011,That's--
1993.93-376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1025.011,1030.454,"Certainly you wouldn't think lawyers were much good for cleaning up waste, or cleaning up a mess."
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,1030.454,1036.238,"--That's correct, and we expressly rely on the new language which was added, the words ""enforcement activities""."
1993.93-376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1044.555,1054.881,"So that ""respond"" and ""response"" and ""remove"" now mean... now include enforcement activities relating to removal or remedies."
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,1054.881,1063.366,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and in this case an action to reallocate cost among liable parties is related to a removal action."
1993.93-376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1066.188,1068.449,"Well, that's rather attenuated, isn't it?"
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,1068.449,1072.773,"--Well, Congress used the word Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.93-376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1072.773,1080.316,"Well, it... it's a word that could have a broad meaning or it could have a narrow meaning, depending on how one defines it."
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,1087.993,1102.532,"Mr. Chief Justice, Congress used the word ""related"" in the common, ordinary use of the term ""related"", meaning does it pertain to, does it relate to an action to reallocate cost of cleanup, does it relate to the cleanup."
1993.93-376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1203.922,1207.572,Did Key Tronic itself arrange to have any of the cleanup done?
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,1207.572,1208.964,Yes.
1993.93-376,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1266.771,1268.583,May I ask you a question?
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,1282.001,1282.992,"That's correct, Justice--"
1993.93-376,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1282.992,1284.252,"(B),"
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,1289.436,1290.105,--That's correct.
1993.93-376,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1290.105,1295.481,"But now, does the... where does the source of your action against the Air Force come from?"
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,1297.201,1297.902,No.
1993.93-376,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1299.111,1317.264,Because I... let me just get the whole thought out so you can explain what my problem... I read 9607 as describing the liability that may be incurred in actions authorized by 9606... it follows the next one... and I thought you said earlier that the private cause of action under 9659 wasn't relevant here.
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,1317.264,1319.084,"--That is correct, Justice Stevens."
1993.93-376,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1319.084,1323.489,"So if it relates to 9606, why does it authorize payments to you?"
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,1324.159,1326.52,"Justice Stevens, it does not relate to section 106."
1993.93-376,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1336.646,1343.621,"--But there's no provision in 9607 authorizing the cause of action by Key Tronic against the Air Force, is there?"
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,1343.621,1354.5,"--Justice Stevens, the only answer I can get is, every court has considered this statute and says that the authority to bring a private action comes under section 107."
1993.93-376,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1356.34,1357.522,It's an implied cause of action we're talking about.
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,1357.522,1360.464,"--Well, Congress... every court has held it's an express cause of action."
1993.93-376,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1360.464,1362.164,"Well, I'm not saying that makes it wrong."
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,1365.587,1366.508,Maybe I could take a step back.
1993.93-376,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1405.872,1409.214,--Doesn't it also authorize action by State agencies in some situations?
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,1409.214,1413.187,"--In the event that the EPA has authorized the State agency to act, that's correct."
1993.93-376,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1413.187,1415.007,"Basically, they're governmental enforcement actions."
1993.93-376,0,36718,mark_david_schneider,,1415.007,1415.979,"That's correct, Justice."
1993.93-376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1420.662,1422.174,"Very well, Mr. Schneider."
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1424.004,1429.778,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-376,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1597.56,1604.864,"Well, Mr. Wallace, how is the Government's desire to recover attorneys' fees any easier to discern?"
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1604.864,1612.797,There is an explicit reference to legal costs incurred by the Government.
1993.93-376,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1638.286,1647.042,"Well, what about States and Indian tribes, how does that leave their ability to recover attorneys fields, in your view?"
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1647.042,1658.818,"Well, we think that they would enjoy that... the fees under the same provision because they act only by delegation from us with respect to a particular site."
1993.93-376,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1671.197,1677.221,"It doesn't sound very explicit to me, as you describe it, does it, for States and Indian tribes?"
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1677.221,1681.844,"--It's not as ideal as we would wish it but, of course, that is not the question at issue in the case."
1993.93-376,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1681.844,1684.205,One might say it was building inference upon inference.
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1685.096,1695.113,But at least... at least there is a reference to costs of attorneys explicit in the statute.
1993.93-376,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1695.113,1696.963,"Well, but that's... excuse me, but that's not specifically what it says."
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1700.596,1701.595,Yes.
1993.93-376,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1701.595,1708.581,"I mean, to speak of a cost of a legal study as being the way to recover attorneys' fees is a very odd use of language."
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1713.834,1722.212,"Well, I understand that this language is not ideal as a starting point for our own purposes."
1993.93-376,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1749.801,1757.827,"Well, no, but if EPA is resting on a thin reed and you knock out the other block you might rest on, the next case might be an expensive one."
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1757.827,1769.235,"Well, we have been sensitive to that problem in the way we have briefed this case, I can assure you, Mr. Justice."
1993.93-376,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1784.402,1797.242,"But may I ask you if the word ""legal studies"", maybe that fits in more with the Tenth Circuit kind of inbetween decision of this case; no litigation fees, but other legal fees."
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1797.242,1808.119,"--Well, it certainly fits in well with that, but we don't think it's limited to that because it... the statutory phrase doesn't end there."
1993.93-376,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1897.858,1904.453,"Well, if they don't include attorneys' fees, what do they include when private parties are... just investigators and stenographers?"
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1904.453,1911.566,"Well, of course, our view is that they don't include anything for a private party; that's the second inference."
1993.93-376,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1923.884,1929.468,"Yeah, but you can't... you can't really plausibly argue that costs of response do not include enforcement activity."
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1933.772,1934.082,--Of course.
1993.93-376,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1934.703,1936.364,It says response includes enforcement activity.
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1936.364,1936.974,Well--
1993.93-376,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1936.974,1937.813,But you're disputing that.
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1937.813,1942.097,--We don't dispute that.
1993.93-376,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1943.749,1951.142,"Well, then, if you don't dispute that, what is it that enforcement activities includes, other than attorneys' fees, when you're talking about private litigation?"
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1951.142,1965.392,--The most direct things involved are the studies and nonlitigation attorney time that would have to be involved in arranging for the cleanup.
1993.93-376,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1970.925,1973.948,You acknowledge that is covered in a private action.
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1973.948,1980.782,"--Well, we don't think that ""enforcement activities"" refers to that."
1993.93-376,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1989.12,1991.032,Private party.
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1991.032,1994.594,--Private person undertaking the cleanup activities.
1993.93-376,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1997.035,2007.523,"Well, what about the argument that enforcement activities would be redundant because the EPA was already getting its... those costs?"
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2007.523,2018.309,--But that was being contested in litigation and this was a way of reconfirming that EPA would have that authority.
1993.93-376,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2018.309,2029.286,"And so, Mr. Wallace, you can't give us an example of an enforcement activity applicable to a private party that is not also covered as... in the term ""response""."
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2029.286,2039.454,"Well, I can't, because we don't think enforcement activities applies to activities by private parties."
1993.93-376,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2039.454,2045.037,"But, if it did, what... you say it's just an empty set."
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2045.037,2046.407,No.
1993.93-376,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2088.705,2096.842,"May I ask, Mr. Wallace... I didn't mean to interrupt... but the enforcement action, that's you recovering Government counsel's attorneys' fees, is that right?"
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2096.842,2097.693,--That is correct.
1993.93-376,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2097.693,2098.663,How do they compute those?
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2102.126,2103.157,Well--
1993.93-376,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2103.157,2106.049,"Is that on an hourly basis as if market value, like we do?"
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2106.049,2122.858,--The... it's... there's a complicated accounting method that's used that attributes time spent by the hourly wages and fringe benefits that the attorneys get--
1993.93-376,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2122.858,2123.259,I see.
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2123.259,2131.064,"--On particular sites, plus what would be regarded as an overhead factor, according to proper accounting methods."
1993.93-376,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2131.064,2138.29,Is it unusual for the Government to be authorized by statute to recover its attorneys' fees against someone it's litigating with?
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2138.29,2146.385,"Well, I can't think of any other example in particular."
1993.93-376,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2146.385,2147.166,I can't either.
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2147.166,2160.813,But I do think that it is not correct to think of this as a disparity between the Government and private parties.
1993.93-376,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2161.253,2163.634,It may not be if none of them can recover their attorneys' fees.
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2164.295,2166.156,"--Well, that's true, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.93-376,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2323.319,2324.62,"Mr. Wallace, can you help me out?"
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2345.783,2350.077,--So long as the pollution has become mixed.
1993.93-376,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2350.077,2350.878,I see.
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2350.878,2356.05,"And has not... is not severable within the site, and that they're jointly and severally liable."
1993.93-376,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2356.05,2366.308,"So then the costs that it has to recover because it had to pay in the first place include not only the physical costs of the actual engineering and so forth, but also the costs that it had to pay to the Government for its enforcement activities."
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2368.73,2386.823,"It can get contribution for its cleanup, but we're of the view that it cannot get contribution for its attorney costs for either trying to resist its liability to EPA or for trying to find out who else were the contributors--"
1993.93-376,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2386.823,2387.153,For bringing contribution actions.
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2387.153,2388.074,--And getting the contribution.
1993.93-376,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2392.856,2399.3,Maybe the total amount in dispute would be significantly reduced if we followed the American rule across the board?
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2399.3,2411.87,"--Perhaps so, but considerable budgetary adjustments would have to be made in order for Federal enforcement to be able to proceed."
1993.93-376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2411.87,2422.836,"Mr. Wallace, you acknowledged a bit earlier that it's unusual, if not, indeed, unique, for the Federal Government to be awarded its attorneys' fees."
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2434.683,2446.521,"Well, there are fee statutes in some agencies that require applicants for licenses to bear what amounts to the Government's costs."
1993.93-376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2446.521,2447.863,--Enforcement costs?
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2448.274,2449.774,"Well, they're not really enforcement costs."
1993.93-376,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2449.774,2451.106,"--Enforcing violations of the law, I'm talking about."
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2454.098,2455.137,I guess that would be true.
1993.93-376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2462.984,2464.154,"No, but I'm trying to help you, Mr. Wallace."
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2464.154,2464.494,Yes--
1993.93-376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2464.494,2470.347,"I will say, you know, just as well... you may it is unusual to get attorneys' fees, but it's also unusual to get enforcement costs."
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2472.507,2473.909,--It certainly is an unusual--
1993.93-376,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2473.909,2476.932,But you were referring to statutes that have user fees.
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2476.932,2478.512,"--Yes, user fees."
1993.93-376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2486.827,2487.708,"I don't often help you, Mr. Wallace."
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2489.872,2493.231,--I should welcome it when it occurs.
1993.93-376,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2849.565,2860.051,"But Mr. Schneider said that that's all you get under citizens... it's the only... there's nothing... no other category that this can be placed under, as distinguished from the cleanup recovery."
1993.93-376,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2860.051,2878.974,"--It still is a rather striking difference in statutory drafting, and this provision was added at the same time in the 1986 amendments that the reference to enforcement activities was added, which certainly makes no explicitly reference to attorneys' fees."
1993.93-376,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2941.106,2942.698,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1993.93-376,2,36718,mark_david_schneider,,2945.299,2947.179,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.93-376,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3047.915,3050.305,"Thank you, Mr. Schneider."
