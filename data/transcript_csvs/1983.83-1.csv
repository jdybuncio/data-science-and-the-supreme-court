1983.83-1,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,78.683,Mr. Solicitor General.
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,78.683,92.26,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves a collateral attack on state courts' proceedings by way of habeas corpus review in Federal District Court."
1983.83-1,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,205.33,209.782,"Mr. Caruso, didn't the Sixth Circuit disagree with you on that point and say--"
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,209.782,210.232,Yes.
1983.83-1,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,446.092,448.644,"--Solicitor general, may I ask a question, because maybe I missed something you said."
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,462.752,477.727,"In the Wright case, the Court applied the contemporaneous objection rule and made a decision that it should review this sort of an error, claimed error, simply because there's the likelihood of miscarriage of justice."
1983.83-1,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,501.342,508.079,"But did they say that they would review Sandstrom error, even if there was no contemporaneous objection?"
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,508.079,511.714,I don't recall their saying that conclusively; no.
1983.83-1,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,511.714,513.733,"But that's, apparently, what the Sixth Circuit thought they said?"
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,513.733,518.102,The Sixth Circuit apparently thought that; yes.
1983.83-1,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,543.982,552.938,"Mr. Caruso, normally we don't reexamine the holding of the Court of Appeals on what the state law is."
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,557.39,558.659,Yes.
1983.83-1,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,582.44,592.18,"Well, if the State Supreme Court makes what we consider an erroneous instruction of its own law or statute that doesn't involve the Constitution, we certainly don't review it."
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,604.488,607.44,"I would say so, yes, Chief Justice."
1983.83-1,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,718.374,726.378,"Mr. Caruso, what are these... which of the points you want to raise are these facts being urged in support of?"
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,726.378,733.198,"--These facts are being urged in support of the fact that if this is error, it's harmless error, beyond a reasonable doubt."
1983.83-1,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,834.746,840.131,"Mr. Solicitor General, could I interpret you for a rather important problem that bothers me, if I may?"
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,851.772,852.005,--Yes.
1983.83-1,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,852.005,861.194,"And your opponents say, in their... page 7 of their brief... that you did not argue that question in either the District Court or the Court of Appeals."
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,865.828,866.378,That is correct.
1983.83-1,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,867.43,869.23,So that's why you're not arguing the retroactivity clause.
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,869.23,869.547,Yes.
1983.83-1,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1105.09,1109.642,"Mr. Caruso, the conviction here was first degree murder, wasn't it?"
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1109.642,1112.177,Yes.
1983.83-1,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1112.177,1116.898,What were the instructions on first degree murder?
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1116.898,1127.636,"On first degree murder, the instructions read that there had to be a proof of specific intent to kill, and premeditation."
1983.83-1,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1130.088,1142.296,"Then how does a good bit of the argument in this case from both sides really bear on that, when the jury came in with a verdict of guilty and first degree murder?"
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1149.452,1151.835,The instruction bear... the verdict?
1983.83-1,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1154.737,1167.43,"Well, you don't make the argument, and I wonder why you don't... it seems to me that the instructions on first degree murder were very specific as to premeditation and intent."
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1167.43,1168.496,Yes.
1983.83-1,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1168.496,1182.506,"And that Sandstrom error, when existent, hardly bears on the instructions on first degree murder and the resulting conviction on first degree murder."
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1182.506,1185.308,That is right.
1983.83-1,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1204.387,1207.072,Let me read from the instructions on first degree murder:
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1211.29,1212.042,--Yes; that is correct.
1983.83-1,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1212.042,1213.392,And the jury bought that.
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1213.392,1217.263,The jury was convinced that it was.
1983.83-1,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1217.263,1220.215,Then I wonder why we're so concerned about Sandstrom error.
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1220.215,1247.215,"I don't believe we should be concerned about Sandstrom error, because in this case, as I say, the instruction that was given does not... would not, in any way, indicate to the jury that the burden of proof with respect to the elements of first degree murder... premeditation, intent to kill, malice... was in any way led to believe that the prosecutor did not have that burden of proof."
1983.83-1,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1249.199,1258.856,"You referred earlier to some of his statements, that he had stopped shooting because he didn't want to kill anybody except this one man."
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1258.856,1259.29,Yes.
1983.83-1,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1259.29,1263.058,"Now, that was before... those were pretrial statements."
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1263.058,1263.608,Yes.
1983.83-1,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1263.608,1268.529,"They were before the jury, when they received the instruction that Justice Blackmum just referred to."
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1268.529,1268.896,Yes.
1983.83-1,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1278.335,1279.77,Let me just summarize what I've said.
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1291.392,1294.53,The intent instruction given did not affect the outcome of the trial?
1983.83-1,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1294.53,1295.663,Could not.
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1298.915,1302.966,"The intent instruction, the presumed intent instruction."
1983.83-1,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1317.843,1328.701,"May I ask you, on that question... the instructions that are quoted in the Sixth Circuit's opinion at 17a, the long instruction, are those instructions on the first degree murder charge?"
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1328.701,1329.167,I didn't hear you.
1983.83-1,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1329.717,1335.421,"There's a long quotation, in the Court of Appeals' opinion, from the instructions of the trial judge."
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1364.04,1371.677,"That pertained to the first degree murder charge, as well as to the second degree murder charge."
1983.83-1,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1371.677,1379.917,And how can you be so confident that those instructions had no impact on the jury's deliberations on the first degree murder charge?
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1379.917,1395.426,"The description that was given in defining malice, and the... certainly, the instruction that was given on malice is defined in another way as the intentional killing of another person."
1983.83-1,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1446.542,1449.261,But the other instructions did affect their deliberations.
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1449.261,1450.496,--Did affect... yes.
1983.83-1,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1493.24,1495.525,"That's the basis of the Harmless Error Rule, is it not?"
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1495.525,1495.908,That's right.
1983.83-1,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1575.241,1588.168,"Did he dispute the statement that he made to the policeman that came into the record through the policeman's testimony, about having stopped shooting because he wanted to be sure not to hit anybody else except the man he was trying to kill?"
1983.83-1,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1588.168,1589.551,I don't believe that was disputed.
1983.83-1,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1635.232,1645.02,Mr. Nussbaumer.
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,1645.02,1655.409,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, I'm going to skip directly to the procedural default issue, since the state has not argued the retroactivity issue."
1983.83-1,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1687.463,1689.063,Is that the Wright case?
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,1689.063,1691.263,"That's right, Your Honor."
1983.83-1,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1722.117,1737.727,"Now, the actual question here, I suppose is, whether in those three petitions for delayed appeal, the Michigan Appellant Court, in this particular respondent's case, did or did not enforce a default rule."
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,1737.727,1739.912,"That is the question, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.83-1,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1770.031,1773.483,What happened on these appeals?
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,1773.483,1778.785,"The courts issue standard, one-line orders denying leave to appeal."
1983.83-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1824.249,1825.932,Could I just interrupt you?
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,1831.002,1841.643,"I concede that this was not a conclusive presumption instruction, and I therefore do concede that this kind of instruction, a burden--"
1983.83-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1841.643,1846.545,"So the error in this case, you agree, was subject to the Harmless Error Rule?"
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,1846.545,1848.481,--Because it was a burden-shifting instruction.
1983.83-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1848.481,1850.916,"Well, anyway, whatever it was, you agree it was--"
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,1850.916,1854.868,But I only agree to a point of where I think Your Honor is going.
1983.83-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1866.543,1867.026,--The intent.
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,1867.445,1867.811,Intent.
1983.83-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1868.711,1871.829,And the Court of Appeals below held intent was in issue here.
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,1871.829,1872.446,That's correct.
1983.83-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1872.446,1874.198,"And, therefore, it was not harmless error."
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,1874.198,1875.498,That's correct.
1983.83-1,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1888.441,1906.836,"Do you agree with counsel for the state, that he did not dispute the statements made at the time that he stopped shooting, because he wanted to be sure not to hit anyone else except this particular man?"
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,1906.836,1912.406,He testified that he did not recall making any statements to the police at the scene.
1983.83-1,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1914.256,1921.445,"There was evidence that he did stop shooting for a period that was consistent to the statement attributed to him, was there not?"
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,1921.445,1927.483,The evidence of the shooting was that he fired one shoot at very close range.
1983.83-1,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1935.689,1950.099,"Mr. Nussbaumer, you doubtless recall that Sandstrom against Montana and Connecticut against Johnson were cases here on direct review, involving the kind of instructions that are being contested here."
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,1981.218,1985.705,Let me make sure you're clear on what these instructions did.
1983.83-1,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2059.753,2063.705,Are you going to answer my question about the standard of review on habeas?
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,2063.705,2073.328,I am answering it by saying that this was not a case where the Court of Appeals picked out a few isolated instructions.
1983.83-1,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2136.486,2144.274,"Well, is there something unconstitutional about requiring a defendant to bear the burden of going forward with evidence about insanity?"
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,2144.274,2152.78,"There's nothing unconstitutional about that, unless the State does not require the defendant to carry any burden."
1983.83-1,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2152.78,2160.885,"Well, isn't the best evidence of what the State requires, the charge by a Michigan judge in this particular case, affirmed by the Michigan Court of Appeals?"
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,2160.885,2162.385,That charge was not affirmed.
1983.83-1,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2168.139,2172.526,"Well, we at least have the view of the Michigan trial judge that this was Michigan law."
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,2172.526,2194.84,"If you look at People v. Kruggman, that is a Michigan Supreme Court decision found at 377 Michigan 559, page 563, you will see that the judge's instruction on the burden of proof in this case with regard to insanity was clearly wrong."
1983.83-1,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2199.41,2204.297,"Well, and does it amount to much more than state law grounds here?"
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,2204.297,2214.353,"All I am saying is that the State has pointed to this instruction, this particular instruction, the insanity instruction, and said this cured any burden-shifting effect."
1983.83-1,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2493.314,2495.098,"Now, these matters were all before the jury, were they not?"
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,2495.098,2495.664,--They were.
1983.83-1,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2496.283,2497.416,They've been resolved by the jury.
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,2497.416,2498.483,"--Yes; they were, Your Honor."
1983.83-1,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2498.483,2503.086,In what year was this killing committed?
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,2503.086,2503.903,"'72, December."
1983.83-1,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2503.903,2504.786,'72?
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,2504.786,2505.288,Yes.
1983.83-1,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2601.9,2608.623,The State's psychiatrist did not concede all of what the defense psychiatrist said.
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,2608.623,2609.173,That's correct.
1983.83-1,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2609.173,2614.26,"But merely, that if what she said was true--"
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,2614.26,2614.877,That's correct.
1983.83-1,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2614.877,2620.431,"--Then he was really just talking about a generalization of psychiatry, was he not?"
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,2620.431,2623.282,He was questioned about that by defense counsel.
1983.83-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2725.598,2738.791,Could I ask... I would suppose you would agree that we are not foreclosed from considering the retroactivity issue in this case.
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,2751.765,2754.467,"Justice White, I agree that this is a discretionary matter."
1983.83-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2756.035,2769.06,"And what of... let's just assume that it was as clear as could be that, under our precedents, old or new, that a decision like this should not be retroactive?"
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,2775.447,2776.533,I don't think that's correct.
1983.83-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2787.521,2788.756,That may be.
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,2800.012,2800.564,I don't think--
1983.83-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2800.564,2804.099,"My only suggestion is, are you going to say anything about retroactivity?"
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,2804.099,2805.849,"--Since you have asked, I will."
1983.83-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2805.849,2813.154,"I would appreciate, just in a word, why you think Sandstrom is retroactive in a case like this."
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,2813.154,2842.574,"For three reasons: First of all, Sandstrom was designed to eliminate the use of jury instructions which created a substantial danger that the jury would either conclusively presume or presume, absent proof to the contrary, the element of intent, eliminating the prosecution's burden of proof which you have characterized in past cases as one of the most fundamental safeguards we have against erroneous factual convictions."
1983.83-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2842.574,2846.093,"So it's a protection against risk of... against error, is it?"
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,2846.093,2848.561,Yes; against erroneous factual error.
1983.83-1,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2858.933,2862.185,But that was for federal courts construing the federal statute.
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,2862.185,2863.054,You're correct.
1983.83-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2895.775,2899.243,"Well, if you're right on your first argument--"
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,2899.243,2900.327,We don't have to go any further.
1983.83-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2900.327,2908.999,"--If you're right in your first argument, it doesn't make any difference whether the case is here on direct appeal or on collateral attack, I take it?"
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,2908.999,2910.235,That's correct.
1983.83-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2917.788,2935.399,"Well, under our... at least, arguably, under our cases, if the new rule is designed sufficiently related to the accuracy of verdicts, it's retroactive in any case."
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,2935.399,2937.515,--That's correct.
1983.83-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2937.515,2938.951,"And I take it, that's your position."
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,2938.951,2941.001,That's my main position; yes.
1983.83-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2941.001,2961.247,"So it really depends on... if there were a rule, for example, that Sandstrom error is never subject to the harmless error analysis, a fortiori, Sandstrom would be retroactive everywhere."
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,2961.247,2963.016,I would think it would.
1983.83-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2991.914,3009.492,"Well, that might be quite a few, and if Sandstrom isn't retroactive, it seems untoward for us to set aside, based on Sandstrom, a conviction that's 13 years old."
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,3009.492,3023.919,"--I don't think it's untoward, given the fact that Morissette and Winship and approximately a half a dozen Circuit Court of Appeals decisions decided in the '50s and '60s, struck down these kinds of instructions, said they'd shift the burden of proof."
1983.83-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3023.919,3027.037,"I know, but that's just an argument that Sandstrom should be retroactive."
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,3027.037,3027.706,That's correct.
1983.83-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3027.706,3030.123,And I just assumed that if... what if it wasn't?
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,3031.175,3037.395,"I think, even if it isn't, I think you're really only dealing with the stragglers here."
1983.83-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3037.395,3039.781,That's too many.
1983.83-1,1,32183,john_nussbaumer,,3039.781,3048.519,I wanted to make one final point with regard to the harmless error issue.
1983.83-1,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3155.239,3158.258,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Solicitor General?"
1983.83-1,2,34272,louis_j_caruso,,3158.258,3159.424,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.83-1,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3314.493,3317.276,"Thank you, gentlemen."
