1983.82-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.759,We'll hear arguments next in Minnesota State Board against Knight.
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,52.867,58.281,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,93.164,98.307,Which case are you from or in?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,98.307,104.592,"Your Honor, the clients that I represented in the action below were the defendant labor organizations."
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,104.592,105.373,Thank you.
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,105.373,132.151,The primary issue in this case is whether or not a state public employee bargaining law violates either the First or the Fourteenth Amendments where it requires a public employer to meet and confer only with an exclusive representative and that exclusive representative uses only its members as apart of the meet and confer meeting.
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,410.621,412.564,Does the employer have to meet with them?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,412.564,423.541,The statute requires that it meet at a minimum every four months with the representative of the professional employees for meet and confer.
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,423.541,426.393,Could the employer meet with somebody else too?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,426.393,427.722,The employer could meet--
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,427.722,428.584,Separately?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,428.584,429.485,--Yes.
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,437.951,445.383,Could he have them in the same meeting with... Could he have them at the same meeting when he meets with the exclusive representative?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,445.383,448.104,I think they could and that has taken place.
1983.82-898,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,450.666,457.441,"This statute is really about the legislature of Minnesota directing its agents whom to meet with, isn't it?"
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,457.441,458.202,That is correct.
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,463.305,468.478,"It requires them to meet with one group and its option with another, I suppose."
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,468.478,470.661,It is optional with another group.
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,485.761,497.769,"You mean it is... I thought you said under the state law, if the employer chose to meet with other groups, he could without violating any state law."
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,497.769,513.108,"The purpose of meet and confer, we believe, is private consultation not only to permit employees to freely express their views, which, of course, is their First Amendment right, and has been confirmed in this record as well as under PELRA."
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,519.742,521.983,To the exclusive representative under--
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,521.983,523.105,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,523.105,527.876,"--Now, may he meet and listen to others besides the exclusive representative?"
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,527.876,528.437,Yes.
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,528.437,530.858,And he wouldn't be committing an unfair labor practice.
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,530.858,534.121,"Your Honor, I think there could be a question--"
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,534.121,534.561,Under state law.
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,534.561,545.669,--Under state law as to at what point an employer meeting and conferring with someone else other than the exclusive representative may be violating--
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,545.669,547.111,That is what I was asking you awhile ago.
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,553.886,570.796,"--I believe the answer is going to be dependent on whether or not that employer, in fact, is exchanging views and holding private consultation as opposed to simply receiving the views of individual employees."
1983.82-898,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,570.796,576.94,"Well, is there a difference in subject matter between bargaining issues and meet and confer issues?"
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,576.94,577.85,Most definitely.
1983.82-898,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,577.85,578.891,Does the statute define them?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,578.891,580.273,The statute defines that.
1983.82-898,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,580.273,582.534,"Well, what is the difference between the two?"
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,582.534,585.066,That is a line drawn by the legislature.
1983.82-898,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,585.066,587.567,What is the line the legislature has drawn?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,587.567,595.351,The line that the legislature has drawn is that matters of inherent management policy shall not be subject to meet and negotiate.
1983.82-898,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,595.351,598.524,Has that term been defined by your courts?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,598.524,599.345,"Yes, it is."
1983.82-898,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,599.345,600.867,What is the definition?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,600.867,606.52,"Not unlike the problems in the private sector, it is a gray and moving line."
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,648.976,666.307,"I think it certainly affects the way I look at the case as to whether or not, under state law, anybody but the... that the employer would violate state law if he meets on meet and confer issues with anybody but the exclusive representative."
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,666.307,674.745,"--I believe the employer can, either at a public meeting or as indicated in this record in sessions held on campus--"
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,674.745,690.173,"Say he does... Say he meets with a group other than the exclusive representative and he goes through exactly the same routine as he does with the exclusive representative, and if you say he must just listen, then he just listens."
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,692.895,694.157,--I believe so.
1983.82-898,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,694.157,706.454,"But, I understood from what you said earlier that the Board could make no response on any proposals that were suggested by the non-union meet and confer group."
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,706.454,721.966,"Again, I think the Board can make a response, but the question, I believe, Your Honor, is not whether or not that causes some constitutional infringement, but whether or not it is an unfair labor practice."
1983.82-898,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,721.966,732.661,"Apart from the constitutional issue, I think the factual question that I understood Justice White was making inquiry about, is what actually happens?"
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,749.212,757.119,The purpose of the statute is to obtain the majority view of the faculty in an orderly and constructive fashion.
1983.82-898,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,757.119,760.041,"But, that would come form the exclusive representative."
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,760.041,761.06,"Yes, indeed, it would."
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,761.06,761.771,Yes.
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,775.719,778.533,Yes.
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,781.094,792.351,"Whatever kind of a dialogue the statute contemplates on meet and confer issues between the exclusive representative and the employer, the employer can engage in with others."
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,798.285,800.025,--Your Honor--
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,800.025,803.838,I think before it would be an unfair labor practice or arguably it would be an unfair labor practice.
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,803.838,817.456,"--The question is hinged on the fact that the exclusive representative has by statute, being the majority representative, the opportunity to present the majority view."
1983.82-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,825.173,829.414,Even on matters in the contract.
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,830.215,831.695,I am sorry?
1983.82-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,831.695,834.517,"You mean on matters that are not covered by the contract, don't you?"
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,834.517,835.338,Yes.
1983.82-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,838.831,840.461,That goes for all of this.
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,858.092,860.226,"I believe they can respond, Your Honor."
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.226,861.125,Without committing an unfair labor practice?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,861.125,865.058,I believe there could be a question of whether or not--
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,865.058,871.623,May the employer respond to the exclusive representative in a meet and confer meeting?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,871.623,873.594,--That is the purpose.
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,873.594,875.476,I mean the employer to respond?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,875.476,875.745,Yes.
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,875.745,889.353,"Well, I thought you told me awhile ago that he could... The employer could go through exactly the same routine with a non-exclusive representative group as he could with the exclusive representative."
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,889.353,901.592,The statute indicates that individual employees have the right to express their views so long as it does not circumvent the rights of the exclusive representative.
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,910.699,916.092,Why would it interfere with your rights to present your views on management issues?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,916.092,917.053,"It does not, Your Honor."
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,917.822,921.215,For the employer to have a meeting and listen to somebody else.
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,921.215,924.788,--The presentation of those views constitutes no problem.
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,927.88,931.682,You still don't tell us very much about responding to the presentation.
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,936.308,938.117,The answer is no.
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,947.395,949.605,Arguably there may be no response.
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,949.605,952.297,Under meet and negotiate--
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,952.297,953.619,"No, under meet and confer."
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,953.619,955.688,--the employer cannot--
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,955.688,962.393,Under meet and confer your view is that arguably there can be no response to a non-union presentation of views.
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,962.393,962.952,--Yes.
1983.82-898,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,962.952,969.487,"But, isn't that also true of a meet and confer presentation by the certified representative?"
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,971.778,973.14,It is not.
1983.82-898,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,973.14,987.469,"So, is there much difference in the kind of response that an employer would give to two different meet and confer sessions, one with minority or representatives of the other with the certified representative?"
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,987.469,987.91,No.
1983.82-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1011.004,1016.067,What you are saying... Let's see if I can get it clear for myself.
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1018.621,1019.51,Yes.
1983.82-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1019.51,1022.142,"And, he can do it informally or formally?"
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1022.142,1023.784,Yes.
1983.82-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1023.784,1027.617,"And, he can mix the two groups up and listen to both of them at once?"
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1027.617,1050.38,"I think that witnesses may certainly attend a formal meet and confer session, but the purpose of the statute, just as the purpose of exclusivity in collective bargaining, is to permit in an orderly, coherent fashion for the employer to receive the views of the majority representative."
1983.82-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1083.092,1099.102,"Well, do these dissidents, to identify them in quotation marks, do they have the same status and posture at this joint meeting as the ones you regard as the official representatives?"
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1099.102,1106.668,"If it is intended to be one of the once every-four-month meetings, the answer is, no, they do not have the same status."
1983.82-898,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1141.94,1145.972,"Has there ever been such a meeting, a subsequent meeting, some ad hoc group?"
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1145.972,1146.362,Yes.
1983.82-898,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1166.845,1191.153,"But, suppose half a dozen faculty members were designated as a committee representing the 18 non-union faculty members who are involved in this case as I understand it and requested the opportunity on specified dates regularly to present their views to the Board at a formal meeting of the Board."
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1193.464,1194.505,None whatsoever.
1983.82-898,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1196.425,1200.689,Is there any authorities to support that interpretation of your law?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1200.689,1202.689,In terms of their ability to do that?
1983.82-898,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1202.689,1203.34,Yes.
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1203.34,1224.674,"I would believe that the decision of this Court in City of Madison would directly support that, a meeting called for the purpose of obtaining the input of either the faculty or the public at large, that they would be guaranteed their First Amendment freedom of expressing their views concerning all subjects under meet and confer."
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1224.674,1227.246,The employer wouldn't have to meet with them?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1227.246,1231.32,"If it calls a public meeting, Your Honor, I think it certainly would."
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1231.32,1238.122,"Yes, if it called a public meeting, but the difference here is that the law requires the employer to meet with the exclusive representative--"
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1238.122,1238.723,That is correct.
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1238.723,1241.584,--and doesn't require them to meet at all with anybody else.
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1241.584,1242.876,It is exactly right.
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1280.33,1281.282,Is even that quite right?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1293.07,1295.09,"No, I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1299.375,1299.912,Right.
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1303.486,1303.927,Yes.
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1321.877,1328.773,"Well, that sounds to me like he is forbidden to meet with anybody but the exclusive representative."
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1328.773,1338.338,He is... The employer is forbidden to meet and confer which means private consultation.
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1410.225,1418.45,"But, as I understand it, the minority or non-union people can only communicate when such a communication is a part of the employee's work assignment."
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1418.45,1423.034,"No, that I don't believe--"
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1423.034,1425.536,What does that mean that is in Subdivision 7?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1425.536,1441.975,--That is an amendment to the statute which I believe is designed to protect the employer that it will not be committing an unfair labor practice to receive the views of an individual employee concerning matters that are part of their work assignment.
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1441.975,1443.267,That employee's work assignment?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1443.267,1443.888,Yes.
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1443.888,1447.479,"But, if he just didn't think the tuition was right in the school, he couldn't talk about that."
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1447.479,1448.761,I think he certainly can.
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1448.761,1449.682,Well--
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1449.682,1452.173,As a matter of First Amendment freedom.
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1452.173,1455.005,"--But, certainly the statute implies that he may not."
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1458.248,1462.209,I don't believe that the statute should be interpreted that way.
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1481.143,1484.694,"So long as it doesn't interfere with the full, faithful, and proper performance and so forth--"
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1484.694,1485.794,Yes.
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1485.794,1487.015,--of the exclusive representative.
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1487.015,1487.947,I believe that there--
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1487.947,1494.279,"Of course, the exclusive representative might think some of this dissident activity interferes with his exclusive privileges."
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1494.279,1503.395,"--It might, but that has never taken place as far as I know in the State of Minnesota and certainly not on behalf of the Minnesota Community College Faculty Association."
1983.82-898,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1503.395,1526.442,Does this reference you recently made to the statutory section prohibiting the employer from meeting and conferring with anybody except the exclusive bargaining agent lead you to qualify any of your earlier answers about what the employer could do with respect to meetings with people other than the certified bargaining representative?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1526.442,1528.723,"No, I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1528.723,1531.505,I just don't understand--
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1538.39,1540.381,"Well, I am certainly not trying to, Your Honor."
1983.82-898,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1540.381,1540.892,I know you are not.
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1540.892,1543.052,Let me try my hand one more time.
1983.82-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1564.947,1567.659,About what subject matters?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1567.659,1573.422,"Inherent management policy, matters that are not in collective bargaining."
1983.82-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1646.95,1652.023,"The administrator would have a terrible job trying to know which hat he has on, wouldn't he?"
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1652.023,1654.715,It might very well.
1983.82-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1654.715,1657.517,"Practically daily, wouldn't it?"
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1657.517,1673.678,"Well, only with the exclusive representative as to whether or not it is obligated to meet and negotiate concerning a certain subject or whether it is an inherent management policy right that is not subject to the collective bargaining obligations."
1983.82-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1673.678,1679.422,"Well, could you tell me the difference between meet and confer and negotiate?"
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1679.422,1685.506,Meet and negotiate are those subjects which relate to the terms and conditions of employment.
1983.82-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1685.506,1688.067,I am talking about the actual... what goes on.
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1688.067,1695.22,"Meet and negotiate involves negotiating a salary schedule, negotiating a vacation."
1983.82-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1695.22,1698.222,When you meet and confer you are not negotiating?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1698.222,1700.065,"That is correct, Your Honor, because--"
1983.82-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1700.065,1700.576,You are not?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1700.576,1701.835,"--No, you are not."
1983.82-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1714.925,1723.922,"Once you decide that the subject is meet and confer or this is the subject of negotiating, you do the same thing?"
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1723.922,1728.483,"--Yes, Your Honor, meeting with the exclusive representative."
1983.82-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1728.483,1730.195,Now I am lost.
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1730.195,1736.548,Maybe we can try one more approach.
1983.82-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1736.548,1737.068,Good.
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1737.068,1739.92,And that is the question of budget.
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1798.11,1808.185,Do I correctly read Subparagraph 7 to say that on a subject such as the budget the employer shall not meet and confer with anyone except the union?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1808.185,1810.165,That is true.
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1810.165,1813.127,So they can't talk to a dissident group about the budget?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1813.127,1814.279,They cannot--
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1814.279,1818.533,The cannot have a meet and confer session with the dissident group about the budget?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1818.533,1818.823,"--Exactly, Your Honor."
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1819.571,1822.175,What is the state interest that is served by that prohibition?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1822.175,1828.569,--The state interest is the same as it is for exclusive representation and meet and negotiation.
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1843.949,1845.871,None of which are bargainable subjects?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1845.871,1846.29,--Pardon me?
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1846.29,1849.531,None of which are proper subjects for mandatory collective bargaining?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1849.531,1849.872,Yes.
1983.82-898,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1861.93,1870.286,Is it a matter of state interest not to have divergent views on the policy type issues that you have been mentioning?
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1870.286,1875.619,I don't think that the State of Minnesota is trying to eliminate divergent views.
1983.82-898,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1875.619,1879.692,"But, is it contrary to state policy to have divergent views?"
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1879.692,1880.654,It is not.
1983.82-898,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1880.654,1894.121,"Well, it could be pretty dreary for some of the administrators if they had to sit up there and listen to not only all the gripes of the collective bargaining representative, but all the individual gripes of everybody, you know, ad nauseam."
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1894.121,1909.923,"In terms of being able to have an orderly constructive session, yes, but I understood the Justice's question to be whether or not the state was opposed to divergent views as a conceptual matter."
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1909.923,1915.406,"By statute it prohibits the expression of them in similar meetings, as I understand it, so it clearly opposes it."
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1921.671,1923.27,In a comparable meeting.
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1923.27,1927.394,"So, the state policy is we want to hear one voice on the budget, not two voices."
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1927.394,1935.177,"They want to hear the majority view on the state budget in a meet and confer session, that is true."
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1935.177,1935.788,And nobody else.
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1935.788,1937.699,In that session that is right.
1983.82-898,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1937.699,1943.683,"Or in a comparable session either, in that session or any one patterned after it."
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1943.683,1948.638,"I want to make myself hopefully, finally, and forever very clear."
1983.82-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1967.319,1970.591,You are just saying that the state statute then is unconstitutional.
1983.82-898,0,22760,eric_r_miller,,1977.166,1983.841,The First Amendment does not guarantee that an employer shall listen and respond.
1983.82-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1993.936,1998.741,Mr. Vieira?
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,1998.741,2006.736,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-898,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2117.359,2125.945,"Well, Mr. Vieira, you speak as though the public employer and the Minnesota legislature were two different entities."
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2141.907,2143.256,"That is right, sir."
1983.82-898,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2155.774,2173.766,"It doesn't remove the First Amendment analysis at all, but I just question your... Perhaps I drew the wrong implication from what you are saying as if these administrators would somehow complain about, the administrators rather than the faculty members could complain about being imposed upon by the state."
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2173.766,2174.257,"No, sir."
1983.82-898,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2208.429,2237.376,"Mr. Vieira, if there had been no statute at all and you had a school board administrator who simply decided that he was willing to confer with a single faculty member whom he liked and admired and he wasn't going to talk to anybody else on matters relating to the subject of the meet and confer law and just chose to talk to that individual."
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2244.642,2256.59,--As a matter purely of his personal interest in the views of this individual or seeking the views of this individual for the purpose of somehow effecting or influencing the exercise of his official powers?
1983.82-898,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2256.59,2257.84,Influencing policy.
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2257.84,2259.232,"Oh, yes, absolutely."
1983.82-898,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2274.182,2276.763,What case supports that argument?
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2279.615,2281.295,"Well, I am talking about the equal protection clause."
1983.82-898,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2296.155,2297.347,They can attempt but he won't listen.
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2305.212,2307.575,"--Well, I suppose it depends upon how you define listen."
1983.82-898,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2323.085,2325.925,But no case has ever held the employer has to listen.
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2328.398,2336.202,"--No, but in this particular case, the statute has told the employer that the employer has to listen."
1983.82-898,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2352.014,2356.235,"And, it says that it will happen in a particular manner through the collective bargaining agent."
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2356.235,2366.232,Then we come to the question as whether that discrimination attached as an ex post facto condition to the grant of this right--
1983.82-898,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2366.232,2369.883,"What are you talking about, an ex post facto condition in a civil case?"
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2373.676,2375.179,--I wasn't using it in that sense.
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2404.017,2406.347,What is the discrimination you are talking about?
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2406.347,2428.493,"--Well, the discrimination in this case, as the statute has been applied, is that the only individuals among the faculty members of the community colleges who have been permitted to participate in any manner whatsoever in the selection of meet and confer committees or serving on the meet and confer committees have been members of the MCCFA."
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2428.493,2443.941,"Well, I know, but that... I would suppose you would still be attacking the statute on the same grounds if the meet and confer committees had included non-union members as well."
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2475.054,2475.875,That is correct.
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2475.875,2480.567,"So, how is it discriminatory at all?"
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2480.567,2490.584,"Well, the question here is whether or not we have a policy justification for limiting the individuals who can actually participate in the meet and confer session."
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2490.584,2498.618,"Under the statute, how do you... Who goes to the meet and confer meetings now the way they are run?"
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2498.618,2500.589,The way they were run.
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2500.589,2507.044,"The way... Who goes to the... Yes, the way they were run, the way that you objected to."
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2507.044,2518.25,The MCCFA selected through some internal procedure on the various campuses the individuals who would participate in the campus meet and confer committees.
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2518.25,2521.633,I thought you say the employer couldn't meet with anybody except the exclusive representative.
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2521.633,2525.266,"Well, it designates these people as its representatives."
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2525.266,2527.647,"Those are people other than the exclusive representative, aren't they?"
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2527.647,2531.07,"That is not the way the Act is applied in Minnesota, no."
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2537.114,2544.989,"The exclusive representative could... Suppose they chose 15 people, half of them non-union and half of them union."
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2547.079,2553.124,"--Well, there is certainly a possibility whereby this statute could be applied through the exclusive representative."
1983.82-898,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2578.952,2581.062,"Well, they now do, is that right?"
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2581.062,2581.924,"--Excuse me, ma'am."
1983.82-898,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2581.924,2586.525,Now non-members can vote for the representative.
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2586.525,2597.281,Under the District Court's orders non-members are allowed to participate in the voting process and they are allowed to stand for election.
1983.82-898,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2597.281,2600.493,"But your adversaries challenge that on appeal, don't they?"
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2600.493,2603.025,"Oh, yes, sir, they definitely challenge that remedy."
1983.82-898,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2690.824,2702.332,"Mr. Vieira, I wonder if the state wasn't operating on a premise that deserves a little more recognition than I think you give it."
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2755.848,2761.59,"Well, we are making no argument that is inconsistent with that view, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-898,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2853.721,2860.554,"So, you are not saying then that every faculty member has a right to be present and speak at this meet and confer session?"
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2868.729,2874.134,Absolutely and to stand personally for election if they can receive sufficient votes.
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2879.508,2893.215,"--You wouldn't be satisfied if the employer said, well, you people who are disaffected or who are non-union members, I will meet with your representatives too separately."
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2901.561,2903.153,--I think that is an unfair labor practice.
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2908.126,2927.817,"I know, but suppose the statute were declared unconstitutional in its present form and instead of having an election like the District Court, it said the employer should meet with the representatives of the minority."
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2929.289,2938.656,"Well, Your Honor, it might very well satisfy me, but I don't know how this Court or the District Court would rewrite--"
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2938.656,2940.94,I am only asking you.
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2947.284,2951.205,--I think it simply struck the exclusive representative's prerogative--
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2951.205,2953.916,You mean that whole voting system is just simply striking something?
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2953.916,2967.706,"--Well, initially... Recall initially all the District Court said was that the MCCFA had to hold a selection process whereby all the faculty members could participate equally."
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2982.995,2984.547,And rewrote the statute a little more.
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2984.547,2985.907,--Excuse me?
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2985.907,2988.29,And rewrote the statute a little more.
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2988.29,3000.856,"Well, I think they created a remedy that maybe somewhat extraordinary in the sense that we can't find a direct precedent for it, but it derives from the conduct that had to be dealt with."
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3000.856,3010.404,"What if it derived a remedy, not in that form but in the form of saying that the employer shall meet with the committee representing the minority?"
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3010.404,3023.223,"Well, we are perfectly willing to accept the proposition that the employer would be burdened to the extent that he has to meet or it has to meet with more than one committee."
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3023.223,3027.305,"Well, would you be litigating then if he agreed to do that?"
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3027.305,3028.817,If he had agreed originally?
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3028.817,3035.431,"No, if he agreed right now to meet separately with your representatives rather than--"
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3035.431,3039.275,In the full meet and confer sense?
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3039.275,3041.075,"--No, no, no, separately."
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3041.075,3058.575,"What I mean is meet and confer is this process whereby the employer treats this input as something more than simply advantageous statements from a friendly faculty member, but as a view of a group with some recognition."
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3058.575,3059.026,Sure.
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3059.026,3060.156,"And, if he meet with these people--"
1983.82-898,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3060.156,3065.889,"And on matters that are that are not wages, hours, and working conditions, the usual collective bargaining process."
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3065.889,3069.242,"--Yes, sir, on inherent managerial questions."
1983.82-898,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3069.242,3075.587,"Mr. Vieira, are you basically satisfied with the order of the District Court?"
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3075.587,3089.735,I think the order of the District Court remedies the meet and confer problem that we had which was the inability of the non-union members to participate in any meaningful... in any way whatsoever in the process.
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3215.659,3240.626,Let's just assume that the meet and negotiate provisions are valid and that the employer may be required to negotiate only with the exclusive representative and that he is forbidden to meet with anybody else and negotiate on those things.
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3251.145,3254.076,"Well, I think there are a number of reasons."
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3260.149,3267.685,I would think you would think the meet and negotiate subject matter would be far more important to you than the other.
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3267.685,3270.336,"Well, we do."
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3273.318,3274.159,"Well, you lost it."
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3274.159,3277.739,"Well, it wasn't argued."
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3281.262,3289.417,I just say assume that we had taken that case and affirmed it.
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3304.357,3306.06,"--Well, of course--"
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3306.06,3307.592,Why wouldn't that govern this case?
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3307.592,3309.482,--Because for two reasons.
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3369.77,3381.157,"I would think an employer would have much more freedom to choose whom he wanted to talk with with respect to inherent managerial things than about wages, hours, and working conditions."
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3381.157,3382.088,"But, they have chosen."
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3382.088,3383.39,Yes.
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3383.39,3384.62,The statute says--
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3384.62,3387.191,And you think it is unconstitutional.
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3387.191,3402.011,"--Well, if you are getting to the question of whether the exclusivity principle can be carried over, the first problem, from my perspective in looking at it, would be that there is no procedural similarity in the two situations."
1983.82-898,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3419.833,3451.585,"If this statute was completely silent on the meet and confer aspect, had just the traditional labor relation negotiating provisions, is there anything that you know of in federal or state law that would prevent the management at the top from calling on a committee or any group of employees they wanted to discuss the subjects of management that you are talking about and policies if they wanted to do it?"
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3451.585,3468.355,"Well, I think if you carry that principle to its logic of conclusion, you run into a whole host of what I would call one-man, one-vote or political equality cases and a number of First Amendment cases that essentially teach--"
1983.82-898,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3468.355,3479.812,"Do you think the First Amendment allowed the Minnesota administrators to talk with anyone they want about problems of management including their own employees, not only statute."
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3479.812,3488.969,"--Well, if they had a rational work-related reason for consulting with particular employees about particular management problems, that is one thing."
1983.82-898,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3493.801,3498.406,"Well, no employer is here attacking the Minnesota statute on that basis either."
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3506.491,3507.522,That is correct.
1983.82-898,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3644.041,3654.787,That is what I meant when I asked you why you needed any statute at all to have meet and confer sessions under the Minnesota statute.
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3654.787,3655.268,"Well, excuse me, Your Honor."
1983.82-898,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3664.933,3670.376,"But, the meet and confer statute limits the authority of the administrators to discuss."
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3672.519,3679.024,"Well, it limits their authority in terms of the entity or individual with whom they may have the discussion."
1983.82-898,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3679.024,3679.405,Yes.
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3679.405,3680.917,"That is right, exactly."
1983.82-898,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3683.859,3685.269,"Well, you call it discrimination."
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3687.472,3687.65,All right.
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3711.675,3718.19,The statute doesn't dictate to the exclusive representative to choose only union members to go to the meetings.
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3718.19,3718.691,"--No, sir."
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3718.691,3721.382,That is a private choice of the union.
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3724.505,3731.64,Because the state gave this organization the authority to do that.
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3731.64,3739.754,"But, it certainly didn't order them to do it and I don't understand how you can say it is state policy that the union is doing it that way."
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3739.754,3748.39,"Well, they are operating under color of the statute, A; and, B, certainly the Board has been cooperating with them since they began running meet and confer this way."
1983.82-898,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3759.297,3759.768,They couldn't challenge it.
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3759.768,3760.429,Excuse me?
1983.82-898,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3760.429,3762.138,They couldn't challenge it.
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3766.633,3778.279,"No, but what they could have done to the MCCFA was to say to them this statute does not require you to limit participation in these meet and confer committees to your members only."
1983.82-898,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3787.095,3788.705,"That would have been consistent with the statute, I take it."
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3788.705,3789.426,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3799.602,3801.604,But it still was the union decision about how to structure its committees.
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3805.008,3823.477,"--Well, it was the MCCFA's claim that it was entitled to select individuals from its membership only based upon... It is based upon 179.66, Subdivision 7."
1983.82-898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3839.019,3846.645,"The decision to exclude your client, that was purely a union decision or a private decision."
1983.82-898,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3846.645,3849.805,"Well, it was a private decision acquiesced by this Board."
1983.82-898,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3852.379,3854.87,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
