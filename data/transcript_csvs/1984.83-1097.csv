1984.83-1097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.57,We will hear arguments next in Heckler against Turner.
1984.83-1097,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,85.504,97.914,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case concerns the proper interpretation of Section 402(a)(7) and (8) of the Social Security Act, which is a provision in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children statute."
1984.83-1097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,139.824,144.644,"Mr. Phillips, are you going to tell us the government's view of the new statute?"
1984.83-1097,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,148.012,153.214,"Well, it seems to me that the new statute has ratified the Secretary's interpretation of the 1981--"
1984.83-1097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,153.214,155.25,"Well, makes gross income certainly for the future, doesn't it?"
1984.83-1097,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,155.25,156.066,"--Yes, Your Honor, and I think it--"
1984.83-1097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,156.066,158.468,And is there any dispute as to the past?
1984.83-1097,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,158.468,169.343,"--I think... well, there is no dispute in my mind that the Congress recognized that the Secretary's interpretation of the structure of the statute has always been correct from 1981 through 1984."
1984.83-1097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,169.343,171.076,Back to my initial question.
1984.83-1097,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,173.845,178.282,"Well, there is still a substantial amount of controversy with regard to the period--"
1984.83-1097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,178.282,178.966,About what?
1984.83-1097,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,178.966,190.189,"--Subsequent to the enactment in 1981, and before the injunction was issued in this case, there is a claim for retroactive benefits by state AFDC recipients in California."
1984.83-1097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,190.189,193.891,Why shouldn't we just apply the statutory law the way it is now?
1984.83-1097,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,200.814,205.866,"I don't know that that... well, that would be perfectly satisfactory to us, Your Honor."
1984.83-1097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,205.866,208.068,"Well, I know, but why aren't you making that argument?"
1984.83-1097,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,208.068,212.437,"Well, it seemed to us somewhat unfair to deprive individuals of their rights."
1984.83-1097,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,220.959,223.578,"They didn't say it was prospective, did they?"
1984.83-1097,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,223.578,225.111,"No, Your Honor, they did not."
1984.83-1097,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,225.111,233.349,"Usually there is a presumption that the Court applies the law in effect when the case is still open, the final version of the law that is in effect."
1984.83-1097,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,233.349,235.885,"Yes, Justice Rehnquist, that is correct."
1984.83-1097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,240.437,243.289,"Would it make more sense, Mr. Phillips, for us to send this back?"
1984.83-1097,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,248.743,252.228,"--Well, I don't believe that there is nearly so much to wrestle with any longer."
1984.83-1097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,253.378,254.83,"Well, even if there isn't, why should we?"
1984.83-1097,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,256.063,264.553,"--Well, the reason the agency has asked to have you do that is because we have a substantial number of these cases pending in various circuits."
1984.83-1097,1,35378,mark_n_aaronson,,995.135,1005.341,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the dispute before the Court today concerns the effects of what Congress did in 1981 or the AFDC program."
1984.83-1097,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1213.892,1223.165,"Well, certainly we have examples of excessive dependency assertions, which affects the amount of withholding."
1984.83-1097,1,35378,mark_n_aaronson,,1223.165,1227.199,"Yes, but there is a provision and have been provisions in almost every state law."
1984.83-1097,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1240.607,1244.661,"But it is still subject to abuse, if somebody asserts ten, and he has only three."
1984.83-1097,1,35378,mark_n_aaronson,,1244.661,1248.446,--It is subject to very easy verification.
1984.83-1097,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1272.661,1280.084,Then the Tax Court cases that struggle over the issue of whether a dependent is assertable are of no significance?
1984.83-1097,1,35378,mark_n_aaronson,,1280.084,1281.101,Not in this case.
1984.83-1097,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1722.436,1736.143,"But if we accept your submission that perhaps the writ should be dismissed or the case simply remanded to the Ninth Circuit, then what about the cases from the various other Courts of Appeals that have come out the other way?"
1984.83-1097,1,35378,mark_n_aaronson,,1742.499,1758.442,"That would be our position, that that is just... you know, in balancing all the various considerations, that if in fact Congress had enacted the 1984 legislation before this Court had accepted the cert petition, I think it would have been an important question for the Court to consider."
1984.83-1097,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1765.096,1777.22,"It wouldn't trouble you, then, that AFDC recipients in one part of the country had been found to be entitled to certain amounts and the same recipients similarly situated in other parts of the country had been found not entitled to them?"
1984.83-1097,1,35378,mark_n_aaronson,,1777.22,1797.05,"It would trouble me, just as it troubles me that in many parts of the country there never were any challenges presented to this provision at all, and in fact there has been over a period of time a differential implementation, and even if this Court were to rule in this case, in order for that judgment to be enforced throughout the country, there would have to be individual actions brought."
1984.83-1097,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1826.833,1833.737,"But just from the point of view of judicial administration, supposing you were totally neutral as to how this particular issue should be resolved."
1984.83-1097,1,35378,mark_n_aaronson,,1844.028,1855.085,"--It would trouble me, and I would then have to weigh whether I thought it was better to reach the case on the merits, and I think if that were the case, I think the Ninth Circuit decision should be upheld in this case."
1984.83-1097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1867.26,1870.795,Do you think we should just ignore the '84 law?
1984.83-1097,1,35378,mark_n_aaronson,,1870.795,1885.189,"I think in terms of resolving this particular issue, unless you think that the very summary statements made in '84 override what we find to be the intent of Congress in '81 and the intent of prior Congresses--"
1984.83-1097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1885.189,1887.991,Can we take Congress over you?
1984.83-1097,1,35378,mark_n_aaronson,,1887.991,1888.441,--Excuse me?
1984.83-1097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1888.441,1900.864,"Can we take Congress over you, and send it back to the Ninth Circuit to decide what effect, if any, the '84 Act has on this case?"
1984.83-1097,1,35378,mark_n_aaronson,,1900.864,1903.916,I certainly think that is an alternative for the Court.
1984.83-1097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1910.52,1913.406,"There is no difference between send back and remand, is there?"
1984.83-1097,1,35378,mark_n_aaronson,,1913.406,1914.224,"--No, there is not."
1984.83-1097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1914.224,1914.941,I thought not.
1984.83-1097,1,35378,mark_n_aaronson,,1914.941,1916.424,"No, I think that is an alternative."
1984.83-1097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1925.33,1932.186,What makes you think Congress didn't intend the statute to affect a case like this?
1984.83-1097,1,35378,mark_n_aaronson,,1932.186,1935.038,There is no statement in the Act at all that that--
1984.83-1097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1935.038,1937.323,The presumption is the other way.
1984.83-1097,1,35378,mark_n_aaronson,,1937.323,1941.541,"--Your Honor, I am not familiar with the law that would say the presumption is the other way."
1984.83-1097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1944.493,1961.122,"Do you think that the... You don't agree with the United States, then, that Congress intended to ratify the Secretary's interpretation of the Act?"
1984.83-1097,1,35378,mark_n_aaronson,,1961.122,1961.722,--No.
1984.83-1097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1963.422,1989.189,"Because if we read the legislative history and the statute, whatever other evidence there is, and thought that the Congress really did intend to ratify, in those words, using that word, the prior interpretation by the Secretary, then you certainly would be led to believe they thought the Act ought to... that that view ought to govern cases like this."
1984.83-1097,1,35378,mark_n_aaronson,,1989.189,1992.307,"--I don't think the record... now, we again haven't gotten fully into it."
1984.83-1097,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2036.318,2046.526,"Well, you say then that the '84 Act is not a ratification of the... in the sense of agency law, that in order to ratify it must have been within the authority of the agent prior to the ratification?"
1984.83-1097,1,35378,mark_n_aaronson,,2046.526,2052.178,"If Congress was doing that, it was in direct conflict with what prior Congresses had done in 1939 and 1968."
1984.83-1097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2052.178,2062.536,"But even if it was an amendment, your sole reliance for nonretroactivity is unless Congress indicated it should be applied retroactively, it shouldn't be applied retroactively."
1984.83-1097,1,35378,mark_n_aaronson,,2064.654,2074.693,"Well, I am more familiar with California state law, where in fact certain statutes might be applied retroactively, more in the land use area."
1984.83-1097,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2148.141,2162.484,"Mr. Aaronson, I guess you don't think that when Congress got around to the '84 Act, perhaps not explicitly, but at least implicitly Congress suggested it did not agree with the Ninth Circuit's interpretation."
1984.83-1097,1,35378,mark_n_aaronson,,2162.484,2168.155,I think it certainly made a different... you could argue certainly implicitly they made a different policy choice.
1984.83-1097,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2180.363,2185.081,But doesn't the legislative history show that they were well aware of the Ninth Circuit position?
1984.83-1097,1,35378,mark_n_aaronson,,2185.081,2185.681,I think in '84.
1984.83-1097,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2397.433,2400.318,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Phillips?"
1984.83-1097,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2400.318,2406.039,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, just a couple of points."
1984.83-1097,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2607.786,2608.953,Have you got a case for me?
1984.83-1097,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2608.953,2609.353,For which?
