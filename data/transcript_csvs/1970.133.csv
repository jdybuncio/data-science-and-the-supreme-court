1970.133,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,51.113,"We will hear arguments next in Number 133, United States against the Luros, Claimant and Thirty-Seven (37) Photographs."
1970.133,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,57.834,61.79,May it please the court.
1970.133,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1043.012,1052.984,"Solicitor general, before you leave the Stanley, have all the Lower Court, have they been uniformed in giving what you call this standard due Stanley?"
1970.133,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1052.984,1074.795,"All but one I believe Mr. Justice, it's very widespread, it’s recited at length in the appendices to the brief of the respondent in this case, I believe there is one case which has narrowed the extension of Stanley."
1970.133,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1212.986,1219.548,"Before you go on with that Mr. Solicitor General, let me see if I clarify that last point."
1970.133,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1232.297,1236.725,That is our position although we don’t have to sustain that in this particular case.
1970.133,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1236.725,1253.869,Then the casual tourist coming back with the same material for the private use in his home is not protected by Stanley at least you argued because Stanley protected it only when it was in his home.
1970.133,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1253.869,1259.999,"When it was in the privacy of his own home, sitting by his own fire."
1970.133,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1279.341,1283.788,What you’re saying is that Stanley isn’t an obscenity case at all.
1970.133,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1283.788,1297.193,I’m saying that Stanley is an obscenity or most at all but I put in the sort of shotgun to shows that Stanley doesn’t protect everything in the home.
1970.133,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,1837.507,1844.833,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1970.133,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1936.436,1939.049,How was that to be accomplished?
1970.133,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,1939.049,1956.447,"Well, it can be accomplished by inviting people who are interested in buying an illustrated Kama Sutra to write in and say that they would like to purchase such a book and to have adequate safeguards that the person is an adult."
1970.133,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1966.845,1977.962,The certification that you speak of the protection is that the purchaser must certify that he’s over 21 or over?
1970.133,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,1977.962,1980.343,An adult that it defers.
1970.133,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1986.58,1991.985,Is that relating now to Mr. Justice Stewart's questioning to you when you called it protection?
1970.133,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,1991.985,1994.592,"Well, Your Honor, one can protect it in a lot of ways."
1970.133,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2033.705,2037.545,Where is that in the stipulation or anywhere else around?
1970.133,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2037.545,2049.079,"Page 19, Your Honor there is a copy of my letter and it states that it was to be distributed in the fashion that I have indicated."
1970.133,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2049.079,2049.982,"Well, that’s just --"
1970.133,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2049.982,2069.405,The material is not being imported for distribution to minors nor to be trusted upon unwilling dealers and it is spelled out a little bit more fully in our answer to the complaint and our cross complaint which also sets forth the intention.
1970.133,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2069.405,2074.074,It’s not that that’s pleading and that’s a letter from counsel for one of the parties.
1970.133,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2075.243,2078.321,"Well, the letter was part of the stipulation."
1970.133,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2082.366,2089.092,As an exhibit or was it incorporated in everything and all their allegations here true?
1970.133,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2089.092,2093.195,"Well, this is Appendix C, Your Honor to the stipulation."
1970.133,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2287.207,2298.592,"Mr. Fleishman, do you mean that in the sense that it’s important in its impact in obscenity per se?"
1970.133,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2298.592,2301.534,"Yes, important as an important obscenity case."
1970.133,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2302.798,2310.701,"I don’t think that’s what the Solicitor General said, at least I didn't hear him say that that was an important case in obscenity."
1970.133,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2310.701,2317.651,"Well, I believe he was suggesting that it was an important case and that it would be debated for a long period of time."
1970.133,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2335.053,2340.801,And to limit that and he has the right to read what he want is his own good law alone?
1970.133,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2340.801,2342.253,"Oh, I would not --"
1970.133,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2342.253,2348.506,"If anyone else is in the Stanley other than that, this is bachelor with one person at home."
1970.133,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2348.506,2349.021,That’s --
1970.133,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2349.021,2351.996,It was found in his desk drawer in his bedroom.
1970.133,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2351.996,2353.935,"It was, Your Honor."
1970.133,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2861.635,2873.657,"Well, did the court say that or did the court merely indicate at whole that Congress permissibly has such a statute."
1970.133,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2873.657,2888.089,"Well, the court of course held that Congress might permissibly passage a statute but the opinion said that the right of mailer to send into a home ends at that point where the mailer says no."
1970.133,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2890.941,2895.281,What you’re making is the court didn’t invent that concept --
1970.133,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2895.281,2895.456,That is to --
1970.133,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2895.456,2895.966,-- for constitution.
1970.133,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2897.613,2906.164,"Although, in all fairness, I think the court did kind of invent it in Ginsburg which preceded the legislation that was somewhat comparable."
1970.133,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3084.064,3085.433,Mr. Fleishman.
1970.133,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3087.145,3103.398,"Mr. Chief Justice, comment was made earlier of the fact that most of the lower courts considering Stanley have concluded that it has the meaning that we attribute to it here."
1970.133,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3394.471,3395.87,If it’s a what?
1970.133,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3395.87,3411.615,"If it’s a classic, it is a provision in the statute would says that classical obscenity may be brought in and to say if it’s obscene for an intellectual, it’s all right but if it’s obscene for a truck driver, presumably it’s not."
1970.133,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3411.615,3412.721,Is that in the statute.
1970.133,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3412.721,3419.367,The statute says that secretary of the treasury may permit obscene classics to be brought in for private --
1970.133,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3419.367,3422.399,(Inaudible) does it give a definition of the classic?
1970.133,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3422.399,3424.318,It does not.
1970.133,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3444.225,3453.223,Don’t you think you could have a little more precise definition of a classic on that in the abstract?
1970.133,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3453.223,3455.638,"Not really, the way it’s been applied by the secretary of the treasury."
1970.133,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3455.638,3462.768,"Oh, it’s not for a criminal statute but I think don't you think it could be a little bit less expensive than you suggest it."
1970.133,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,3462.768,3468.684,"Perhaps, this was broad argument Mr. Chief Justice."
1970.133,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3682.05,3686.986,"Mr. Solicitor General, you have about three minutes left."
1970.133,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3686.986,3691.648,"In the time I have available, I want to make only two points."
1970.133,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3781.347,3782.772,That is a customs case?
1970.133,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3782.772,3797.308,"No, that happens to be a transport by common carrier case which is like the next case we’re going to present to the court which is mail but I think the principle of the extended Stanley is exactly parallel in all of them."
1970.133,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3797.308,3801.157,Do you have the citations of the three cases --
1970.133,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3801.157,3854.241,"Yes, Mr. Justice in the United States against Melvin, the one to which I just referred 419 federal second, 136 a Fourth Circuit decision, Fragus against United States 428 F.2d 1211, a Fifth Circuit decision and plainly involving pandering and Miller against the United States 431 F.2d 655 a Ninth Circuit decision and then I would like to refer to the decision of a three-judge district court in Georgia, Gable against Jenkins, 309 federal supplement 998, which also took a narrower or a non-expensive view of Stanley."
1970.133,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3906.301,3910.77,Can I have that citation-- .
1970.133,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3910.77,3915.676,The affirmance Mr. Justice is in 397 U.S. 205.
1970.133,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3969.223,3970.892,Thank you Mr. Solicitor General.
