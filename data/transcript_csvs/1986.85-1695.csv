1986.85-1695,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,15.167,"We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 85-1695, Societe Nationale Industrielle, et cetera, versus United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa."
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,18.431,37.235,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case concerns The Hague Evidence Convention which establishes procedures for gathering evidence located on the soil of other signator nations."
1986.85-1695,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,178.226,179.788,"Mr. Ford, may I just interrupt?"
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,186.91,189.722,"Justice Stevens, it is to this extent."
1986.85-1695,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,195.955,196.486,Right.
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,196.486,198.437,Alternatively we argued--
1986.85-1695,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,198.437,200.514,And are you abandoning the exclusive use position?
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,200.514,203.965,"--We are not abandoning, Justice Stevens, the exclusive use position."
1986.85-1695,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,251.524,255.069,"We are bound by The Hague Convention, are we not?"
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,255.069,260.099,"It is our position, Justice Marshall, that we are."
1986.85-1695,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,260.099,261.286,Can't that be answered yes or no?
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,261.286,263.348,I beg your pardon?
1986.85-1695,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,263.348,265.739,Can't that be answered yes or no?
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,265.739,267.58,"It can, and the answer is yes."
1986.85-1695,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,267.58,270.064,And so what else is there before us?
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,270.064,277.889,I believe what is before the Court is the opportunity to establish a general rule for American courts.
1986.85-1695,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,277.889,280.577,0 xxx.
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,280.577,286.933,"To have resort to the Convention in the first use, on a first use basis."
1986.85-1695,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,286.933,288.308,"We are not resorting to it, we are bound by it."
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,288.308,290.915,"I am sorry, I did not--"
1986.85-1695,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,290.915,291.868,We are not resorting to it.
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,295.024,295.96,"--I agree, Justice Marshall."
1986.85-1695,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,295.96,298.771,I don't understand what the case is about.
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,298.771,305.238,I believe in the American courts the opinions below have a great deal of confusion.
1986.85-1695,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,334.71,344.8,"Mr. Ford, as I understand it, the Solicitor General doesn't agree that it has to always be resorted to in the first instance, does he?"
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,349.97,362.247,"The present position of the Solicitor General as I understand it, Justice O'Connor, is, this case should be remanded for a case by case comity analysis."
1986.85-1695,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,362.247,368.901,Which wouldn't necessarily require a resort to the Hague procedures in the first instance.
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,368.901,389.457,"In our view a comity analysis certainly in this case and any similar case necessarily leads to that conclusion, but the rule proposed a change from the Solicitor General's earlier position in Volkswagen versus Falzon, where the Solicitor General of the United States amicus took the position the Convention was exclusive--"
1986.85-1695,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,389.457,389.97,Right.
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,389.97,404.809,"--just a few years ago, now turns us to the suggestion the case be sent back for American courts in each case to have a factually laden, a factually burdened comity inquiry."
1986.85-1695,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,404.809,411.946,"And as I understand it it would not under his view, at least, require resort in the first instance to The Hague procedures--"
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,411.946,412.274,That is--
1986.85-1695,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,412.274,413.086,--necessarily.
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,413.086,414.679,--That is my understanding.
1986.85-1695,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,414.679,427.675,"Now, what is your position on who has the burden of proof to show what other procedures can accommodate a plaintiff's needs?"
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,438.515,443.888,"I do not believe so, Justice O'Connor, because it is not a fact question."
1986.85-1695,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,463.191,487.431,"Well, certainly the foreign national is going to know what the procedures are in that country better than the American litigant, presumably, and you don't think there should be any burden on the foreign national, at least, to go forward and establish what the procedures are which are available in the foreign country?"
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,487.431,488.915,"I do not, Justice O'Connor."
1986.85-1695,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,521.53,527.263,"Well, Mr. Ford, are you urging the applicability of The Hague Convention?"
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,562.375,570.902,"Well, Justice Scalia if I may point out, we are urging that this be a rule for all American courts."
1986.85-1695,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,575.245,577.54,"I understand, but what imposes that rule?"
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,581.571,589.522,"It comes from a consideration of comity, which we have discussed in the brief."
1986.85-1695,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,589.522,592.552,"Right, which would have existed before The Hague Convention, right?"
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,592.552,594.411,"Yes, that is true, Justice Scalia."
1986.85-1695,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,594.988,596.55,So we can just stop talking about The Hague Convention.
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,596.55,598.191,"--Well, I would like to say--"
1986.85-1695,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,598.191,607.844,"And all we are discussing is whether as a matter of comity American courts should generally not conduct discovery abroad, or not permit discovery to be conducted abroad."
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,607.844,628.087,"--I should have made it clear in the first instance, a reading of the Convention itself and the Convention history supports prior to any resort to comity principles the proposition that The Hague Evidence Convention by an American court must be... must be used in the first instance."
1986.85-1695,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,634.334,635.568,May I interrupt you?
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,647.142,648.376,"--We do not, Justice Stevens."
1986.85-1695,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,648.376,650.392,So it is not must in every sense.
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,652.484,656.405,We have responded to all discovery against us.
1986.85-1695,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,656.405,660.201,"And you didn't violate any international treaties by doing that, did you?"
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,660.201,663.403,Based on any and all information we could get in the United States.
1986.85-1695,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,666.152,666.793,I understand--
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,666.793,670.182,"--to the genuineness of those advertising articles after, through U.S. sources."
1986.85-1695,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,670.182,674.057,"--And by doing so you acted consistently with the Convention, as I understand."
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,674.057,674.666,That is our position.
1986.85-1695,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,674.666,681.617,"Well, then, when must the Convention first be resorted to, just whenever the defendant, whenever the party opposing discovery requests that they do?"
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,681.617,706.154,"When we are unable within the United States to reach the evidence gathering process to respond, we or any other party, or, to put it another way, when the evidence must be gathered by whatever means on foreign soil of a signator, it is not the nationality, if the Court will permit, that controls, and there is where we find much confusion below."
1986.85-1695,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,711.073,721.96,"Even if the officer of the corporate defendant who is subject to the jurisdiction of the American court could write a letter that says please send me a copy of this document, it still means they have to go through The Hague Convention?"
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,721.96,724.132,"That is our position, because otherwise the divergent--"
1986.85-1695,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,724.132,725.271,Even if the officer is willing to do it?
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,725.271,740.937,"--That is correct, because in the case of France we have the defensive legislation referred to in the cases as the blocking statute, a term we have adopted to avoid confusion, and in the case put to me by Justice--"
1986.85-1695,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,740.937,744.577,"The statute, which, if I understand it correctly, you would not have needed if the Convention means what you say it means."
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,744.577,747.152,--We would not have needed--
1986.85-1695,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,747.152,751.057,At least if the Convention is exclusive you wouldn't have needed that statute.
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,751.057,757.446,"--Well, it isn't so much a question of our need as France's declaration of its own policy."
1986.85-1695,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,810.662,815.364,Would this be true also of an American corporation with a French wholly owned subsidiary?
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,822.315,838.544,"If we have the situation where the evidence reposes on French soil and French soil alone and we are dealing with the The Hague Convention, again, it is the location of the evidence controls."
1986.85-1695,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,838.544,842.746,"Right, even if it is a wholly owned subsidiary, say, of General Motors or some company like that?"
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,845.243,847.056,That is correct.
1986.85-1695,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,861.722,868.235,"I don't understand... if I understood your response to Justice O'Connor correctly, it isn't a first use rule."
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,876.827,877.607,It is.
1986.85-1695,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,877.607,885.98,"Okay, so you think that you always must do it first, or generally must do it first?"
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,886.65,887.275,Always.
1986.85-1695,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,887.275,887.916,--Always?
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,887.916,894.805,Absent an absolute extreme situation where there has been a demonstrated record that this would be completely futile.
1986.85-1695,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,913.096,931.527,"And this would be so even though it has become clear from the past experience of a particular federal court or of all the federal courts or state courts that a particular country, a particular signatory to the Convention in fact has not permitted these procedures to be used properly?"
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,931.527,932.433,Or has returned--
1986.85-1695,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,932.433,933.043,Right.
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,933.043,936.119,--letter after letter of request unexecuted.
1986.85-1695,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,953.16,953.582,Right.
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,954.972,955.457,--of dissatisfaction.
1986.85-1695,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,955.457,956.332,Are you going to answer my question?
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,961.532,969.343,"That is for the Court upon a record to create an exception to the general rule, so my answer would be--"
1986.85-1695,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,969.343,971.919,So it isn't absolute first use rule.
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,974.403,974.762,--Of course.
1986.85-1695,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,978.574,980.026,--I am trying to understand what your position is.
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,980.026,981.729,--And I didn't quite make it clear.
1986.85-1695,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,989.789,990.975,And as experience warrants.
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,1001.909,1019.933,"Obviously where there are some exceptions or reservations taken that show incompatibility and collide with overriding national interests of the United States is one that occurs to me, but I say that only experience could determine this with a general rule in place from this Court."
1986.85-1695,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1019.933,1036.144,"Mr. Ford, for example, haven't some countries party to the Convention made an Article 23 reservation so that, for example, documents will not be... requests for documents will not be honored."
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,1039.05,1039.675,"They have, Justice O'Connor."
1986.85-1695,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1039.675,1051.545,"And what is an American court to do when a party plaintiff, for example, is seeking production of documents that are in a country with an Article 23 reservation?"
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,1051.545,1056.576,I suggest what the American courts have done is to have moved--
1986.85-1695,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1056.576,1061.622,I am asking under your proposal what is it the American court would have to do?
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,1061.622,1068.916,--It would have to make a first use of the Convention to test the meaning of the Article 23 reservation by the country.
1986.85-1695,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1068.916,1075.445,"Well, suppose we know the meaning, and the country simply will not permit the production of documents."
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,1079.335,1094.143,"Well, under the question as put, with the court knows, we know, if that knowledge is true knowledge and factually correct, the court is obviously faced with the option of carving out an exception."
1986.85-1695,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1108.355,1117.71,What is the position of France today in honoring requests for documents that are relevant to the litigation in this country?
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,1117.71,1129.518,The position of France today is as expressed in the letter from the Minister of Justice to the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Appendix A to the amicus brief for the Republic of France.
1986.85-1695,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1147.963,1154.805,Are you aware of any such requests being made through American courts since that letter was issued?
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,1154.805,1155.461,--I am aware of none.
1986.85-1695,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1194.429,1209.939,"Well, suppose there is insufficient experience to show that these requests just aren't going to be honored, and you say, well, then the American court has... can recognize an exception."
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,1214.719,1220.654,"It must then make, with the benefit of a developed record, a comity analysis."
1986.85-1695,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1220.654,1223.7,"All right, it makes it, and it says we need the documents."
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,1226.949,1229.137,First of all--
1986.85-1695,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1229.137,1233.603,--If it is against the law for the party to produce them--
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,1233.603,1234.572,--We suggest--
1986.85-1695,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1234.572,1237.897,"--in the home state, in the home country."
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,1237.897,1248.128,"--First of all, we suggest, Justice White, that orders should not become routine merely directing, it has to be a considered comity analysis."
1986.85-1695,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1248.128,1255.516,"Could the court ever order the party to produce the documents if it is against the law, say, of France to produce them?"
1986.85-1695,0,30346,john_w_ford,,1255.516,1255.61,Yes.
1986.85-1695,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1377.311,1378.686,"Thank you, Mr. Ford."
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1380.966,1400.037,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the United States agrees that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that The Hague Evidence Convention has no application in this case."
1986.85-1695,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1415.39,1422.45,"Now, Mr. Minear, the SG appears to have changed his position regarding the use of The Hague Convention."
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1422.45,1426.293,"Your Honor, we don't believe that that is really accurate."
1986.85-1695,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1428.698,1433.557,"Well, I reread the briefs filed by the SG, and it certainly appears that way to me."
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1433.557,1438.087,--You are referring to the brief that we filed in Falzon.
1986.85-1695,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1438.087,1438.525,Yes.
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1438.525,1443.321,Falzon dealt with the problem of oral depositions on foreign soil.
1986.85-1695,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1457.034,1464.483,"Now, as to the taking of depositions do you adhere to the position that The Hague Convention procedures are exclusive?"
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1464.483,1465.311,--No.
1986.85-1695,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1481.524,1486.304,"But not in France, for example, in this case."
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1486.304,1487.881,"Yes, that is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1487.881,1491.145,"By reason of The Hague Convention, or by reason of some other principle?"
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1491.145,1507.108,"By reason of what we believe is customary international law that the general view of foreign nations is that this would be a violation of their sovereignty, and the United States is willing to honor that viewpoint even though we might not necessarily agree with it fully."
1986.85-1695,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1507.108,1509.045,It would have nothing to do with The Hague Convention.
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1509.045,1510.936,"No, that would be quite apart from The Hague Convention."
1986.85-1695,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1510.936,1514.341,Why does your current position have anything to do with The Hague Convention?
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1514.341,1515.638,"The problem here, Your honor--"
1986.85-1695,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1515.638,1527.026,"I mean, either The Hague Convention is mandatory, in which case you use it, or it is not mandatory, and all it does is supplement the procedures that countries have to make information available abroad, right?"
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1527.026,1528.055,"--Your Honor, that--"
1986.85-1695,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1528.055,1536.927,"It is either one or the other, and if it is the latter, then I don't see why it creates a new rule of comity that didn't exist before."
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1540.005,1540.927,"--Yes, that is right."
1986.85-1695,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1540.927,1544.363,So why didn't we use comity before with respect to England?
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1558.343,1565.216,Prior to the formulation of The Hague Convention these issues typically arose in the case of depositions that were to take place on foreign soil.
1986.85-1695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1572.87,1575.134,"But weren't those third party depositions, for the cost part?"
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1575.134,1576.119,For the most part they were.
1986.85-1695,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1577.743,1587.927,"Well, Mr. Minear, does the fact that this country has entered into The Hague Convention now weigh in the comity balance?"
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1591.988,1599.189,"--Your Honor, it weighs in in this way, that the foreign nations generally view The Hague Convention as exclusive."
1986.85-1695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1638.272,1641.38,How do you get a treaty and comity?
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1646.535,1654.876,"Again, Justice Marshall, the things that we must do is, we must provide the evidence as specified when a foreign nation requests it."
1986.85-1695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1654.876,1658.935,"You must follow The Hague Convention, period."
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1658.935,1663.481,"Yes, but The Hague Convention says that requests for foreign--"
1986.85-1695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1663.481,1665.372,But I mean there is no comity involved.
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1665.372,1668.387,"--As a receiving state that is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1668.387,1671.776,"The treaty, the Constitution says a treaty is it."
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1671.776,1674.477,"Yes, but it only provides a supplement--"
1986.85-1695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1674.477,1677.586,"And it binds everybody, including us and the Department of Justice."
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1677.586,1685.894,"--Your Honor, yes, the treaty is mandatory insofar as we must provide evidence to foreign countries."
1986.85-1695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1701.623,1719.756,"Well, that is a perfectly fair position, and even if comity wouldn't have required resorting to foreign mechanisms in the first instance, it is perfectly fair to argue that The Hague Convention does require it, no matter what comity would have said."
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1719.756,1721.053,We disagree.
1986.85-1695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1721.053,1722.051,I know.
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1728.643,1747.948,"Our view is, first of all, there is nothing in the Convention that indicates a first use requirement, and there is nothing in the ratification history that indicates a first use requirement as well, but furthermore petitioner's rule rests on the assumption that The Hague Convention will always produce fair, effective, and efficient discovery, and that is a matter that is subject to considerable debate."
1986.85-1695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1747.948,1753.883,"Well, if it just requires first resort I am not so sure about that."
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1753.883,1764.347,"Your Honor, the problem here is a domestic plaintiff who is forced to go through first resort to the Convention may in fact encounter so many obstacles that he is forced to give up his lawsuit."
1986.85-1695,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1764.347,1772.282,"What if Congress in so many words said, you will resort to The Hague Convention in federal cases and you will not do otherwise?"
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1772.282,1773.64,Then that would be controlling.
1986.85-1695,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1776.685,1790.962,"So we are just talking basically about how stringent the provisions of The Hague Convention are, you know, what impetus Congress gave or the executive gave to require some sort of use of it before you get to ordinary discovery proceedings."
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1790.962,1798.538,"--Yes, Your Honor, but the record here is rather unclear, quite frankly, on to what extent Congress expected these matters to be used even in the first instance."
1986.85-1695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.538,1811.346,"Well, if we construe, if we say that The Hague Convention does not require exclusive use or first resort, do we have to decide anything else?"
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1817.982,1822.746,We believe that the Court should identify those principles that should control the comity analysis.
1986.85-1695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1833.758,1835.694,Are they supposed to do that in each case?
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1842.427,1843.957,"--Yes, Your Honor, we believe that that is--"
1986.85-1695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1843.957,1844.66,But did they do that in this case?
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1853.783,1864.045,"--Yes, Your Honor, but the statement that a foreign nation objects, and being able to point to specific policies of the foreign nation we believe will generally suffice to show that there is a legitimate foreign interest here."
1986.85-1695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1878.071,1885.397,"Yes, but don't they have to say in their motion to limit discovery, we have got a trade secret problem in this case that you have got to be sensitive about, and they didn't do that."
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1885.397,1888.099,"Well, yes, Your Honor, and this brings up another problem."
1986.85-1695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1895.941,1898.91,But they didn't ask for anything except a 100 percent protective order here.
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1898.91,1899.988,"Yes, that is true, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1899.988,1904.08,And even the District Judge said you must take the depositions in France.
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1906.734,1907.219,Yes.
1986.85-1695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1918.591,1922.09,Do you think they made the kind of showing that requires reversal in this case?
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1927.23,1927.917,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1936.477,1938.945,Who has the burden of supplementing the record?
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1938.945,1942.569,In this case it is difficult to speak of burdens in this situation.
1986.85-1695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1943.053,1945.786,"Well, somebody has got to go forward before the judge first."
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1945.786,1952.299,--We believe that the domestic litigant has an obligation to identify the types of discovery that it feels is necessary.
1986.85-1695,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1952.299,1952.877,"Well, he has done that."
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1952.877,1961.92,And in return petitioner should indicate or the foreign litigant should indicate whether or not this discovery could be obtained through the use of the Convention.
1986.85-1695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1964.326,1969.497,So are you going to order somebody to violate the laws of France?
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1969.497,1973.744,"Your Honor, may I answer that question?"
1986.85-1695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1974.963,1977.338,Go right ahead.
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1977.338,1977.76,Yes.
1986.85-1695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1988.131,1991.006,And get a man arrested and convicted.
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1991.006,1996.925,"Well first of all, there is a real question whether or not these laws are in fact being applied to French citizens."
1986.85-1695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1997.91,2002.924,You and your court are not going to determine what the law of France is when they put him in jail.
1986.85-1695,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2005.283,2007.328,"--Yes, Your honor."
1986.85-1695,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2008.469,2009.61,"Thank you, Mr. Minear."
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2011.531,2034.912,"Mr. Chief Justice, and say it please the Court, we respectfully request this Court to affirm the lower court's decision and allow the plaintiffs in this case, John and Rosa George and Dennis Jones, to proceed with their request of discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as opposed to the procedures under The Hague Evidence Convention."
1986.85-1695,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2034.912,2037.161,Do you agree that the Eighth Circuit was in error?
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2037.161,2038.693,"No, I do not, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2038.693,2042.815,"Well, your opponent said everybody agreed to that."
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2042.815,2045.643,"We certainly agree with the result, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2088.375,2093.045,"Yes, but they are requiring the documents to be brought from France."
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2093.045,2094.654,"That is true, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2104.635,2111.289,"Well, France believes that the Hague Convention covers the production of these documents."
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2111.289,2118.037,"That is true, your Honor, and we disagree with their reading of the Convention."
1986.85-1695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2119.491,2124.832,"Well, if we disagree with you on that the case has to go back, doesn't it, to see if there are some grounds for an exception?"
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2124.832,2140.686,"Your Honor, I believe that the magistrate in the District Court and the Eighth Circuit made the necessary analysis so that it is not necessary for this case to be remanded in order to perform that analysis again."
1986.85-1695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2140.686,2145.589,"Well, did the Court below agree with you that The Hague Convention just didn't reach these documents?"
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2145.589,2147.823,"That is true, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2147.823,2156.804,"Did they also say, even if it... even if it... even if it applies there is an exception?"
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2156.804,2158.006,That is true.
1986.85-1695,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2167.346,2171.267,"I am really puzzled, because Article 3(g) of the Convention says in words"
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2180.967,2186.809,"No, The Hague Evidence Convention applies to document production, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2211.08,2224.7,"Well, it may not apply in the sense that it mandates that the procedure be adopted, but is it not at least an optional procedure that you could have requested a letter of request and you could have asked the Court to follow The Hague Convention if you thought it would be advantageous?"
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2224.7,2229.26,"Your Honor, I don't think there is any question but that the plaintiffs in this case could have--"
1986.85-1695,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2229.26,2235.008,"You see, using the words ""doesn't apply"" is really kind of a confusing term."
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2248.955,2250.471,--I think an American litigant always has that option--
1986.85-1695,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2250.471,2250.939,Okay.
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2250.939,2259.342,--of using The Hague Evidence Convention for the type discovery that we requested in this particular case.
1986.85-1695,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2259.342,2263.794,"So when you say and maybe when the Court of Appeals said it doesn't apply, all they meant was, it is not exclusive."
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2265.247,2268.653,"Well, there is no question but that The Hague Evidence Convention is not exclusive, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2268.653,2271.62,"Well, the government of France disagrees with you on that, so there is a question."
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2276.759,2278.149,"That is true, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2278.149,2280.789,And that is one of the issues we have to resolve.
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2280.789,2282.023,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2296.986,2314.761,"Now, even if the Court were... even if we were to decide it isn't exclusive, do you think that a trial court has no obligation to consider whether Convention procedures could be followed in obtaining the requested discovery?"
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2314.761,2324.491,"In this case, Your Honor, it is our position that the trial court indeed has no obligation to consider whether or not Hague Evidence Convention procedures should be applied."
1986.85-1695,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2324.491,2325.835,And why?
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2339.157,2342.437,There are two reasons why it should not apply in this case.
1986.85-1695,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2358.509,2385.233,"Well, if we disagree with the court below on that point and believe that if the document is presently on foreign soil and has to be taken from there to be produced here, and if we think that is something that would trigger The Hague Convention as a possible procedure to use, then must the trial court not think about these international concerns?"
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2385.233,2388.904,"--In this particular case, Your Honor, no."
1986.85-1695,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2427.124,2434.371,"But now we have the letter from the foreign minister indicating possible availability of the procedure, do we not?"
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2434.371,2436.793,"Your Honor, I have some difficulties with that letter."
1986.85-1695,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2484.292,2488.947,Do you know that it has to be adopted by the French legislature in order to be binding in France?
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2488.947,2490.385,"No, I do not, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2490.385,2502.241,"Well, while you are speculating, what happens if this Court, a District Court here orders this man to go over there and get these documents, and France locks him up?"
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2502.241,2513.595,"Your Honor, our position is that if there is no intrusion by the adversary on French soil, that The Hague Evidence Convention does not apply."
1986.85-1695,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2513.595,2516.531,How could that help him over there?
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2519.249,2525.059,"It is our position, Your Honor, and we conceded and agreed with the lower court--"
1986.85-1695,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2525.059,2526.589,You just feel sorry for him?
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2526.589,2540.834,"--We conceded that if activity by the adversary, the American adversary takes place on French soil, that The Hague Evidence Convention procedures should apply."
1986.85-1695,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2559.014,2572.43,What if the French lawyer goes to France representing the French company and he is subject to some sort of sanctions by the French government because he is attempting to comply with the District Court discovery order?
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2572.43,2595.108,The safety valve in that case is that the French litigant would inform the District Court that if we comply with this discovery order we are subject to criminal penalties.
1986.85-1695,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2624.785,2636.53,Do you think the District Court can focus solely on the concerns of the litigants before it to get information pertinent to their lawsuit and ignore foreign policy considerations in making this sort of a determination?
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2636.53,2640.794,"Your Honor, no."
1986.85-1695,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2657.679,2669.441,"When you say it is not applicable, you are saying, I take it, not that it would not be available if you chose to use it, but that by its terms it is not required to be used?"
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2669.441,2670.315,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2673.657,2676.375,What does The Hague Convention have to do with that?
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2694.243,2697.368,"Your Honor, the Court certainly has to take into consideration that statute."
1986.85-1695,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2697.368,2700.32,So the inapplicability of The Hague statute is really irrelevant.
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2713.581,2716.049,That's really a two-pronged test.
1986.85-1695,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2766.062,2773.638,So your argument about the applicability of The Hague Convention merely goes to the manner in which the comity decision should be made.
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2779.136,2779.777,That's right.
1986.85-1695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2820.917,2845.47,"Do you understand your opponents to say that if an American plaintiff wants to take the deposition of a French national and the French national is completely willing to have his deposition taken on French soil, that you have to go through some official authority have it done?"
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2845.47,2849.484,"I understand that that's what our opponent's position is, Your Honor, yes."
1986.85-1695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2849.484,2868.774,"And that it the defendants in this case had said, well, we are quite willing to furnish these documents, is it their position that The Hague Convention, wholly aside from the blocking statute, would prevent them from doing that?"
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2868.774,2885.219,"Our position is that The Hague Evidence Convention is not mandatory, and that, yes, a foreign national or a foreign country could provide less restrictive procedures."
1986.85-1695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2885.219,2893.124,"Yes, but could these defendants simply have produced the documents without complying with any... without regard to The Hague Convention?"
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2893.124,2896.826,"They certainly could do that, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2903.229,2908.634,"Yes, but your opponents say that the Hague Convention would forbid them from just voluntarily producing the documents?"
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2908.634,2910.993,"No, because The Hague Convention is not exclusive."
1986.85-1695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2910.993,2911.743,"Yes, all right."
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2911.743,2912.774,And is not mandatory.
1986.85-1695,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2912.774,2921.584,"Well, presumably you could waive any procedures required by The Hague Convention voluntarily like any other procedures, can't you?"
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2927.768,2928.94,"That is true, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2928.94,2934.5,"But if you voluntarily turn them over, you are in trouble with France."
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2934.5,2937.233,"That is what our opponents say, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2937.233,2942.263,Is that true?
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2942.263,2944.778,"We have no personal experience, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2944.778,2956.913,"But as you read the statute or the treaty, and you turn them over voluntarily, wouldn't you be violating the treaty?"
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2956.913,2961.569,"You would be violating the blocking statute, Your honor, and not the treaty."
1986.85-1695,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2963.16,2963.519,That is what I meant to say.
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2967.05,2967.972,"--That is correct, Your honor."
1986.85-1695,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2967.972,2969.44,And you would be subject to jail.
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2969.44,2970.784,That is correct.
1986.85-1695,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2979.218,2982.357,To some people like me a fine is just as bad as jail.
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,2983.2,2984.904,"--Me, too, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3000.648,3002.85,One way to find out.
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,3002.85,3004.897,--That is correct.
1986.85-1695,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3007.161,3008.925,Mr. Doyle--
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,3009.909,3011.503,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3011.503,3013.3,That would be one way to find out.
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,3026.466,3029.84,"Our client has not, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3065.139,3073.074,"Mr. Doyle, the District Court order, if I remember correctly, permitted you to take depositions only in France, but it did permit you to go ahead and take them."
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,3074.823,3075.542,"No, we haven't."
1986.85-1695,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3091.786,3093.615,Who was your District Judge?
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,3093.615,3096.615,"It was Magistrate Ronald Longstaff, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3096.615,3102.255,"Well, that is why I asked, because I thought it was a magistrate's case, not a District Court's case."
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,3102.255,3109.767,"The case was submitted to the magistrate under Section 636, Your Honor, for submission."
1986.85-1695,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3123.807,3129.181,"Mr. Doyle, the order says if discovery depositions are to be undertaken the court will require compliance with The Hague Convention."
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,3134.477,3142.881,"--Well, we read the order as saying, if we are to take depositions in France, The Hague Evidence Convention applies."
1986.85-1695,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3142.881,3143.225,That is not what it says.
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,3143.225,3147.865,I is our position that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure certainly allow us to--
1986.85-1695,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3147.865,3148.396,"Oh, I see."
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,3149.427,3151.802,--to require parties--
1986.85-1695,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3151.802,3154.255,"But you haven't taken any depositions in the United States either, then, have you?"
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,3154.255,3155.55,"--No, we have not, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3371.995,3375.432,"Well, even under your theory you can't get equality."
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,3381.633,3383.163,"That is true, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3383.163,3386.912,So there is no way to get parity.
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,3386.912,3388.068,That is true.
1986.85-1695,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3389.771,3395.91,Do you acknowledge that you couldn't compel an officer of your opposing party to appear in the United States and give his testimony?
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,3395.91,3406.297,"--Your Honor, this court, the United States court cannot compel an individual to transport himself from France to the United States."
1986.85-1695,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3406.297,3406.672,"No, I am not talking about the individual."
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,3413.905,3414.435,Yes.
1986.85-1695,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3425.931,3431.633,"Well, they can tell the corporation we will dismiss your... strike your answer if you don't show up, or something like that."
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,3432.21,3433.085,"--And that is the remedy, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3439.442,3455.559,--Do you contend there is any difference at all between the power... just forgetting the Convention between the power of the Federal District Judge to order an officer of an American corporation... say his office is in New York... to testify in Iowa or California and an officer of a French corporation who does business in Iowa to testify in Iowa?
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,3457.169,3462.666,--The jurisdiction of the Court to force--
1986.85-1695,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3462.666,3464.478,Assume they've got jurisdiction over the corporation.
1986.85-1695,2,39103,richard_h_doyle,,3473.71,3474.429,"--No, there is not, Your Honor."
1986.85-1695,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3476.835,3477.989,"Thank you, Mr. Doyle."
1986.85-1695,3,30346,john_w_ford,,3480.567,3512.086,"With respect to respondent's remarks regarding questions of the applicability of the French defensive legislation or blocking statute and the Solicitor General's representative's remarks, which I understood to be there was some question in that office whether or not the French law applies to French attorneys highlights one of the major points be are trying to make."
1986.85-1695,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3558.755,3563.924,"Mr. Ford, as I understand the questions presented and the position you espouse here, it doesn't depend at all on a blocking statute."
1986.85-1695,3,30346,john_w_ford,,3571.078,3571.938,"--Oh, yes, Justice Stevens."
1986.85-1695,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3571.938,3576.203,"And your questions presented don't mention the blocking statute, in your cert petition."
1986.85-1695,3,30346,john_w_ford,,3587.684,3592.933,The same argument would be made for a general rule if there were no blocking statute.
