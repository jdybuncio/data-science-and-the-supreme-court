2000.99-901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.774,"We'll hear argument next in Number 99-901, Brentwood Academy v. Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association."
2000.99-901,0,29228,james_f_blumstein,,88.133,91.105,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2000.99-901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,138.66,152.777,"Mr. Blumstein, the court of appeals in this case went through three different tests that they thought our cases support, a public function, State compulsion, symbiotic, and said this didn't fit into any one of those three."
2000.99-901,0,29228,james_f_blumstein,,160.019,167.927,"Mr. Chief Justice, the court of appeals did not look at the local level interactions between the TSSAA and the public schools."
2000.99-901,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,232.821,238.394,"Well, would you state what you think the test is, without being so fact-specific?"
2000.99-901,0,29228,james_f_blumstein,,240.91,243.511,"--Justice O'Connor, in this case, building on the--"
2000.99-901,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,243.511,244.997,"Not in this case, in all cases."
2000.99-901,0,29228,james_f_blumstein,,245.824,264.893,"--Well, whether the... in this case whether the governmental institutions, in this case public schools, control the activity and so that it is fair to say that this is attributable to the Government because the Government, or its public schools in this case, control the decisionmaking."
2000.99-901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.923,313.562,"Wait, let's... it's controlled by public schools."
2000.99-901,0,29228,james_f_blumstein,,320.25,322.357,"--Of its members, Justice Scalia."
2000.99-901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,322.357,325.329,"Of... well, of its... but principally its governing board."
2000.99-901,0,29228,james_f_blumstein,,334.45,336.845,"Well, I think that under the control principle--"
2000.99-901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,336.845,337.217,Oh.
2000.99-901,0,29228,james_f_blumstein,,341.032,341.42,--On the composition.
2000.99-901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,342.701,343.378,I see.
2000.99-901,0,29228,james_f_blumstein,,343.378,350.048,"--ultimately the control of the organization in a one-school, one-vote situation is the membership of the organization."
2000.99-901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,350.048,361.005,"So if this organization were composed of 49 percent public school... public schools and 51 percent private schools, it would be okay?"
2000.99-901,0,29228,james_f_blumstein,,361.005,374.668,"Justice Scalia, we think there's an analogy to the separation of powers cases, the Washington Metropolitan Airports case, and Bowsher v. Synar and the question of control... there's an effective control question and a formal control question."
2000.99-901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,377.336,391.537,But in the Washington Airport case it was the Government which said the decisionmakers here shall be ex officio members of certain committees.
2000.99-901,0,29228,james_f_blumstein,,411.394,416.512,"But it is the organization that's controlled by governmental institutions, so--"
2000.99-901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,416.512,443.633,"--Well, Mr. Blumstein, supposing that all the principals, say in Eastern Tennessee, or Middle Tennessee, some area, got together, private schools, public schools, and said we want to form a principals association and get together once a month and we'll have a convention in the summertime, and they don't get paid, they do it on their own time, and they decide they're going to give a principals' award to the best student in Eastern Tennessee, and they give that award."
2000.99-901,0,29228,james_f_blumstein,,444.376,464.149,"--Your Honor, if the organization... if they're serving in their official capacity as principals, if they're representing the schools, and if they are allowing private and public schools to participate in some awarding process, whether it be a principals' association or a German Club, if the German departments of the State decided that they--"
2000.99-901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,464.149,468.896,"Well, my hypothesis was that the principals did it on their own time."
2000.99-901,0,29228,james_f_blumstein,,482.725,499.072,"--Your Honor, as one moves towards the... a coaches' association or principals' association, I concede that it is conceivable that public officials will have a nonpublic function, or nongovernmental function that they can perform, and they would not be State actors."
2000.99-901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,538.62,544.853,You could have had the same rule in the hypothetical that the Chief Justice posed.
2000.99-901,0,29228,james_f_blumstein,,547.825,549.061,"Well, Your Honor, in this case--"
2000.99-901,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1174.018,1185.602,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-901,2,39013,richard_l_colbert,,1791.633,1802.49,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-901,3,29228,james_f_blumstein,,3450.865,3456.893,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2000.99-901,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3571.071,3571.98,"Thank you, Mr. Blumstein."
