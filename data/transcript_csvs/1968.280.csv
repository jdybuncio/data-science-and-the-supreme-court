1968.280,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,31.939,"Number 280, United States, petitioner versus Skelly Oil Company."
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,33.8,38.645,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.280,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,253.631,261.254,We'll recess now.
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,261.254,303.444,"As I was saying before the recess, this case involves two payments aggregating $505,000.00 made by the respondent in 1958 which represented repayments of excess charges for gas which it had sold in the years 1952 through 1957 for which it had received payment and against which payments it had deducted the statutory percentage depletion in the amount of 27.5%."
1968.280,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,850.95,870.13,"Mr. Solicitor General, is the law clear that if the other alternative had been used namely recomputing the prior years tax that in computing that tax, you would have just excluded the item of income but still retain the depletion and deduction?"
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,870.13,877.618,"Well, Mr. Justice, I think it is clear and I hope that it will be after this Court has decided this case."
1968.280,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,877.618,880.765,"But you mean, it isn't clear under that other --"
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,880.765,887.134,"At the present time, it is somewhat clouded by the decision of the Tenth Circuit but --"
1968.280,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,887.134,890.197,"But that is under a different way of approaching, is it?"
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,902.481,904.207,It didn't choose paragraph 5 --
1968.280,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,904.207,905.723,That's what I mean.
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,905.723,915.612,-- which would have meant throwing it back into the earlier year and reducing the tax for this year by the amount of tax which it paid.
1968.280,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,915.612,924.501,"If it had done that though, would you say the law is unclear that in so doing, all it would have done was to exclude the item of income to the prior year?"
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,924.501,927.333,"No, Mr. Justice."
1968.280,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,938.83,939.063,Yes.
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,946.123,959.763,"Suppose they had had a smaller loss or putting it another way, Section 1341 is very much a consequence of this Court's decision in the Arrowsmith case."
1968.280,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1515.364,1541.422,"Is it also accurate to say that in effect the depletion which was actually taken in the prior year with respect to a certain amount of income from mining, if you then deduct some of the income in the later year and leave that depletion taken on the prior year, you will take any much higher percentage of depletion as against the remaining income?"
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1543.879,1558.491,Well that -- you can say in effect that they have deducted 27.5% twice with respect to the same mineral.
1968.280,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1569.714,1576.189,And the amount -- the amount of percentage depletion depended on what the gross income for mining was included in that return.
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1576.189,1586.853,"Depended on what the gross income for mining was and we contend that the 505,000 repaid in 1958 reduced the gross income from --"
1968.280,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1586.853,1593.697,"And therefore, the depletion allowance, the prior return was unjustified."
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1593.697,1598.798,"As it now turns out, the depletion allowance in the prior return was not justified."
1968.280,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1623.563,1638.748,"Mr. Solicitor General, I hope you won't mind, I really have difficulty in understanding why 1341 (a) (4) is not controlling here."
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1709.746,1715.777,"Well, Mr. Justice that is pretty close to the taxpayer's contention in this case."
1968.280,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1715.777,1718.233,"Well, tell me what's wrong Mr. -- I didn't follow you really."
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1718.233,1723.927,It seems to me that the -- it seems to me to begging your pardon clearly wrong.
1968.280,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1723.927,1724.406,"Well, I know."
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1739.239,1741.341,"Well, let me just take the language."
1968.280,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1760.353,1762.592,And what is the deduction under (a) (2)?
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1762.592,1783.303,"It seems to me that in the statement which you have made, you have taken the next leap which is to say that a deduction means in this case $505,000.00 and I suggest that there's nothing in 1341 (a) (2) which says that the deduction to which a deduction refers is $505,000.00."
1968.280,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1783.303,1810.205,"Well, of course, I might think $505,000.00 when I'm suggesting to you that in asking your help if this is not -- if you disagree with this as I gather you do and I don't understand why and therefore there's a word such deduction, two words “such deduction”, just reading this and literally it would seem to refer to subparagraph 2."
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1810.205,1811.005,"Clearly, it does."
1968.280,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1811.005,1819.698,"And subparagraph 2 would mean as the amount $505,000.00 here, is that the amount of the overpayment?"
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1819.698,1821.615,That's the amount of the overpayment.
1968.280,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1821.615,1823.921,"Well, it would seem to refer to that amount here."
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1823.921,1824.829,"Well, Mr. Justice --"
1968.280,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1824.829,1827.042,But now tell me why it doesn't.
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1827.042,1836.956,Because I think that a deduction does not have the same meaning as the words “the amount repaid.”
1968.280,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1845.616,1845.856,"No, sir but --"
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1845.856,1848.459,That was what was taken into income.
1968.280,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1848.459,1871.192,"I'm sorry Mr. Solicitor General but paragraph 2 defines a deduction as being the amount, an amount allowable for the taxable year because the taxpayer did not have an unrestricted right to such item or to a portion of such item."
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1890.357,1926.873,"Only Mr. Justice if you take the position which I think is not warranted that the deduction referred to in 1341 (a) (2) is the same in amount as the amount of the item which was paid out and what I have been trying to suggest is that the amount of the deduction to which the taxpayer is entitled, under cases like Ludey and I repeat, I think Ludey is the closest case of all, is not the amount paid but is the amount which is properly deductible for the year."
1968.280,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1926.873,1957.773,"Well, I beg your pardon sir but if you will bear with me a moment, you look at (2), that defines for purposes of 1341 what is meant by the Congress by the allowable deduction and it defines it as I read this as the amount to which the taxpayer did not have an unrestricted right."
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1957.773,1962.479,I think you shortened the language and perhaps unduly.
1968.280,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1969.571,1971.634,Well go on and you have to read the whole paragraph.
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1971.634,1980.135,"Well, I'm trying -- what I'm trying to suggest that a deduction is colorless as to the amount."
1968.280,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2003.532,2011.21,"Now, to what did the taxpayer here not have an unrestricted right?"
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2012.209,2014.795,"$505,000.00."
1968.280,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2038.509,2047.94,"I think your point is, Mr. Solicitor General, that subsection 2 here is not a definition of the amount of the deduction."
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2047.94,2048.784,"Exactly, Mr. Justice."
1968.280,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2048.784,2050.342,That's where you and Justice Fortas find yourself --
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2050.342,2059.331,"That's exactly the point that I'm concerned, that I have not able to make my position thoroughly."
1968.280,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2059.331,2061.339,"Well, what is its function though?"
1968.280,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2065.108,2066.44,Or the conditions.
1968.280,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2066.44,2079.672,What is the function of the verbiage of subsection 2 if it is not to define the amount which the taxpayer may deduct in the defined circumstance?
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2079.672,2087.797,It is to define the one of the three conditions upon which Section 1341 becomes operating.
1968.280,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2087.797,2104.886,"You mean it defines the circumstances that is to say, if you find that the taxpayer did not have an unrestricted right to the item that he included in his income in a prior year."
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2104.886,2106.01,Then a deduction.
1968.280,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2106.01,2110.844,Then you go to look -- then he's entitled to a deduction?
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2110.844,2111.572,Right.
1968.280,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2111.572,2125.592,And then you find out what the amount of the deduction is not by reference to the amount to which he did not have an unrestricted right but by reference to the existing case law.
1968.280,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2125.592,2127.707,That is exactly our position.
1968.280,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2127.707,2129.701,Thank you.
1968.280,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2129.701,2139.452,"In fact, the taxpayer never did pay taxes for the previous year on entire amount of the item."
1968.280,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2139.452,2146.786,"No, Mr. Justice he paid taxes on the entire amount less 27.5%."
1968.280,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2146.786,2153.066,Mr. Casey.
1968.280,1,38996,robert_j_casey,,2153.066,2154.467,May it please the Court.
1968.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2275.471,2284.115,"Could I ask you that if this so-called item had not been included in the previous year's income, would your percentage of depletion taken in that year have been the same?"
1968.280,1,38996,robert_j_casey,,2284.115,2285.081,"No, sir, it would not."
1968.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2285.081,2289.941,It would have been 27.5% of the item left?
1968.280,1,38996,robert_j_casey,,2289.941,2290.553,"Yes, sir."
1968.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2291.995,2292.529,Yes.
1968.280,1,38996,robert_j_casey,,2292.529,2309.763,"But the problem which that question brings in is in fact the finally determined principles of tax accounting which this Court has laid down, that is the annual accounting concept."
1968.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2309.763,2322.916,"Well, you think Congress actually thought in these terms and decided to leave, to give a full deduction for the item and leave the depletion in the previous year intact?"
1968.280,1,38996,robert_j_casey,,2322.916,2337.796,"I can't tell you that Congress was looking specifically to a depletable income item but I can tell you that in their own words, Congress said, “If the item was included in gross income.”"
1968.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2337.796,2348.378,"Well, you see -- but you think in fact that they used these words construed as you say they should be construed as you say they should be construed that it actually have in mind the situation before the Court?"
1968.280,1,38996,robert_j_casey,,2348.378,2353.664,It's typical for me to imagine that this would have escaped the attention of the Congress.
1968.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2365.854,2374.452,But you don't think it's surprising that Congress would say you may reduce your income in effect the previous year without reducing your depletion.
1968.280,1,38996,robert_j_casey,,2374.452,2380.065,I think that that is the office of percentage depletion.
1968.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2450.502,2456.091,What would happen if you had elected to use (a) (5)?
1968.280,1,38996,robert_j_casey,,2456.091,2457.294,"Well, to --"
1968.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2457.294,2460.406,"Then you would have recomputed your tax to the prior year, wouldn't you?"
1968.280,1,38996,robert_j_casey,,2460.406,2468.886,We would have recomputed the tax for the prior year solely by excluding the amount from gross income.
1968.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2468.886,2471.885,And you don't think you would have any change your depletion deduction?
1968.280,1,38996,robert_j_casey,,2471.885,2486.691,"Well, this case isn't before us but in my opinion, no we would not because percentage depletion is predicated upon gross income from the property which is an entirely different concept from gross income."
1968.280,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2486.691,2501.458,"Well if you had made the refunds in the same taxable year, then you would not have gotten the benefit of the depletion allowance on those, isn't that right?"
1968.280,1,38996,robert_j_casey,,2501.458,2503.79,That is exactly right.
1968.280,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2503.79,2516.749,And isn't it a little bit difficult to think that Congress really intended to establish a different rule just because the refunds were made in a subsequent year?
1968.280,1,38996,robert_j_casey,,2516.749,2518.054,I don't think so.
1968.280,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2518.412,2519.089,But you can't?
1968.280,1,38996,robert_j_casey,,2522.53,2532.387,"Well, we know that Congress enacted Lewis and Healy, they codified it."
1968.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2673.167,2678.15,Do you think it really (Inaudible)?
1968.280,1,38996,robert_j_casey,,2678.15,2684.591,"If it had been -- well, it's hard for me to address myself to that."
1968.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2684.591,2696.543,"Well, as always then, would you think for an allowance is based on the amount by which, physically a (Inaudible)."
1968.280,1,38996,robert_j_casey,,2696.543,2697.221,No sir.
1968.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2704.096,2718.005,"Well, I know but you are asking me to compute as though the percentage of the depletion allowance was a fixed amount based upon say the tonnage or the gallons?"
1968.280,1,38996,robert_j_casey,,2718.005,2724.805,"Now, that is not my position and I hope I have not left you with that impression."
1968.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2784.021,2790.94,"But again, Mr. Justice Fortas suggested that this settlement been paid at the year your income defining what it had produced?"
1968.280,1,38996,robert_j_casey,,2790.94,2791.691,"Yes, sir."
1968.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2791.691,2793.016,And your depletion?
1968.280,1,38996,robert_j_casey,,2793.016,2794.711,"Yes, sir."
1968.280,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2794.711,2813.734,"Mr. Casey, do you believe if this matter had been specifically presented to the Congress that the Congress would have said in these circumstances, you are entitled to take a double 27.5% depletion allowance?"
1968.280,1,38996,robert_j_casey,,2813.734,2824.914,"Well, I don't think Mr. Chief Justice that we can assume for a minute that Congress was unaware of this possibility."
1968.280,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2824.914,2826.918,"No, I didn't ask you that."
1968.280,1,38996,robert_j_casey,,2838.162,2839.437,"Well, yes I do."
1968.280,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2840.026,2847.473,Would you tell me why they would give 55% deduction in circumstance of this kind?
1968.280,1,38996,robert_j_casey,,2847.473,2857.806,If I could amend the question to be asked of the Congress not to say would you allow a double percentage depletion allowance because they haven't.
1968.280,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2948.854,2950.401,I just like to ask you this.
1968.280,1,38996,robert_j_casey,,2958.066,2959.89,"Yes indeed, it does sir."
1968.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2981.581,2993.644,"Now, what does your -- what was this deduction amount to the current year, $505,000.00 for your --"
1968.280,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2993.644,2996.092,We deduct it from ordinary income.
1968.280,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2996.092,2997.595,Gross income?
1968.280,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2997.595,2998.397,From gross income.
1968.280,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2998.397,3004.506,"Well, they then should deduct it from gross income from mining for the current year?"
1968.280,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3004.506,3007.936,I don't think it's properly deductible from gross income from mining.
1968.280,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3007.936,3014.211,"If it were, why you would have to make your percentage depletion as we have here."
1968.280,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3014.211,3015.037,"Yes, it would."
1968.280,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3020.287,3036.055,"So that I suppose if you were permitted or required deducted income for mining this year, you would have the same effect roughly that the Government's interest."
1968.280,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3036.055,3042.091,"Not -- well, I guess the quick answer is yes."
1968.280,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3047.568,3053.259,But accounting wise you may not do that in this year or you don't want to do it?
1968.280,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3053.259,3062.691,"Well, accounting wise it really isn't a factor that goes to bringing gross income from the property down to taxable income from the property."
1968.280,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3074.35,3087.32,"In this particular case, the year, the way you deducted it in 1950 taxes did not really reduce incoem from mining, income from the property at first (Inaudible) depletion in 1958."
1968.280,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3087.32,3088.23,That's true.
1968.280,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3089.619,3093.432,And you would not welcome that suggestion?
1968.280,3,38996,robert_j_casey,,3093.432,3106.603,"Well, I would resist it if I could but I don't think that it is really a proper charge against that -- the operation of that property."
1968.280,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3157.674,3171.981,"Is there -- may I ask you Mr. Casey, Solicitor General has for the moment in a way clarified my view of the meaning of subparagraph 2."
1968.280,3,38996,robert_j_casey,,3202.699,3203.915,"Yes, I do."
1968.280,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3203.915,3210.991,And is there any authority one way or the other or what do you have to say about it?
1968.280,3,38996,robert_j_casey,,3210.991,3220.5,"Well, when you look to deductions as the Government's brief in this case, no."
1968.280,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3329.783,3332.246,"Well, I understand your position."
1968.280,3,38996,robert_j_casey,,3343.47,3371.203,"Yes, subparagraph 2 to us makes it plain that if the -- if there is an allowable deduction, I don't care as the Solicitor General said, we've had some exchanges as to whether the deduction in the current year is ordinary and necessary business expense under 162 or a loss under 165, we don't care."
1968.280,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3500.758,3507.13,Do you have an election in the oil business as to how to take the depletion?
1968.280,3,38996,robert_j_casey,,3507.13,3511.184,"Yes sir, you take a cost depletion or percentage depletion."
1968.280,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3511.184,3512.294,(Inaudible)
1968.280,3,38996,robert_j_casey,,3512.294,3516.839,Yes sir.
