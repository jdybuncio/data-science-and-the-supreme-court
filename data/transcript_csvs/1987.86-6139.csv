1987.86-6139,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.557,"We'll hear argument this morning in Number 86-6139, Clara Watson v. Fort Worth Bank and Trust."
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,11.81,18.232,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-6139,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,280.061,283.262,"Well, we don't have a hiring case anymore, do we?"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,283.262,288.455,"--No, but the same supervisors that were making those hiring decisions were also making the promotion decisions."
1987.86-6139,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,288.455,294.509,"I mean, all that's left now is the promotion aspect for an individual plaintiff?"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,294.509,298.993,"That's correct, although the hiring case actually has been remanded to the District Court where it's still pending."
1987.86-6139,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,298.993,300.415,"Yes, but we're not concerned with that here?"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,300.415,301.625,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-6139,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,301.625,320.398,"Mr. Brender, I assume that the proof offered as trial, the statistical evidence, is exactly the same evidence that would be offered either under a disparate treatment or a disparate impact case."
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,320.398,322.099,"I think that's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-6139,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,330.323,336.417,"And if it were remanded, you wouldn't have different proof, it would still be the same statistical evidence?"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,336.417,338.409,"Yes, I believe so."
1987.86-6139,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,338.409,341.562,"So, what is really at stake here?"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,358.834,360.524,Probably both.
1987.86-6139,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,370.18,372.09,"Well, we haven't said that, have we?"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,372.09,373.232,--Not exactly.
1987.86-6139,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,374.301,380.836,And I'm just wondering if there's any difference at all in the initial burden of proof under the two types of cases.
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,380.836,400.371,"Well, I think there is in this sense, because at least under Castenada v. Partida, where the Court addressed the two or three standard deviation argument on applying an intent theory, that would be greater that under Griggs, where you could show under the eighty percent rule, the three-fourths rule, you wouldn't necessarily have to have statistical significance."
1987.86-6139,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,443.138,453.165,"So, the courts below, although you have the statistical evidence, decline to even treat it as a pattern and practice case--"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,453.165,454.214,The--
1987.86-6139,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,454.214,460.778,"--because the class was discharged, she wasn't representative of the class?"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,460.778,478.77,"--I believe that's what they did because they just simply said this was not a... we had disbanded the class or we have upheld the District Court's feeling to that extent, and, but it really wasn't analyzed at all nor, of course, would they allow us to analyze it under the disparate impact."
1987.86-6139,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,482.705,486.674,"Suppose the Court had allowed you, what would you have done?"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,486.674,492.538,"--Well, of course, we attempted in the District Court to prove it."
1987.86-6139,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,500.135,501.515,"Well, what would you have done?"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,508.971,509.432,"Oh, okay."
1987.86-6139,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,511.672,514.063,What would you have said?
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,514.063,519.027,"--Maybe I'm not understanding your question, Justice White, but I--"
1987.86-6139,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,519.027,521.77,"Well, how would you... how could you have won the case?"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,521.77,529.954,"--Oh, Well, I think it would have then been up to the employer to come forward and justify on business necessity their practices, which they didn't do."
1987.86-6139,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,535.788,542.163,"So that in disparate impact case, you really don't need to prove intent, do you?"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,542.163,542.551,"No, no."
1987.86-6139,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,543.592,547.847,"And in disparate treatment, you do?"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,547.847,548.515,That's correct.
1987.86-6139,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,555.491,569.939,"In the disparate impact, is the bottom line, nevertheless, intent in the sense that the employer must justify as in Griggs or what do you conclude, intent or--"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,569.939,571.882,I don't believe they have to prove intent.
1987.86-6139,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,575.833,581.206,"--But under a pattern and practice case, you don't directly prove intent."
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,588.202,589.173,Could infer intent.
1987.86-6139,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,589.173,589.744,Right?
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,589.744,590.113,That's correct.
1987.86-6139,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,590.113,596.798,"And in actuality, the proof is much the same from the plaintiff's side, isn't it?"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,596.798,609.085,"Well, I think proof can be used both ways, but I think the disparate impact probably hones in more on the group discrimination, whereas, you know,--"
1987.86-6139,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,609.085,624.135,"My impression is that the plaintiff's initial proof would be exactly the same and what you might be quibbling about is what the defendant's burden then is under the two types, and I guess we haven't spoken to that, really."
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,624.135,624.526,--No.
1987.86-6139,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,652.004,656.057,And he justifies it by showing job-related.
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,656.057,656.886,That's correct.
1987.86-6139,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,656.886,660.47,"So, he doesn't rebut any notion of intent directly."
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,660.47,662.022,"No, no."
1987.86-6139,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,666.504,673.599,"Or he could show, as I understand it, that even if there is an impact, there is a job-related reason for giving it."
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,673.599,674.2,--That's right.
1987.86-6139,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,683.225,693.761,"And if he fails to do that, he's liable not because he intends anything, but because as the law is interpreted, intended to give relief--"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,693.761,695.342,That's right.
1987.86-6139,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,695.342,696.524,"--Griggs, I guess."
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,696.524,697.535,"That's Griggs, Your Honor."
1987.86-6139,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,714.747,730.207,"Mr. Brender, may I just... I'm not entirely clear on what you think the employer has to show in a case in which the practice being challenged is the practice of using subjective discretionary approach by the supervisors at each branch office."
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,741.474,743.504,"Justice Stevens, I think he can do it several ways."
1987.86-6139,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,764.949,775.705,"--By that, do you mean you validate each factor that the local manager uses or validate the practice of using multi-factor discretion?"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,776.936,790.595,"--I think one problem with the facts of this case is that the subjective... I don't know whether it's subjective process being used, but there was really no criteria that was out there for which the supervisors were supposed to make decisions."
1987.86-6139,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,807.977,818.672,"The people who were familiar with the employees in the best position to make a judgment as to which would be the best supervisor, and there's really no way to prove that that's a necessary way to hire people, is it?"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,818.672,823.076,"--Well, I think there is, but I think you could also validate it."
1987.86-6139,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,865.825,871.957,"It seems to me you're saying don't do it on a subjective basis, that you must have a series of objective criteria that can be reviewed."
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,871.957,874.33,"--Only to validate, only to validate."
1987.86-6139,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,898.586,900.768,"And if you find they made a few mistakes, why, then, you're in trouble."
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,900.768,909.073,"--If you made some mistakes, you're going to have to either find an alternative process or put in some criteria in this case that would--"
1987.86-6139,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,909.073,911.925,And these are all by hypotheses innocent mistakes?
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,913.915,914.896,--There wouldn't have to be.
1987.86-6139,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,914.896,919.038,"Well, I mean, if you can prove racial animus, you don't need any of this theory."
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,919.038,924.313,"Well, if you don't... as I see disparate impact, you could have racial animus."
1987.86-6139,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,928.485,941.824,"Mr. Brender, the sort of system that you suggest for validating in response to Justice Stevens' question may be find for a company like the Fort Worth Bank and Trust Company that has a number of employees."
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,949.428,950.64,"First of all,--"
1987.86-6139,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,950.64,952.5,"What is it, fifteen people or twenty people?"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,952.5,965.47,"--First of all, Your Honor, I think the thing we've got to realize is that you have to be able to show impact first, and I do think in smaller employers, it's going to be difficult to show an impact simply because of the number of decisions would not be sufficient to show statistically that there's an impact."
1987.86-6139,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,970.573,978.096,"What would a small employer of twenty people, how could he validate, you know, that sort of subjective system that I think most of those employers probably use?"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,978.096,981.789,"--I think, first of all, there are the transportability provisions to the guidelines."
1987.86-6139,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,990.094,994.559,But even an employer of twenty people would have to go to studies and that sort of thing.
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,994.559,997.31,"Only if, only if they have a disparate impact."
1987.86-6139,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,997.31,1003.675,"Of course, he doesn't know at any given time whether his practices may be shown to have a disparate impact or not."
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,1005.465,1022.445,"Well, it doesn't depend on intent, but he is under the guidelines required to be looking at his practices and aware of his practices under the provisions of self-help provisions of the guidelines, where an employer is encouraged to try to eliminate racial bias or racial effects in his employment practices."
1987.86-6139,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1022.445,1041.489,"Well, Mr. Brender, isn't there something short of this so-called validation that would suffice to determine or establish that a particular employer's system of evaluating or promoting employees is generally fair and uniformly applied?"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,1046.652,1064.283,"There is, and we have cited some of those cases in our reply brief, where courts have simply held that on different sorts of things, one of them that comes to mind is the Zahorik v. Cornell University, where their process of assessing people for tenure was found to be... to satisfy business necessity."
1987.86-6139,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1064.283,1084.997,"I mean, you would concede, I suppose, that for supervisory and managerial positions, it probably isn't possible to always use subjective standards in hiring, that there will almost always be a subjective component in hiring and promotional decisions for that kind of job."
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,1084.997,1086.9,"Well, I think there's--"
1987.86-6139,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1086.9,1087.348,Isn't that right?
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,1087.348,1088.069,--I think that's true.
1987.86-6139,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1155.374,1167.162,"Well, it must go without saying that a strict validation procedure would, indeed, be very costly, and, so, we need to look at this body of case law out there to see what else might--"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,1167.162,1170.413,"--Well, I think that body of case law can he helpful."
1987.86-6139,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1281.155,1285.818,"--May I ask what... we're talking about individual claims here, not class claims, aren't we?"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,1285.818,1286.689,That's correct.
1987.86-6139,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1286.689,1300.948,"Does that mean that every individual... say we accept your theory, does that mean that every individual who is a minority person who sought promotion or sought a higher wage during the period in issue would be entitled to recover?"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,1300.948,1304.961,"I don't believe so, Justice Stevens."
1987.86-6139,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1304.961,1308.684,How do you screen out those that do win and those that don't win?
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,1308.684,1316.769,"Well, what... as I understand it, I think this is what the Court said in Connecticut v. Teale, disparate impact is simply inference."
1987.86-6139,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1326.625,1328.618,"Well, but they're all injured if they all applied."
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,1328.618,1337.504,"I agree, but if it's not a class action, I don't believe, unless they came in and applied within the 180 days and fulfilled the other agreements, that they would be eligible for any relief."
1987.86-6139,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1337.504,1347.378,It seems to me each one would be equally entitled to relief under your theory because there's an absence of intent or any... I may not quite get the understanding here.
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,1347.378,1351.721,"I think that if they were in the case, but what I'm saying is the statistical proof would not put them in the case."
1987.86-6139,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1351.721,1356.085,"Why not, if they're a member of the group to which the statistics apply?"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,1363.479,1368.582,"Well, if there was a class action, they could certainly come in and show they were members of the class."
1987.86-6139,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1368.582,1369.043,Right.
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,1386.884,1392.307,"Well, I don't think the proof necessarily says they would all prevail because they couldn't all get the one job."
1987.86-6139,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1393.639,1395.179,How do you decide which would have gotten it?
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,1395.74,1403.605,"--Well, all you're showing is that the decision-making was based on an impermissible racial component."
1987.86-6139,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1407.818,1422.999,"I thought they were showing that the permissible factors that were used involving discretion had the unfortunate consequence, unintended, of ending up with either getting many more males than you should have or many more females than you should have."
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,1422.999,1423.62,--That's correct.
1987.86-6139,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1423.62,1426.889,"And whichever way it goes, it seems to me the employer--"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,1426.889,1430.072,That wouldn't mean every applicant would then be entitled to the job.
1987.86-6139,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1430.072,1432.295,--But how do you decide which ones are and which are not?
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,1432.295,1433.214,I think--
1987.86-6139,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1433.214,1435.527,Each case would have discretionary decision.
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,1435.527,1438.159,"--That's right, but I think that applies in class actions, too."
1987.86-6139,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1451.957,1471.849,"Well, very frankly, what's running through my mind, I hire a lot of law clerks, and I do it on a discretionary basis, and I suppose statistically I either discriminate against men or women, just to take a simple case, and say all the male applicants who applied and I turned down come in and say, well, statistically, you've got a disproportionate number of women clerks, and I say I guess I have, but I just kind of pick them as they come."
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,1476.043,1491.922,"--Well, if you were shown to have a disparate impact because you greatly were favoring one group over another in your hiring practices, and then the question is what individual out of that group would then prevail--"
1987.86-6139,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1491.922,1494.125,--And there are a lot of them who are qualified that were turned down.
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,1494.125,1497.936,"--Well, the only one... okay."
1987.86-6139,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1500.898,1501.619,Right.
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,1501.619,1505.452,"If that's the case, then the Court is simply... it's a matter of damages, as I see it."
1987.86-6139,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1505.923,1507.292,"Well, why?"
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,1518.86,1521.371,--They would have--
1987.86-6139,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1521.371,1522.112,Do you think just one would?
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,1522.112,1523.053,--I think... yeah.
1987.86-6139,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1526.116,1528.567,What good is the cause of action without relief?
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,1530.337,1532.37,"By that, I don't mean they would not have total relief."
1987.86-6139,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1554.243,1560.066,"Anyway, I suppose your answer to all this is if this is a problem, it's not a problem you're creating, this must be a problem under Griggs, too."
1987.86-6139,0,15621,art_brender,,1560.066,1564.16,"Well, I think it would be a problem under intentional discrimination, too."
1987.86-6139,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1616.755,1618.097,"Thank you, Mr. Brender."
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,1619.656,1625.142,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-6139,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1656.281,1657.813,Did not prevail on discrimination.
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,1657.813,1659.072,"--That is correct, Justice White."
1987.86-6139,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1672.712,1682.327,"Mr. McGee, did the trial court consider the statistical evidence in the disparate treatment claim?"
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,1682.327,1684.299,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor, it did."
1987.86-6139,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1684.959,1688.311,And held that it didn't raise any inference?
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,1688.311,1712.047,"--They considered it both in whether or not it raised the prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas and then whether or not it had been used to show, by the Petitioner to show that the articulated reasons by the bank were a pretext and they found that the District Court considered those fully or at least there was no suggestion that it did not, and concluded that the statistics had been given full weight by the trial court."
1987.86-6139,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1757.587,1758.418,What was that?
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,1758.418,1763.541,--They described four different reasons for the non-selection.
1987.86-6139,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1850.81,1857.154,"Well, Mr. McGee, it seems to me the initial proof would be the same under the statistics, under either theory."
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,1857.154,1859.746,The initial proof would--
1987.86-6139,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1859.746,1866.592,The initial proof by the Plaintiff and apparently there was enough to make out a prima facie case of disparate treatment here.
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,1866.592,1868.021,"--That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-6139,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1868.021,1872.863,And I assume the exact same proof would be offered and considered under disparate impact.
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,1872.863,1876.575,I know of nothing that could be offered at trial that would be any different.
1987.86-6139,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1879.267,1879.728,Right.
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,1883.181,1883.822,--That is correct.
1987.86-6139,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1890.945,1895.429,And what do you think the difference is in the Defendant's burden under the two?
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,1895.429,1897.63,"Well, with this particular case,--"
1987.86-6139,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1897.63,1899.44,And do you think this Court has spoken to that?
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,1899.44,1901.263,"--No, I do not."
1987.86-6139,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1923.927,1929.5,"Well, I don't think it's established that there is a need to prove validation, is there?"
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,1938.115,1951.556,"--As I read Griggs and those that follow, there is a requirement that the Petitioner or that the Plaintiff point out a specific facially-neutral arbitrary-type of standard or requirement that causes the impacts complained of."
1987.86-6139,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2012.564,2013.436,"Well, not necessarily."
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,2038.11,2039.722,--That is correct.
1987.86-6139,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2039.722,2050.95,"Whereas, under your theory, this bank would be entirely entitled to put the wrong people in the position, so long as they didn't pick the wrong people because of racial animus or sex animus."
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,2050.95,2057.024,"Obviously, errors can occur and we would submit that we have the right to make those errors."
1987.86-6139,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2057.024,2065.99,"You're not asserting that you established below or that the Court thought you established below that, in fact, your system's a good one, that you're picking the best people?"
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,2073.584,2074.546,That's correct.
1987.86-6139,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2083.491,2087.314,Let me just go on further.
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,2117.893,2129.64,"--Well, the difference is, Justice Stevens, that with the facially-neutral objective requirements, there is a uniform or automatic disqualification of certain people."
1987.86-6139,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2161.823,2169.958,What if it goes on for ten years and you just get hundreds and hundreds of black applicants turned down and you never hire anybody but white; would you say the same thing?
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,2169.958,2174.701,This Court has provided an adequate method for challenging that type of result.
1987.86-6139,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2383.857,2391.564,"Mr. McGee, I'm not sure that validation of an objective test is a very simple operation either."
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,2445.537,2456.846,"I think because while validation of objective testing devices may be hard, it has been demonstrated that it can be done."
1987.86-6139,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2481.5,2502.305,"The fact is that it's doable for an objective test, but the cost of doing it is usually more than the cost of simply adopting a relatively balanced work force, and it's my impression that that's the way most employers meet the problem, and if that's the case, then I see no difference between their situation and your client's."
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,2502.305,2512.713,"Well, I am not familiar with what other employers do and whether that is how they respond to the question, but there's no question in my mind that that's what I would have to recommend to my client."
1987.86-6139,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2773.05,2784.56,What is the EEOC's view?
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,2784.56,2787.292,The EEOC views the case exactly the same way I do.
1987.86-6139,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2790.253,2792.495,Have they always had that view?
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,2792.495,2794.015,"--No, Justice White."
1987.86-6139,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2803.151,2810.526,"Well, what was its view immediately before the present view?"
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,2810.526,2817.429,Let me see if I can go back in time.
1987.86-6139,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2818.491,2819.532,"Well, it shouldn't be too long."
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,2819.532,2846.481,"--In 1978, when the uniform guidelines were adopted, they had the view that subjective selection processes, such as present here, might not be verifiable or validateable and, therefore, need only be validated under the federal law, which comments to the uniform guidelines suggest would be under the disparate treatment theory as announced in McDonnell Douglas."
1987.86-6139,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2857.196,2857.977,Including subjective?
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,2857.977,2858.987,Objective and subjective.
1987.86-6139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2914.733,2919.458,"By your own figures, how many employees are there involved in the whole bank?"
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,2919.458,2921.538,--How many employees are involved in the whole bank?
1987.86-6139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2921.538,2922.279,Yes.
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,2922.279,2924.591,There are approximately eighty employees.
1987.86-6139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2924.591,2927.252,And how many are those are Negroes?
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,2927.252,2929.255,Approximately nine or ten.
1987.86-6139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2929.255,2934.227,And one's a cook and one's a janitor.
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,2934.868,2940.181,"There are no employees that I'm aware of in those positions any longer, Justice Marshall."
1987.86-6139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2940.181,2942.582,I thought one Negro was in the cafeteria.
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,2942.582,2946.926,The bank does not have a cafeteria at this time nor did it have at the time of the trial.
1987.86-6139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2947.695,2950.577,What jobs do the nine have?
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,2950.577,2961.585,"--There is one employee, I believe, that has the position that you're referring to, it's not a... they do not have a cafeteria, but there's someone in a position that's similar to what you have described."
1987.86-6139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2968.228,2968.639,Like what?
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,2971.871,2973.921,--There are approximately four.
1987.86-6139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2975.183,2975.874,Four?
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,2975.874,2976.365,Yes.
1987.86-6139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2976.365,2977.544,Out of how many?
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,2977.544,2978.456,Out of eight.
1987.86-6139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2978.456,2981.548,"So, only half of them are Negroes."
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,2981.548,2982.747,That's correct.
1987.86-6139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2985.969,2987.682,That was what I asked.
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,2987.682,2988.123,--Yes.
1987.86-6139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2992.335,2994.615,You mean they're tellers?
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,2994.615,3001.571,"Some are tellers, some are customer service personnel, but they all function in the same area of the bank."
1987.86-6139,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3001.571,3011.599,"You know, one time I had a case where they reported that they had a Negro employed as a telephonic expert."
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,3017.261,3019.713,I don't think that's what we have here.
1987.86-6139,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3107.309,3108.711,"Actually, that's a bad example."
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,3122.61,3125.472,That's important.
1987.86-6139,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3125.472,3127.452,We won't quote you.
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,3127.452,3139.69,McDonnell Douglas makes clear and Burdine makes clear that the law does not require that the employer have the best or the most balanced work force.
1987.86-6139,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3156.693,3160.487,"But when you say he was not a discriminator, what you mean is he did not intentionally discriminate?"
1987.86-6139,1,17861,bruce_w_mcgee,,3172.665,3182.491,"--Well, I agree that that is the problem with this case, but this case differs from those, such as Griggs, where you're dealing with non-intent."
1987.86-6139,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3203.994,3205.186,"Thank you, Mr. McGee."
1987.86-6139,2,15621,art_brender,,3207.088,3208.168,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-6139,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3262.935,3293.696,"Well, the Solicitor General, speaking on behalf of the EEOC and the United States, said that the subjective methods must be justified, need only be shown that the selection procedure is reasonably related to the requirements of the job or other business needs, and has been applied in a non-pretextural fashion."
1987.86-6139,2,15621,art_brender,,3296.668,3297.417,I know.
1987.86-6139,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3298.509,3299.841,Let me just ask you.
1987.86-6139,2,15621,art_brender,,3310.086,3310.827,--No.
1987.86-6139,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3311.916,3313.308,Or found or applied by--
1987.86-6139,2,15621,art_brender,,3313.308,3313.718,--No.
1987.86-6139,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3328.98,3337.004,"--What I'm trying to find out, if that's the test... was that the test that was applied in this case by the courts below or not?"
1987.86-6139,2,15621,art_brender,,3337.004,3337.405,--No.
1987.86-6139,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3354.756,3356.268,"Thank you, Mr. Brender."
1987.86-6139,2,15621,art_brender,,3357.313,3358.359,"Thank you, Your Honor."
