1983.82-2056,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.141,We will hear arguments first this morning in Escondido Mutual Water Company against LaJolla.
1983.82-2056,0,37853,paul_d_engstrand,,19.186,50.515,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, it is an honor today for us to share our time with Solicitor Feit of the Commission, who will explain why Section 4(e) of the Federal Power Act does not give the Secretaries authority to veto licensing decisions of the Commission by imposing unreasonable conditions."
1983.82-2056,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,699.852,712.468,Mr. Feit.
1983.82-2056,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,712.468,724.536,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, as has been stated, this case involves the reach and scope of the proviso, the licensing proviso in Section 4(e) of the Federal Power Act."
1983.82-2056,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1004.11,1012.536,"Mr. Feit, what effect would such a recognition have on the water rights litigation that is pending in the District Court?"
1983.82-2056,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1012.536,1014.987,--A recognition of the reserve interest rights?
1983.82-2056,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1445.357,1447.749,"Mr. Feit, you haven't said much about the statutory language."
1983.82-2056,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1456.444,1458.588,"Yes, I will turn to that right now, Your Honor."
1983.82-2056,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1466.692,1468.222,"It doesn't even have the word ""reasonable"" in it."
1983.82-2056,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1468.222,1474.106,"--They didn't put the word ""reasonable"" in, but I think it was implicit in the situation in which the statute was enacted."
1983.82-2056,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1532.485,1533.975,May I ask this question?
1983.82-2056,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1533.975,1534.486,Sir.
1983.82-2056,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1534.486,1541.071,One of the briefs suggests that Section 15 of the Federal Power Act controls with respect to relicensing.
1983.82-2056,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1541.071,1552.488,"That is issue we believe is not properly before the Court in this case, since the Commission specifically treated this license as an original license."
1983.82-2056,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1562.663,1571.669,Mr. Schulder?
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1571.669,1583.797,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to begin my remarks by focusing on the reservation proviso of Section 4(e) of the Power Act."
1983.82-2056,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1649.27,1661.027,"Mr. Schulder, do you still concede that if you are correct, that the conditions imposed by Interior have to be reasonable conditions?"
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1661.027,1662.399,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1983.82-2056,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1662.399,1673.226,And how is the... what is the process for review of the legality of those conditions?
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1691.318,1700.724,"The issue could not go to the Commission to decide, because that would negate the clear intent of Section 4(e)."
1983.82-2056,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1767.958,1774.423,"Well, as a practical matter, how do you see the review taking place, and how mechanically would it work?"
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1774.423,1774.874,Okay.
1983.82-2056,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1789.923,1793.313,"Well, suppose the Commission thinks that they are unreasonable."
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1797.046,1803.952,"Well, the Commission can do one of two things at the licensing stage."
1983.82-2056,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1851.424,1856.296,"The review in the Court of Appeals contemplates some sort of a record having been made somewhere, doesn't it?"
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1867.642,1873.345,"Well, the record, as in this case, would be the same record that was before the Court of Appeals."
1983.82-2056,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1883.964,1884.963,Presented to the Commission?
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1884.963,1887.755,--Presented as part of his case.
1983.82-2056,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1887.755,1888.987,Where?
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1888.987,1892.81,"Well, there are several ways in which this could be done."
1983.82-2056,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1951.558,1958.182,"Well, you are suggesting that all the evidence would be presented to the Commission, but that the Commission can't make a finding on it."
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1967.489,1975.784,"It may be confusing, but the problem here is with... the problem here is not with 4(e)."
1983.82-2056,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1982.49,1984.83,"Well, you do agree there is a problem, don't you, on judicial review?"
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,1984.83,1999.38,"--Well, the Commission under 4(e) has no power to make any finding with respect to the Secretary's conditions, and has no power to alter or modify those conditions, if you look at the language of 4(e) itself."
1983.82-2056,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2021.263,2023.557,But APA review ordinarily goes to the District Court.
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2023.557,2026.315,"It ordinarily does, but it does not in every case, Your Honor."
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2049.332,2062.088,"Mr. Schulder, it seems to me that there is nothing in 4(e) that prevents the Commission from making... giving its opinion as to the reasonableness of the Secretary's or... I thought you said that a while ago--"
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2062.088,2062.96,That's correct.
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2062.96,2064.091,--that they could voice a disagreement.
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2064.091,2065.133,Absolutely.
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2065.133,2072.697,And I would suppose the parties before the Administrative Law Judge could introduce any evidence going to the reasonableness of the Secretary's conditions.
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2072.697,2073.946,I agree with you.
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2073.946,2080.672,"And I would think 4(e) would be satisfied if the Commission said, we have to incorporate these conditions."
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2094.891,2097.933,"Well, that is precisely what Congress intended when--"
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2097.933,2099.145,"Well, you agree with that."
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2099.145,2100.214,--That's correct.
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2100.214,2108.671,So why do you say they have no power to make a finding about... or to... as to reasonableness?
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2108.671,2113.103,"Well, I was just talking in terms of the technical language of the statute."
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2113.103,2122.981,"Well, so you concede that based on the evidence in the record as the Commission reads it, it could say the Secretary is out of his mind."
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2122.981,2123.762,Certainly.
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2123.762,2129.034,And then the Court of Appeals would be in a position to review it.
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2129.034,2139.891,"That's right, and this is precisely, if we look at the legislative history of the Federal Water Power Act prior to its enactment in 1920, this is exactly what Congress had in mind."
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2145.213,2147.474,"So where does that leave us in this case, Mr. Schulder?"
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2147.474,2151.638,--Where does--
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2151.638,2156.771,The Commission didn't include those conditions.
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2157.572,2158.423,--That's right.
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2165.406,2170.111,"And if it does, there would still be left over the reasonableness of those conditions."
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2170.111,2170.702,That's correct.
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2170.702,2175.324,"So we shouldn't reach that issue now, I take it."
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2175.324,2177.455,"Oh, it is absolutely not before the Court at this point, Your Honor."
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2177.455,2180.107,But sooner or later it likely will be.
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2180.107,2181.358,That's correct.
1983.82-2056,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2187.962,2188.503,I understand.
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2204.813,2212.578,"No, Your Honor, because the whole process under 4(e) is a process in which an applicant goes to the Commission requesting the license."
1983.82-2056,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2224.244,2226.258,So it is disagreement with the conditions.
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2233.002,2235.143,Not on its own initiative.
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2236.963,2237.915,The applicant can.
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2237.915,2239.395,That's correct.
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2239.395,2246.24,"If the applicant wants to accept the conditions, of course, that... I suppose there won't be any case left."
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2246.24,2247.322,That's correct.
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2247.322,2251.223,But you would say the Commission could appear in the Court of Appeals.
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2251.223,2252.344,"Oh, certainly."
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2252.344,2253.186,And give its view.
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2253.186,2254.375,Absolutely.
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2254.375,2255.687,And here.
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2255.687,2275.94,"In this regard, I would like to point out that of course Section 4(e) refers not only to reservations within the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior, but also to reservations within the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Defense."
1983.82-2056,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2303.75,2307.248,"Well, but Mr. Schulder, what about the word 4(e)?"
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2316.946,2318.247,--That's correct.
1983.82-2056,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2318.247,2323.601,"You rely on the plain language for part of your argument, but I don't suppose you do for those three reservations."
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2323.601,2331.946,It is not exactly that we don't rely on the plain language.
1983.82-2056,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2375.124,2383.83,"It is your position that the plain language is plain when it helps you, and is ambiguous when it doesn't help you?"
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2384.331,2385.833,"Not exactly, Your Honor."
1983.82-2056,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2385.833,2387.282,Not exactly.
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2389.345,2398.608,"Well, I think that there is a real ambiguity here, because of the broad definition of the term ""reservations"" in the definitional section of the Act."
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2440.196,2447.462,"Mr. Schulder, is there an issue before us as to the power of the tribes to veto?"
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2447.462,2468.657,"Well, the issue about whether Section 8 of the Mission Indian Relief Act has been impliedly repealed by the Federal Power Act is the third issue in the case, and it is our position, as we stated in our brief, that it has not been repealed by the Federal Power Act."
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2468.657,2472.277,"And if it hasn't been, what is the authority of the tribe?"
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2472.277,2488.678,"If it has not been, than any water conveyance facility that will be going across a reservation land must be approved by the bands before that facility can be operated."
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2488.678,2498.684,"Well, if you are right in that regard, does that render the rest of the case almost beside the point?"
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2498.684,2501.656,"It might as a practical matter, Your Honor."
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2501.656,2502.517,It might?
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2505.289,2514.895,"Well, they could state that they do not agree to the canal going across their reservations."
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2516.645,2520.228,You mean to the extent it is going to be changed?
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2523.651,2532.117,"--That's correct, but to the extent that it is going to continue in operation, and also to the extent that it may be changed in the future."
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2532.117,2538.031,So you treat this as a new licensing.
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2538.031,2539.182,That's correct.
1983.82-2056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2543.624,2547.898,"So that if the tribes have a veto, why, the case is really over."
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2547.898,2549.468,That's correct.
1983.82-2056,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2551.091,2557.843,"Mr. Schulder, I am a little bothered by the posture of the case that Justice White just adverted to."
1983.82-2056,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2593.105,2598.781,"Well, we believe that it is, because every applicant at the relicensing stage is at an equal level."
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2641.33,2648.463,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to begin by addressing a few of the issues that were raised previously."
1983.82-2056,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2702.179,2705.281,"Is that in one of the briefs, the section you are quoting from?"
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2705.281,2706.693,--Is the--
1983.82-2056,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2706.693,2710.564,"What you are just reading, is it in one of the briefs where one could find it?"
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2710.564,2714.257,"--I think I have a footnote on my brief on that, Your Honor."
1983.82-2056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2715.419,2717.999,What section are you quoting from?
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2717.999,2719.79,--I am quoting Section 15(a).
1983.82-2056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2722.371,2723.904,Of what Act?
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2723.904,2724.905,It is in the... I'm sorry.
1983.82-2056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2726.395,2727.827,What Act are you--
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2727.827,2729.327,Of the Federal Power Act.
1983.82-2056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2731.298,2732.389,--Thank you.
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2732.389,2755.804,"And this is the relicensing provision, and I don't understand why there's a controversy about whether this is an original licensing or a relicensing, because the relicensing provision specifically says that the Commission can issue either a new license or an original license under the then existing laws and regulations, and obviously the reservation proviso is an existing law."
1983.82-2056,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2839.8,2844.282,And it would have no effect on the pending water rights litigation?
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2844.282,2861.473,"That's right, unless the petitioners... it would not affect the existing water rights dispute unless the petitioners were not able to utilize their water right, in which case the dispute would not be resolved, but would become moot essentially."
1983.82-2056,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2929.728,2933.421,"You are not challenging, are you, Mr. Pelcyger, the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission--"
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2933.421,2934.052,"--No, we do not--"
1983.82-2056,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2934.052,2937.615,--because of the thin reed that the power thing is hinged?
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2937.615,2939.605,--We did not cross-petition on that ground.
1983.82-2056,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2963.18,2965.331,"Well, I don't think there is any halfway house."
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2973.859,2990.558,"I agree with that, but the question of whether it overrides the Mission Indian Relief Act may turn in part of whether this case is really a power project, in which case it would come squarely within the Federal Power Act, or whether it is really a water diversion project, and that is its principal effect."
1983.82-2056,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2990.558,3003.125,"Do you say then if it were 60 percent power and 40 percent water diversion, which I take it this is not, the bands would have a weaker case?"
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3003.125,3022.72,"To put that issue in context, our first position is that the provision of the Mission Indian Relief Act must be given effect because the reservation proviso specifically protects against interference the purposes of Indian reservations."
1983.82-2056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3092.296,3104.375,What business does the Commission have or what authority does it have over a straight water diversion project?
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3105.136,3106.215,That's correct.
1983.82-2056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3108.516,3109.618,I understand.
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3109.618,3111.929,--midsized power plants.
1983.82-2056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3111.929,3124.919,But wasn't one of the power plants built and isn't it run by water taken out of a reservoir by a canal?
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3124.919,3126.838,"Both of them are, yes."
1983.82-2056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3130.481,3134.155,And the canal takes water for metropolitan use.
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3134.155,3135.084,"No, this is--"
1983.82-2056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3135.084,3137.087,Just a straight power--
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3137.087,3139.467,"--Well... Oh, I'm sorry."
1983.82-2056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3140.759,3141.408,--Yes.
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3141.408,3141.778,Yes.
1983.82-2056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3141.778,3143.26,Down to Escondido?
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3143.26,3144.941,"Yes, and to Vista."
1983.82-2056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3144.941,3158.261,"And do you say that that project is at risk now too, that... just the metropolitan water use?"
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3158.261,3162.953,The canal that crosses the reservations.
1983.82-2056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3180.434,3185.216,And this is wholly aside from whether it is a power project or not.
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3185.216,3201.809,"--Yes, although as I explained to Justice Rehnquist, I think that the incidental nature of the power aspect can come into play if the Court concludes that under certain circumstances if this were a true honest to goodness power project, Indian consent would be overridden by the Act."
1983.82-2056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3235.532,3242.965,"Was the original 50-year license for the water project at that time tied up with the power project too, or wasn't it?"
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3242.965,3244.485,Yes.
1983.82-2056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3253.24,3254.842,"Well, this was long before the Federal Power Act."
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3254.842,3257.594,"--Yes, that's right."
1983.82-2056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3257.594,3263.278,And so from whom did the easement for right-of-way run?
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3263.278,3266.01,"Well, there are a combination of those sources."
1983.82-2056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3275.326,3277.117,For both the power and the water?
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3277.117,3278.529,"No, at that time there was no power."
1983.82-2056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3278.529,3279.13,Just water?
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3279.13,3280.569,Just water.
1983.82-2056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3300.722,3303.276,They might also strike a deal with the tribe.
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3303.276,3303.864,That's right.
1983.82-2056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3303.864,3305.396,They just might have to pay a little more money.
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3305.396,3330.591,"That's absolutely right, and the issue here is that the San Luis Rey River supply is somewhat cheaper than the alternate supply that is imported through the Metropolitan Water District, but there is no evidence in this record to indicate that the welfare or the economies of these areas would be adversely affected in the slightest bit if they had to obtain all of their water from the alternate source where they are now obtaining most of their water."
1983.82-2056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3330.591,3333.793,Through how many reservations does the canal go?
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3333.793,3334.434,Three.
1983.82-2056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3334.434,3335.874,Three.
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3335.874,3342.439,And the project diverts waters away from six reservations... six Indian reservations.
1983.82-2056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3342.439,3353.746,And how... what's the total mileage of the canal as it runs through the reservations?
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3354.528,3358.671,Those figures are... I don't have them immediately available.
1983.82-2056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3410.793,3420.761,"Of course, even if you are wrong on that, if the Secretary happens to be right on his side of the case, he will have the authority to put all the conditions in he wants to."
1983.82-2056,3,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,3420.761,3422.021,--That's correct.
1983.82-2056,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3605.522,3609.685,Do you have anything further?
1983.82-2056,4,37853,paul_d_engstrand,,3609.685,3618.16,"Your Honor, if I may on this question of water rights, the reason the land needs to be protected is because of a physical imposition on the land."
1983.82-2056,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3670.414,3679.079,"Well, I take it the United States agrees the Secretary's conditions must be reasonable."
1983.82-2056,4,37853,paul_d_engstrand,,3679.079,3681.272,"--Yes, Your Honor, and I--"
1983.82-2056,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3681.272,3683.965,And that even the Commission may say what it thinks about his conditions.
1983.82-2056,4,37853,paul_d_engstrand,,3685.113,3685.924,--Yes.
1983.82-2056,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3717.083,3719.226,"Thank you, counsel."
