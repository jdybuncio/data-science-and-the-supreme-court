2016.15-1500,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.02,We'll hear argument next this morning in case 15-1500 Lewis v. Clarke. Mr. Miller.
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,7.02,16.83,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In an individual capacity action against a government employee, the plaintiff seeks relief from the employee personally."
2016.15-1500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,59.46,66.1,"They say it's the same as if it were federal employee, then you would have the Westfall Act."
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,84.92,112.75,"Well, and when a claim arises, you know, within the reservation that is subject to the tribe's legislative and adjudicatory jurisdiction, then the tribe has the authority to define how that claim shall be handled. But here, we're talking about a claim that arose under Connecticut law from an accident on a Connecticut highway not on the reservation, and the tribe does not have the authority to define the process for handling that claim."
2016.15-1500,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,162.25,176.59,"There is one flaw there. Under our decision in Hyatt, Clarke would have been entitled to the immunity that Connecticut gave its own officials."
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,176.59,181.78,"Well, there are a couple of antecedent questions there, Your Honor."
2016.15-1500,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,181.78,182.72,I agree.
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,182.72,186.66,"So, one, Hyatt is about the full faith and credit clause, which applies --"
2016.15-1500,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,186.66,187.16,Hyatt does not --
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,187.16,188.3,-- only to states and not -- not tribes.
2016.15-1500,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,188.3,189.26,-- the tribes.
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,189.26,195.84,Hyatt is also about an action against a state agency and not an individual capacity action against a state employee.
2016.15-1500,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,195.84,198.73,You're absolutely true. We haven't extended Hyatt that far yet.
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,198.73,229.09,"But even granting both of those extensions of the decision, the rule in -- in Hyatt is that the State cannot treat another state worse than it would treat itself. So if you applied the analogy here, you would say that Connecticut has a regime in which an action against a state employee is barred, but instead you sue the state directly. So applying that here, you would say, well, we can't sue Mr. Clarke, so instead we get to sue the tribe."
2016.15-1500,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,262.03,273.11,"Well, just -- just so I understand the case: If this plaintiff had elected to sue in the tribal court, the rule would have been that there is indemnity from the tribe."
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,279.69,281.13,"The -- the tribe -- yeah, yes."
2016.15-1500,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,281.13,282.64,"I mean, we can take the case on that assumption."
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,282.64,282.86,Yes.
2016.15-1500,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,298.11,302.955,"Well, very limited though; right? I mean, there's a significant cap on punitive damages."
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,302.955,305.74,"Well, that's -- but punitive damages are not available at all."
2016.15-1500,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,331.77,353.8,"When -- when there is a suit against an entity like the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the question is whether that is really a -- a suit -- whether that is a suit against one of the states and, therefore, subject to sovereign immunity, we would look to see who would pay the judgment."
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,362.98,377.45,"When -- when you have a state-created agency like -- like the Port Authority, the Court looks at a number of factors to assess whether that agency should be treated as essentially the State or as some distinct entity, and you're right."
2016.15-1500,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,389.42,394.545,"Well, why shouldn't we? I mean, you suggest the difference is because this is a voluntary agreement."
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,401.895,407.595,"Well, there -- a couple of -- that would be inconsistent with a number of decisions."
2016.15-1500,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,407.595,409.17,"I -- I think you're right, Mr. Miller."
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,415.17,425.33,"Well, for one thing, it's not a sensible rule because as a -- immunity is a question that ought to be decided, as this Court has said many times, at the threshold of a litigation."
2016.15-1500,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,465.82,475.12,So those kinds of considerations haven't prevented us from looking to who's ultimately going to pay the bills in the kinds of cases that Justice Alito was talking about.
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,475.12,498.755,"Well, when -- when you're talking about a -- a sort of state-created entity, you know, but the State is itself an artificial legal construct and so there has to be some test for figuring out, you know, whether some other artificial legal construct is a different entity or the same entity. But that's just not how we think about it with real-live people who are not the State."
2016.15-1500,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,595.22,602.98,Could a State give greater immunity to an Indian tribe than is available under Federal law?
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,602.98,608.635,"As a matter of State law, yes, a State could choose to do that."
2016.15-1500,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,610.555,615.085,So the Connecticut supreme court could do that if it wanted to?
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,615.085,616.09,Yes.
2016.15-1500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,631.475,645.44,"Suppose this -- the driver of the vehicle was not working for the -- for an Indian tribe, but instead was an employee of a foreign embassy."
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,652.905,660.955,"No, Your Honor, it would not. So a -- a suit against -- if you're saying a suit against the individual employee --"
2016.15-1500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,660.955,661.33,Yes.
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,661.33,672.025,"-- who was driving a car, our -- the -- the test set out in -- in the second restatement is that that would not be barred by official immunity."
2016.15-1500,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,717.06,728.395,"Is it always the case that the plaintiff simply gets to choose whether it wants to proceed in an individual capacity or in an official capacity, or are there constraints at all on that choice?"
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,728.395,735.36,"The -- well, the constraints are that in certain circumstances an official capacity suit is going to be barred by sovereign immunity, but --"
2016.15-1500,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,735.36,735.765,"No, right."
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,736.2,743.685,"In framing -- in framing the complaint, it's up to the plaintiff to decide what relief he or she wants to seek and from whom."
2016.15-1500,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,747.7,762.7,"What about an Edelman v. Jordan type situation? I mean, if you name the individual who's in charge of disbursing the funds of the tribe and pursue -- proceed just against the individual, it's still going to be regarded as a suit against the sovereign."
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,762.7,788.01,"Well, that's because in -- in Edelman -- I guess the -- the -- the fuller answer to the question would be that the plaintiff gets to choose, but the way they choose is by the relief that they're seeking, not just the label that they attach. So in -- in Edelman, I mean, whatever the plaintiff may have chosen to call that, the action -- the -- the relief that was sought was the payment of welfare benefits or disability benefits."
2016.15-1500,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,830.17,831.42,Do you think the official --
2016.15-1500,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,831.42,851.205,"Recognizing the broader description of the remedy-sought analysis contained in Maxwell, that if the suit is seeking not just public funds but affects the public administration or requires the tribe to do something, it's still --"
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,851.205,852.88,Yes.
2016.15-1500,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,882.275,885.02,What -- what do you think -- maybe you're going to get to this.
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,889.195,906.28,"Well, the -- the first thing we think about that is that it is not before the Court. The question presented as stated both in the petition and in Respondent's brief in our position referred only to sovereign immunity. The only issue that was addressed below was sovereign immunity."
2016.15-1500,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,929.865,932.2,So you think it was waived. Was that argument? Waived.
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,932.2,936.3,We -- we do at least for purposes of -- of this appeal.
2016.15-1500,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,999.27,1013.565,"I suppose that's correct. And I was going to ask you, you responded to an earlier question and -- and indicated that the State could expand the immunity of the Indian tribe."
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1023.215,1024.15,That's -- yes.
2016.15-1500,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1026.21,1027.9,Or am I right about that? We don't need to address it.
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1027.9,1029.85,You don't need -- the State has not tried to do that.
2016.15-1500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1031.75,1037.35,It was a suggestion in the government's brief that Connecticut might afford some kind of comity.
2016.15-1500,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1037.35,1038.49,Yes.
2016.15-1500,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1069.365,1082.31,"Thank you, Mr. Miller. Ms. O'Connell."
2016.15-1500,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1082.31,1108.265,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioners' suit is a personal-capacity suit against an individual tribal employee, and the tribe sovereign immunity is therefore not implicated. The Connecticut supreme court reached the opposite conclusion by holding that a tribe's sovereign immunity extends to any of its employees acting within the scope of his employment, even if the plaintiff seeks damages against that employee personally."
2016.15-1500,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1143.24,1145.15,Did we reach that question?
2016.15-1500,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1145.15,1148.35,We don't think the Court should reach the question in this case.
2016.15-1500,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1190.31,1190.765,I'm sorry.
2016.15-1500,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1198.49,1198.97,Well --
2016.15-1500,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1198.97,1220.365,"Because you're basically announcing a rule that in individual-capacity suits, sovereign immunity is not implicated unless the remedy sought implicates the tribe directly. What else could we write that would preclude official immunity?"
2016.15-1500,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1220.365,1235.915,"Well, I think, Justice Sotomayor, these -- as you can tell from the Connecticut supreme court's decision in this case and the cases cited therein, these two concepts often confused or conflated with one another in lower courts."
2016.15-1500,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1249.87,1256.48,"Do you think that might have happened here in the court below, in the Connecticut courts, that those two concepts were confused?"
2016.15-1500,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1256.48,1264.57,"The Connecticut supreme court, we think, when you read the opinion, they've definitely decided this case as a matter of tribal sovereign immunity."
2016.15-1500,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1309.725,1334.93,"Now, on the facts of this case, is there any argument in favor of official immunity? Mr. Clarke is not a member of the tribe. He's driving a limo on I-95 transporting gamblers and he rear-ends Mr. Lewis, who is not a member of the tribe. You think there's any argument in favor of sovereign immunity for Mr. Clarke under the facts of this case?"
2016.15-1500,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1334.93,1342.55,"For official immunity, based on the facts as you've described them and as I understand them, no."
2016.15-1500,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1385.23,1401.17,"Well, Mr. Clarke is arguing that if you're going to go back to the common law official immunity doctrine, that covered, as our Westfall case indicated, even nondiscretionary acts; that it covered every act."
2016.15-1500,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1403.04,1407.775,Westfall said the opposite. So the -- the case they're looking to is Barr v. Mateo.
2016.15-1500,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1407.775,1408.62,I'm sorry.
2016.15-1500,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1409.56,1418.375,"But in Westfall, the Court said that view of what the Federal common law provided was a mistaken reading of Barr v. Mateo."
2016.15-1500,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1432.36,1440.395,I -- I thought your brief was helpful and quite correct on explaining the bases for sovereign immunity and the difference between official immunity.
2016.15-1500,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1453.675,1454.34,Yes.
2016.15-1500,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1455.71,1457.16,What case do I read to find that?
2016.15-1500,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1457.16,1459.56,It would -- it would be a matter of State law.
2016.15-1500,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1460.27,1462.23,What case can I read to find that?
2016.15-1500,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1462.23,1467.87,I -- I don't know of a case that specifically --
2016.15-1500,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1467.87,1475.42,It seems to me a far-reaching proposition to say that this extent of tribal immunity is a matter of State law.
2016.15-1500,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1475.42,1477.59,It's -- it is a matter of Federal law.
2016.15-1500,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1508.245,1511.9,"Well, I think that's a difficult proposition, but, again, we need not reach it here."
2016.15-1500,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1511.9,1513.01,I think that's correct.
2016.15-1500,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1513.01,1527.17,"Well, one reason it might be a difficult proposition is that the Court has suggested several times that there is some uneasiness with the doctrine of applying sovereign immunity to tribal entities at all. Does the government have a position on that?"
2016.15-1500,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1527.17,1557.93,"The -- well, we think it's -- it's settled at this point that tribal sovereign immunity is a -- is an issue of Federal law, that it applies to commercial activities, including off-reservation commercial activities. The Court suggested in Bay Mills that there may be an exception to tribal sovereign immunity if there were some circumstance in which a -- like, a tort victim or a person with no connection to the tribe, which is the Petitioners here, had no remedy for their injuries because of tribal sovereign immunity."
2016.15-1500,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1621.73,1627.755,Are you then giving a different answer to the one that -- that we just heard?
2016.15-1500,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1627.755,1628.13,Yes.
2016.15-1500,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1628.13,1636.96,I -- I suppose everything was the same except that it was a vehicle belonging to a foreign embassy driven by an employee of that embassy.
2016.15-1500,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1636.96,1637.46,Yes.
2016.15-1500,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1637.46,1639.49,You say that employee would have --
2016.15-1500,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1639.49,1640.54,That's correct.
2016.15-1500,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1662.52,1665.57,And the only suit would be against the sovereign nation itself.
2016.15-1500,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1665.57,1669.73,"That's correct. If there are no further questions, thank you."
2016.15-1500,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1669.73,1676.09,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal."
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1676.09,1684.28,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As Justice Ginsburg noted, the Mohegan tribe is asking for the same protections from suit that every other sovereign enjoys."
2016.15-1500,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1735.805,1746.635,"Well, what would happen in all the 1983 actions or all the Bivens actions if there was an agreement by the government employee -- employer to indemnify the individual?"
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1746.635,1752.83,"Easy, Justice Alito, and that was my friend's answer to that kind of dangerous scenario that would unfold."
2016.15-1500,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1801.595,1804.83,I thought you could sue some -- but I may have it totally wrong.
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1815.995,1817.04,In -- in Georgia --
2016.15-1500,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1817.04,1818.36,Let's take any State.
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1828.31,1829.42,"In general, you cannot."
2016.15-1500,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1830.02,1830.3,You cannot.
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1830.3,1831.35,-- is a very good example.
2016.15-1500,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1832.23,1834.0,You mean you cannot because of the State law.
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1834.0,1834.645,Correct.
2016.15-1500,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1834.645,1836.79,Either they pass a statute or they have a State law.
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1836.79,1837.41,"Correct, correct."
2016.15-1500,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1837.41,1838.04,And so what's the --
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1838.04,1838.19,And so --
2016.15-1500,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1838.19,1845.13,"-- what -- what is our -- our -- we're deciding this as -- as a matter of what? As a matter of the Federal Constitution, aren't we?"
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1845.13,1847.4,"Federal common law, I think, is the best way of understanding --"
2016.15-1500,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1847.4,1850.87,Common law under the Indian tribe being a domestic nation.
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1850.87,1851.23,Correct.
2016.15-1500,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1851.45,1851.67,All right.
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1851.93,1852.28,And so that's --
2016.15-1500,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1852.28,1858.025,So are -- are there states that do allow you to sue somebody who -- who rear-ends you?
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1858.025,1859.89,I'm not aware of any State that does so.
2016.15-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1866.09,1866.58,But wouldn't --
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1866.58,1866.67,And --
2016.15-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1866.67,1873.63,"-- wouldn't that have been the Connecticut law but for its Westfall Act-type -- I mean, the Westfall Act changed it."
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1892.22,1897.57,"You couldn't actually, Justice Ginsburg, because the Federal Drivers Act in 1961 forbade that."
2016.15-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1898.23,1901.39,"Well, let's go back before there was legislation that changed it."
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1901.39,1901.78,Correct.
2016.15-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1901.78,1911.88,"But under the ordinary law, the employee was -- you could sue an -- the employee in a personal capacity."
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1911.88,1914.45,"Certainly before 1959, I think that's right."
2016.15-1500,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1935.85,1936.55,"Well, but that --"
2016.15-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1936.55,1937.095,What did it --
2016.15-1500,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1937.095,1938.7,-- that -- that's a congressional act.
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1947.15,1947.77,Uh-huh.
2016.15-1500,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1947.77,1951.555,"-- which is, I think, a demeaning professional comment."
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1966.38,1967.33,Justice Kennedy --
2016.15-1500,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1967.33,1979.21,"But you want to say that it should be alighted because of -- of the tribe's indemnification agreement, and you want -- but in effect what you want us to do is to pass a little Westfall Act up here."
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1979.21,1984.37,"Justice Kennedy, three -- three responses. First of all, we certainly didn't mean to deride them professionally or otherwise."
2016.15-1500,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2049.27,2049.36,Yeah.
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2049.36,2049.84,-- of the statutes.
2016.15-1500,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2049.84,2065.455,"But my understanding, which Justice Ginsburg said, is that, basically -- the Westfall Act is a complicated act, but, basically, if you're rear-ended by a postal employee, you can sue the government of the United States."
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2084.09,2084.94,Absolutely.
2016.15-1500,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2084.94,2085.77,There is a remedy.
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2085.77,2086.91,I'm sorry if I misspoke.
2016.15-1500,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2086.91,2087.11,Yeah.
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2087.11,2090.67,"But absolutely you'd have a remedy against the State itself, just not against the employee."
2016.15-1500,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2090.67,2091.015,Okay.
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2109.5,2110.04,"So, Justice --"
2016.15-1500,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2110.04,2112.32,And then they changed that through legislation.
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2112.32,2117.61,"So, Justice Breyer, we think that that's absolutely not true; that is, there is a remedy against the tribe."
2016.15-1500,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2119.73,2121.29,"Well, that's entirely contingent."
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2127.285,2128.8,That's absolutely right.
2016.15-1500,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2172.91,2184.78,The problem -- the problem with that argument is that it -- it seems to suggest that the State's motive will be to provide protection for somebody like Mr. Clarke.
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2201.04,2209.61,"But I -- I -- Justice Alito, I understand the point, but I think that's true generally in law; that is, we -- we rely on the State to -- to make its own prerogatives and choices."
2016.15-1500,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2286.92,2293.22,"Well, that wouldn't help Mr. Clarke -- that wouldn't help Mr. Lewis because -- well, it would help him."
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2297.345,2297.88,Well --
2016.15-1500,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2297.88,2303.37,"And so if the tribe's waived sovereign immunity, why shouldn't the individual?"
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2303.37,2317.32,"Justice Sotomayor, before the lawsuit was brought, there was a preexisting statute that -- of the tribe that says that they fully indemnify Mr. Clarke, they pay all of the expenses and pay any judgment that was rendered against him. So anything in substance and --"
2016.15-1500,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2317.32,2321.0,So your sovereign immunity argument relies solely on that --
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2321.0,2321.49,Correct.
2016.15-1500,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2324.6,2328.79,"Indemnification in the Bivens actions, you say oh, those are constitutional actions."
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2334.18,2334.68,Correct.
2016.15-1500,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2335.0,2336.33,But they are all constitutional.
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2336.33,2336.59,Correct.
2016.15-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2352.52,2364.69,"Is there any -- is there any court that has held that an indemnification agreement, agreement to indemnify the employee, extends sovereign immunity to that employee?"
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2364.69,2367.59,So -- so this Court hasn't reached that question.
2016.15-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2402.33,2427.445,"The -- the indemnification in other contexts, does somebody -- you -- you couldn't have an indemnity agreement that would count, let's say, for diversity of citizenship, it would only be the parties. You couldn't -- the indemnity agreement -- the party that indemnifies is not a necessary party under Rule 19."
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2434.595,2470.66,"To be sure, Justice Ginsburg, in joinder and -- and in things like that, I think that's right, but I don't think that is -- those are private party litigation cases. I think if this Court's asking for what's the best analogy to this situation here, which is a sovereign-immunity situation, I think the instrumentality cases are -- are quite a bit closer than the ones like joinder and the like, which don't have anything to do with immunity at all. In case after case, starting with Ford Motor, this Court has been asking the question, who is the real party in interest for purposes of sovereign immunity."
2016.15-1500,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2494.08,2494.18,Okay.
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2534.33,2535.66,The answer to that is in our brief.
2016.15-1500,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2640.62,2644.975,"So why didn't you do it in your question presented? Presumably, you're --"
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2644.975,2650.54,"We -- we certainly should have -- the brief in opposition, there's no doubt, Justice Sotomayor, should have been clearer on this point --"
2016.15-1500,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2650.54,2658.02,"Well, your opening brief on page 22, 23 says, we're not claiming any personal immunity."
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2660.115,2662.75,I think -- I think that we -- we did say --
2016.15-1500,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2662.75,2663.89,Between official and --
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2663.89,2689.04,"In the -- in the brief in opposition at page 1, we did say that if this -- that the employee cases and the statutory cases support our position, as well as at pages 14 and 15 of that -- and -- and 22 and 23 of that brief. And I do think that that follows naturally from the way the Connecticut courts have understood this, which is to conflate both doctrines together, official immunity and tribal immunity."
2016.15-1500,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2689.04,2696.12,"So why don't we unconflate them, send them back and tell them, answer the two doctrines differently, because we've always treated them differently."
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2696.12,2696.48,Well -- right.
2016.15-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2761.74,2766.65,"So Congress could have enacted a Westfall Act covering tribes, but it didn't."
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2766.65,2779.25,"Correct, Justice Ginsburg. That's exactly the argument this Court rejected in Boyle and Justice Scalia's opinion, which is Congress was lobbied to extend the Federal -- the Federal Tort Claims Act except to federal contractors."
2016.15-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2818.25,2821.795,The Federal driver never had common law immunity.
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2829.01,2843.715,"They didn't before 1961 as I was -- as I was saying, but I do think the unbroken tradition of the lower courts after Barr v. Matteo in 1959, is to give low level employees, nondiscretionary employees, Federal -- Federal common law immunity."
2016.15-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2843.715,2846.21,But we said that was wrong.
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2853.335,2853.9,Correct.
2016.15-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2866.08,2880.5,"You said repudiated. They could have said, yeah, the Court got the -- the law right, what -- what it was, but we think the law should be changed, and not necessarily repudiating this Court's reading of what the common law is."
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2880.5,2885.39,"I think that's actually in the findings itself, Justice Ginsburg, of the act, as well as the House report."
2016.15-1500,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2905.25,2927.665,"Why should -- why should a -- a tribal employee driving a limo be entitled to official immunity? You say that the purpose of official immunity is to protect, quote, ""the fearless, vigorous, and effective administration of policies of government,"" but you -- you want to have -- you want to encourage limo drivers on I-95 to be fearless in the way they drive?"
2016.15-1500,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2927.665,2940.23,"Well, I -- I think the -- the first point is that their argument is so sweeping it extends not just to drivers, it extends to tribal judges, it extends to tribal prosecutors, and, yes, it extends even to drivers of emergency vehicles."
2016.15-1500,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3030.0,3035.18,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Miller, 7 minutes."
2016.15-1500,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3035.18,3061.16,"Thank you. On the question of official immunity, we've already discussed the reasons why it's not part of the case before this Court, but I'd like to add that this case is a particularly bad vehicle with which to consider the -- in which to consider the question of official immunity. As has been discussed, in order to craft an immunity rule that would reach the facts of this case, it would be something far beyond what the common law has recognized."
2016.15-1500,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3173.13,3187.924,"Do you think, Mr. Miller, that there's any decision that precludes us from saying that we're going to treat this as sovereign immunity or not sovereign immunity depending on an -- an indemnification agreement?"
2016.15-1500,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3187.924,3193.28,There's no case that directly precludes you from saying that.
2016.15-1500,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3250.76,3278.375,"Well, I heard his argument. I mean, he may not, I don't want to saddle him with this, but common -- Federal common law, sovereign immunity idea, and where a tribe -- let -- so let's look at what the statutes do. And we see every State and the Federal government don't let you bring a suit against the employee and make the employee pay for an automobile accident."
2016.15-1500,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3306.09,3308.26,"Yes, and -- and there are two answers to that."
2016.15-1500,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3368.18,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
