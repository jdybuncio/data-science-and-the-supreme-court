1971.70-5058,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,26.758,"We will hear arguments next in Number 5058, Lynch against Household Finance."
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,30.277,37.458,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-5058,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,72.641,82.437,"Now in Connecticut, would you clear this up for me, must there be an action pending against to the garnish -- the defendant at the time."
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,82.437,93.218,I would like Mr. Chief Justice to begin answering that question and then explain the Connecticut practice of summary prejudgment garnishment in some detail because it is quite unusual.
1971.70-5058,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,93.218,95.9,"Yes, you do it on your own way then."
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,95.9,115.427,"In Connecticut, an alleged creditor and his attorney has absolute discretion prior to instituting suit against the debtor to summarily garnish earnings in his account without any involvement of the court."
1971.70-5058,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,133.137,136.162,Then when he get the judgment?
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,136.162,147.178,Judgment is obtained perhaps several years after civil action is commenced by service of process on the debtor Mr. Justice Brennan.
1971.70-5058,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,147.178,152.402,What -- you garnished as here I gather savings account.
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,152.402,153.524,"And a checking account, Mr. Justice."
1971.70-5058,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,153.524,154.788,And a checking account.
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,160.235,162.15,He does not immediately need to file.
1971.70-5058,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,162.15,163.427,How much time does he have?
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,163.427,172.32,"Under the applicable statutes, Section 329 of Title 52 and Section 48 (a) of Title 52."
1971.70-5058,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,190.838,194.275,And you do not get into the State Court until day 55?
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,194.275,203.719,One never gets into the State Court on a garnishment Mr. Justice Brennan to raise any questions with respect to that garnishment.
1971.70-5058,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,205.857,210.638,You mean after the proceeding -- even afterward you get into the State Court on day 55?
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,210.638,214.606,"That is correct Mr. Justice, and I would like to explain that."
1971.70-5058,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,310.535,313.569,There must be an action pending first against the defendant.
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,313.569,316.388,There need not be an action pending first Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-5058,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,316.388,318.936,I am speaking -- you were addressing yourself in Minnesota --
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,318.936,319.218,"Oh, yes, that is correct."
1971.70-5058,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,319.218,322.26,"-- which is very common of many other states, is it not?"
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,322.26,325.118,That is correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-5058,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,333.92,349.869,"Of course in most other states at least those of which I am familiar, the word, the word ‘garnishment’ means going after somebody’s wages, going after his employer for his wages. Here, what we are talking about is what is generally known in other states as an attachment, is it not?"
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,349.869,350.706,In Connecticut the term garnishment --
1971.70-5058,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,350.706,352.969,Excuse me.
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,352.969,364.71,"In Connecticut the term garnishment is used Mr. Justice Stewart, as a term permitting a creditor to reach debts owing to a debtor which are in the hands of a third person --"
1971.70-5058,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,364.71,368.5,But not -- but explicitly not wages as I understand it.
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,368.5,380.861,"We have a -- we have alleged in these cases that the constitutional deprivations that Mrs. Lynch and Mrs. Toro have suffered is indistinguishable from that suffered by Christine SNIADACH, the only difference --"
1971.70-5058,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,380.861,383.57,"I understand your -- I understand your legal argument, I am asking a question that I --"
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,383.57,391.357,"Wages on the hands of an employer, Mr. Justice, are exempt from garnishment until after judgment, and then it is called an execution."
1971.70-5058,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,391.357,392.187,Right.
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,392.187,394.886,But wages deposited in accounts --
1971.70-5058,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,394.886,395.573,In a bank account?
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,395.573,397.789,In a bank account.
1971.70-5058,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,410.37,411.704,Deposited in the bank and --
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,411.704,417.851,And automatically deposited in a Credit Union Savings Account after place of employment.
1971.70-5058,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,420.751,425.032,Do you have any amount exempt in garnishment in Connecticut?
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,425.032,433.13,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, there is a statute, Section 352 I believe of Title 52, which sets out what the exemptions are."
1971.70-5058,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,446.0,448.868,"But no cash amounts, no monetary amounts?"
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,448.868,466.543,"Only after judgment when wages in the hands of an employer or executed upon, is there any exemption I believe it is either the first $65.00 of the wage earner’s net income is exempt or 25% of his disposable income whichever is greater."
1971.70-5058,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,575.309,580.627,Particularly Mrs. Toro’s particular garnishment has been released?
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,580.627,615.563,"Mrs. Toro’s particular garnishment has been released Mr. Justice and the District Court stated that this raised some question of mootness which it did not decide but as our prayers for relief demonstrate, Pages 10 of the Appendix in 37 and 38, we were also looking for injunctions against garnishments to be levied by deputy sheriff in the future on behalf of other creditors of Mrs. Lynch and Mrs. Toro."
1971.70-5058,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,666.702,671.619,Would your case be any different if your client were General Motors?
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,671.619,681.817,"I think that this case would be different with respect to the jurisdictional point Mr. Justice Blackmun, if our client were General Motors, not with respect to the 2283 point."
1971.70-5058,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,682.756,687.986,It is rather effective to garnish large corporation’s bank accounts once in awhile.
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,687.986,702.181,"In Connecticut there is a statute, Section 337 (a) of Title 52, which requires a court order for garnishment of checking accounts to the extent if they exceed $5,000."
1971.70-5058,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,820.757,826.383,We will suspend for lunch at this time counsel.
1971.70-5058,0,21139,david_m_lesser,,829.341,833.573,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,1296.827,1299.553,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-5058,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1892.071,1899.573,"In Connecticut as I understand it, one thing that cannot be reached prior to judgment is wages owing from an employer to an employee."
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,1899.573,1900.617,That is correct Your Honor.
1971.70-5058,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1941.452,1955.062,"Is there any time limit counsel that the garnishments may remain in effect for following the merits, some states put time limits?"
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,1955.062,1955.766,No --
1971.70-5058,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1955.766,1956.928,Three months --
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,1956.928,1964.401,"No, if the garnishment is properly effective at the outset of suit it will remain pending throughout the duration of the suit."
1971.70-5058,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1968.682,1981.286,"So, if the lawsuit -- it is in a particular district where three years in reaching cases for trial or money have been impounded all that time."
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,1991.725,1981.286,That is correct.
1971.70-5058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2221.967,2224.56,"It is not the court proceeding, is it?"
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2224.56,2224.789,Excuse me.
1971.70-5058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2224.789,2227.018,"It is not a Court proceeding, is it?"
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2227.018,2229.29,"Well, it involves court procedures Your Honor."
1971.70-5058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2230.695,2233.562,This particular case does not involve a court proceeding.
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2233.562,2241.152,"Well, and that it invokes the utilization of statutory procedures in court or attacking the garnishment, if that is desired by the defendants."
1971.70-5058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2241.152,2244.533,"Well, that would these people do in the Connecticut Court?"
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2244.533,2246.811,"They did nothing, I believe."
1971.70-5058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2246.811,2250.064,Has this of Court proceeding of the State of Connecticut?
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2250.064,2255.51,"Well, that bears on the question of what is a proceeding under 2283."
1971.70-5058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2256.64,2260.216,"It is a court proceedings, it says that, does it not?"
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2260.216,2260.748,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-5058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2263.602,2266.312,"Yes, but it is a court proceeding?"
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2269.778,2277.887,"Well, the concept of proceedings in 2283 Your Honor, I believe takes in all phases of a lawsuit and it takes them in from beginning to end."
1971.70-5058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2280.78,2291.224,"Well, suppose the -- I am sure you are familiar because this client, suppose your client repossesses a car, would that be a court proceeding?"
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2291.224,2295.653,"Well, he needs to proceed with an order of court Your Honor at the upset and that --"
1971.70-5058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2295.653,2297.349,Does he in Connecticut?
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2297.349,2298.009,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-5058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2298.009,2299.835,"That is because of Connecticut statute, is it not?"
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2299.835,2300.438,That is correct Your Honor.
1971.70-5058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2300.438,2303.333,"But that is not normally so, is it?"
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2303.333,2304.804,For automobiles that could -- it is a statute as proscribed.
1971.70-5058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2304.804,2321.409,"If I understand Mrs. Lynch made this note and did not pay the money, you go to the sheriff or deputy sheriff and he garnishes the bank account."
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2321.409,2323.654,That is correct.
1971.70-5058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2323.654,2330.735,And none of that up to that point has ever happened anywhere in (Inaudible).
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2330.735,2332.821,That is correct Your Honor.
1971.70-5058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2333.527,2337.861,"That is where this case was when it came in to Federal Court, was it not?"
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2337.861,2343.53,"Well, this case was -- this case was pending at the time the federal action was instituted."
1971.70-5058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2344.69,2353.714,"That is the case that you filed, and as I understand they are not trying to get an injunction against that case, am I right?"
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2353.714,2358.771,"Well, they are not seeking to enjoin the application of the utilization of the Connecticut statutes."
1971.70-5058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2358.771,2361.106,They are seeking to get the money back.
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2361.106,2361.937,That is correct.
1971.70-5058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2363.242,2367.324,And they do not need the Connecticut Court to get that money back.
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2367.324,2374.798,"Well, I think that is the question, and then one of the allegations is that they make it that the Connecticut Courts do not have the machinery to do just that."
1971.70-5058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2374.798,2385.393,"Well, all I am trying to test you a little, I admit I am being over technical about this, but I just do not see that -- I do not think the sheriff is the court, the deputy sheriff."
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2385.393,2388.262,Maybe I could explain it this way.
1971.70-5058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2447.505,2452.122,The sheriff in Connecticut are elected or appointed by the court?
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2452.122,2460.957,"I believe that deputy sheriff in service was appointed, he is appointed, I believe, by a sheriff who is an elected official if I am not mistaken, I believe that is the case."
1971.70-5058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2460.957,2463.735,"Well, is he responsible for the court?"
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2463.735,2471.41,"Well, he is a -- he is an officer, an administerial officer who must at least have enough colors of state law that fit in under the original statute at the outset."
1971.70-5058,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2471.41,2473.883,I apologize for being even more practical.
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2473.883,2482.14,"No, I would suggest that he is a ministerial officer in serving the writs of the papers involved in a garnishment process."
1971.70-5058,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2532.505,2538.565,"May I ask Mr. Bell, I am looking at the opinion of the court below on Page 26."
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2548.377,2559.963,I believe what it was saying Your Honor is that the question for instance of liability or not the basic rationale of any judgment that might be rendered by the Court is separate from the garnishment proceeding.
1971.70-5058,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2564.314,2577.457,"I do not mind anywhere in this opinion, I gather under the statute, now the question is whether this garnishment, whatever it is, is a proceeding in a State Court, did you get it, that the question."
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2577.457,2578.1,That is correct.
1971.70-5058,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2578.1,2583.014,"And I do not see that this opinion addresses itself directly to that question, does it?"
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2583.014,2593.952,I take its language is not as direct as I would have like to have seen it but the holding under 2283 must necessarily involve the conclusion that it constitutes proceedings.
1971.70-5058,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2595.242,2599.149,"Well, more than proceedings whether it constitutes proceedings in a State Court."
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2599.149,2599.612,That is correct.
1971.70-5058,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2599.612,2600.708,That is what the statute is.
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2600.708,2617.279,"That is correct, well there is not any question that the basic garnishment than -- that is reflected both Lynch and Toro were in connection with a proceeding to pending State Court action that is both cases where pending at that time in a Sixth Circuit Court in Connecticut as to which these garnishments had in fact ineffective."
1971.70-5058,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2617.707,2623.629,"Incidentally when were the complaints, repetitive complaints filed in, in a relation to the time with the Federal Court complaints."
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2623.629,2626.196,"Well, I think within -- in relation to the Federal Court?"
1971.70-5058,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2626.196,2627.095,Yes.
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2627.095,2637.287,"Well, the creditor’s complaints were filed in Lynch on July 1, 1970, Toro in February."
1971.70-5058,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2645.354,2648.626,"But, in any event, after the creditor’s complaints were filed in the State Court."
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2648.626,2649.364,"Yes, those actions were --"
1971.70-5058,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2649.364,2659.802,"But I gather -- but it is the case, is it not, that the complaint in Federal Court did not ask for any restraint against the prosecution of the creditor’s complaints in State Court?"
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2659.802,2665.494,"Well, that is not prosecutions; that was an injunction against the utilization of this Connecticut garnishments statute."
1971.70-5058,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2665.494,2667.578,Now that my question was Mr. Bell.
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2675.529,2681.635,I have to answer that you are correct Mr. Justice Brennan as far as the suit is concerned but I have -- but they did seek -- they did seek the application --
1971.70-5058,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2681.635,2686.342,"Well, what they want to do is take a way from you the security you now held under the garnishment --"
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2686.342,2686.781,That is correct.
1971.70-5058,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2686.781,2690.466,"process, but whether recovery of a judgment if you got it in there."
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2690.466,2691.078,That is correct.
1971.70-5058,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2691.078,2691.599,Is that not it?
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2691.599,2692.655,That is precisely correct.
1971.70-5058,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2693.286,2703.412,"Now, are we to -- how should we approach interpreting proceedings in the State Court strictly or --"
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2703.412,2714.234,"I believe that Hill v. Martin suggests that given the policy of 2283 that it needs to be a generous instruction, that the concern expressed in the statute is for the operation of a State jurisdiction."
1971.70-5058,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2714.234,2716.851,You mean generous against jurisdiction.
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2716.851,2718.071,"Well, I think it requires a broad interpretation because of the --"
1971.70-5058,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2718.071,2722.741,A broad interpretation against jurisdiction.
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2722.741,2723.987,I believe so because I think the concern --
1971.70-5058,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2723.987,2727.4,The jurisdiction I mean against the --
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2727.4,2734.053,I believe the concern is to permit if it is appropriate to permit the State proceedings to go on.
1971.70-5058,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2768.575,2775.44,"Excuse me Mr. Bell, is the question before us whether 1983 is an expressed deception."
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2775.44,2778.147,I believe it is a --
1971.70-5058,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2778.147,2783.853,And I noticed it was decided apparently or the Second Circuit poses it is not.
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2789.186,2793.103,I believe it is with the total 23 issues Your Honor.
1971.70-5058,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2815.895,2818.837,"To which, in the creditor’s action?"
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2820.38,2826.416,I believe if you sought an injunction in a State Court proceeding that is available by way of a counterclaim in court --
1971.70-5058,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2826.416,2830.019,"Now, the creditor brings a suit for recovery on a note, is that what it was?"
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2830.019,2830.57,That is right.
1971.70-5058,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2830.57,2835.839,And in that proceeding you are suggesting the defendant is seeking an injunction against the garnishment.
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2835.839,2836.249,I am.
1971.70-5058,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2849.435,2852.15,"But that would be independent, that would be independent suit, would it not?"
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2852.15,2856.16,It could either be by independent suit Mr. Justice Brennan or by way of counterclaim.
1971.70-5058,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2871.41,2873.733,The whole suit then or just a counterclaim?
1971.70-5058,1,38797,richard_g_bell,,2873.733,2876.282,The whole action would follow.
1971.70-5058,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3102.245,3104.174,Thank you Mr. Bell.
1971.70-5058,2,21139,david_m_lesser,,3109.78,3113.162,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-5058,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3166.291,3170.936,Do you agree with your friend that your client can assert a counterclaim --
1971.70-5058,2,21139,david_m_lesser,,3170.936,3171.248,No I do not.
1971.70-5058,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3171.248,3174.576,-- under 1983 grounds?
1971.70-5058,2,21139,david_m_lesser,,3174.576,3184.249,"I do not believe that a counterclaim would lie in the Sixth Circuit Court action where the creditors service pending against Mrs. Lynch, Mr. Chief Justice."
1971.70-5058,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3192.925,3202.925,But does -- do you say it does not relate to the matter in demand when the counterclaim would be against the unlawful act of garnishment (Voice Overlap).
1971.70-5058,2,21139,david_m_lesser,,3202.925,3207.128,The garnishment would be unrelated to the complaints that alleged.
1971.70-5058,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3371.969,3373.677,Thank you Mr. Lesser.
