1982.81-1859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.655,We will hear arguments next in Illinois against Lafayette.
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,81.265,84.232,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.81-1859,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,141.942,149.377,"Now, Mr. Ficaro, you did not make that search incident to an arrest argument below, did you?"
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,149.377,154.016,"Yes, Your Honor, that argument was made in the trial court."
1982.81-1859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,194.328,205.793,Before it got to the end of its opinion on page 3A of the cert petition it said we find the state has waived this argument for the purposes of appeal by falling to raise it at the suppression hearing.
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,207.604,212.554,--There are three ways that this case is before this Court.
1982.81-1859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,218.521,219.209,I understand.
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,227.002,232.234,"--Although they said that under Jenkins v. Georgia, they reached the issue."
1982.81-1859,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,265.829,273.687,"But that has nothing to do with whether an argument might be waived, does it, the fact that the two constitutions might be coterminous?"
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,273.687,302.972,"The Illinois courts follow the procedural rules, so this Court under the holdings of Steagald which establishes the standard for waiver in Illinois... the Illinois courts in People v. Keller which explicitly says we follow the federal guideline of Steagald for the waiver principles, thereby allows this Court to reach the question of whether or not it was waived."
1982.81-1859,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,312.281,322.903,"But assuming we ought to take the word of the Illinois Appellate Court in this particular case on these particular facts as to whether something was waived under Illinois law, shouldn't we?"
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,322.903,338.21,"I believe, Your Honor, it is not an independent ground because they use the federal standard of waiver in Steagald, and, therefore, in applying the federal standard in Steagald this issue was not waived because it was raised in a timely fashion."
1982.81-1859,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,338.21,346.658,"Without getting into all this Steagald underbrush, didn't your Illinois Appellate Court go on and say and reach the issue anyway--"
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,346.658,348.424,"Yes, that is correct."
1982.81-1859,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,348.424,353.001,--by saying that we assume arguendo that it was not waived and then went ahead and decided it.
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,353.533,359.373,That is enough under Jenkins v. Georgia if they reach the constitutional issue and more significantly--
1982.81-1859,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,359.373,360.81,But you have not mentioned it in so many words.
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,360.81,362.716,--I apologize to the Court.
1982.81-1859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,712.886,716.213,What was this man custodial arrested for?
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,716.213,723.538,"He was arrested for, Your Honor, disorderly conduct which was a city ordinance which was subject to incarceration."
1982.81-1859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,723.538,731.848,And what evidence could you find of disorderly conduct by searching him?
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,731.848,734.613,"I do not believe that is an issue, Your Honor."
1982.81-1859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,736.018,736.924,But it is a question--
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,736.924,737.377,"--Yes, it is."
1982.81-1859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,737.377,738.158,--which I am asking.
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,738.158,748.03,"And the answer to that question is that the evidence of his bizarre behavior may have resulted from the use of narcotics, in this case amphetamines."
1982.81-1859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,826.904,830.934,May I ask you one question about the scope of the permissible search?
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,840.929,861.187,"I believe the answer to that question is if it is pursuant to a valid custodial arrest, the police have a right to examine the contents, not to read the contents of the letters, as this Court has indicated in other decisions, that there is a certain amount of scrutiny available to the police."
1982.81-1859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,865.935,869.34,"Suppose the envelopes were sealed, could they rip open the seals and look inside?"
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,869.34,884.678,"--I believe they could, Your Honor, and it is the arrest that justifies this intrusion because the expectation of privacy of an arrested individual is diminished and the contents of his personal belongings are also diminished."
1982.81-1859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,884.678,888.035,Do we have to go that far in this case?
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,888.035,890.799,"No, Your Honor, we do not have to go that far in this case."
1982.81-1859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,890.799,895.86,What if in feeling the envelopes they felt some kind of a granulated powder inside.
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,903.795,921.755,"I believe they would, Your Honor, in this case under these facts because the valid custodial arrest, just like searching into the pocket of Robinson to find a cigarette pack and then opening a cigarette pack to find narcotics inside would be the same as the Court's example or hypothetical to me."
1982.81-1859,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,938.655,942.06,Is incident to arrest your principle submission?
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,942.06,944.543,"No, Your Honor, that is the first submission."
1982.81-1859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1090.437,1092.686,Is it limited to the purse or--
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1092.686,1093.905,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1093.905,1098.309,--diminished expectation of privacy of everything on his person?
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1098.309,1103.838,"Everything on his person and within the scope of allowable search, under Chimel."
1982.81-1859,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1103.838,1107.196,How about a separate locked trunk as in Chadwick:
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1107.196,1114.818,It depends upon the association of that locked trunk with the person at the time of his arrest.
1982.81-1859,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1117.052,1119.223,--You mean if it were nearby it could be opened and searched?
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1119.223,1128.25,--If it were in the permissible scope of Chimel if Chimel is... if the language of Chimel means a foot locker.
1982.81-1859,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1128.25,1130.28,Even if it is locked?
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1130.28,1134.919,"If that is what the interpretation of Chimel means, even if it is locked."
1982.81-1859,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1151.178,1164.377,Are you suggesting that... in Chadwick didn't the encounter begin when they were standing in the depot or the station?
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1164.377,1175.715,"The encounter began in an observation in another city, I believe, but the arrest took place... there was probable cause to search--"
1982.81-1859,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1175.715,1176.34,From where?
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1178.261,1191.584,"--Based upon observations by agents in, I believe, San Diego following it through to Boston where the foot locker was observed."
1982.81-1859,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1196.801,1202.83,"As soon as the dog sniffed the foot locker, where were the people when the dog sniffed the foot locker?"
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1202.83,1204.891,"--That was unclear, Your Honor, but that issue--"
1982.81-1859,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1204.891,1205.938,"They were close by, weren't they?"
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1205.938,1207.249,--That issue was not addressed.
1982.81-1859,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1207.249,1216.246,Do you think they could have... suppose the dog had sniffed the foot locker when they were sitting on the foot locker and they arrested them right then.
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1219.416,1227.835,"I believe within the holding of Chimel that foot locker could have been searched as valid, incident to a custodial arrest."
1982.81-1859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1249.013,1261.54,In Chadwick the police did not know of any... of the connection between Chadwick and the foot locker until he exercised dominion over it--
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1261.54,1263.336,That is correct.
1982.81-1859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1263.336,1277.174,"--by taking possession, and the police deferred their arrest until he claimed the container that the dog had indicated had drugs in it."
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1277.174,1283.875,But I believe this Court has distinguished Chadwick in that it was not a search incidental to arrest.
1982.81-1859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1283.875,1286.029,And it was not an automobile search.
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1286.029,1286.639,That is correct.
1982.81-1859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1298.822,1303.727,Did the Ross case possibly have some impact on Chadwick?
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1303.727,1314.488,"I believe Ross merely indicated the worthiness and unworthiness of containers for the purposes of describing, as I have, a purse or a double locked foot locker."
1982.81-1859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1329.872,1335.572,Are you going to come to your theory on the inventory search--
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1335.572,1337.196,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1337.196,1339.024,--or have you said all you were going to say about that?
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1339.024,1340.289,"No, Your Honor, I will."
1982.81-1859,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1396.485,1406.092,Do we know from the record in this case what the details of the standard procedure were that were used by the Kankakee Police Department?
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1406.092,1423.411,"--We do not know from the record, Your Honor, other than the facts of removing the contents from the pockets of the individual, placing this individual in jail garb or jail attire, and taking all the personal belongings of that individual in inventory."
1982.81-1859,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1423.411,1433.549,And we do not know to what property it extends or whether a form is filled out or anything of the kind?
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1433.549,1457.21,"In the amicus brief filed before the Court, there is a copy of the inventory form used by the Kankakee Police Department which line by line designates questions to be answered and items to be inventoried and property to be received and that the Respondent in each and every case or the person arrested must sign that inventory to verify the contents."
1982.81-1859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1457.21,1460.007,What is in the course of the inventory process?
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1460.007,1469.408,"The inventory process, Your Honor, Mr. Justice, is a caretaking administrative practice."
1982.81-1859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1557.872,1560.527,May I ask you a question?
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1563.573,1564.698,I believe that is the inventory card.
1982.81-1859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1564.698,1573.381,"--It describes the property as b-l-k, black shoes, $79 U.S.C., brown pouch, three keys, pants, I guess, vest, and something else."
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1578.286,1580.38,"It is not clear from the record, Your Honor, where those keys--"
1982.81-1859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1580.38,1583.019,Can you tell what was in the pouch from the inventory card?
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1583.019,1584.94,"--I do not believe so, Your Honor--"
1982.81-1859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1584.94,1588.033,Did they just inventory the pouch and I assume they leave the contents inside it?
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1588.033,1590.937,--If that would not--
1982.81-1859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1590.937,1592.484,"I mean, this is their regular procedure, I guess."
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1592.484,1593.499,--That is their regular procedure.
1982.81-1859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1593.499,1597.263,But you cannot tell from the card what is in the pouch and what is not in the pouch?
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1597.263,1600.402,I do not think it is of significance whether it is in the pouch or not.
1982.81-1859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1604.995,1609.961,"The other side argues that all you really have to do is describe the pouch and keep that separate, and you are arguing you have got to know what is in the pouch--"
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1609.961,1611.022,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1611.022,1615.1,"--and if the ordinary record does not even show what is in the pouch, I wonder how valid your argument is."
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1615.1,1623.221,I believe in the record it indicates that every item of property of an arrestee must be inventoried.
1982.81-1859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1626.501,1627.954,So if he had a pouch with nothing in it but three keys?
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1630.078,1639.137,"I do not believe that I understand the question, Your Honor, in that they inventoried all items of personal property in his possession."
1982.81-1859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1644.618,1646.508,And I am saying they apparently do not inventory the contents of the pouch.
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1648.571,1655.505,You mean they do not specifically indicate that the contents are the following?
1982.81-1859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1655.505,1657.614,"If this is your regular form, they do not."
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1657.614,1666.345,"But they do, which is the basic consideration, inventory each and every item taken from the arrestee at the time of his arrest."
1982.81-1859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1666.345,1674.841,"Including the pouch but not the contents of the pouch, which would seem to suggest you do not have to look inside the pouch to comply with your inventory regulations."
1982.81-1859,0,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,1674.841,1683.134,I believe you would have to look into the pouch or you cannot list each and every item taken from the arrestee at the time of his arrest.
1982.81-1859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1715.981,1721.572,Mr. Carusona.
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,1721.572,1726.147,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.81-1859,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1774.707,1777.581,Why did they indulge in that waste of time?
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,1777.581,1783.735,"I do not know, Your Honor."
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1790.951,1791.778,We won't push you.
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,1791.778,1793.122,Thank you.
1982.81-1859,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1818.72,1822.438,How about Jenkins v. Georgia which the other side relies on?
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,1822.438,1827.451,In that case the Court in that case went on to reach and decide the question.
1982.81-1859,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1899.531,1904.904,How about the custodial nature of an arrest made for a violation of that ordinance?
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,1909.136,1917.29,"Certainly not, Your Honor, and this is the... you can have a custodial arrest for a misdemeanor, and this is not even a misdemeanor."
1982.81-1859,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1933.126,1934.845,If he had it.
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,1934.845,1936.532,If he had it.
1982.81-1859,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1967.552,1973.55,"May I ask you if the record tells us what he had in the purse other than the cigarettes, which I guess are mentioned, and the--"
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,1973.55,1974.704,--The record does not show.
1982.81-1859,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1974.704,1977.438,--Because neither the cigarettes nor the drugs are listed on the card.
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,1980.671,1986.84,There is no indication in the record.
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2048.77,2049.549,What did you say?
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2055.702,2063.2,"--Perhaps as a search incident to arrest under the Fourth Amendment, yes."
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2063.2,2064.934,So--
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2064.934,2067.463,We are not disputing a contemporaneous search.
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2067.463,2068.229,--All right.
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2069.697,2076.711,"I might add, however, that such a search might be illegal under Illinois law because it is controlled by state statute."
1982.81-1859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2119.459,2130.922,"Now, you have said, if I understood you correctly, that the police would not even have been able to obtain a search warrant for that bag that he was carrying."
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2130.922,2132.265,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2132.265,2155.178,"What if, in fact, there was $20,000 worth of raw heroin in it and the police do not know that when they arrest him but his conduct was such that they might reasonably think he was influenced by drugs."
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2168.72,2173.217,"What we are saying, Your Honor, is that such a search would not be an inventory search."
1982.81-1859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2180.387,2187.603,Suppose... you are suggesting that they should have put it in a sealed wrapper and put it away and not looked inside of it.
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2189.493,2191.367,As far as the inventory issue is concerned.
1982.81-1859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2191.367,2206.737,"Now suppose after he posted his bond and had been fined he then claimed that he had had $10,000 in currency in it but that the $10,000 in currency was missing."
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2213.982,2229.413,"What we are suggesting, Your Honor, is the right... the police do have a right to protect themselves from a claim, and they could have done it exactly as the officer testified in this case by placing the shoulder bag in an inventory bag, which were available, and securing it in a locker."
1982.81-1859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2229.413,2240.067,"Would that prevent this gentleman from claiming afterward that he had $10,000 when he put it in, that the $10,000 was missing when he was released?"
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2240.067,2244.845,"Your Honor, absolutely no procedure would prevent that from happening."
1982.81-1859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2244.845,2255.169,"Well, the inventory at the time and place at the police station, spreading the things all out on the table and counting the money would protect them, would it not?"
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2255.169,2256.918,That would not protect a false claim.
1982.81-1859,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2262.447,2273.382,Even if the person arrested had to sign the form and say I acknowledge this is what I had and here it is and you have listed it on the inventory and yes that is right?
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2273.382,2283.689,"Well, Your Honor, in this case the shoulder bag could have been placed in an inventory bag and that could have been sealed and the Defendant could have initialed that and then--"
1982.81-1859,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2283.689,2290.468,"Yes, but that does not do away with the type of claim the Chief Justice was inquiring about."
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2290.468,2292.233,--I understand.
1982.81-1859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2302.868,2306.586,"Well, it is not the function of judges to try to say how it should be done."
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2316.957,2318.8,--I agree with Your Honor.
1982.81-1859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2335.683,2351.13,"Well, in Opperman we said that an inventory search is a constitutional means for several purposes, one of which is the protection of the police from false claims, but that is only one of the purposes."
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2351.13,2358.846,"That is correct, Your Honor, and we feel that that interest is served exactly as the majority of courts have been holding."
1982.81-1859,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2404.204,2417.339,Is that the sort of a record upon which this Court could say that as a matter of constitutional law you have to inventory one way rather than another?
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2417.339,2418.901,"Certainly not, Your Honor."
1982.81-1859,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2449.983,2453.295,But we do not reach the question of opening up letters in this case.
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2453.295,2459.432,"--That is correct, Your Honor, but that is the rule that the Petitioner is advocating."
1982.81-1859,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2459.432,2467.663,"Well, we do not have to take in haec verba either your submission or Petitioner's, I take it, to decide the case."
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2467.663,2469.52,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2469.52,2484.203,"Would you say that if the arrestee has in his pocket a little box that is wrapped up with strings, it looks like a little box with a present in it or something, would the police be permitted to open that or not?"
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2484.203,2485.203,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2487.858,2490.107,"And, how about his wallet?"
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2490.107,2493.262,"The same goes to that, Your Honor."
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2500.524,2501.898,They get him into the station.
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2514.299,2515.503,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2515.503,2519.579,But why isn't the wallet like the cigarette package in Robinson?
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2519.579,2526.28,"Well, Robinson was a search incident to arrest case, and it involved a contemporaneous search."
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2530.013,2541.994,"So you are saying... What case is it that holds, do you think, that... You would think that if they arrested him out on the street corner they could then search his wallet."
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2563.499,2566.952,"Sometimes they can, Your Honor."
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2566.952,2571.231,"And it was because of incident to arrest,--"
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2571.231,2572.059,Right.
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2572.059,2575.104,--But they would not have to have probable cause or anything to believe anything is in the box.
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2575.104,2575.729,That is correct.
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2582.243,2596.986,"Now, tell me the case that says that with respect to a personal article that is intimately connected with a person like a wallet that could be searched in the field, the arrest was in the field."
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2604.155,2613.855,--We would submit as far as search incident to arrest goes that that would be controlled by Sanders and Chadwick.
1982.81-1859,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2617.009,2618.556,What about Opperman?
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2618.556,2628.271,"Opperman for inventory purposes, we submit that Opperman does not allow opening containers that are to be stored in the station house."
1982.81-1859,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2628.271,2639.283,"Why should Justice White's hypothetical be controlled by Sanders and Chadwick rather than, which you consider to be extensions, rather than by Robinson for purposes of search incident to arrest?"
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2639.283,2645.171,Because Robinson is a case which allows... There is no need.
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2649.7,2662.258,I thought Chadwick carefully put aside those items that were intimately connected with the person and did not say that those could not be searched at the station house.
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2662.258,2672.643,"--There is some language in Chadwick to that effect, but it is our position that that just applies to clothing."
1982.81-1859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2691.698,2698.008,Let me take you back to the wallet that Justice White postulated to you.
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2729.98,2735.071,"That is correct, Your Honor, because we feel that they are protected by sealing--"
1982.81-1859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2735.071,2736.18,"Well, then that is... You are running counter to Opperman."
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2736.18,2737.243,"--Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1982.81-1859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2741.897,2747.083,The entire of everything in the automobile including things that were in the--
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2747.083,2749.753,--Glove compartment.
1982.81-1859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2749.753,2750.893,--glove compartment.
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2750.893,2753.58,"That is correct, Your Honor, but there was essential need in that case."
1982.81-1859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2764.372,2767.232,Also to protect the police.
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2767.232,2773.104,"That is correct, Your Honor, but the idea was that a car is stored outside."
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.114,2867.707,And to you it would not make any difference if they had a probable cause to search the purse?
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2867.707,2871.721,"Probable cause would be a different case, Your Honor."
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2873.33,2875.812,But you would just say they would have to go get a warrant.
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2879.357,2880.904,"If there were probable... That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2922.918,2940.974,"In Washington just recently a young man was arrested and he had a package and it was discovered that there were two venomous, poisonous snakes which had inflicted very serious injury on him endangering his life."
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2951.954,2956.03,"Certainly, I do not think it would be wise--"
1982.81-1859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2956.03,2966.229,"In this case it was a translucent bag, and they could see what was there, but suppose it had been a bag that was not translucent."
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2966.229,2971.196,--If the officer has reason to think that there is a poisonous snake in there or any other dangerous instrumentality--
1982.81-1859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2971.196,2984.722,"The whole point is that he might not have any reason to think there was a bomb or a poisonous snake any more than you would have any reason to think there was $10,000 in the man's wallet, but is it not the business of the police to find out?"
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,2984.722,2991.531,"--Yes, Your Honor, and I submit it would be foolhardy to open up a container where a snake jumps out and bites you."
1982.81-1859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2992.797,2994.576,It would be embarrassing.
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,3005.838,3009.04,That is correct.
1982.81-1859,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3009.04,3010.664,So what is your answer?
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,3010.664,3015.818,That he should not be opening... He is better protected by putting it in a locker.
1982.81-1859,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3018.036,3021.316,Letting the custodian deal with them.
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,3021.316,3022.394,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1982.81-1859,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3022.394,3024.362,Letting the custodian deal with them.
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,3030.328,3056.381,"It is... I do not know how else to answer this potential bomb or potential dangerous instrumentality except to say that it is foolhardy to routinely open these up and how it should be dealt with is if there is a reasonable suspicion then, of course, he should do something."
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3109.125,3110.204,Who are you talking about?
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,3113.483,3115.139,--That is right.
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3117.326,3121.371,"Well, we have the state represented here."
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,3121.371,3127.197,"The legitimate state interest served, Your Honor, is that the courts should not be deciding--"
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3127.197,3128.697,So the state gets a judicial interest?
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,3128.697,3132.991,--A judicial interest as the interest that this Court recognizes in Tyler.
1982.81-1859,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3142.737,3144.112,"Well, they did."
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,3175.881,3177.91,"That is not the rule in Illinois, Your Honor."
1982.81-1859,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3177.91,3183.611,The rule is that the burden is on the state to defeat a motion to suppress?
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,3183.611,3187.063,The burden on the state is to raise questions in a timely fashion.
1982.81-1859,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3204.509,3206.228,You are talking about the waiver argument now?
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,3206.228,3206.68,That is correct.
1982.81-1859,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3206.68,3207.383,I am sorry.
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,3208.461,3217.395,The important legitimate state interest here is that he could have asserted a state statute.
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3233.779,3244.665,"Well, when the Illinois court, though, said even if it was not waived this is not a search incident to arrest, it did not talk about Illinois law did it?"
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,3244.665,3246.899,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3248.554,3249.304,Why didn't it?
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,3254.911,3265.516,"--There was no need for the court to talk about... I mean, what we are talking about is in the trial court we were denied our opportunity to present that statute."
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3265.516,3266.483,Yes.
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,3266.483,3272.716,In the Appellate Court we contended that the state had waived the theory--
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3272.716,3274.076,"Yes, and your court said it had."
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,3274.076,3274.669,--That is correct.
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3274.669,3278.604,And then it nevertheless decided the question?
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,3278.604,3280.526,"We did not decide the question, Your Honor, and, in fact, the--"
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3280.526,3281.963,"Well, what did they say?"
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,3281.963,3287.663,"--Exactly what the state says they said, and they held that it was waived and then they went on to note--"
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3287.663,3292.209,"Assuming it was not waived, it nevertheless... We reject the state's position."
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,3292.209,3292.927,--That is correct.
1982.81-1859,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3292.927,3296.816,They did not say a word about Illinois law during that discussion.
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,3296.816,3297.441,That is correct.
1982.81-1859,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3297.441,3313.653,"I am not sure it is right to call that a hypothetical, that alternative ground, because they were subject to review by the Illinois Supreme Court which might have disagreed with them on waiver so they had a perfectly good reason for putting another reason in the record if they wanted to avoid review by their superior court."
1982.81-1859,1,37755,peter_a_carusona,,3313.653,3320.213,"I think Your Honor brings up a good point, and that is that in the petition for leave to appeal the state did not raise the waiver question."
1982.81-1859,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3403.195,3406.803,"Mr. Ficaro, do you have anything further?"
1982.81-1859,2,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,3406.803,3408.99,"Brief response, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1859,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3451.473,3452.738,In Chicago do you mean or--
1982.81-1859,2,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,3452.738,3454.16,In the United States--
1982.81-1859,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3454.16,3455.391,--the United States--
1982.81-1859,2,35818,michael_a_ficaro,,3455.391,3461.187,"--according to the FBI uniform crime statistics, although at times it seems that there are that many in Chicago."
1982.81-1859,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3526.332,3526.911,"Thank you, gentlemen."
