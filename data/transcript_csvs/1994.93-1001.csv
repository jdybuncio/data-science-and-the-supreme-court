1994.93-1001,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.889,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 93-1001, Allied-Bruce Terminix Companies, Inc. v. Michael Dobson."
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,12.299,16.372,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1001,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,97.866,105.74,"Mr. Farr, I suppose... now, this act was adopted in what year?"
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,105.74,107.242,"1925, Justice O'Connor."
1994.93-1001,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,107.242,116.639,"Right, and as of that time, I suppose we didn't have as broad a view of Commerce power as we have today?"
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,116.639,134.912,"Well, Your Honor, the best evidence I think that we have of that in 1925 is first of all Congress' own view as reflected briefly in the House report, which indicated that the Commerce power extended to all contracts relating to interstate commerce."
1994.93-1001,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,134.912,143.319,"Well, you would acknowledge, though, that we had a narrower view of the Commerce Clause power in 1925 than we have today?"
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,143.319,147.83,"Just O'Connor, I think it was not uniformly as broad as it is today."
1994.93-1001,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,174.458,187.416,"Well, of course, my view, as expressed in the Southland case, is that Congress didn't intend to do more in this Federal Arbitration Act than affect what happens in Federal courts."
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,243.413,245.576,"Well, Justice O'Connor, let me make two points, if I may."
1994.93-1001,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,306.481,309.993,"Mr. Farr, can I ask... this is a very interesting point that you're making."
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,325.756,336.703,"No, I would say, without knowing exactly the details of the transaction, the act might well apply but would not necessarily preempt whatever the State law is."
1994.93-1001,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,336.703,345.17,"--Where the State law says certain contracts are not subject to arbitration, certain consumer contracts are not, how could it apply without preempting it?"
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,346.652,355.789,"Well, if that's... if the definition of the law is a very narrow law that is aimed at arbitration agreements itself, I think in fact it probably would be preempted--"
1994.93-1001,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,355.789,355.959,I see.
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,355.959,357.411,--to the extent the Federal act applies.
1994.93-1001,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,365.467,370.76,"You mean, the rules of whether the company is liable on the merits are not preempted, you mean."
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,370.76,377.265,"--Well, I mean, perhaps even rules that go to the construction of the contract, or rules that deal with--"
1994.93-1001,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,377.265,383.269,"The rules that deal with whether or not the Arbitration Clause is enforceable would always be preempted, I would think."
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,383.269,385.711,"--Well, let me try to use an example."
1994.93-1001,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,423.016,433.464,"If the State law, as I think the Georgia law does say, said that for an arbitration clause to be enforceable that paragraph of the contract has to be initialed, even though nothing else has to, that would be unenforceable."
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,433.464,434.145,That would be.
1994.93-1001,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,459.013,465.248,"Mr. Farr, may I ask you to be entirely clear about this?"
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,481.999,491.565,"I think I can't give an absolutely clear answer for every case, because it depends on the particular nature of the State law."
1994.93-1001,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,515.043,516.203,"Why is that, Mr. Farr?"
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,535.907,567.66,"But I think one starts with the language of section 2, and the language of section 2 says that agreements to arbitrate, within the field, which I will discuss this morning, are enforceable save on grounds that are sufficient for revocation of any contract and, therefore, it seems to me that, when one is looking at State law seeking to be applied to an arbitration agreement and seeking to say that it makes it enforceable, one... the first inquiry, naturally, one makes is, is this grounds for revocation of any contract?"
1994.93-1001,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,567.66,575.355,"Then the answer to the question I posed is, you cannot carve out from arbitration specific kinds of contracts."
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,584.422,588.414,"From arbitration specifically, I do not believe that you can consistently with the Federal act."
1994.93-1001,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,588.414,599.553,"Mr. Farr, given the language of section 2, though, the key language seems to be a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce."
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,611.731,628.24,"Well, this, I should point out, is not a statute in which Congress has made specific findings to which the Court has to defer saying that we believe a specific activity affects interstate commerce and then directly regulates that activity."
1994.93-1001,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,652.767,659.219,"But it's certainly, it can also be read to be less sweeping than ""affecting""."
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,659.219,660.351,"It could, I agree."
1994.93-1001,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,660.351,666.355,"""Affecting"" has been almost a word of art in our Commerce Clause jurisdiction, whereas ""involving"" hasn't."
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,666.355,679.345,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the fact is that if one goes back, I think one cannot fairly say that the use of the word 1925."
1994.93-1001,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,740.689,742.541,What about Bernhardt v. Polygraphic?
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,745.053,751.778,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think in fact it did read the language broadly, if one looks at the inquiry that the Court made."
1994.93-1001,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,766.757,772.041,"Well, it didn't really say it had to do, it said it did not do any of those three things."
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,779.287,788.163,"Well, the contract involved in Bernhardt, it's not clear from that, there's almost no discussion of what the facts are as to what the duties were that the person undertook."
1994.93-1001,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,802.942,804.234,"Well, that's not the way Justice Douglas stated the question."
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,816.014,825.408,"I don't think, at least in one's that I'm aware of, that there are decisions about consumer contracts one way or the other."
1994.93-1001,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,825.408,841.821,"Mr. Farr, as I understand your proposal, you would decide whether this contract involves, or whether it evidences a transaction involving commerce ex post."
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,858.962,859.142,That's correct.
1994.93-1001,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,859.142,866.298,"So at the time you sign the contract, you don't really know whether it's going to be arbitrable under the Federal law or not, do you?"
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,866.298,878.058,"Well, when you're signing the contract you are agreeing to arbitrate your disputes under the agreement, and I think the natural presumption is that you are in fact intending to go ahead and agree."
1994.93-1001,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,878.058,893.436,"Yes, but one side can be rolling the dice and saying, you know, there is... I'm signing this standard form contract that has an arbitration provision, but inasmuch as I don't intend this contract to actually involve interstate materials, my contemplation is that this thing won't be covered."
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,923.658,936.277,"Well, Justice Scalia, it seems to me that in fact when Congress includes a reference to interstate commerce as a jurisdictional nexus in a statute, that the rule frankly is exactly the opposite."
1994.93-1001,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,953.859,954.42,But they are not laws--
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,954.42,954.59,--in order to be covered.
1994.93-1001,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,954.59,956.893,--But they are not laws involving contracting.
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,971.983,980.309,"Well, it involves contracts which relate to transactions involving commerce, so one is looking--"
1994.93-1001,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,980.309,1003.034,"More precisely, it involves contracts evidencing a transaction involving commerce, which could be read to mean that the contract must show on its face that it involves interstate commerce, so if the contract says, I will buy and sell widgets now located in Ohio which will be brought to me in Pennsylvania, then it would qualify, but if it just says, I will buy and sell widgets, it doesn't qualify."
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1004.166,1005.938,--I agree it's a possible reading.
1994.93-1001,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1024.16,1028.814,"Not a subjective intention at all, an objective one, one that is recited in the contract."
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1040.977,1065.354,"--But what's lacking from all of that... I mean, this in a sense is perhaps a variation of what the Alabama court applied as its test and what Judge Lumbard applied... is any explanation for why, in fact, Congress would want to put that kind of limitation into the act, to make the coverage of the act turn on what's on the face of the contract or, as the Alabama courts would have it, the subjective intention."
1994.93-1001,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1065.354,1068.977,So you could know at the outset whether this provision that you're agreeing to is enforceable or not.
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1068.977,1070.138,But that assumes--
1994.93-1001,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1070.138,1070.278,That's a good reason.
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1070.278,1082.237,"--But that assumes an intention on the part of someone who is signing the contract to say, I am signing on the face of the contract an agreement that in the event disputes arise between us we will go to arbitration."
1994.93-1001,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1094.714,1095.295,"Mr. Farr, if it's--"
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1095.295,1097.586,--to think Congress wanted to pin it onto that.
1994.93-1001,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1097.586,1115.167,"--If it's a question of what's recited on the face of a contract, and this is a form contract, the person, in this case Terminix, drawing the contract, would say on the face of it this is a contract involving commerce, and I guess the consumer wouldn't have much of a choice about what the contract says."
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1115.167,1126.517,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I believe that's correct, but in a way that seems to me to point up why the real question ought to be whether the transaction does, in fact, involve interstate commerce."
1994.93-1001,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1150.754,1155.789,Why did you say earlier that it's entirely an after-the-fact determination?
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1169.997,1172.158,"--Well, that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.93-1001,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1183.488,1185.999,"--Mr. Farr, if it were in all other respects--"
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1185.999,1186.2,"--respondents, located in Alabama."
1994.93-1001,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1186.2,1194.123,"--a local agreement, would you say the fact that a parent company of a contracting party is an out-of-State concern would be sufficient to make the act applicable?"
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1194.123,1199.236,It... I think it might depend on what particular duties they are undertaking under the contract.
1994.93-1001,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1199.787,1201.469,Say they guarantee performance of the contract.
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1201.469,1210.135,"--If they're guaranteeing performance of the contract, I think that an arbitration agreement in that should be enforceable as a matter of Federal law, and would be within the coverage."
1994.93-1001,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1210.135,1221.084,"If we were to say, as we've sometimes suggested in the antitrust area, that the contract must have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, do you have any idea how this case would come out?"
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1221.084,1230.551,"I mean, if one is looking to this particular transaction, I mean, it is a transaction of relatively modest size, I suppose."
1994.93-1001,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1259.821,1267.147,You mentioned at the start of your argument that in many statutes Congress makes findings that the particular activity affects commerce.
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1281.899,1286.631,"--Well, I... no, I think particular... particular arbitration contracts are found within that definition."
1994.93-1001,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1312.78,1351.636,"--Suppose we replicate a situation like Wickard v. Filburn, where one farmer in Ohio agrees with his neighbor to sell him 50 bushels of wheat, and they have an arbitration agreement in it, and nobody claims that the wheat ever went anywhere except across the local road, but I suppose if you apply Wickard v. Filburn you'd say, well, if he hadn't sold that 50 bushels of wheat to his neighbor, he might have sold it to somebody else that might have baked some bread that went in interstate commerce."
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1356.16,1359.262,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think so, in the absence of congressional findings."
1994.93-1001,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1368.279,1370.211,"Mr. Farr, may I ask you a related question?"
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1420.986,1441.701,"--Well, Your Honor, I think, again, it serves the same function as defining the class of contracts that Congress was intending to reach, just as, when Congress uses the terms, affecting commerce in criminal statutes, it is indicating what particular acts and transactions it's trying to reach by those statutes, and if one steps back for a second and--"
1994.93-1001,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1441.701,1457.511,"But in fact unless parties attempted to apply the arbitration agreement and to enforce the Federal act in cases which clearly did, or in cases which did not in fact involve commerce, the functioning of the act would be no different."
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1457.511,1459.464,"--Well, if one looks back--"
1994.93-1001,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1459.464,1472.69,"In other words, Congress... you're saying, in effect, that Congress is saying to the Federal courts, when... and parties, I suppose, when you refuse to apply this agreement to contracts that do not involve commerce, you're right."
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1475.332,1492.754,"--The Congress is saying, we did not intend to, but I think that's important, because in 1925, when Congress was enacting this legislation, it was enacting it against a background of hostility towards enforcement of arbitration agreements, hostility from the very courts that were going to have to interpret the act."
1994.93-1001,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1492.754,1499.909,"In your judgment, in the absence of this limitation, would there have been a risk of facial invalidity to the statute?"
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1499.909,1503.032,"Oh, I think there would have been a very definite risk in 1925."
1994.93-1001,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1503.032,1504.891,So you think that's what they were guarding against.
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1504.891,1521.962,"I mean, Congress was very concerned in 1925, and I think Judge Medina says this many years later in Robert Lorance, that unless it was very careful and put this on sound jurisdictional grounds, the courts, which did not want to enforce arbitration agreements, would invalidate it as beyond the scope of Congress' power."
1994.93-1001,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1521.962,1525.514,"Mr. Farr, can I just ask you one... maybe you want to answer it on your reply."
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1532.182,1539.567,"That... my reaction to it is that if one applies the test that the Court applied in Bernhardt, that that would be found to be too attenuated."
1994.93-1001,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1540.158,1540.379,But you said before--
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1541.981,1543.341,In the absence of findings.
1994.93-1001,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1543.341,1544.963,"--and if so, how do you distinguish that contract from this one?"
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1544.963,1550.566,"Because this one, in fact, does involve interstate commerce, that you are dealing with out-of-State dealers."
1994.93-1001,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1567.188,1571.581,"But the services... it isn't where the service is, but where the owner of... anyway, I won't take any more of your time."
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1571.581,1573.363,"--I'd like to reserve the rest of my time, if I--"
1994.93-1001,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1573.363,1581.479,"Then you're saying it doesn't go the full length of congressional power, because the Chief is giving you an example of something that was held to be within the Commerce power."
1994.93-1001,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1581.479,1583.351,--Based on the findings that Congress made.
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,1594.279,1597.021,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1001,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1739.217,1744.131,"You cite the case to Our Honors, I think, you don't cite Our Honors to the case, but that's all right."
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,1744.131,1744.451,"Yes, sir."
1994.93-1001,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1808.747,1832.413,"Why doesn't it involve commerce, why isn't it in commerce if I contract with someone to bring in some individuals from out of State to perform services in this State in spraying bugs, and to use bug spray that is manufactured by that company in another State, and will be brought across State lines for the purpose of spraying?"
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,1836.849,1843.704,"--Justice Scalia, that's a difficult question, whether simply the fact that crossing State lines is commerce."
1994.93-1001,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1852.122,1853.243,"--No, but I'm not talking about residence."
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,1867.774,1870.536,--I don't know the answer to that question.
1994.93-1001,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1870.536,1870.837,"--Well, sure you do."
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,1874.289,1887.839,"My difficulty with your hypothetical, Justice Scalia, is that again it is hard to imagine, particularly if the performance of the contract involved consumers, that Congress could have intended to regulate that kind of transaction."
1994.93-1001,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1887.839,1888.821,"Well, but that's a different point."
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,1909.434,1932.19,"The way this contract was performed was that Terminix, through its local office in the same community where these people lived, sent a truck just a matter of a few blocks, or maybe miles, over to spray insects in their home, and Terminix can only point to two things which might offer some connection with interstate commerce."
1994.93-1001,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1952.615,1952.886,But that's not tenuous.
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,1961.313,1968.957,"Well, if Your Honor is speaking of the way that the contract was actually performed, we had no way of knowing that."
1994.93-1001,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1972.73,1981.286,"What about, wasn't the original seller of the home didn't say something about, wasn't there testimony, I want to go with a national company instead of a local company?"
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,1981.286,1982.067,"--Yes, Your Honor, the--"
1994.93-1001,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1982.067,1995.216,And may I ask you what you make of this Court's statement in Perry v. Thomas that the FAA embodies Congress' intent to provide for the enforcement of arbitration agreements within the full reach of the Commerce Clause?
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,1996.307,2009.477,"--Your Honor, I would feel that in the first place that statement in Perry v. Thomas is dictum because it was a State court case where that finding was not necessary to the holding of the case."
1994.93-1001,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2062.712,2071.12,"That was soundly rejected by the Court majority in Southland so far as the Federal Arbitration Act is concerned, any concept of federalism."
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2093.553,2104.091,"--I think that the Court needs to resolve the question concerning the jurisdictional reach of the statute, whether the statute applies in State or Federal court."
1994.93-1001,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2106.122,2114.36,"Well, the text of the statute doesn't draw any distinction between State or Federal courts if it's applicable."
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2121.442,2133.092,"Justice O'Connor, our reading of the legislative history is that first it was intended to apply as a procedural matter in Federal court, but given--"
1994.93-1001,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2133.092,2135.824,"Well, are you arguing that Southland be overruled?"
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2135.824,2137.073,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1001,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2146.4,2171.938,"Then you would have a different result, if that's your theory, if the, say Gwins, who are also defendants, if they moved to a State outside Alabama so you would have a diversity case, so the defendants could have removed... if you make a difference between the substantive law applicable in State and Federal court, and the, then you get into the whole mess that Erie was intended to eliminate, right?"
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2171.938,2184.146,"I would admit, Justice Ginsburg, that there are difficulties in the application of this act, as was fully pointed out in the majority and dissenting opinion in Southland."
1994.93-1001,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2200.857,2202.596,It was a square holding.
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2215.746,2217.238,Justice Scalia--
1994.93-1001,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2217.238,2228.796,"It's precisely the kind of a case where it's, especially in a field involving contracting, it's very hard to go back and overrule a prior decision without upsetting a lot of reliance."
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2228.796,2242.774,"--Justice Scalia, the only thing I can say to you in response to that is that I don't believe that the significance of Southland was fully appreciated until cert was granted in this case."
1994.93-1001,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2254.164,2273.986,Is one of the implications of your position that it is within the control of the parties to determine whether the Federal act is going to apply because they simply can be explicit in their original contract as to whether they understand that commerce will be affected or implicated?
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2273.986,2275.265,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1001,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2287.374,2293.489,"Well, is their statement of that contemplation in the original contract going to be conclusive, on your theory?"
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2327.414,2335.699,"If I understand your question, Justice Souter, it would be that the parties contemplate interstate commerce but in fact there is none?"
1994.93-1001,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2335.699,2336.468,"Well, no."
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2363.669,2391.816,"I don't know the answer to your question, and if I could be permitted to explain why I don't know, I can say that we view the contemplation of the parties test as an attempt to look at the practical consequences of what happened in the transaction under inquiry, and to give effect to what the reasonable expectations of the parties were."
1994.93-1001,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2391.816,2397.589,"Well, if it's reasonable expectations, then I suppose the answer to my question is no, that's not going to be conclusive."
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2397.589,2403.163,"The notions of foreseeability, Your Honor, are not foreign to our--"
1994.93-1001,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2403.163,2428.921,"So there's no way, I guess what I'm getting at is, there's no way, I gather, then, to simplify the administration that your position would sort of foist upon the courts, because no matter, no matter what the statement by the parties in their contract about what they contemplate, any one of them would be free at any time, I suppose, to say well, that just wasn't reasonable, and therefore I shouldn't be bound by it."
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2428.921,2432.414,--One of the... one of the objections that Terminix--
1994.93-1001,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2432.414,2433.283,"Well, is it... do you agree?"
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2438.636,2442.65,"--Not if the test is objective, which we say that it is."
1994.93-1001,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2446.533,2453.468,"Then isn't it much too easy, in a form contract, for the party who is writing the contract just to put in anything?"
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2461.753,2471.43,"--Again, we get back to questions about, what are the reasonable expectations of the parties, and what could they foresee, what could they reasonably foresee?"
1994.93-1001,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2471.43,2483.008,"But if you're going to go by what's on the face of the contract, isn't it so that in the case of a form contract, the party who writes the contract can put anything they want on the face of it?"
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2483.008,2483.699,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1001,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2483.699,2485.902,"If you have an objective test, that will be the end of it."
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2501.513,2503.553,"I agree with that, Your Honor."
1994.93-1001,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2544.271,2545.182,But it should be easy to say.
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2568.46,2595.808,"Well, Terminix makes that argument, Your Honor, that a practical solution to this problem is just to broadly construe the jurisdictional reach of the statute, and then you don't have to worry about tests, and for practical purposes maybe not all, but almost all contracts would be drawn within the purview of the statute, and we don't think, absent a clear congressional statement, that that was their intent."
1994.93-1001,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2595.808,2610.769,"You need a clear congressional statement for the proposition that Congress surely could not have intended that every such agreement as this would give rise to a potential lawsuit over arbitration, which was the point of Justice Scalia's question."
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2620.015,2622.045,To cover transactions like the one here?
1994.93-1001,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2622.045,2633.332,"Or any transaction in which there can, there is an invitation to litigation over what is in the contemplation of the parties, or the reasonable contemplation of the parties."
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2633.332,2649.592,"Your Honor, my answer to your question is yes, that I do believe you need a clear statement of congressional intent, and I would cite Your Honor to the Gulf Oil v. Copp Paving case, which I believe is very important to our... the analysis that we would urge this Court to take here."
1994.93-1001,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2705.738,2712.494,"Yes, but that case involved the, that statute deals with transactions in commerce as opposed to the affecting commerce standard in the Sherman Act."
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2712.494,2712.735,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1001,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2712.735,2717.8,"I really don't think, are you saying this should be read as in commerce and excluding everything affecting commerce?"
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2717.8,2727.755,"No, Your Honor, the... it... as I remember the language of that, of section 2, it was engaged in commerce, and the Court read engaged in to mean the same thing as in."
1994.93-1001,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2727.755,2729.478,"They same point they made in the Bunte case, yes."
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2729.478,2730.149,"Yes, sir."
1994.93-1001,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2730.149,2734.602,Do you agree with the Bernhardt formula?
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2745.669,2750.712,"No, Your Honor, we don't... we don't... we rely on the facts of Bernhardt."
1994.93-1001,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2755.076,2764.603,"But as far as Douglas' statement of what is involving commerce, do you accept that as a proper statement of the law?"
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2764.603,2765.652,"No, Your Honor."
1994.93-1001,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2770.066,2775.759,"So you think that the Court got it wrong on the law but right on the facts in that case, is that--"
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2775.759,2779.331,We think it was right on the facts.
1994.93-1001,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2799.784,2803.568,--It was a declaration of what those words meant in the statute.
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2803.568,2808.921,I can't... I can't express an opinion on exactly--
1994.93-1001,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2808.921,2822.648,"You said that the Perry words, that that was dictum, and the Douglas formula was wrong in Bernhardt, so where did the Court have a right answer in the majority opinion?"
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2822.648,2859.033,"--The answer that I would give you, Justice Ginsburg, is that the facts in that case speak very loudly, very clearly, that when a New York company is hiring a New York employee to go to Vermont and run their plant, that if the act reaches as broad as constitutionally permissible, that transaction must be regulated, and that is the position of Terminix in this case, is that's the reach which should be given to this act, and Mr. Farr has admitted that in his statements and in his brief."
1994.93-1001,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2859.033,2859.253,"Well, no."
1994.93-1001,1,15669,allan_r_chason,,2862.816,2874.134,"If I remember the facts of Wickard v. Filburn, Justice Stevens, one of the relevant facts in that case was that there was some machinery used from out of State."
1994.93-1001,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3322.747,3325.41,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.93-1001,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3473.936,3474.287,"Thank you, Mr. Farr."
