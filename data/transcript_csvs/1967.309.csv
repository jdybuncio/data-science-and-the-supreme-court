1967.309,0,40268,ronald_rosenberg,,29.555,33.582,May it please the Court.
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,3434.702,3437.852,May it please the Court.
1967.309,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3506.247,3507.777,I don't want to interrupt you but --
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,3507.777,3509.856,Surely.
1967.309,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3509.856,3513.537,But I'd be glad if you could state what I asked him earlier.
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,3513.537,3515.557,I would be happy to do it right now.
1967.309,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3515.801,3517.238,With no charge.
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,3517.238,3519.523,My charge.
1967.309,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3519.523,3523.351,(Inaudible) divide among themselves or take it with them?
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,3523.351,3525.056,"No, it is not limited to that."
1967.309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3955.337,3959.919,"Well, do your clients in this case play instruments?"
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,3959.919,3961.329,Do they play an instrument?
1967.309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3964.481,3966.661,"If Peterson leads all the time, he never plays an instrument."
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,3966.661,3967.741,Never plays an instrument.
1967.309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3967.741,3971.755,So we have to at least get phase up to the professional leader who never plays.
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,3971.755,3973.77,"Oh yes, there are quite a few of those."
1967.309,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3993.9,4004.43,"Did you say Mr. Schmidt that none of your clients could get an engagement in a hotel, nightclub and so forth in New York City unless he is a member of the union, did I understand you to say that?"
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4004.43,4020.22,"I didn't say that but it's practically true Your Honor because whenever an events of any kind, the required music are arranged with the banquet manager of the hotel and that's in the record undisputed."
1967.309,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4028.712,4030.442,I know but what do they say?
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4035.233,4035.933,Yes.
1967.309,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4035.933,4040.584,"Mr. Leader, you have to be satisfied to the union before we can employ."
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4040.584,4059.652,"Yes, there is a specific provision in Local 802 bylaws that says that the executive board of Local 802 must approve each orchestra leader and it reserves to itself the right to cancel the contract."
1967.309,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4059.652,4079.524,"Yes, but what about the -- does this union here have an agreement with any hotel to the effect that the hotel will hire orchestras only if the leader and the members are -- members that are associate -- affiliated with the union."
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4079.524,4086.776,They don't Your Honor have a written agreement containing that verbiage expressly.
1967.309,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4101.72,4109.511,Well then I gathered that your clients are the ones who have been expelled from the union could never get a job with a New York hotel.
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4109.511,4111.361,They couldn't get a job as an employee or --
1967.309,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4111.361,4113.163,"No, as a leader."
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4113.163,4119.231,"As a leader -- Your Honor, I must say that there are some few cases where leaders are employees."
1967.309,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4121.569,4123.252,"No, your clients, your clients."
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4123.252,4124.75,My clients?
1967.309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4146.595,4151.332,Do you at least know whether or not you're any of your -- your clients have been expelled from the union.
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4156.721,4159.56,"Some -- in some places, yes and in some places, no."
1967.309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4159.56,4170.055,"There must not be any, any flat rule that leaders who aren't members of the union may not get an engagement in a New York hotel."
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4170.055,4170.877,No Your Honor.
1967.309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4199.924,4201.489,"You mean, they could never lead there."
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4201.489,4202.597,That's exactly a point.
1967.309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4202.597,4204.258,They could book the engagement --
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4204.258,4204.624,That's right.
1967.309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4204.624,4205.808,-- but they have to hire a leader.
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4205.808,4208.622,"Yes Your Honor, yes Your Honor."
1967.309,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4208.622,4213.025,What was this negotiation that you said earlier Mr. Schmidt?
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4218.504,4218.928,Right.
1967.309,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4218.928,4220.543,And this was altered in an agreement.
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4221.605,4224.158,That's called the hotel agreement.
1967.309,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4224.158,4225.658,"Well, what is it?"
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4230.717,4241.026,"Well Your Honor, the terms of that agreement provide for example for payment into a welfare fund."
1967.309,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4267.538,4272.082,That is must make that contribution even though they are not member of the union?
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4272.082,4274.875,"That would be true even if they're not members of the union, yes Your Honor."
1967.309,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4292.246,4294.605,Well what -- is there anything at all in the agreement?
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4313.194,4314.998,Not at the present time Your Honor.
1967.309,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4333.942,4335.668,You said as a practice that's where it works.
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4335.668,4336.263,That's right?
1967.309,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4336.263,4345.948,"My next question is, is there anything at all in the agreement which -- by which the banquet manager agrees that he shall pay a certain minimum price?"
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4345.948,4346.837,Oh yes.
1967.309,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4347.011,4348.033,What's that?
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4348.033,4354.152,Well that's the minimum price which is made at the so called price meeting of Local 802.
1967.309,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4354.152,4365.733,"So even if one of your clients is willing to take the job for something less, this requires your client to take the price that's specified in the agreement of the union with the hotels?"
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4365.733,4366.45,Oh yes Your Honor.
1967.309,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4366.45,4369.107,But it's not really a price is it Mr. Schmidt?
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4395.798,4400.005,I don't think that's quite a fair way to point Justice Fortas -- may I --
1967.309,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4400.005,4402.787,I want you to state it as precisely as you can.
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4402.787,4404.74,I will.
1967.309,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4432.755,4433.76,What does that mean?
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4433.76,4440.566,"Well, that means that for example the grand ballroom of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel --"
1967.309,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4440.566,4441.814,You've got to employ a certain --
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4441.814,4451.768,"-- must have 12 musicians including the leader, including the leader because the leader is counted I this minimum quotas."
1967.309,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4461.402,4462.553,"Alright, what's the next one?"
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4462.553,4465.54,The third one is the leader's money.
1967.309,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4488.695,4490.691,"Wait a minute, who will be brought up on charges?"
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4490.691,4491.88,The leaders will be brought up on charges.
1967.309,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4491.88,4493.586,Even though they're not members of the union?
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4493.586,4495.72,"Well, yes in one sense only."
1967.309,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4507.876,4509.189,"Now, what's the next one?"
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4509.189,4512.129,"The fourth one, cartage fees."
1967.309,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4520.495,4521.613,What's next?
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4521.613,4523.894,The fifth is mileage fees.
1967.309,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4579.3,4581.38,That's paid through the leader.
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4581.38,4583.362,That's paid to the leader.
1967.309,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4616.541,4617.934,"Alright, any more?"
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4617.934,4630.821,"The tenth is the 10% traveling surcharge up to a certain point in the beginning of 1964, and that was a 10% addendum to the price because of traveling."
1967.309,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4654.058,4655.377,Is that all of them?
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4655.377,4656.502,"That's -- that's all of them, yes, Your Honor."
1967.309,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4656.502,4660.803,"Now, the union book does refer to those as price."
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4661.561,4672.854,"The union -- I don't know how to answer that, Your Honor because during the trial, the union attorney took the position that the words ‘price' and ‘wage' were interchangeable."
1967.309,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4672.854,4700.377,"Now, would you agree Mr. Schmidt that one of our questions is whether all of those are appropriately part of the wage agreement and the wage contract, or whether in fact they should be regarding it as a fixing of the price for a totality of a commodity or service in antitrust terms?"
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4700.377,4702.764,I think some of them pertain to price.
1967.309,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4702.764,4704.457,"That -- that's one of our issues, is it?"
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4704.457,4705.923,"Right, yes, Your Honor."
1967.309,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4705.923,4706.251,Alright.
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4706.251,4708.874,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.309,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4708.874,4710.133,"Now, let me get it clear, Mr. Schmidt."
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4710.133,4711.07,Surely.
1967.309,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4711.07,4738.208,"You're telling us that in New York City, one of your clients who's offered and engagement at any hotel or night club that is a party to this agreement with the union has to take from the hotel, whether he wants that much or not, a sum of money which is the total of all those items."
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4738.208,4742.065,"Yes Your Honor, when the -- when the hotel hires him."
1967.309,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4754.45,4758.891,"Well, I know, but the association must be charged this amount by the hotel, is that it?"
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4758.891,4761.081,"No, no, by my client in that case."
1967.309,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4761.081,4763.178,"I suppose Mr. Schmidt, it's arguable."
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4782.698,4793.863,"Well, I -- I took about four pages I believe in my reply brief to try to distinguish the Oliver case and I take the position personally that it is not relevant here."
1967.309,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4793.863,4796.104,"Well, I'm suggesting the possibility."
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4818.085,4827.651,"Oh, I don't think that you -- you can merely baptize these items as wages and then say, you see, it's nothing but a wage question."
1967.309,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4832.785,4834.662,"Well, what -- what label would you use, Mr. Schmidt?"
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4834.662,4835.183,I beg your pardon?
1967.309,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4835.183,4836.971,What label would you use?
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,4836.971,4842.759,"Well, I would say that for example, some of those items are clearly part of pricing and some are wages."
1967.309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5048.1,5071.917,"But I would suppose the union would claim that if that national association wanted to bargain with the union or the union wanted to bargain with that national association, that they could bargain and execute a collective bargaining contract in which the wage is to be paid by the members of the association to the sideman, etcetera, would be -- could be fixed."
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,5088.917,5092.096,"Well Your Honor, if I can approximate --"
1967.309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5092.096,5094.388,Then that claim wouldn't be any different than what it is here.
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,5094.388,5112.335,"That's right because -- because we did have one session between the representatives of the National Association of Orchestra Leaders and this union, and one of the things that we told them we couldn't do with them is fixed prices, which they wanted to do."
1967.309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5112.335,5123.035,"Well, this -- it seems to me like membership in the union is by independent businessmen -- independent leaders is really in effect the collective bargaining contract between them and the union."
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,5123.035,5126.571,"Well, if it -- if the -- I don't believe it is really a collective bargain --"
1967.309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5126.571,5128.147,It serves the same purpose.
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,5128.147,5132.844,If -- it might serve the same purpose but you certainly not arrive at the same way.
1967.309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5132.844,5134.135,I agree with you.
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,5134.135,5136.079,Because my clients have no word in it.
1967.309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5136.079,5136.667,That's right.
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,5136.667,5138.466,You understand.
1967.309,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5213.698,5215.579,What do they supervise?
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,5215.579,5219.53,They supervise the conduct of the particular engagement.
1967.309,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5548.702,5552.393,"Well your action is solely against the New York local, isn't it?"
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,5552.393,5563.247,"Oh no, Your Honor, because many of the price fixing lists appear right in the -- the bylaws of the AFM itself."
1967.309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5922.173,5924.447,(Inaudible)
1967.309,1,26075,godfrey_p_schmidt,,5924.447,5932.015,"Your Honor, I specified them in more -- in my brief somewhere, but I don't remember the number offhand."
1967.309,2,40268,ronald_rosenberg,,6174.188,6174.94,May it please the court.
1967.309,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6216.497,6218.253,Do you challenge any of the findings?
1967.309,2,40268,ronald_rosenberg,,6218.253,6219.494,Do we challenge any of the findings?
1967.309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6326.569,6335.418,What's the interest of the union in specifying that the leader -- leader's compensation shall be twice that of the sub-leader?
1967.309,2,40268,ronald_rosenberg,,6335.418,6342.558,"Because the – just as the union has the right to say when a musician plays two instruments, he will receive a certain amount more."
1967.309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6344.153,6347.394,I don't think that's at least but relevant.
1967.309,2,40268,ronald_rosenberg,,6381.07,6397.152,"Because typically in this field, and it was stipulated, Your Honor, that in those fields in which the leader is admittedly an employee under the findings of both courts below, the -- so the recording in television, the leader always receives a -- an amount two times."
1967.309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6397.21,6401.159,So what's the union's interest in saying that it must be twice?
1967.309,2,40268,ronald_rosenberg,,6410.41,6417.305,"That's no different than the union is saying, is it does, Your Honor, that the -- a musician who performs on two instruments shall receive and additional amount."

1967.309,2,40268,ronald_rosenberg,,6429.965,6433.324,"In that particular circumstance, Your Honor, he does not receive two times."
1967.309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6448.605,6461.997,"But why is it the union attempt to regulate what this fellow -- what the leader charges for his efforts in managing the orchestra, getting the engagement and supervising the whole affair?"
