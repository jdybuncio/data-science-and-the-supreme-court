1974.73-1689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,45.907,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-1689, United States against American Building Maintenance."
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,50.418,55.276,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,215.32,216.164,We'll resume there --
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,216.164,216.328,Right.
1974.73-1689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,216.328,217.263,-- at 1 o'clock Mr. Wilson.
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,217.263,231.923,"Fine, thank you Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-1689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,231.923,235.772,Mr. Wilson you may continue.
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,235.772,241.933,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,718.075,723.815,Had the department taken out after any merger such as this before?
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,723.815,726.686,"I think so Mr. Justice White, I think we have --"
1974.73-1689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,726.686,728.403,Can you give me a couple of examples?
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,728.403,738.875,Bennington Bank where the question was as to the jurisdictional -- not the jurisdictional reach of the act but rather --
1974.73-1689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,738.875,741.739,"So it wasn't a question, that wasn't the question then."
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,741.739,743.745,No but it's a merger of the same type --
1974.73-1689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,743.745,744.641,"Well, that I know but --"
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,744.641,756.027,"-- and that I think is very important because a question here is, does the jurisdiction of the act extend to this kind of a merger?"
1974.73-1689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,760.811,775.851,"Well, you wouldn't do and suggest the department regularly since 1914 as to take in this position and has attempted to apply the act to corporations that were engaged solely in intrastate commerce."
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,779.402,782.729,"Well, I think the problems with which we are dealing --"
1974.73-1689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,782.729,784.909,"Well, has it or has it not?"
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,784.909,788.31,"I think in recent years, yes sir it has."
1974.73-1689,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,808.557,827.542,"Mr. Wilson, on page 36 of your brief at the top of the page of the first sentence states that previous Section 7 cases have involved both acquiring and acquired firms that have been engaged in the floor of commerce."
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,838.503,849.938,"Mr. Justice Powell, I agree that this is the first case in this Court which clearly presents the question of whether the acquisition by an interstate firm."
1974.73-1689,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,874.122,882.554,You referred to the dissatisfaction of Congress in 1914 with the limitation of the Sherman Act.
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,894.427,912.43,I think the Congress Mr. Justice Powell has indicated that it wants us to bring this kind of a suit where the result of the acquisition is going to be in the words of the statute substantially to lessen competition.
1974.73-1689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,922.535,929.967,"Yes, but it refused to put the words affecting commerce in the Act."
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,929.967,933.567,"Oh, I don't Mr. Justice White, I don't think it has."
1974.73-1689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,933.567,935.629,"Though there have been -- I'll put it this way, there have been proposals."
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,935.629,950.784,There have been proposals but one cannot rely as this Court has recognized on the failure of Congress to act on a specific proposal as an indication of Congress' intent in enacting a statute which has already enacted one way or the other.
1974.73-1689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,950.784,962.108,But you certainly wouldn't rely on a failure to amend the statute to show that Congress expresses some dissatisfaction or is the way the department of justice for enforcing the act?
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,962.108,964.339,"Oh, heavens, no, One has to --"
1974.73-1689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,964.339,966.779,"Well, what other evidence is there?"
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,966.779,978.78,"Well, there is the evidence of Congress and it's -- the statements of its intention in 1950, again, it came back to the Clayton Act in 1950."
1974.73-1689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,978.838,997.882,"Well, I take it then that the -- under your -- under the department's position now that the act don't mean exactly the same if the words engaged in commerce or any act at all?"
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,997.882,1000.295,"Read, engaged and/or affect in commerce."
1974.73-1689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1000.295,1001.126,"Well, I know but lets just take them out."
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,1001.126,1002.059,Or indeed --
1974.73-1689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1002.059,1003.331,Let's just take them out.
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,1016.02,1016.458,Yes sir.
1974.73-1689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1016.458,1017.603,The way you want to construe it.
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,1017.603,1018.219,Yes sir.
1974.73-1689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1018.219,1019.564,So those are just surpassing.
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,1019.564,1020.904,I think that is correct.
1974.73-1689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1020.904,1022.269,And you must take that position?
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,1022.269,1026.146,Yes sir.
1974.73-1689,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1338.394,1345.803,"But the amendment simply added the acquisition of assets to stock acquisition, that was basically what it did, isn't it?"
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,1345.803,1358.336,"That's right, it did not Mr. Justice Stewart in any way change what the jurisdictional requirements had been in 1914."
1974.73-1689,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1358.336,1400.783,"Right, that's what I thought and it -- does it carry a very far to -- now you undoubtedly must think it does because you spend a good deal of time in your brief on oral argument but I wonder how far does it carry you just to say that Congress intended to implement, add to, effectuate, amplify the Sherman Act both in 1914 and again in 1950 when it enacted and then amended the Clayton Act because we -- it's clear from the language of the Clayton Act that in many ways it did add to the Sherman Act but in certain other ways, it very clearly have -- was more limited than the Sherman Act quite apart from the question now before us."
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,1420.402,1443.35,"Well, I think it is more limiting in the sense that it limits the substantive offense under the Clayton Act that there is no indication in any of the legislative history that Congress intended the jurisdictional reach of the Clayton Act to be less than the jurisdiction which Congress had exercised under the Sherman Act."
1974.73-1689,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1443.35,1466.198,"You can argue about what jurisdictional means but certainly no matter how strangling of competition potentially at least, the acquisition of an individual person's assets might be even though that person was engaged in commerce by somebody else engaged in commerce, Section 7 simply doesn't reach it as a matter --"
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,1466.198,1466.997,Simply by it terms.
1974.73-1689,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1466.997,1471.755,"Statutory scope or jurisdiction if you want to call it that, isn't that correct?"
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,1471.755,1473.981,"Well, I don't think the substantive offense --"
1974.73-1689,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1473.981,1474.318,Precisely.
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,1474.318,1475.406,-- is so defined.
1974.73-1689,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1475.406,1476.564,Precisely.
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,1476.564,1477.385,"Now, if Congress jurisdiction --"
1974.73-1689,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1477.385,1480.0,"Even though the -- well, go ahead."
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,1480.0,1488.375,"If Congress jurisdictionally wanted to reach that, there's no doubt that they could and the question is did they intend to reach this kind of a merger."
1974.73-1689,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1488.375,1498.252,"And there's no doubt that if Congress wanted to exercise their full power, the same Sherman Act power and with respect to Section 7 of the Clayton Act, they could, everybody agrees on that."
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,1501.067,1502.325,And our answer to that is yes.
1974.73-1689,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1502.325,1502.515,Yes.
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,1502.515,1502.936,They did.
1974.73-1689,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1502.936,1504.409,"And your brother's answer is no, they didn't?"
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,1504.409,1505.178,That is correct.
1974.73-1689,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1505.178,1511.402,That's the case.
1974.73-1689,0,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,1511.402,1525.362,"Now, coming back just for a moment to Mr. Justice White's question as to what kind of acquisitions was Section 7 designed to reach."
1974.73-1689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1635.309,1638.75,Very well.
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,1639.893,1644.991,Mr. Chief Justice and may the Court please.
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1886.575,1888.988,Do you think this was inadvertence?
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,1888.988,1907.438,I think that this was -- that this -- their argument that they're making in their brief and their argument they make today is an effort to reach a problem which arose in this case and this is the first time that they've used it as a means of taking care of this case.
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1907.438,1917.634,"But you don't -- you think -- you don't think this case was brought, was the idea of reaching farther with Section 7 that hadn't been reached before?"
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,1917.634,1919.039,I do not.
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1919.039,1923.133,You take the idea in the first place was that these corporations were engaged to commerce?
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,1923.133,1934.357,I thought perhaps they felt that they're -- they hardly conceive that there was anyone who had such local operation as the Benton Corporation.
1974.73-1689,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2171.979,2177.844,But you're not suggesting are you that the case went back to the District Court Mr. Mattson.
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2188.779,2194.975,"No, I don't think they could support the situation at all."
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2411.642,2424.866,"I suppose -- suppose one of these building companies are both -- say both the janitor companies, maintenance companies were -- bought a couple of $100,000.00 a year of piece of goods from outer state, would that --"
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2424.866,2426.702,You mean directly from out of state?
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2426.702,2427.176,Yes.
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2427.176,2429.674,You would have a more difficult question.
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2429.674,2433.718,But at least they would have -- to some extent they would be then engaged in commerce?
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2433.718,2442.692,They might have come within -- then come within part of the Government's contention if you could prove that those purchases affected interstate commerce.
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2442.692,2447.736,"Well, let's assume they -- well yes, for jurisdictional purposes."
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2447.736,2448.12,Yes.
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2448.12,2454.834,They'd still have -- they'd have a problem of proof about the line of commerce of whether there would be affect on commerce.
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2459.94,2462.346,I'm not prepared to concede that.
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2470.924,2477.517,"Well, they've -- all their supplies or most of their supplies, they buy it from out of state directly, let's assume that."
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2477.517,2481.888,"If that's an assumption, it is possible to so state."
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2484.061,2497.613,"But instead of buying from 10 suppliers from out of state, they buy it from wholesaler in California who buys in turn all those supplies from out of state, you see that breaks the flow."
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2497.613,2499.101,Yes I do.
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2508.668,2519.946,"Well, I will change my -- let's assume that you would concede that if they bought directly from out of state, they would be engaged in commerce first."
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2519.946,2521.745,I'm willing to start in that assumption.
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2521.745,2523.145,But I know you don't want to agree with that.
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2523.145,2524.51,Right.
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2524.51,2530.886,"But you say it makes all the difference if they -- instead of doing it directly, they buy from a wholesaler, from the California wholesaler?"
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2530.886,2531.156,Right.
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2531.156,2534.108,"That changes the case completely, no jurisdiction."
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2534.108,2535.718,That's the assumption.
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.903,2538.572,You say that would be the legal result?
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2538.572,2538.993,Right.
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2538.993,2541.282,That the flow of commerce has broken with the wholesaler?
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2541.282,2545.23,"Yes, very much so."
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2545.23,2552.064,"And that's some -- some Clayton Act cases, jurisdictional cases on that point?"
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2552.064,2553.106,I don't think this is the first case.
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2553.106,2554.165,"There aren't any, are they?"
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2554.165,2561.428,There aren't any and I think the reason for that is that the statute is so explicit.
1974.73-1689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2561.428,2567.403,But what is the factor or does this record show what the factors -- where the mops and the pails and things?
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2567.403,2567.444,Yes.
1974.73-1689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2567.444,2569.263,Are they purchased from a wholesaler?
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2569.263,2571.225,They're purchased all in California.
1974.73-1689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2571.225,2573.269,"Yes I know, but from a wholesaler?"
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2573.269,2575.776,"Well, or a distributor or whatever you might call him."
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2575.776,2579.322,"But those distributors also shows, those distributors buy from out of state."
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2579.322,2583.471,"Yes, they buy it part from out of state."
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2593.938,2595.193,Of the distributor?
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2595.193,2596.155,Yes.
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2599.616,2610.399,"You don't have any figures on what these two maintenance companies bought, what supplies they bought that had the origin on the state."
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2610.399,2616.447,The record doesn't show any figures that you can point to with that regard.
1974.73-1689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2646.355,2651.353,"How about -- any of these employees, maintenance employees, window washers will have to heights?"
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2651.353,2652.167,Oh yes.
1974.73-1689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2652.167,2653.464,The wear of harness?
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2653.464,2653.853,Yes.
1974.73-1689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2653.853,2656.104,I take it those come from out of state?
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2656.104,2658.863,I really don't know.
1974.73-1689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2890.147,2906.871,"I recall some discussion of the proportion of the total cost of the acquiring company and of the acquired company particularly and it's overwhelmingly the cost of labor, is it not?"
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2906.871,2907.739,Oh yes.
1974.73-1689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2911.663,2914.122,Only a small percentage in the material?
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2914.122,2918.136,"Right, very small, it's 3% as I recall."
1974.73-1689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2918.445,2918.617,The cost --
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2918.617,2934.26,-- its total gross income is in the -- the Government's position with reference to the legislative history is ambivalent.
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2945.989,2970.325,"Well, as in -- are you suggesting in your argument that in order to -- of course that the issue is not here I take it but are you suggesting that the -- that to satisfy the latter part of Section 7, the impact on any line of commerce, that the impact, the substantially lessening of competition would have to result only from activities in commerce?"
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2970.325,2971.191,"No, I do not."
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2971.191,2971.759,"Yeah, alright."
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2971.759,2975.616,"The commerce part of Section 7 is the first part, they engaged in commerce."
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2975.616,2976.489,I understand.
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2976.489,2977.806,The operative part.
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2977.806,2984.39,But the effect on the line of commerce could be delivered by wholly intrastate?
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2984.39,2985.088,Exactly.
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2985.088,2985.953,"Okay, thank you."
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2985.953,2988.37,And this case is brought upon that theory.
1974.73-1689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2993.266,2993.6,Thank you.
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,2993.6,3001.393,But you have to get in to -- the only way to get in to Court perhaps is by means of the jurisdictional point.
1974.73-1689,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3001.393,3004.105,In any section of the country can be purely intrastate?
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,3004.105,3005.037,Yes.
1974.73-1689,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3005.037,3006.876,As it was in Von's for example --
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,3006.876,3007.267,Right.
1974.73-1689,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3007.267,3007.716,As alleged to be here.
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,3007.716,3012.437,"Right correct, and as it could be here."
1974.73-1689,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3012.437,3014.1,Or as alleged to be here?
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,3014.1,3014.278,Yes.
1974.73-1689,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3014.278,3014.781,Southern California again?
1974.73-1689,1,36307,marcus_mattson,,3014.781,3019.06,It is alleged only in Southern California.
1974.73-1689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3338.11,3340.048,Mr. Mattson.
1974.73-1689,2,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,3343.524,3348.001,"Mr. Chief Justice, I arise to make but one short point."
1974.73-1689,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3374.541,3380.067,Has the Government abandoned the notion that these companies were engaged in commerce?
1974.73-1689,2,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,3380.067,3389.353,They were engaged in commerce within the meaning of that -- of those words for the jurisdictional purposes of the Clayton Act.
1974.73-1689,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3389.353,3397.02,Are you saying they were engaged in commerce without having to rely on the effect notion?
1974.73-1689,2,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,3398.42,3414.925,"No, I think we have to say that the affecting commerce in any section of the -- in any line of commerce in any section of the country, that's what gets this merger within the scope of the Section 7 of the Clayton Act."
1974.73-1689,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3414.925,3421.793,But you argue that -- you argue that these people were sufficiently dealing directly in interstate commerce.
1974.73-1689,2,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,3421.793,3429.204,"Well, they were, there were certainly dealings in interstate that gives directly in interstate commerce."
1974.73-1689,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3429.204,3437.504,"Well, on that basis you don't need any change, any redefinition of engaged in commerce at all."
1974.73-1689,2,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,3437.504,3444.268,"Well, the District Court of course found that those dealings were de minimis."
1974.73-1689,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3444.268,3444.511,But you don't agree with that.
1974.73-1689,2,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,3444.511,3451.51,"If -- we don't agree with that but if one accepts the District Court's findings, we say that nevertheless --"
1974.73-1689,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3451.51,3453.944,"Well, you're not abandoning your --"
1974.73-1689,2,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,3453.944,3454.023,Oh no sir.
1974.73-1689,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3454.023,3455.921,-- charge to the District Court's findings.
1974.73-1689,2,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,3455.921,3457.561,No sir.
1974.73-1689,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3461.014,3461.883,Go ahead.
1974.73-1689,2,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,3461.883,3464.851,There is one case which is directly on point.
1974.73-1689,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3497.257,3497.855,Mr. Wilson could I interrupt you here.
1974.73-1689,2,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,3497.855,3500.613,Yes sir.
1974.73-1689,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3500.613,3516.789,"Before you sit down, would you expand a little bit on what your response is to your oppositions rely on some of the comments to Senator Sparkman and member Dickson in the 1958 debate?"
1974.73-1689,2,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,3516.789,3528.024,"Well, I think one has to come back to the -- a position taken by an administrative agency cannot be used subsequently to stop the intent of Congress in passing a statute."
1974.73-1689,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3561.384,3570.897,At what point could you fix the time when this sort of maintenance became a nationwide business on a large scale?
1974.73-1689,2,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,3570.897,3575.251,"Well, I think one has to look at the growth of the service industries generally."
1974.73-1689,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3584.356,3588.623,"Not precisely but at something in the last decade, 15 years?"
1974.73-1689,2,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,3588.623,3591.682,"Yes sir, 10 to 15 years."
1974.73-1689,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3592.23,3603.283,"Pretty much the same history as the -- or at least comparable history to the private security business protecting industries and office buildings, things of that kind."
1974.73-1689,2,18132,bruce_b_wilson,,3603.283,3605.601,"I think that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-1689,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3606.924,3607.604,Thank you gentlemen.
