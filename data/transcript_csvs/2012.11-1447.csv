2012.11-1447,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,"We will hear argument next this morning in Case 11-1447, Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District."
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,9.522,12.308,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1447,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,38.023,38.756,Let's back up.
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,68.192,69.91,--That is correct.
2012.11-1447,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,77.814,91.908,"And if he had offered nothing and he just said, I want this permit to develop my land, and the agency said, You have offered no mitigation, we deny your permit, would he have a claim?"
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,91.908,113.756,"If there was no condition attached to the permit denial, then there would be no claim; although it would be up to the district, under Nollan and Dolan, to make the individualized determination, both of the amount of impact to wetlands and the amount necessary to offset."
2012.11-1447,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,113.756,125.731,"Suppose he just put in the application, no mitigating -- no mitigation of any kind, and the agency says no."
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,131.718,134.753,"It depends, Your Honor."
2012.11-1447,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,174.762,175.328,For what?
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,178.014,180.449,--He wouldn't know where--
2012.11-1447,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,180.449,185.62,You are posing a situation in which he never came forward with any suggestion.
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,190.204,191.406,--Not for--
2012.11-1447,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,191.406,192.423,A taking of what?
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,192.423,202.481,"--Not for a taking, Your Honor, but he -- he may have a cause of action under Nollan and Dolan for the imposition of an unconstitutional condition that may not -- the contours of which may not be known."
2012.11-1447,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,206.449,210.568,I think the other side says that you may have such a cause of action here.
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,210.568,212.503,"--Excuse me, I didn't understand."
2012.11-1447,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,212.503,220.693,Wouldn't -- wouldn't the other side in this case acknowledge that you have such a cause -- that you may have such a cause of action here?
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,220.693,222.793,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-1447,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,224.461,227.279,They are just saying you don't have a cause of action for a taking.
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,227.279,229.798,--That is correct.
2012.11-1447,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,253.38,256.282,"Counsel, I've had a problem with your argument, okay?"
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,314.987,328.895,"--Justice Sotomayor, we don't contest the legitimacy of the policy, of course, in preserving wetlands; nor do we contest, for that matter, the ratios that the district has imposed via its regulations."
2012.11-1447,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,348.141,374.943,"I think you -- I think you have a problem with that, Mr. Beard, because if you look at the record, the record is very clear that it was not -- that the district didn't come back and say, Take it or leave it, you -- you improve our wetlands or you get no permit."
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,440.635,448.574,"Justice Ginsburg, it's true that there were negotiations and that a range of offers were made."
2012.11-1447,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,469.271,492.27,"And that is because he wouldn't go beyond what he was offering, but that's -- some of these options -- one was that he -- that he adjust the size of his project, that he make it smaller."
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,515.568,517.985,"--I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg?"
2012.11-1447,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,518.787,532.495,"If they said, we will give you a permit if you reduce the scale of your project to 1 acre, and then preserve the rest by a conservation easement."
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,532.495,541.001,"--Unlikely not, Your Honor, because the trial court did conclude based on the evidence that he was having minimal impact on any viable wetlands."
2012.11-1447,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,578.124,582.943,"Mr. Beard, can I go back to Justice Ginsburg's first question and make sure I understand your answer to it?"
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,625.004,628.806,My answer was that he may have a Nollan-Dolan claim.
2012.11-1447,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,635.662,644.351,"Well, that's the next question I was going to ask you, because my understanding of Nollan and Dolan was that it assumed the conditions, if taken alone, would constitute a taking."
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,645.934,647.62,"I do not disagree with that, Your Honor."
2012.11-1447,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,647.62,648.103,Okay.
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,663.979,664.295,Right.
2012.11-1447,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,688.863,699.819,"Suppose the district did have, as I think it did here, a uniform policy that for every acre you develop, you have to preserve 10 wetlands, 10 acres of wetlands."
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,741.497,752.853,"The crux is not that he had to go offsite, but that -- that did play into the trial court's analysis as to the connection between his impact and what was being required."
2012.11-1447,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,763.661,769.815,So in my hypothetical you would -- would there be a violation in my hypothetical as you understood it?
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,769.815,781.057,"It depends, Your Honor, because you have to determine what in each respective hypothetical, what the impact was actually to the wetlands, and then determine what the appropriate mitigation--"
2012.11-1447,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,781.057,784.324,How do you decide whether the agency has done that right or not?
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,784.324,785.424,--Excuse me?
2012.11-1447,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,785.424,787.46,How do you normally decide?
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,821.45,828.687,"In the normal circumstance, if there was no condition imposed, there would not be a Nollan and Dolan claim."
2012.11-1447,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,836.809,838.126,It would be an inverse condemnation.
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,838.126,840.011,Correct.
2012.11-1447,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,841.947,858.057,"So what I think might be driving some of these questions is the district court says, just as you say, had Koontz offered additional mitigation, the additional, that would have cost $10,000, he would have gotten the permit."
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,989.959,998.399,"Justice Breyer, Nollan and Dolan fundamentally are about whether a property owner has been singled out to bear public burdens."
2012.11-1447,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,998.399,1013.409,"But of course, they are land claims because they took a piece of land which everybody assumes -- right in front of his house -- and said you've got to let everybody from the beaches walk back and forth from one beach in the north to another one in the south."
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,1026.132,1035.738,"Because you can have an unconstitutional condition imposed on your right to do something, in this case make use of your property."
2012.11-1447,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1036.438,1037.607,Of course you can.
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,1044.678,1057.854,--Penn Central is a special takings case that goes to the question of whether a regulation of the use of property that is sought to be developed has gone too far so as to affect the taking.
2012.11-1447,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1059.504,1063.24,Which -- how does that not address going too far?
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,1092.575,1103.983,--We're entitled under the Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine to not have to bear a public burden that has no bearing on the impact that we're trying to use on our property.
2012.11-1447,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1103.983,1104.919,"Yes, that's fine."
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,1120.278,1130.634,"What has been -- what has been taken in effect is his funds that have to be put now to a public use, the enhancement of 50 acres of public wetlands."
2012.11-1447,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1134.188,1135.738,It hasn't -- it hasn't been taken.
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,1138.306,1140.675,"--Nothing was taken in Nollan and Dolan, either."
2012.11-1447,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1144.46,1150.697,The -- the -- the permit was granted in Nollan and Dolan.
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,1174.063,1179.967,"Justice Scalia, in Nollan and Dolan, there was approval -- approval with conditions."
2012.11-1447,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1218.442,1200.546,All right.
2012.11-1447,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1219.075,1220.477,Sliced bread's supposed to be good.
2012.11-1447,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1220.477,1222.244,"No, no, it's been proved bad."
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,1275.36,1285.652,"Justice Breyer, there is another part, a very distinct part, and that part goes to the question of the condition that produced the denial."
2012.11-1447,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1345.107,1347.474,Suppose the record just doesn't bear that out.
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,1379.495,1408.431,"--We agree that there were negotiations and that even in the orders allege that various options were provided to Mr. Koontz, but ultimately the decision, as the district admits, the decision, the final decision to deny the permit application for 3.7 acres of use was Mr. Koontz's refusal to acquiesce in the condition that he perform 50 acres of offsite improvements."
2012.11-1447,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1410.549,1412.016,Where -- where is that?
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,1412.016,1420.155,"--It's in the Joint Appendix, pages 70 to 71, which is the pretrial statement where each party sets forth his and her position."
2012.11-1447,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1474.224,1480.443,"Mr. -- Mr. Beard, I don't think anybody is contesting that there was a condition imposed or maybe there are."
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,1510.499,1523.906,"I want to be clear that we're not saying that all monetary fees or exactions would be subject to Nollan and Dolan, only within the permit context, the special context of land use permitting."
2012.11-1447,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1523.906,1524.439,"No, I understand."
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,1537.832,1540.101,Correct.
2012.11-1447,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1555.527,1568.268,"So -- so, for example, and I'll try to do this very quickly, if -- if the State just had a policy for every acre of wetlands you fill in, it costs us $10,000, you need to pay $10,000, that's subject to Nollan and Dolan analysis, too."
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,1568.268,1574.589,"--Correct, it would be subject to Nollan and Dolan analysis to determine if they're really on the ground, there's a connection between the impact--"
2012.11-1447,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1574.589,1579.143,"No, it would be subject to Nollan and Dolan analysis if they took the $10,000."
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,1664.165,1668.117,"--In Nollan and Dolan, Your Honor, nothing was taken, either."
2012.11-1447,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1686.078,1687.114,The permit had issued.
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,1697.303,1700.838,--The permits in Nollan and Dolan actually did not issue.
2012.11-1447,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1711.127,1712.329,There was no approval with conditions.
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,1727.089,1738.21,"--But in either case he faces the threat, the unconstitutional condition on his use of his property: You don't get your use until you comply with our conditions."
2012.11-1447,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1738.979,1740.946,I have one question.
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,1752.554,1755.906,--No.
2012.11-1447,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1766.63,1770.432,And I will afford you some additional time since our questioning intruded on yours.
2012.11-1447,0,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,1770.432,1770.932,Thank you.
2012.11-1447,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1770.932,1773.951,Mr. Wolfson?
2012.11-1447,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1773.951,1777.354,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2012.11-1447,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1807.457,1813.027,Does it make any difference in his refusing to do anything more whether the condition is onsite or offsite?
2012.11-1447,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1813.027,1817.229,"I don't think it makes any difference, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.11-1447,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1839.528,1840.545,State law provisions you are talking about.
2012.11-1447,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1840.545,1840.878,--Correct.
2012.11-1447,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1841.212,1848.016,What about is there anything in the Federal Constitution that limits the conditions that you can demand?
2012.11-1447,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1848.016,1853.67,"I don't -- not -- not -- if I understand your question, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think so."
2012.11-1447,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1881.422,1884.641,"But there is no, there is no restraint on the agency."
2012.11-1447,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1888.326,1893.647,"--Well, I don't -- I think that Penn -- first of all, I think there are many restraints on the agency."
2012.11-1447,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1897.014,1899.816,Do you know of any case where the government has lost a Penn Central case?
2012.11-1447,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1899.816,1900.35,Yes.
2012.11-1447,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1909.839,1912.624,May we -- I'm sorry.
2012.11-1447,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1912.624,1913.643,It does -- it certainly doesn't--
2012.11-1447,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1913.643,1915.443,It doesn't happen very often.
2012.11-1447,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1915.443,1918.445,"--Well, it is -- certainly the burden is on the landowner."
2012.11-1447,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1950.333,1960.189,"Just to nail it down, your position is that there is no limit in the Federal Constitution on what the agency can demand as a condition for the issuance of a permit?"
2012.11-1447,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1960.189,1961.874,"--No, no, no, I don't think that is our position."
2012.11-1447,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1969.313,1971.713,But the Takings Clause does not.
2012.11-1447,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1971.713,1981.537,"If the conditions are so onerous that it would make it essentially impossible to derive any value from the land, that may very well call into question Penn Central or Lucas."
2012.11-1447,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1988.108,1997.88,"Suppose -- suppose the agency said, we are really short of revenue; we will let you develop your land if you contribute a million dollars to our new football stadium."
2012.11-1447,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1997.88,2003.551,"Justice Kennedy, I think that that may very well raise a Penn Central or Lucas claim."
2012.11-1447,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2005.236,2006.32,It doesn't raise Penn Central.
2012.11-1447,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2009.538,2010.238,"--Well, it's not--"
2012.11-1447,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2010.238,2011.974,It does not deprive the land of all value.
2012.11-1447,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2015.826,2043.945,"--It's not a Nollan or Dolan claim is my point, Justice Kennedy, and it's not a Nollan or Dolan claim because it's not a -- the, as my friend acknowledged, the question in Nollan and Dolan or the rationale of Nollan and Dolan is would the condition by itself, if demanded unilaterally and outside the permitting context, would that have been a taking of property for which just compensation would have been required."
2012.11-1447,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2043.945,2045.161,Sure it would have been.
2012.11-1447,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2059.054,2063.239,"I think that would -- I mean I think that would violate, could well violate the Due Process Clause."
2012.11-1447,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2091.342,2096.663,I'm trying to understand what would be -- what would be left of Nollan and Dolan if we agree with you.
2012.11-1447,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2108.22,2109.37,Yes.
2012.11-1447,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2109.37,2110.02,Okay.
2012.11-1447,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2118.076,2142.874,"I think in that situation, in other words, if the situation is really exactly the same like Nollan and Dolan, but the permit is denied but it's clear that it is a concrete -- concrete condition, the landowner can go up through the judicial review process and say, this is -- you know, the denial of the permit application is predicated on an unconstitutional condition, and you should set that aside."
2012.11-1447,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2142.874,2146.428,Is that the same as the first example for purposes of Nollan and Dolan?
2012.11-1447,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2146.428,2147.562,Almost.
2012.11-1447,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2149.045,2149.547,All right.
2012.11-1447,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2161.772,2186.737,"Justice Alito, I think that this Court's decision, this Court decision in Village of Norwood, essentially says if what is going on is just a pure contrivance to avoid the requirement of compensation in the Just Compensation Clause, that the Court has said, no, it will look through to the substance of the demand and determine that there was -- you know, essentially an evasion of the just compensation requirement."
2012.11-1447,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2186.737,2191.041,"As I understand your position, cash is magical, right?"
2012.11-1447,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2205.149,2209.919,"First of all, Justice Scalia, of course this case we don't believe involves cash."
2012.11-1447,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2229.249,2229.549,Right.
2012.11-1447,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2229.549,2232.034,--is that it has no logical stopping point.
2012.11-1447,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2233.134,2234.82,The stopping point is don't take my cash.

2012.11-1447,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2695.301,2696.487,"Now, that is a problem."
2012.11-1447,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2698.522,2698.939,Right.
2012.11-1447,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2731.86,2736.695,I think that your point goes to the question that has been raised about -- there's no permit issued.
2012.11-1447,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2755.525,2758.893,"--No, that's not our argument, Mr. Chief Justice."

2012.11-1447,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2867.699,2871.317,"Justice Ginsburg, I think that the district thought that they were acting roughly proportional."

2012.11-1447,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3001.885,3003.153,What was taken in Nollan and Dolan?

2012.11-1447,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3013.526,3029.721,"Well, but it -- wasn't what was taken unreasonably the ability of this homeowner to make the alterations to his house that he wanted to make?"
2012.11-1447,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3041.362,3064.359,"The basis of the -- the theory of Nollan and Dolan, and the Court made this clear in Lingle and in Delmonte Dunes, for that matter, is those two cases apply in a specific situation where there is an exaction of a right of access, an easement for the public to enter the land as a condition."
2012.11-1447,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3140.926,3143.494,What about -- what about the football stadium?
2012.11-1447,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3166.026,3173.347,--I think in that situation there would be a very substantial equal protection challenge because one landowner is being singled out with no rational basis.
2012.11-1447,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3173.347,3181.269,But the one constitutional provision that is concerned with protecting property owners from having to bear burdens that should be borne by the public at large is not applicable?
2012.11-1447,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3181.269,3189.475,"Well, that -- it applies when there is an identifiable property taken--"
2012.11-1447,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3189.475,3189.975,"No, no."
2012.11-1447,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3200.766,3201.832,"--Right, right, right."
2012.11-1447,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3201.832,3220.561,"And to say that I can't put a house on this because I'm supposed to pay for a football field, which has nothing to do with it, is as close to insisting that you have to have 4,000 columns of coal in your mine so that you can never use it as I can think of."
2012.11-1447,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3221.68,3222.513,"Well, certainly--"
2012.11-1447,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3222.513,3223.48,At least that argument would be made--
2012.11-1447,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3223.48,3224.298,--Certainly--
2012.11-1447,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3224.298,3225.365,--And why wouldn't it be a winning argument?
2012.11-1447,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3225.365,3230.702,"--Certainly a Penn Central argument could be made there, but I think that's very different from a Nollan argument--"
2012.11-1447,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3230.702,3231.586,I agree with you--
2012.11-1447,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3231.586,3238.724,--which -- which imposes the -- the burden on the government and basically treats the payment of money as itself a taking.
2012.11-1447,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3238.724,3243.343,"Mr. Kneedler, can I go back to the questions presented for a moment?"
2012.11-1447,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3266.975,3267.309,Yes.
2012.11-1447,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3271.277,3271.594,Right.
2012.11-1447,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3298.994,3300.446,We think--
2012.11-1447,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3300.446,3307.934,"Assuming we narrow it not to undifferentiated money, but is there a difference between a denial or a grant?"
2012.11-1447,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3307.934,3308.517,--No.
2012.11-1447,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3363.619,3376.761,"Do you agree -- your friend on the other side cited a number of places in the record where he thought your condition was satisfied, that the denial of the permit was expressly based on the failure to comply with the offered conditions."
2012.11-1447,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3376.761,3389.252,"Well, if you look at the orders denying the permit applications in the record at, I believe it's 49 to 51 and 59 to 61."
2012.11-1447,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3404.079,3405.695,Isn't this unreal?
2012.11-1447,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3437.983,3443.204,But the ultimate standard under the statute is whether he has provided reasonable assurances.
2012.11-1447,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3460.129,3476.304,"--What he's going to say in part is, I guess, I did a little numbers from your brief, the 37 million acres in Florida, say about 4 million are bodies of water, and say a third of them are built up, and we have 11 million that are wetland and 11 million that aren't."
2012.11-1447,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3498.135,3501.187,I think it's clearly not like the Shriners Hospital--
2012.11-1447,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3501.187,3501.706,I know you'll say that.
2012.11-1447,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3502.772,3507.86,--But I did want to come back to Justice Scalia's question.
2012.11-1447,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3527.171,3533.158,You made the reference -- you are making Nollan and Dolan a trap only for really stupid districts -- you know.
2012.11-1447,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3536.962,3544.949,"--Well, I don't think so because -- because there are situations in which an agency actually wants to get the easement."
2012.11-1447,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3554.304,3559.475,"It shouldn't matter whether the -- whether the permitting authority says expressly in the denial,"
2012.11-1447,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3570.35,3587.728,"--If may I answer, because the agency has to reserve, has to have the ability to deny the permit because the conditions required by the statute were not met, and Nollan and Dolan deal with formality and the formality of conveyance of an easement."
2012.11-1447,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3593.881,3595.348,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."

2012.11-1447,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3634.292,3646.183,"What do we do with what Mr. Kneedler says is a ruling in your favor on this question, that all denials are subject to Nollan and Dolan?"
2012.11-1447,3,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,3679.821,3688.843,"--Justice Sotomayor, I don't believe that negotiations will suddenly break down, and we will see a flurry of permit denials if the Court rules in our favor."
2012.11-1447,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3708.341,3709.007,But they're not.
2012.11-1447,3,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,3724.766,3732.456,"--No question that we all are subject on a daily basis to government demands that we pay, that we have a financial obligation."
2012.11-1447,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3732.456,3737.174,So what happens in just -- when the legislature passes a development fee?
2012.11-1447,3,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,3740.376,3764.058,"If the legislation requires an agency who processes a permit to impose a fee in exchange for a permit -- again, within the land-use context, we are not talking about taxes, homeowners fees, we are talking within the discretionary land-use process -- that is imposed there, then the risk of coercion, undue influence and the like arise and Nollan and Dolan should apply."
2012.11-1447,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3786.774,3787.793,Finish your thought.
2012.11-1447,3,37730,paul_j_beard_ii,,3787.793,3791.911,"--The offense there is the conditioning, the improper conditioning of a permit."
