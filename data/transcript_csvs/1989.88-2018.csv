1989.88-2018,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.904,"We'll hear argument next in Number 88-2018, Illinois v. Edward Rodriguez."
1989.88-2018,0,29488,joseph_claps,,22.496,28.583,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-2018,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,165.453,173.058,Did the officers ask her if she was currently living in the apartment?
1989.88-2018,0,29488,joseph_claps,,173.058,179.379,That specific problem... that specific question was not directly asked.
1989.88-2018,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,199.709,200.892,But he didn't ask that question?
1989.88-2018,0,29488,joseph_claps,,200.892,202.478,--He didn't ask that specific question.
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,990.277,998.264,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-2018,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1050.066,1056.053,To what extent in your view do the police have a duty of inquiry in order to support the reasonableness of their decision?
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1056.053,1061.641,"Justice Stevens, we do not believe that the police should have a mandatory duty of inquiry in each case."
1989.88-2018,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1106.653,1111.723,"In this case, do you think the police officer had any duty to ask the young lady if she lived there?"
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1111.723,1116.091,"I think that in the facts of this case, the police officers acted quite reasonably."
1989.88-2018,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1116.091,1116.591,"Well, I understand that."
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1118.627,1119.427,No.
1989.88-2018,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1170.928,1175.297,"Well, it would have been pretty simple for them to ask a few more questions, wouldn't it?"
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1175.297,1176.347,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor--"
1989.88-2018,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1176.347,1185.403,And you're asking for an exception to the warrant requirement which is something paramount in the Fourth Amendment requirements.
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1196.043,1207.101,"--Justice O'Connor, I think it would be fully appropriate for this Court to hold that appropriate inquiry is necessary when the facts are ambiguous and clarification is what a reasonable police officer would do."
1989.88-2018,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1275.579,1276.346,"Well, Counsel--"
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1276.346,1276.846,--to find out a little bit.
1989.88-2018,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1276.846,1279.198,--I have a hypothetical.
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1292.54,1293.873,"Justice Marshall, I don't think--"
1989.88-2018,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1293.873,1295.492,Would you let me finish?
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1306.848,1308.098,--No.
1989.88-2018,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1312.05,1313.116,"Well, this is the same case."
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1313.116,1316.935,"--No, this is not the same case because there is a context involved here."
1989.88-2018,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1316.935,1317.22,All right.
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1323.207,1329.861,In this case the victim of the battery described the apartment as being her apartment and she produced a key.
1989.88-2018,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1337.883,1338.933,She said she used to live there.
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1341.418,1344.037,"--Well, there... there's... I would like to clarify the record for--"
1989.88-2018,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1344.037,1346.203,Is it your position that the police shouldn't have such a question?
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1346.203,1352.643,"--In this case I do not think it was required for the police to ask, but I think that is a question that the Illinois courts--"
1989.88-2018,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1352.643,1354.826,So the police can just walk in wherever they want to walk in?
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1354.826,1357.695,"--No, not if they don't have a reasonable basis for doing that."
1989.88-2018,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1357.695,1358.63,They're going to get killed one of these days.
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1358.63,1367.117,The question that arose as to whether the transcript reflects that the police testified that she used to live there--
1989.88-2018,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1367.117,1367.486,She said she didn't.
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1369.919,1376.341,--The testimony reflects that the police understood her to say that she had been living there and she had a key and she would let them in.
1989.88-2018,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1376.341,1377.524,Which meant she didn't live there then.
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1377.524,1380.21,"Well, the Illinois courts did not reach that finding."
1989.88-2018,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1388.999,1391.518,And she had just been beaten up the night before?
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1391.518,1393.818,--She had been beaten up that very day.
1989.88-2018,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1393.818,1395.736,"Yeah, that very day in that apartment."
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1395.736,1395.902,Yes.
1989.88-2018,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1398.688,1418.499,"Mr. Dreeben, what other cases do we have where... where reasonableness of... of... of proceeding without a warrant or the reasonableness of the search and seizure is determined not on the basis of objective fact reasonableness but just on the basis of mental impression reasonableness?"
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1418.499,1422.386,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I would suggest that this is based on objective fact."
1989.88-2018,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1521.883,1525.87,xxx some suggestion that they didn't have probable cause in this case?
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1525.87,1527.453,"--No, I think, Justice White, in this case they--"
1989.88-2018,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1527.453,1532.691,"Well, I mean if they didn't have probable cause, they had no business going in the house at all."
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1532.691,1539.177,"--No, I think, Justice White, an entry based on consent of someone who has authority to do it or--"
1989.88-2018,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1539.177,1541.546,"I know, but they went there... they went there to arrest the man."
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1541.546,1542.879,"--That's correct, Justice White."
1989.88-2018,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1542.879,1545.581,"And they thought they had probable cause, and I guess they did."
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1545.581,1546.164,Yes.
1989.88-2018,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1552.835,1555.103,Without a warrant in order to make the arrest.
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1555.103,1562.674,"--That's correct, because it was a consensual entry based on the authority of one who appeared to have the ability to do that."
1989.88-2018,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1562.674,1567.16,But the position you're taking is that they could have gone in there without probable cause.
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1569.779,1570.362,Provided--
1989.88-2018,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1570.362,1571.596,Since she... since she let them in.
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1571.596,1572.648,--That's correct.
1989.88-2018,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1572.648,1578.052,"And you say on these facts, if they... even if... even if there hadn't been the beating... the beating is really quite irrelevant, isn't it?"
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1578.052,1580.552,That's certainly not a necessary pre-condition--
1989.88-2018,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1580.552,1580.852,Right.
1989.88-2018,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1589.008,1591.36,--I see that my time has expired.
1989.88-2018,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1592.995,1593.962,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
1989.88-2018,2,32494,james_w_reilley,,1595.595,1598.716,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1989.88-2018,3,29488,joseph_claps,,2909.454,2911.656,"Yes, Justice... Chief Justice."
1989.88-2018,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2911.656,2913.342,You have four minutes remaining.
1989.88-2018,3,29488,joseph_claps,,2913.342,2924.548,"I want to first say that the statement by counsel, although I'm sure it wasn't on purpose, is not correct about what was argued before the trial judge in the suppression hearing."
1989.88-2018,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3126.195,3128.547,"Thank you, Mr. Claps."
