1972.72-459,0,28652,israel_packel,,65.235,69.622,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-459,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,372.435,377.384,Thank you Mr. Attorney General.
1972.72-459,1,43916,william_bentley_ball,,396.155,399.991,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.72-459,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1333.625,1341.108,Thank you Mr. Ball.
1972.72-459,2,27879,henry_t_reath,,1344.596,1348.752,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-459,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1451.301,1454.346,You want us to count these up and decide on plurality?[Laughter]
1972.72-459,2,27879,henry_t_reath,,1454.346,1457.348,"No sir, not at all, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1972.72-459,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2387.136,2397.341,"Mr. Reath, before you sit down, you know, worded to what’s the difference between this case and Wolman against Essex, there was a firm that's involved?"
1972.72-459,2,27879,henry_t_reath,,2397.341,2399.235,There are several very fundamental differences.
1972.72-459,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2404.586,2406.36,"Because it is 23% of cigarette tax, right?"
1972.72-459,2,27879,henry_t_reath,,2406.36,2407.724,Yes sir.
1972.72-459,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2407.724,2408.942,It doesn't require appropriation?
1972.72-459,2,27879,henry_t_reath,,2408.942,2410.889,That is correct.
1972.72-459,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2410.889,2412.452,What else -- anything else?
1972.72-459,2,27879,henry_t_reath,,2412.452,2417.558,"Well, there are other differences in the structure of the Act."
1972.72-459,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2444.765,2445.768,And devise a --
1972.72-459,2,27879,henry_t_reath,,2445.768,2449.041,Devise and here that has been completely eliminated.
1972.72-459,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2449.041,2449.73,Okay thank you.
1972.72-459,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2449.73,2450.439,Mr Reath.
1972.72-459,2,27879,henry_t_reath,,2450.439,2451.947,Yes sir.
1972.72-459,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2451.947,2458.106,A Statement from Mr. Brewster which you read in the papers filed with the court --
1972.72-459,2,27879,henry_t_reath,,2458.106,2459.295,My closing statement?
1972.72-459,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2459.295,2463.811,"It's the one – no, the statement you read from the President of Yale, Mr Kingman Brewster."
1972.72-459,2,27879,henry_t_reath,,2463.811,2465.494,"No sir, it is not."
1972.72-459,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2474.259,2477.28,"Well if the statement wasn't in the records below, the record is clear then?"
1972.72-459,2,27879,henry_t_reath,,2477.28,2477.868,But it was read.
1972.72-459,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2483.018,2485.238,Was that in his annual report?
1972.72-459,2,27879,henry_t_reath,,2485.238,2487.617,It was in the --
1972.72-459,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2487.617,2488.659,President's annual report?
1972.72-459,2,27879,henry_t_reath,,2488.659,2494.563,"Yes sir, it was in the President's annual report for the -- the report of the President of Yale University for 1970-71."
1972.72-459,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2494.563,2501.983,Alright.
1972.72-459,2,27879,henry_t_reath,,2501.983,2502.977,Thank you Your Honors.
1972.72-459,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2502.977,2508.57,Mr. Reath.
1972.72-459,3,43056,theodore_r_mann,,2509.772,2512.819,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.72-459,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2810.461,2813.469,What about the Everson case?
1972.72-459,3,43056,theodore_r_mann,,2813.469,2820.528,The Everson case sir is probably the only exception to the analysis I was about to make.
1972.72-459,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2820.528,2820.827,Oh!
1972.72-459,3,43056,theodore_r_mann,,2822.03,2838.618,"And with Your Honors' permissions because I think it's quite distinguishable, that in Tilton versus Richardson of course, this Court made clear to all of us that indeed a state can provide money directly to a church institution, so provided that the propose is proper."
1972.72-459,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3026.317,3048.587,"But now in Everson and in Allen, did the Court not say explicitly that the fact that the program, books in one case, bus rides in the other, encourages more people to send their children to a church related school or private school is not controlling?"
1972.72-459,3,43056,theodore_r_mann,,3048.587,3051.791,Yes they did and I think the Court was absolutely correct.
1972.72-459,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3083.394,3097.236,"Well, the Attorney General course put it a little different perhaps not as roughly as I am about to restate it, but it was to keep as many as possible of the children out of the overcrowded public schools?"
1972.72-459,3,43056,theodore_r_mann,,3097.236,3100.414,I think it's two sides of the same coin.
1972.72-459,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3138.332,3147.306,"But can't you equally say that the purpose is to continue to give the kids a private, non-public education rather than a sectarian education."
1972.72-459,3,43056,theodore_r_mann,,3151.545,3165.915,"Yes the matter of fact it's true that the states -- if a 100% of the children went to non-sectarian private schools, the state's purpose would be accomplished in the same way, that is absolutely correct sir."
1972.72-459,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3165.915,3171.208,But it have to be 100% to say that that was a valid state purpose?
1972.72-459,3,43056,theodore_r_mann,,3171.208,3172.694,"Well, I am sorry I didn't hear that?"
1972.72-459,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3172.694,3177.578,Would they need to -- would it need to effect a 100% of this 20%.
1972.72-459,3,43056,theodore_r_mann,,3195.946,3213.283,"In terms of whether it passes constitutional muster on the primary effect test, I don't think it makes any difference whether 50% of the kids are going to private non-sectarian and 50% to private sectarian or whatever the percentage is, I don't think it makes any difference."
1972.72-459,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3407.074,3415.33,"So your argument -- what you are saying is if Pennsylvania said, we will give you half of your tuition, but never anymore?"
1972.72-459,3,43056,theodore_r_mann,,3415.33,3418.851,"Yes sir, by all means, by all means."
1972.72-459,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3418.851,3432.644,"Although you to the extent that his entire duration is paid, you say necessarily then the state is financing that part of the education that, that is religious also?"
1972.72-459,3,43056,theodore_r_mann,,3432.644,3442.118,"Well, clearly here we have the state may be paying the entire tuition because if it's less than a 150 – the entire tuition is a $150, the child gets a $150."
1972.72-459,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3454.721,3455.993,Your argument remains much the same?
1972.72-459,3,43056,theodore_r_mann,,3455.993,3457.608,"My argument remain the same, yes sir."
1972.72-459,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3457.608,3461.788,And your constitutional argument would be the same as it was $10?
1972.72-459,3,43056,theodore_r_mann,,3461.788,3464.625,"Yes, sir it makes no difference at all."
1972.72-459,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3464.625,3476.122,"Then the difference is in Everson case and the Allen case, text books and buses, what about that?"
1972.72-459,3,43056,theodore_r_mann,,3476.122,3477.261,I am not --
1972.72-459,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3477.261,3480.564,"Well, than you are to go with Everson, don't you?"
1972.72-459,3,43056,theodore_r_mann,,3480.564,3512.591,"Well, I don't know that I am so much in trouble [Laughter] as you know any attempt sir, it will take all of the Court's previous decisions and apply them in a symmetrical way to every church state case that comes before the Court, is going to meet with some trouble and I will grant Justice White that, but I think the Everson case gives me some problems, it gave the Court problems and as I understand it some of those who voted in favor of it that now sit on this Court have indicated if they had to do it over again, they wouldn't."
1972.72-459,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3612.702,3623.059,What about a returning veteran who has not had a high school education and goes to a Catholic high school at age 18?
1972.72-459,3,43056,theodore_r_mann,,3623.059,3640.734,"What I reminded of sir is some of the Court's opinions or concurring opinions or dissenting opinions, I do not remember now which, years ago we used to cite Bible reading in the public schools which had not yet been declared unconstitutional as saying well how about Bible reading of the public schools."
1972.72-459,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4066.715,4072.704,"Mr. Mann, what is the balance of the cigarette tax go?"
1972.72-459,3,43056,theodore_r_mann,,4072.704,4077.638,"I am not sure sir, the attorney general does know?[Laughter]"
1972.72-459,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4077.638,4078.987,77%.
1972.72-459,3,43056,theodore_r_mann,,4078.987,4083.908,"77% balance, I do not go where it goes for other purposes and I do not know what they are."
1972.72-459,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4083.908,4088.945,What did this -- where did this 23% of the tax used to go?
1972.72-459,3,43056,theodore_r_mann,,4088.945,4111.548,"I believe -- I cannot answer that because I believe, but I am not certain that the 1968 law that was invalidated by this Court was initially funded through the harness raising receipts and then was funded by the cigarette tax which I think was increased for that purpose, but I am really not certain and I am not helping the Court by --"
1972.72-459,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4111.548,4113.728,I was going to ask if there has been an increase in the tax?
1972.72-459,3,43056,theodore_r_mann,,4113.728,4116.955,I think there was but I am not sure I am sorry.
1972.72-459,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4269.713,4272.375,Thank you Mr. Mann today.
1972.72-459,4,43916,william_bentley_ball,,4278.661,4279.518,If I may.
1972.72-459,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4279.518,4279.813,You may.
1972.72-459,4,43916,william_bentley_ball,,4279.813,4288.644,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.I will save you 30 seconds Mr. Reath."
1972.72-459,5,27879,henry_t_reath,,4445.258,4453.107,"Your Honors please, just a simple matter with what Mr. Ball said in response to Mr. Mann's statement about the character, the aided activity."
1972.72-459,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4520.82,4521.372,Thank you gentlemen.
