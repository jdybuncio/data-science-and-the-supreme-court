1975.74-1047,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,74.614,"We will hear arguments next in 1047, Hills against Gautreaux."
1975.74-1047,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,75.515,78.045,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1975.74-1047,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,318.936,330.972,"Mr. Solicitor General in the District Court, did the plaintiffs' request for a metropolitan remedy, was it accompanied by a prayer to join the outlying housing authorities?"
1975.74-1047,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,330.972,333.15,I do not recall whether there was a prayer at that stage.
1975.74-1047,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,337.159,339.178,I mean before the Court of Appeals?
1975.74-1047,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,339.178,341.893,"Well, I believe there was a request."
1975.74-1047,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,465.576,469.969,Are you arguing in a sense into the absence of indispensable parties?
1975.74-1047,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,469.969,471.903,I am not actually Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1975.74-1047,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,494.523,505.102,Do you defend the District Court’s refusal to permit the joining of these outlying districts for the purpose of offering proof?
1975.74-1047,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,505.102,505.677,No.
1975.74-1047,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,822.566,825.769,"With that geographical restriction, if any?"
1975.74-1047,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,825.769,829.309,"Well, I think they may deal with private developers."
1975.74-1047,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,833.444,837.82,That was within a -- given metropolitan community or --?
1975.74-1047,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,837.82,839.154,Yes.
1975.74-1047,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,868.22,880.094,Does HUD have authority of imminent domain to condemn land itself or must it operate through State and Local Housing Authorities?
1975.74-1047,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,880.094,887.436,"It must operate through communities, State or Local Housing Authorities or with private developers under certain limitations."
1975.74-1047,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,896.172,901.337,"But some Federal Agencies do have power of imminent domain, is that not?"
1975.74-1047,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,901.337,902.888,I believe that is true.
1975.74-1047,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,902.888,906.696,But had you represent trust that they do not have that power?
1975.74-1047,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,906.696,907.291,That is correct.
1975.74-1047,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,909.198,920.757,They would have authority in your view to to enter into a contract with a private builder to erect a housing project contrary to local zoning laws --
1975.74-1047,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,920.757,922.077,No.
1975.74-1047,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,922.077,932.393,Does not the decree of a -- does not the final paragraph of the opinion of the Court of Appeals in effect mandate that?
1975.74-1047,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,932.393,944.016,"When I think what is going to happen and in fact mandates if it work, but respondents say that the decree does not allow them to nor do they wish to override local zoning ordinance."
1975.74-1047,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,961.097,975.683,"But since the Local Agencies, the Local Housing Authorities and the Local Governmental Bodies were not parties to the case, what sanction will that be to compel and to comply with the --?"
1975.74-1047,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,975.683,986.6,"Well, I assume Mr. Justice Powell either in this case or in a separate case we will then have serious of litigation about whether refusal to make zoning changes or variances was discriminatory."
1975.74-1047,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,988.604,1004.026,"But certainly Judge Austin if he is still on the case or if his successor might well feel that the issue of the availability of a metropolitan remedy would be foreclosed in favor of a metropolitan remedy by the Court of Appeals opinion here, might it not?"
1975.74-1047,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1004.026,1014.412,"I think that Judge Austin, with the direction in that opinion and that order is bound to feel that he has to enter some kind of a metropolitan remedy."
1975.74-1047,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1369.184,1390.861,"Mr. Solicitor General, what if there had been as there was not before the Court of Appeals ruling, a hearing in the District Court after a complaint in which all of the outlying authorities had been joined and there had been a finding by the District Court of inter-district violations on the part of all."
1975.74-1047,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1393.379,1406.701,"That would put the case in an entirely different posture Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but we have here the remedy appropriate to a case which is not here which is our problem."
1975.74-1047,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1472.401,1475.022,How did this come in to the record?
1975.74-1047,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1475.022,1490.2,Respondents' counsel drew this map and put it into the record to indicate that there were no alternatives available to respondents to move into public housing in white areas outside of Chicago.
1975.74-1047,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1490.2,1492.105,"Well, how was it authenticated?"
1975.74-1047,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1492.105,1494.954,"I do not believe, I mean, I am subject to correction, but I do not believe it is authenticated."
1975.74-1047,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1498.933,1503.57,Was it admitted an evidence in some factual proceeding in the District Court?
1975.74-1047,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1503.57,1503.718,No.
1975.74-1047,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1556.615,1558.947,Does Robbins have its own Housing Authority?
1975.74-1047,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1558.947,1564.957,"Well, it has its own government, I do not know if it has a Housing Authority because many of these communities do not have Housing Authorities."
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,1682.408,1686.441,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1047,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1735.104,1743.404,Would the power of exercise -- of imminent domain have to be exercised by someone to implement this decree?
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,1743.404,1750.194,It would have to be exercised Your Honor by private developers or by Local Housing Authorities and not by HUD.
1975.74-1047,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1838.364,1846.944,"Mr. Polikoff, what and is you conceive the decree that would be required under the remand of the Court of Appeals?"
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,1851.855,1853.421,"It might have none, Your Honor."
1975.74-1047,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1853.421,1856.196,But what so -- but might it have some?
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,1856.196,1869.392,"It might have an indirect impact and one of the problems is we cannot know because as my first of two points and I have not even told you yet what the second is, my first of two points was that an order might be confined to HUD alone."
1975.74-1047,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1955.342,1965.854,But how can you justify the imposition of that second condition as against outlying authorities who have never had an opportunity to litigate any of these questions?
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,1965.854,1966.833,We do not.
1975.74-1047,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2077.324,2083.529,Is that argument suggest that perhaps it is premature for us to grapple with the issues involved here?
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,2083.529,2086.158,I think it does Your Honor and --
1975.74-1047,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2086.158,2096.134,"It is the same I gather is there is no order yet, none of us knows what the contours will be, none of us knows the impact on the outlying municipalities, indeed even the impact on HUD?"
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,2096.134,2097.428,That is exactly correct.
1975.74-1047,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2138.614,2143.929,"I mean, with our recent summary affirmance in the Delaware school, desegregation (Voice Overlap)."
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,2143.929,2145.628,"I am, Your Honor."
1975.74-1047,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2145.628,2152.776,"You recall there, it was proposed that the District Court consider a metropolitan remedy in the school desegregation case."
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,2152.776,2153.426,That is correct.
1975.74-1047,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2153.426,2163.843,"But have not in fact entered a decree involving, providing a metropolitan remedy and we summarily affirmed, that was an appeal of course."
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,2165.91,2168.681,I think that emphasizes the prematurity.
1975.74-1047,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2194.577,2204.807,Yet do you not have to say that the Court of Appeals then too was premature in saying as it did that there should be a metropolitan remedy?
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,2204.807,2213.157,I do Your Honor and I must say with deference to the Court of Appeals that I am not here defending that opinion per se.
1975.74-1047,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2251.286,2258.877,In this respect is this not case and very much the same posture that the Milliken case was when it came here?
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,2258.877,2259.784,Not at all Your Honor.
1975.74-1047,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2318.901,2320.345,It was affirmed and approached though?
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,2320.345,2332.801,"It affirmed and approached, but with a clear indication that in -- it was a long Court of Appeals’ opinion Your Honor will recall, in a number of specifics that the District Court had indicated, that was the right way to go."
1975.74-1047,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2356.552,2358.754,You do not mean -- you mean out of Chicago?
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,2358.754,2362.005,"Out of Chicago, it would not involve them at all."
1975.74-1047,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2363.0,2365.378,But thatis what the Court of Appeals was talking about?
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,2365.378,2377.406,"The Court of Appeals was talking Your Honor, about the desirability on the record made in this case of area wide, but not multi district relief."
1975.74-1047,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2514.871,2530.773,"But even if those housing authorities are not as you say, decreedly involved, if HUD is to be enjoined by the Court to treat them in a manner otherwise, then it would voluntarily treat them, ought they not to have had an opportunity to be heard on that question?"
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,2530.773,2537.047,We insist that they should and I have been agreeing with you Mr. Justice Rehnquist is that should have been the procedure followed.
1975.74-1047,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2670.192,2678.635,"That if I might suggest that is what you have just said to us, you do not agree that the -- you do think that the opinion at least sweeps over broadly?"
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,2678.635,2679.471,Correct.
1975.74-1047,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2680.777,2684.674,So a dismissal leaving that stand probably would not be (Inaudible).
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,2684.674,2696.238,The second alternative and in my view by far the preferable one because this has been a long lasting litigation and clarity is desirable.
1975.74-1047,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2736.612,2737.751,Was the limitation that you just suggested --
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,2737.751,2749.646,"With limitation that I -- well, what I am suggesting is a limitation as to an appropriate order that might be entered by the District Court, but the District Court would not be confined to that."
1975.74-1047,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2765.205,2774.525,"Do you rather, more like a modification of the remand of the Court of Appeals and District Court and does an affirmance as to both."
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,2774.525,2777.542,I agree with that Your Honor.
1975.74-1047,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2777.542,2782.57,It is an affirmance in that you think we ought to agree that the case ought to be remanded to the District Court.
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,2782.57,2783.756,Yes.
1975.74-1047,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2787.659,2789.646,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,2789.646,2789.985,Pardon me?
1975.74-1047,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2789.985,2793.129,"You want the District Court to hold the hearing, you do not want just issue an order?"
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,2793.129,2793.878,That is correct.
1975.74-1047,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2803.013,2819.513,"You said as I understand it, that when it came to the District Court, the District Court can say, would be free to say if he is so concluded that under Milliken he could not go beyond the boundaries of Chicago?"
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,2819.513,2841.231,"The District Court would not in our judgment be free to say that soundly and correctly because as I have indicated it is my first and principal point here Mr. Chief Justice Burger, that an order confined to HUD, even though it extended area wide to the housing market area, but did not involve other parties would not be an inter-district order under Milliken."
1975.74-1047,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2841.644,2851.003,"What kind of an order would go to HUD to say exercise your -- to the Secretary, exercise your discretion according to the following guidelines?"
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,2851.003,2852.798,Not quite that way.
1975.74-1047,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2919.303,2932.012,"But that is the authority of the District, the Federal District Judge to tell the Executive Branch how to exercise its discretion?"
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,2932.012,2939.029,"The authority, I would say the duty stems from the adjudication of liability against HUD."
1975.74-1047,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2957.368,2959.975,(Inaudible) identify here when you referred to that the --
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,2959.975,2994.541,"The Solicitor General emphasizes and properly so that HUD’s wrong was in a sense secondary because it consisted of funding and approving actions of another agency, but we insist and I think also correctly so that the Court of Appeals was right in finding that HUD’s activities, although understandable were nonetheless an independent basis of wrongdoing and violated both the Constitution and the Civil Rights Act."
1975.74-1047,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2994.541,3000.391,All of that relate simply to the Chicago Housing Authority as I understand it.
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,3016.665,3018.09,That is correct Your Honor.
1975.74-1047,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3048.117,3060.693,But your theory in the District Court that was upheld by the Court of Appeals on the first appeal was that HUD’s violations had been secondary as a result of pressure from Chicago Alderman.
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,3081.397,3082.057,I think not.
1975.74-1047,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3215.528,3218.531,"The school districts are geographic units, they were politically units?"
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,3218.531,3219.743,"Both, that is correct Your Honor."
1975.74-1047,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3219.743,3221.607,And here to you have political units?
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,3221.607,3240.709,"And the political unit that is relevant with respect to HUD is of course the entity, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which has chosen an administrative area that expands beyond the boundaries of the Local Housing Authorities who may not even be participants at all in a part of the remedial scheme we are talking about."
1975.74-1047,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3241.554,3247.837,"In Milliken, you have the State of Michigan with an overall regional educational policy and powers?"
1975.74-1047,1,16768,alexander_polikoff,,3247.837,3248.734,That is correct.
1975.74-1047,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3298.441,3301.548,Mr. Solicitor General.
1975.74-1047,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3301.548,3303.764,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1975.74-1047,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3340.919,3351.391,"Well, my question suggest is not a hearing about a remedy, but a question about whether there had been an initial wrong and then presumably if a finding of a wrong?"
1975.74-1047,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3351.391,3362.471,"I quite agree in that case if the respondents' counsel wants to file a new case or amend this case and start a new lawsuit about an inter-district violation of the fact, of course."
1975.74-1047,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3424.3,3430.64,As I understand the position would that the Court might not issue any decree at all?
1975.74-1047,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3430.64,3431.911,The Court might not.
1975.74-1047,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3446.862,3449.861,(Inaudible) would be modified.
1975.74-1047,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3463.498,3463.633,Oh.
1975.74-1047,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3465.874,3470.755,But what they are asking for and to see whether or not there is not some relief that HUD could give.(Voice Overlap)
1975.74-1047,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3470.755,3471.08,Well that is a different --
1975.74-1047,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3471.08,3473.812,Not that HUD must do it?
1975.74-1047,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3473.812,3476.508,I think it is a different lawsuit Mr. Justice Marshall.
1975.74-1047,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3532.116,3538.536,(Inaudible) HUD consider it as a region and wipe out the line and reconsider it?
1975.74-1047,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3538.536,3541.909,"No sir, Mr. Justice Marshall, it does not wipe out the lines."
1975.74-1047,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3541.909,3547.105,"You mean that HUD does not look at five, six or more counties around in the city?"
1975.74-1047,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3547.105,3547.834,HUD may do that.
1975.74-1047,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3547.834,3553.072,And look at it as a unit without regard to district lines?
1975.74-1047,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3553.072,3569.077,"HUD looks at it for planning purposes, but when it is finished planning, it does not implement a plan which is inconsistent with the Local Communities Housing Assistance Plan for example."
1975.74-1047,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3592.552,3603.691,"Do you think that HUD would generally say -- could cooperating in unconstitutional sites selection, was it not your trouble area?"
1975.74-1047,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3603.691,3604.265,No.
1975.74-1047,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3613.376,3619.06,"Well, I know but that is -- I will ask you again, what about that injunction applied to the Chicago housing area as a (Voice Overlap)."
1975.74-1047,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3619.06,3621.788,"Oh the area, I am sorry, I am sorry."
1975.74-1047,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3622.203,3623.869,It is just not the kind of an order?
1975.74-1047,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3623.869,3625.077,A best-efforts order.
1975.74-1047,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3625.077,3625.518,Yes.
1975.74-1047,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3637.562,3649.508,I do not see the legal predicate for an order against HUD in the Chicago housing area anymore because it did something wrong in Chicago.
1975.74-1047,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3649.508,3659.478,"(Inaudible) I suppose something that is not in the record in this case that is, that is someone is beating his wife, and therefore, stop beating your wife?"
1975.74-1047,3,16768,alexander_polikoff,,3659.478,3663.652,"I think I would Mr. Chief Justice, in fact I think that to be consistent --"
1975.74-1047,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3663.652,3673.84,(Inaudible) apparently you do not challenge the -- at least here this is lawsuit and the constitutional violation by HUD in Chicago.
1975.74-1047,4,38778,robert_h_bork,,3676.752,3678.13,That is quite correct Mr. Justice White.
1975.74-1047,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3679.441,3684.346,You do not mind being ordered to stop violating the constitution in the Chicago housing area?
1975.74-1047,4,38778,robert_h_bork,,3684.346,3693.142,"HUD is not being shown to and does not, to the best of my knowledge to violate the Constitution in anyway in the Chicago Housing Area and it is not doing it in the City of Chicago."
1975.74-1047,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3693.142,3694.169,(Voice Overlap) you do object to it?
1975.74-1047,4,38778,robert_h_bork,,3694.169,3696.725,I certainly do Mr. Justice White and let me explain why.
1975.74-1047,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3716.891,3729.666,"(Inaudible) who are operating in the Chicago Housing Area, that operate inside Chicago, then we do have an issue post and I guess that is what the lawsuit is all about?"
1975.74-1047,4,38778,robert_h_bork,,3729.666,3735.864,I must Mr. Justice White there has been no showing of a predisposition on the part on the part of HUD to this.
1975.74-1047,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3762.754,3774.364,What was the basis for the Court of Appeals (Voice Overlap) remarks that at least had initially thought that a District Right remedy -- a metropolitan remedy was appropriate?
1975.74-1047,4,38778,robert_h_bork,,3774.364,3784.846,"Well, HUD does think that it ought to work as its statutory mandate requires throughout the metropolitan area."
1975.74-1047,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3792.158,3797.583,Do you think the Court of Appeals misread whatever it was that HUD represented --
1975.74-1047,4,38778,robert_h_bork,,3797.583,3801.156,"I think the Court of Appeals did, Mr. Justice White and I think respondents' counsel too."
1975.74-1047,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3827.325,3828.293,Thank you gentlemen.
