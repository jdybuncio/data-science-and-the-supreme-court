1984.83-963,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,68.227,"Ms. Managhan, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,68.227,72.346,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-963,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,142.376,143.509,On what grounds?
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,143.509,161.904,"It is my understanding the grounds for the quashing of the warrant were that the police did not knock prior to entering the premises of the Attic Lounge, and also apparently the trial court judge believed that the affidavit which accompanied and caused the warrant to issue did not show probable, sufficient probable cause."
1984.83-963,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,161.904,165.908,"Is this in the record at all, the reasons for the quashing?"
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,165.908,167.858,"Yes, I believe it is."
1984.83-963,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,167.858,168.26,It is?
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,168.26,171.545,"We do not have a record of the actual criminal proceedings, but they are referred to."
1984.83-963,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,171.545,174.414,I certainly didn't... I didn't get it from the brief.
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,174.414,175.264,That is correct.
1984.83-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,182.168,196.577,"Ms. Managhan, under New Jersey law, could the officers have entered the bar without a warrant and made a search under the authority of the liquor control laws regardless of any--"
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,196.577,198.195,"--Yes, Mrs. Justice O'Connor."
1984.83-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,291.072,297.459,--Was one part owner of the Attic Lounge also a member of the town council?
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,298.495,300.361,"No, no, that is not my understanding."
1984.83-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,557.912,564.599,"Ms. Managhan, also of course we have here the issuance of a warrant by a magistrate, is that correct?"
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,564.599,565.266,--That is correct.
1984.83-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,565.266,575.407,"And is the magistrate an official of the town, or is that... was that officer someone who was a state officer appointed by the state?"
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,575.407,577.276,"In the case of Rhode Island, it would have had to have been a judge."
1984.83-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,577.276,580.561,"Not selected by the town, but--"
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,580.561,581.078,"No, oh, no."
1984.83-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,581.078,582.894,"--selected by the state, a different--"
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,582.894,587.548,"No, it would have been a judge who would have issued that warrant."
1984.83-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,658.144,673.487,--Is there any evidence in the record from which we would know whether the officers were interested in securing evidence of a criminal offense as opposed to evidence for suspension or revocation of the license?
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,673.487,679.907,"No, there is not specific evidence where an officer was actually asked what was your purpose in going to the lounge."
1984.83-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,688.93,691.715,"Well, what did the warrant affidavit say?"
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,691.715,697.453,"The warrant affidavit, which I have to admit, Your Honor, I have not seen, but basically consisted--"
1984.83-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,697.453,703.523,"Well, they must have explained, to get the warrant issued, they had to say what they thought they were going to find."
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,703.523,704.007,--That's correct.
1984.83-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,704.007,705.592,And demonstrate reasonable cause.
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,705.592,705.925,Yes.
1984.83-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,706.859,707.644,"Well, what did it say?"
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,707.644,720.234,"--The warrant affidavit, as I understand it, reflected the knowledge of a Fall River police officer who had obtained from an informer the information that there was stolen property to be found on the lounge premises."
1984.83-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,720.234,723.253,"Well, then, that's... that's their asserted purpose in going there."
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,723.253,724.07,That is correct.
1984.83-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,724.07,729.69,And I thought you said that they were... that they were seeking to enforce the criminal laws rather than the licensing laws.
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,729.69,743.35,"That is correct, and that's the argument I am making, that they received information that was directly oriented towards the violation of a criminal offense, to wit, the harboring of stolen property on the lounge premises."
1984.83-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,745.167,746.452,"May I ask this question, please?"
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,758.759,775.055,--I am relying on the... I am arguing that point because I believe that this Court has indicated some concern in the Janis case particularly about what was the real purpose pursuant to which the officers actually obtained evidence which was later held unlawfully seized.
1984.83-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,779.423,780.959,But I am still not quite clear.
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,787.279,819.334,"--Then I think you probably have a situation very similar to what this Court faced in Lopez-Medndoza where it was basically admitted that officials, officers, immigration officers, actually acted with a specific civil proceeding in mind, and in that case, which I don't believe is this case, you might very well have to argue that the exclusionary rule would have to be applied to that civil proceeding unless you had circumstances such as this Court found in Lopez-Mendoza that for other reasons distinguished the proceeding--"
1984.83-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,819.334,820.717,"Well, let me ask you a simple question, if I can."
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,831.142,832.592,--I think that is one of the reasons.
1984.83-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,832.592,838.545,"And that is... but is that... assume he didn't, would you make a different... would you concede it would apply, or you would just say that is just a different case?"
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,838.545,841.413,I would say that is a different case.
1984.83-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,841.413,854.238,"Well, what is... is the law in your state that people who are enforcing the licensing laws, the liquor laws, may enter a premises to inspect without any warrant at all?"
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,854.238,855.523,That is correct.
1984.83-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,855.523,861.161,"Well, where did they find these stolen goods?"
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,861.161,863.294,"They found... I am not sure of that, Your Honor."
1984.83-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,875.185,875.918,The officers--
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,875.918,877.752,--of bar patrons of the Attic Lounge.
1984.83-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,877.752,883.772,"--But the two... but the liquor laws are enforced by the same police who enforce the criminal laws there, aren't they?"
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,883.772,884.84,That is correct.
1984.83-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,884.84,892.127,So these same police officers could have entered the lounge any time they wanted to to see if the liquor laws were being--
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,892.127,894.146,"That's right, that's right."
1984.83-963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,894.146,897.115,--I have a little problem with that.
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,900.233,901.752,Rhode Island?
1984.83-963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,901.752,902.152,Rhode Island.
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,902.835,907.823,Perhaps we don't have one such as is found in other states.
1984.83-963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,907.823,914.66,"Well, don't you have one that gives the liquor authority officers the right to go in the bars and grills?"
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,914.66,920.814,That responsibility is primarily borne in Rhode Island by local police officials.
1984.83-963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,920.814,926.117,And they don't have any state liquor authority people?
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,926.117,934.223,"They function primarily on an administrative basis, Your Honor, to hear appeals such as was taken from the Town of Tiverton."
1984.83-963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,934.69,937.508,"Well, who checks as to whether they are serving watered whiskey or not?"
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,937.508,942.144,"--That could certainly be one reason, yes, or unstamped liquor, or--"
1984.83-963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,942.144,942.996,That's what I'm talking about.
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,942.996,943.429,--Right.
1984.83-963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,943.429,946.281,But that's done by... it's not done by police?
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,946.281,947.498,It can be.
1984.83-963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,968.711,971.829,"But the state board, the state board revokes the license, not the local city."
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,971.829,973.531,"No, it is the local town council."
1984.83-963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,973.531,974.365,That revokes the license.
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,974.365,974.781,Yes.
1984.83-963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,977.067,977.917,And revokes them.
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,977.917,980.185,"--And suspends them, and revokes them, yes."
1984.83-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,991.577,996.714,But then it has to go to the state Liquor Control Administrator for review.
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,996.714,997.247,--That is correct.
1984.83-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,998.947,999.647,Yes.
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,999.647,1000.347,If it is appealed.
1984.83-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1003.835,1011.155,It is the state Liquor Control Administrator who is your opponent in these proceedings.
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,1011.155,1011.539,That is correct.
1984.83-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1011.539,1014.707,No brief being filed by owners of the Attic Lounge.
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,1014.707,1017.143,That is correct.
1984.83-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1017.143,1035.37,"The board, the town commission minutes in the appendix do reflect that a one-third owner of shares in the Attic Lounge was apparently one of the town commissioners voting on the matter."
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,1035.37,1036.087,I stand corrected.
1984.83-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1036.087,1041.024,"I don't know that it is any... has any great relevance, but I thought it was curious."
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,1041.024,1042.726,"I stand corrected, Your Honor."
1984.83-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1274.909,1276.594,May I go back to your last argument for just a second?
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,1276.594,1277.144,--Yes.
1984.83-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1277.144,1278.328,I was trying to think it through.
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,1289.002,1290.119,That is correct.
1984.83-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1290.119,1293.288,So this is really kind of a one shot situation.
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,1293.288,1297.756,That is correct.
1984.83-963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1441.281,1446.335,"Your liquor Control Administrator, I take it, thought otherwise until the Superior Court straightened him out."
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,1446.335,1451.606,"That is correct, and he was told that that in fact was not the case, that a conviction is not necessary."
1984.83-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1659.291,1665.195,"Counsel, I take it that most of the cases on this point around the country are against you, are they, or not?"
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,1665.195,1666.861,I would disagree.
1984.83-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1666.861,1671.432,I don't see much discussion of those cases in your brief.
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,1671.432,1686.274,"I did discuss two cases, one from Illinois and one from Ohio, both of which basically indicated that where liquor license revocation was the concern, that in fact the exclusionary rule would not apply."
1984.83-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1686.274,1688.81,"There are other cases to the contrary, I take it."
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,1688.81,1690.56,There are other cases to the contrary.
1984.83-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1777.618,1779.934,"Ms. Managhan, may I ask one factual question?"
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,1787.254,1787.921,That is correct.
1984.83-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1787.921,1788.89,Is it still in business?
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,1789.823,1791.023,It is not still in business.
1984.83-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1791.023,1792.758,"--Oh, it is out of business?"
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,1792.758,1793.275,That is correct.
1984.83-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1793.275,1795.527,Do we have a live case in front of us then?
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,1795.527,1797.11,"Yes, I think you do."
1984.83-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1797.11,1799.662,Who is interested in winning or losing then?
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,1799.662,1805.565,"Well, I think that the town is interested, and also the liquor license... the Liquor License Administrator is also interested."
1984.83-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1805.565,1806.667,They would like to know what the law is.
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,1806.667,1807.434,That is correct.
1984.83-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1807.434,1811.219,"I mean, will the outcome of the case actually decide whether anybody sells any liquor or not?"
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,1811.219,1814.671,That is... it will not because the Attic Lounge has in fact gone out of business.
1984.83-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1823.86,1825.376,In just knowing what the law is.
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,1825.376,1826.743,That is correct.
1984.83-963,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1866.368,1867.57,"Your time has expired now, Ms. Managhan."
1984.83-963,0,33909,kathleen_managhan,,1867.57,1872.122,--Thank you.
1984.83-963,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1872.122,1873.657,Mr. Hines?
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,1873.657,1883.33,"Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, I would like to begin by amplifying somewhat the nature of liquor matters in the State of Rhode Island."
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1883.33,1884.38,Could I ask you at the outset--
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,1884.38,1884.98,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1884.98,1895.903,--The issue in the Court below was whether or not the Administrator was correct in setting aside the license revocation.
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,1895.903,1897.089,"Yes, that's right."
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1897.089,1901.641,And the Administrator's decision was affirmed.
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,1901.641,1902.841,That is correct.
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1902.841,1912.515,"And so it really is a license case, a licensing case, and I wonder what your answer is to Justice Stevens' question, why isn't this case moot?"
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,1912.515,1924.423,"It is not moot, Your Honor, for the reason that the Attic Lounge did go out of business, but they did not go out of business immediately, and at the time that this was in the works, it would have an effect on them."
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1925.09,1929.408,What happens to a liquor license that a tavern owns when it closes?
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,1930.742,1931.394,--Yes.
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1941.383,1946.419,"Of course, if they... if it had been properly revoked, they couldn't sell it or transfer it."
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,1946.419,1947.919,"--No, that is correct, Your Honor, they could not."
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1947.919,1955.959,But is there... did somebody want to succeed these owners in that same place and sell liquor under that license?
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,1955.959,1960.929,"I am not aware of that, but I would doubt if that were the case, Your Honor, if someone wanted to succeed to that license."
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1963.346,1969.802,"Well, I know, but let's assume the... I'm still asking whether there is a live controversy here."
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,1977.973,1983.693,"--The license is probably still in existence, but not with the former owners of the Attic Lounge."
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1983.693,1986.379,"Well, it might be attached to that place, though."
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,1986.379,1987.163,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1987.163,1987.53,It isn't.
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,1987.53,1989.28,The license does not attach to anyplace.
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1993.315,1995.867,"Well, what would happen to the license if we reversed?"
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,1995.867,1997.817,--Nothing whatsoever.
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1997.817,2003.604,"Well, why wouldn't it?"
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2009.422,2020.13,"I have no... I have no doubt, although I am not certain, that since this time the license has been transferred to another entity, totally separate from the Attic Lounge, and they are probably functioning under it right now."
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2022.416,2024.932,"Well, your client... and your client is the Commissioner, is that right?"
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2024.932,2025.784,"That is correct, Your Honor, yes, sir."
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2025.784,2029.503,"Well, suppose we reversed and said the evidence was properly admissible?"
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2031.272,2032.722,In future hearings?
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2032.722,2034.022,"No, no, in this case."
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2034.022,2035.907,It would take no action whatsoever.
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2035.907,2036.374,Well--
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2036.374,2040.026,"If anyone were to take action, it would be the local community."
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2044.429,2046.881,"--Well, I know, but they revoked the license."
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2046.881,2047.447,--That is correct.
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2047.447,2050.916,And you said... and you reinstated it.
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2050.916,2052.535,"Yes, Your Honor, we did."
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2053.735,2056.237,On an erroneous basis.
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2056.237,2057.47,--That is correct.
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2057.47,2060.874,And now you are defending the state court's decision.
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2060.874,2064.343,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2064.343,2067.711,"Not much of a case here, is there?"
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2067.711,2080.336,"From a scholarly point of view, perhaps, but from a practical point of view, your questions point out that the ultimate effect does not have a practical result."
1984.83-963,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2080.336,2086.672,"But this wasn't point out in your brief anywhere, and we have no brief from the Attic Lounge."
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2094.592,2095.342,"No, they were not pointed out."
1984.83-963,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2118.29,2122.658,"Well, if it is moot, we simply wouldn't decide it at all, would we?"
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2122.658,2123.258,"No, you would not."
1984.83-963,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2123.258,2126.877,That's why it becomes important to us to know.
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2137.418,2138.535,"That is correct also, Your Honor."
1984.83-963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2138.535,2141.637,So really even theoretically there is not a great deal at stake.
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2141.637,2142.122,No.
1984.83-963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2142.122,2145.657,"Because we are really asked to decide this case only, and this case itself is moot."
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2145.657,2146.674,That is correct.
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2146.674,2154.446,Except that officers to enforce the liquor laws cannot enter without a license and go to locked doors.
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2154.446,2154.913,No.
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2169.689,2173.057,Do you think they could go and search bureau drawers?
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2173.057,2174.257,"Under, if they went in under the statute--"
1984.83-963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2174.257,2174.809,Desk drawers.
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2174.809,2175.443,"--Yes, they could."
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2190.519,2198.475,"Suppose they wanted to go in and hunt for some drugs, and they went in, and if they... in the back end of the tavern was a living quarters?"
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2199.709,2201.744,"I don't believe so, Your Honor, no."
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2201.744,2203.711,"Well, do you think they could look in a jar, look in a--"
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2203.711,2205.612,I don't believe the living quarters are premises.
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2210.449,2212.749,--Do you think they could open the cash register?
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2212.749,2213.784,"No, I don't believe they can."
1984.83-963,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2224.776,2226.709,"Mr. Hines, may I get back a minute?"
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2236.482,2237.317,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-963,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2237.317,2239.084,Does it still continue in existence?
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2239.084,2240.386,"Yes, it does."
1984.83-963,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2240.386,2241.502,No matter what we decide.
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2241.502,2242.571,That is correct.
1984.83-963,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2242.571,2247.956,"Well, what can we do other than give an advisory opinion?"
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2247.956,2261.449,"Your Honor, there is some, as my adversary has pointed out, there is some diversion in the lower courts as to whether or not the exclusionary rule does apply in this type of proceeding."
1984.83-963,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2280.411,2283.029,"Well, wouldn't it be an advisory opinion?"
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2283.029,2284.731,"Yes, it would be, Your Honor."
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2284.731,2299.824,"Well, I would have thought, though, that... I would have thought that if your client determined in his own mind that he had erroneously reinstated the license, that the could consider this evidence, and that there was evidence--"
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2299.824,2300.624,"No, he--"
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2300.624,2306.694,"--I would think he could go back and say this license should have been revoked, and I am now going to revoke it."
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2306.694,2310.48,"--He would do that, but he would be faced with the same situation you are faced with."
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2312.432,2313.282,"Well, I don't know--"
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2313.282,2314.132,The license--
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2314.132,2321.703,"--Anybody who took, the transferree of his license took it at his risk and his peril."
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2321.703,2323.703,"--No, not under the Rhode Island law, Your Honor."
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2323.703,2324.239,I see.
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2324.239,2326.189,"It is a clean, clean slate."
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2326.189,2327.941,It is like issuing a new license?
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2327.941,2329.807,"Yes, it... exactly, Your Honor."
1984.83-963,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2329.807,2339.499,Would it have an effect in the future on the ability of the owners of the Attic Lounge to get... to hold a liquor license in the future?
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2339.499,2340.015,"Yes, it would, Your Honor."
1984.83-963,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2340.015,2341.365,So it would have that effect.
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2341.365,2342.784,"Yes, it would."
1984.83-963,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2343.234,2358.41,And why wouldn't the liquor Control Administrator of the state be interested then in going back and taking action so that he would know the status of these people in the future if they were to come back into business.
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2358.41,2358.944,--I haven't made myself clear.
1984.83-963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2370.301,2371.717,So it would be up to the Town of Tiverton--
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2371.717,2375.519,"That is correct, yes, Your Honor, and that... it is because of the jurisdictional aspects."
1984.83-963,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2375.519,2377.202,"--Well, the town has already acted."
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2383.856,2385.106,"Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-963,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2385.106,2386.974,The town has already acted.
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2386.974,2387.541,"Yes, they have."
1984.83-963,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2387.541,2396.347,So your administrator would not consider changing his aim on the basis of the evidence on the appeal?
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2396.347,2404.936,"He would consider it if it was properly before him, but it wouldn't come before him until, first of all, the town would have to take the initial original action."
1984.83-963,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2409.404,2414.308,"Well, I thought the town did take it and that your administrator heard it on appeal."
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2414.308,2416.041,"Yes, we did, de novo."
1984.83-963,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2416.041,2416.577,Yes.
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2427.116,2427.483,Yes.
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2427.483,2430.485,And that that is like issuing a new license to a new person.
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2430.485,2431.337,That's correct.
1984.83-963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2431.337,2437.907,But let's suppose that this Court did reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island.
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2454.868,2455.368,Yes.
1984.83-963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2455.368,2457.418,So that it isn't up to someone else to start a new proceeding.
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2459.77,2463.222,"And then we would send it back to Tiverton, Your Honor."
1984.83-963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2463.222,2465.824,And so it depends on what Tiverton wanted to do--
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2465.824,2466.258,That is correct.
1984.83-963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2466.258,2466.743,--what would happen?
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2466.743,2467.493,Yes.
1984.83-963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2477.299,2488.106,"Well, what if Tiverton says we already revoked, and your decision setting aside our revocation has now been overturned by the higher courts?"
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2488.106,2499.497,"An interested party who might be affected by that, and I don't think one exists because they are not holding the license, could then appeal to the Liquor Control Administrator."
1984.83-963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2499.497,2503.365,May I ask if your state supreme court has authority to render advisory opinions?
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2504.132,2505.082,"Yes, they do, Your Honor."
1984.83-963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2505.082,2508.853,And so perhaps they were well aware of this whole situation and just rendered an advisory opinion.
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2508.853,2516.007,"No, can I say that at the level of the Supreme Court, the Attic Lounge people were represented by their own counsel."
1984.83-963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2516.007,2516.873,"Oh, they were at that, then."
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2516.873,2519.975,"Yes, Your Honor, and the... I was not involved in that."
1984.83-963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2525.295,2527.997,"Of course, you take the position that they were right in their view on the law."
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2527.997,2529.432,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2529.432,2538.222,"But so that if we sent it back, the Rhode Island Supreme Court would have the power to say, well, that is all well and good, but our advisory opinion is the following anyway."
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2542.757,2543.859,"Yes, Your Honor, they could."
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2543.859,2550.43,"Well, they have... I was going to say, they have already decided this case the way you want it decided."
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2550.43,2551.146,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2551.146,2559.536,"I would think you, with your first point out of the box here would be to say that the case is moot, you should just dismiss it."
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2562.753,2567.991,"I would not be displeased with that disposition whatsoever, Your Honor."
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2567.991,2572.276,Unless we held it was moot and vacated the judgment below.
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2572.276,2573.009,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2575.828,2579.965,Do you think we have the authority to vacate advisory opinions of state Supreme Courts?
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2579.965,2586.619,"No, Your Honor, I do not."
1984.83-963,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2623.558,2630.648,"Well, wouldn't that mean that virtually all license revocations would fall under that category?"
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2630.648,2633.616,"Yes, it would, Your Honor, and it would I think for this reason."
1984.83-963,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2758.78,2780.943,"Well, Mr. Hines, do you suppose that one Plymouth Sedan quasi-criminal analysis survives the balancing test now employed by the Court not only in Janis, but in cases like Leon and Shephard, which themselves were actually criminal cases."
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2800.007,2802.209,"My answer is yes, for this reason."
1984.83-963,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2845.136,2848.57,"But that might put the cart before the horse, mightn't it?"
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2850.856,2853.574,--I don't believe so.
1984.83-963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2902.324,2906.709,May I ask another question about the procedure in the case that kind of puzzles me?
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2906.709,2907.226,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2907.226,2915.299,"Apart from this one case... and I understand that your client sustained or revoked the... or reinstated the license, in effect, here--"
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2915.299,2915.699,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2915.699,2921.719,"--that apart from this case, that your client's general duties are supervising the administration of liquor laws in a certain capacity."
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2932.776,2939.33,"Yes, but I don't think that that is a standard that should be applicable whether or not you can function better, not with the Fourth Amendment."
1984.83-963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2940.447,2945.834,"But from the point of view of his actual, his interest in performing his job would be better served if you lost the lawsuit."
1984.83-963,1,30866,john_h_hines_jr,,2945.834,2947.201,--Absolutely.
