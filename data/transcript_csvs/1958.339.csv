1958.339,0,31048,joseph_y_houghton,,39.449,44.881,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1958.339,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,67.505,71.854,(Inaudible)
1958.339,0,31048,joseph_y_houghton,,71.854,73.994,"No, Your Honor."
1958.339,1,18870,carleton_u_edwards_ii,,2496.863,2509.702,"If it please the Court, I would just propose to discuss the question of the new issue which the respondents have sought to raise in this case."
1958.339,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2550.609,2553.948,(Inaudible)
1958.339,1,18870,carleton_u_edwards_ii,,2553.948,2562.287,"The contracts Your Honor, prefer not to call them employment, they were strictly a contractor basis and a consultant basis."
1958.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2673.391,2678.212,Well why do you and your associates say they have abandoned everything except this new trial?
1958.339,1,18870,carleton_u_edwards_ii,,2685.955,2687.738,Well --
1958.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2687.738,2691.743,"I've just looked at (Inaudible), don't they?"
1958.339,1,18870,carleton_u_edwards_ii,,2691.743,2694.223,"Well, I think it all comes down to this."
1958.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2730.591,2760.019,"I can understand your disagreeing with the government, namely that there is an adequate, that damages are incalculable, therefore (Inaudible)"
1958.339,1,18870,carleton_u_edwards_ii,,2760.019,2762.6,Well that's true to that extent Your Honor.
1958.339,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2777.658,2788.466,You mean they are denying now that they have governmental authority to do this (Inaudible)
1958.339,1,18870,carleton_u_edwards_ii,,2788.466,2792.08,"Well, they just aren't arguing that they do have the statutory authority."
1958.339,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2800.067,2817.121,"Now suppose they agree that they are acting under governmental authority and not going beyond (Inaudible) by the government as they should act as government, what is your position with reference to the Court of Appeals' judgment passed?"
1958.339,1,18870,carleton_u_edwards_ii,,2821.608,2828.338,"Well, I'm afraid I don't quite understand the question Your Honor."
1958.339,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2828.338,2851.349,Now the Courts of Appeals has held that yes they destroyed the value of the property (Inaudible)
1958.339,1,18870,carleton_u_edwards_ii,,2851.349,2858.666,"Well, I say that the Court of Appeals is wrong that they didn't have the authority and that's what I say."
1958.339,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2858.666,2865.047,Suppose they do have the authority and suppose it's held that they do have the authority what (Inaudible)
1958.339,1,18870,carleton_u_edwards_ii,,2865.047,2885.862,"Well, then I say we can't determine where our damages are -- it may -- what they have done may have destroyed Mr Spevack's right to obtain patents in many places where he has applied for them, which maybe in calculable as to what the damage would be."
1958.339,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2887.618,2900.374,"Well I understand that argument, but I do not understand that the government â€“ if you say the government is now denying the (Inaudible) I can understand."
1958.339,1,18870,carleton_u_edwards_ii,,2904.869,2918.076,"Well, Your Honor I don't actually say they are denying it, I just say they have abandoned their old view that they had the statutory authority to do what they are trying to do and now they are shifting over to something else which is brand new and --"
1958.339,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2918.076,2923.392,(Inaudible)
1958.339,1,18870,carleton_u_edwards_ii,,2923.392,2926.746,Just this one case sir.
1958.339,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3029.617,3033.558,"-- before the district, where they in the proceedings below?"
1958.339,1,18870,carleton_u_edwards_ii,,3033.558,3054.984,"No they weren't Your Honor, no they weren't, although there was every reason -- in fact counsel statements on the motion for preliminary injunction revel that he knew of the contracts, in fact they were discussed, the very fact that throughout this litigation this issue was never previously raised, I believe there is telltale that there really is no basis for it."
1958.339,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3076.768,3079.358,Mr. Sands.
1958.339,2,35094,leonard_b_sand,,3079.358,3083.073,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1958.339,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3164.958,3168.155,Has he that choice?
1958.339,2,35094,leonard_b_sand,,3168.155,3192.7,I think not Mr. Justice Frankfurter because he is seeking to enjoin the Atomic Energy Commission from fulfilling its statutory obligations to disseminate to the free world and to the scientific community the technology with respect to atomic --
1958.339,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3192.7,3197.041,You've introduced -- you've introduced a statement which takes care of most of the case.
1958.339,2,35094,leonard_b_sand,,3197.041,3200.73,"I think that's correct, I think that's correct."
1958.339,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3200.73,3204.552,(Inaudible)
1958.339,2,35094,leonard_b_sand,,3204.552,3219.99,"Well I think that it's true, that under the Atomic Energy Act there is an obligation imposed upon the commission to declassify data, to disseminate it to the world."
1958.339,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3247.286,3258.693,What about the qualification (Inaudible)
1958.339,2,35094,leonard_b_sand,,3258.693,3260.478,This --
1958.339,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3260.478,3264.816,Some provision (Inaudible)
1958.339,2,35094,leonard_b_sand,,3264.816,3269.98,"I know of no such provision, no such provision in the statute."
1958.339,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3274.89,3284.782,You mean to say after we (Inaudible) that the Atomic Energy Commission would have make everything public that is known.
1958.339,2,35094,leonard_b_sand,,3284.782,3298.499,"Oh no, there are provisions in our treaties with foreign countries which -- in which we reserve the right not to divulge certain information, but --"
1958.339,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3298.499,3311.762,"For that -- suggest that under those reservations, they withholding that you are under obligation by our law not make public, anything in that?"
1958.339,2,35094,leonard_b_sand,,3311.762,3324.193,"Well I think not, because our contention is that, that as between Mr. Spevack and the Atomic Energy Commission, there is no such obligation."
1958.339,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3324.193,3326.588,Because of the arrangement you mean you do?
1958.339,2,35094,leonard_b_sand,,3326.588,3343.128,"Because of the arrangement between us, because we learned of his secret not by virtue of any patent application, not by virtue of any statutory reporting provisions, we learned of his invention because we paid him to tell it to us."
1958.339,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3359.434,3362.909,"Well now you say that, have there been any findings in this effect (Inaudible)"
1958.339,2,35094,leonard_b_sand,,3362.909,3377.084,"The findings, well the findings of the District Court --"
1958.339,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3377.084,3378.068,Do we have those?
1958.339,2,35094,leonard_b_sand,,3378.068,3386.692,"Pardon, they appear on page 18 of the joint appendix."
1958.339,3,18870,carleton_u_edwards_ii,,5560.863,5584.362,"Id it please the court, I should like to say at the outset at this time that unfortunately this litigation has consumed a great portion of the petitioner's effort and that of his counsel dealing over the period of these months."
