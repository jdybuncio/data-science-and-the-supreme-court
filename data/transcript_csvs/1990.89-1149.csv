1990.89-1149,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,22.386,"We'll hear argument now in No. 89-1149, Coy R. Grogan v. Frank J. Garner."
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,23.876,26.697,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1149,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,58.711,63.412,What is your understanding of in the Eighth Circuit's view what happens on remand?
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,69.166,99.647,"We requested that the Eighth... we filed a motion for rehearing with the Eighth Circuit and requested that on... that the court specify what would happen on remand, so that we could retry either under (a)(2) or, as we had alleged originally in the adversary complaint, try it under (a)(6), because there were punitive damages assessed in the underlying fraud claim, and we believe we had additional grounds for nondischargeability under the theory that it was a malicious... intentionally malicious injury to the property of the creditors."
1990.89-1149,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,135.894,137.364,"Well, has (a)(6) been pursued at all?"
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,137.364,149.632,"It was pursued and the bankruptcy judge declined to rule on (a)(6) because he ruled in favor of the creditor under... creditors under (a)(2), and said a decision under (a)(6) was unnecessary."
1990.89-1149,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,149.632,152.814,It would seem to me the briefs up here completely ignored (a)(6).
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,152.814,166.803,"That is correct, Your Honor, and the reason for that is because the petition for cert. merely put the question of the proper standard of proof under (a)(2), and it was my belief and understanding that the question of the proper standard of proof under (a)(6) is not before this Court."
1990.89-1149,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,168.285,168.926,Say that last again.
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,170.318,175.714,--That the question of the appropriate standard of proof under (a)(6) is not before the Court.
1990.89-1149,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,179.668,183.471,It seems to me in some respects that's a much better subsection than (a)(2).
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,183.471,185.14,"--For my clients it is, Your Honor."
1990.89-1149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,185.14,190.026,"Mr. Gallagher, in this case you already had a judgment from the State court."
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,190.026,190.537,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,190.537,197.529,"What... Justice Stevens probably knows this, but I haven't done any bankruptcy work."
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,205.075,205.415,Yes.
1990.89-1149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,205.415,207.196,It hasn't been tried yet in State court.
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,207.196,207.396,Yes.
1990.89-1149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,208.268,208.919,Yeah.
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,208.919,210.358,What would happen?
1990.89-1149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,210.358,211.25,What would happen?
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,216.946,219.569,It would be a State law claim controlled by the State law.
1990.89-1149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.796,229.128,What would govern under Erie?
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,230.36,231.301,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,231.301,234.493,"So, if... let's see."
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,255.707,266.366,"It would decide the case under the clear and convincing standard, which of course would carry the day with respect to the adversary brought under rule 4007 of the Bankruptcy Rules."
1990.89-1149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,266.366,266.864,I see.
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,275.023,278.135,"That is correct, you would have to win under both in order to... well, no, there would really be two separate issues."
1990.89-1149,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,308.279,328.144,"Then it is your view that if the creditor here had come into bankruptcy court with an unliquidated claim, no State court judgment in back of it, and the rule in Missouri was clear and convincing evidence, the rule adopted by this Court were preponderance of the evidence, all you would have to show in the bankruptcy court is a preponderance of the evidence, notwithstanding Missouri law?"
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,328.144,329.264,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1149,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,350.8,357.573,So you come in with an unliquidated claim arising in a State like Missouri.
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,370.703,377.257,"That is correct, Your Honor, because the State law controls the determination of the existence of the debt."
1990.89-1149,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,377.257,379.169,"That doesn't make much sense though, does it?"
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,381.339,389.867,"Well, I believe it makes perfect sense, because the issue of tort liability is quite apart from the issue of dischargeability."
1990.89-1149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,397.021,412.441,"What would happen if we said that the standard for bankruptcy is clear and convincing, and you have a State law that says it is only preponderance, and... this case, and it's an unliquidated claim however?"
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,419.894,421.226,Then there is no debt.
1990.89-1149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,421.226,425.74,"Does the bankruptcy court go on to adjudicate whether there is a debt or not, or just dismisses it and then--"
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,425.74,433.097,"The terminated... the proof of claim would be filed asserting a claim for common law tort, an unliquidated tort claim."
1990.89-1149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,437.708,439.058,--Upon a preponderance basis?
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,439.058,440.4,"--Well, if that were the State law."
1990.89-1149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,440.4,441.98,"Yeah, well, that's what he posed."
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,446.134,446.304,"Yes, that is correct."
1990.89-1149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,446.304,447.906,So the State would then have to go on.
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,457.595,463.368,"It would decide the claim in the first instance, and then if the creditor asked, would decide whether it were dischargeable."
1990.89-1149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,463.368,465.31,So it would have to take two cuts at the thing to decide.
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,465.31,467.081,Although it would occur in the same proceeding.
1990.89-1149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,467.081,467.391,Yes.
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,467.391,481.241,"Because in the bank... under the bankruptcy procedures when an adversary is filed, and an adversary proceeding must be filed, then all the issues that are bound up in that determination, both the existence of the debt and the dischargeability issue, come together and are tried at the same time."
1990.89-1149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,481.241,481.411,What fun.
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,496.99,497.131,Yes.
1990.89-1149,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,499.174,500.646,--And do you think that's the proper rule?
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,500.646,501.835,"I do not, Your Honor."
1990.89-1149,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,502.997,503.187,Why?
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,503.187,508.953,--of dischargeability is a separate question which is a matter of Federal law which this Court must decide.
1990.89-1149,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,535.56,547.11,"Well, if the Federal interest is one in giving special consideration in the event there has been fraud, why not let the State standard control?"
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,547.11,548.67,I think that--
1990.89-1149,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,548.67,550.791,Isn't the Federal interest satisfied there?
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,569.015,579.764,"--There would be no harm from that rule, because if the State standard is preponderance, the same burden would apply with respect to dischargeability."
1990.89-1149,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,586.89,591.735,Wouldn't that simplify things and vindicate Federal policy?
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,591.735,597.008,It would... it would simplify things and it would satisfy my clients.
1990.89-1149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,616.759,627.386,"I suppose if you applied that follow the State rule to fraud, there would be no reason not to apply it to everything else as well."
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,635.022,642.087,"Yes, and I think that would be inappropriate under this section, because the issue of dischargeability is just a monetary dispute."
1990.89-1149,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,784.293,790.317,And the district court charged the jury in the underlying case that the burden of proof was by a preponderance of the evidence?
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,790.317,798.324,"By a preponderance of the evidence, Your Honor, as required by Missouri pattern instructions, which is essentially a preponderance of the evidence instruction."
1990.89-1149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,843.194,850.93,The district court didn't disagree that to establish the claim a preponderance was enough?
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,850.93,857.803,--The district court in the underlying... I'm not sure I understand the question.
1990.89-1149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,857.803,861.205,Did the district court rule that they had no claim?
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,864.439,871.753,"Yes, the district court in the underlying action is the court that tried the original common law fraud case, and it affirmed."
1990.89-1149,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,944.412,952.567,But of course many States do require a heightened standard of proof for fraud in private disputes between parties about money.
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,952.567,953.489,That is correct.
1990.89-1149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,963.458,969.114,"Well, you're saying it's just an issue of dischargeability, but the issue of dischargeability turns upon whether there has been fraud."
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,969.114,971.394,"--Well, but that's already determined in this case."
1990.89-1149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,983.462,987.155,But we have to adopt a rule that is going to apply where it is not discharged too.
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,993.059,993.489,--Yes.
1990.89-1149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,993.489,994.371,How could you?
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,994.371,1003.189,"Because the determination could likewise be made in the bankruptcy court that the creditor... that the debtor was a fraud feasor under a preponderance of the evidence, if that is the State rule."
1990.89-1149,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1003.189,1007.671,"Mr. Gallagher, let me just be sure I understand your position."
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,1016.038,1016.438,That is correct.
1990.89-1149,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1016.438,1020.523,"That the clear and convincing standard is only in establishing the claim, not in--"
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,1020.523,1020.853,That is correct.
1990.89-1149,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1020.853,1021.224,--Okay.
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,1021.414,1022.606,"In some States, not in all."
1990.89-1149,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1022.606,1022.936,--I understand.
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,1032.663,1032.964,Yes.
1990.89-1149,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1099.552,1105.467,"Well, Mr. Gallagher, would you explain... I still am confused about your position."
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,1127.611,1132.724,"--The debt, the existence of the fraud debt must be established by clear and convincing evidence."
1990.89-1149,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1132.724,1134.186,In the Federal bankruptcy court.
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,1134.186,1136.159,"In the Federal bankruptcy court, that is correct."
1990.89-1149,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1151.659,1156.694,"Mr. Gallagher, who are the Federal district judges involved?"
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,1156.694,1161.617,"Scott O. Wright, the chief judge--"
1990.89-1149,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1161.617,1161.757,I know.
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,1162.776,1164.058,--Dean Whipple.
1990.89-1149,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1164.058,1165.36,Sir?
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,1165.36,1166.559,Dean Whipple.
1990.89-1149,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1166.559,1167.16,Okay.
1990.89-1149,0,35932,michael_j_gallagher,,1167.16,1177.528,"Judge Whipple was the person, was the judge that decided the issue respecting bankruptcy, and Judge Wright was the trial judge in the underlying common law fraud case."
1990.89-1149,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1188.774,1191.316,"Thank you, Mr. Gallagher."
1990.89-1149,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1193.279,1202.936,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1149,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1388.609,1398.156,"But doesn't that beg the question, because isn't the question how clear we ought to be that the debtor is not honest before we make the exception?"
1990.89-1149,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1398.156,1403.889,It is clear that under Missouri law in this case and under the Federal securities law that he is guilty of fraud.
1990.89-1149,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1430.129,1432.681,Of course it's not just the victim's interest in compensation.
1990.89-1149,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1440.118,1440.869,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1149,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1583.507,1586.531,"Mr. Roberts, can I interrupt you just to be sure I have got your position on one thing?"
1990.89-1149,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1593.174,1597.287,"Yes, Your Honor, we think it does, and we think that is the most reasonable interpretation."
1990.89-1149,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1602.512,1609.426,And I understand that most States with an (a)(6) type injury apply simply the preponderance test?
1990.89-1149,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1609.426,1613.087,"I believe that is correct, Your Honor, yes."
1990.89-1149,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1621.795,1627.887,Do you have a view whether or not this claim is more properly tried under (a)(2) or (a)(6) in this case?
1990.89-1149,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1627.887,1630.961,"Well, it seems to fit comfortably under both."
1990.89-1149,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1654.159,1657.2,"Of course, does (a)(2) cover all types of fraud?"
1990.89-1149,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1657.2,1660.032,--It covers what is known as actual fraud.
1990.89-1149,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1679.416,1686.441,"Well, it applies to money, property, services, or an extension renewal or refinancing of credit to the extent obtained by."
1990.89-1149,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1700.832,1707.114,"I suppose that is true, but in the bankruptcy context you need to establish the debt in the first instance, so--"
1990.89-1149,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1707.114,1709.307,"But that was this case, actually, wasn't it?"
1990.89-1149,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1715.12,1729.861,"--The respondent was enriched by the fact that the petitioners, whom he defrauded, did not choose to participate in the opportunity that he had available and fraudulently declined to advise them about."
1990.89-1149,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1734.834,1736.276,But he didn't obtain the money?
1990.89-1149,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1736.276,1741.367,--What he got was more valuable because the petitioners didn't get to share in it.
1990.89-1149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1748.363,1752.464,"Did the claim that was allowed, did it include punitive damages?"
1990.89-1149,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1752.464,1753.445,Yes.
1990.89-1149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1762.264,1770.579,"I take it that the victim, if there is a bankrupt estate, let's assume that all creditors are going to get 10 percent."
1990.89-1149,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1773.751,1774.102,Yes.
1990.89-1149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1776.125,1776.245,Exactly.
1990.89-1149,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1776.245,1777.484,The question remains--
1990.89-1149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1777.484,1779.577,Then the remainder just isn't discharged.
1990.89-1149,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1779.577,1780.138,--That is right.
1990.89-1149,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1785.603,1786.224,It's a fresh start.
1990.89-1149,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1786.224,1788.074,"A fresh start, yes."
1990.89-1149,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1789.033,1791.226,"Thank you, Mr. Roberts."
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,1797.232,1800.034,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1149,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1833.056,1837.397,Would Justice Kennedy's standard encourage forum shopping?
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,1845.184,1858.074,"If the courts were to do that, Judge, I think it would... Justice, exactly what would happen is that they would encourage forum shopping, in that you could have State A, which requires a mere preponderance, State B, of which there are a majority, requiring clear and--"
1990.89-1149,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1858.074,1861.516,But it would depend on where the underlying transaction had occurred.
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,1867.611,1878.246,"--Well, if the underlying court were going to apply that burden, but by filing your action in one State or another you could dictate what your burden of proof would be if you had a choice."
1990.89-1149,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1878.246,1886.601,But you can sue someone in Kansas presumably if you can get personal service on them there on a claim that arose in Missouri.
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,1890.574,1891.325,"Yes, they would."
1990.89-1149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1953.53,1956.18,"Mr. McNamara, can I interrupt you, because I want to be sure I have your position."
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,1964.869,1976.058,"--It would be our position, Justice Stevens, that yes, it should apply to, at least to (a)(2), (a)(4), and (a)(6), which are 3 of the 10 grounds for exception."
1990.89-1149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1976.058,1980.17,"Well, but then there might be a different one for (a)(1), which is a tax or custom duty, something like that?"
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,1982.853,1984.736,"Under the... no, we would not, Justice."
1990.89-1149,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2009.653,2012.595,Is Federal securities fraud (a)(6)?
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,2012.595,2016.157,"No, it would be under (a)(2), Justice Kennedy."
1990.89-1149,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2016.157,2023.043,"And is Federal securities fraud, outside the bankruptcy context, preponderance of the evidence, is it not?"
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,2023.043,2027.765,"Outside the bankruptcy context it is, much like a minority of States."
1990.89-1149,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2027.765,2037.532,"That's a rather odd policy to have one Federal standard to establish the liability and the other to establish the discharge, if it's a fraud... if it's a fraud component in the action."
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,2037.532,2053.503,"And we would suggest that if Congress finds that policy choice to be an unfair one, or one which unfairly favors certain judgment debtors, that Congress, as it has in the False Claims Act and various other laws, is free to amend the Bankruptcy Code to--"
1990.89-1149,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2053.503,2057.687,"Well, I am suggesting that there is an illogic on its face, and that is why we shouldn't adopt your standard."
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,2057.687,2070.674,"--Well, there is going to be, regardless of which standard the Court would adopt, there inevitably, inevitably will be some relitigation, depending upon what the facts are in the underlying case and what the burdens of proof are."
1990.89-1149,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2080.091,2087.828,"Well, not if the petitioners' counsel is correct that the higher State standard always controls because that establishes the debt."
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,2087.828,2090.848,Only for purposes of establishing the debt.
1990.89-1149,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2126.805,2128.285,But he needs a cause of action.
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,2139.374,2141.985,If that is the only debt involved--
1990.89-1149,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2141.985,2142.195,Right.
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,2142.195,2142.596,--that would be true.
1990.89-1149,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2143.608,2157.887,"Do you say that in case of a claim that is not liquidated, and the creditor comes in and wants to get a... files a claim for fraud in the bankruptcy proceeding."
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,2165.814,2167.695,"No, we do not, Justice White, as to--"
1990.89-1149,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2167.695,2174.259,But you say the clear and convincing standard would just apply to dischargeability.
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,2174.259,2175.649,--As to dischargeability.
1990.89-1149,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2177.0,2180.413,"So in that case there is not going to be two trials, because there is no debt."
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,2180.413,2198.906,"--In the case of... if he walked... he'll come into bankruptcy court with a claim and have to prove it up there, as opposed to there having been a prior State or Federal court case on which you have a judgment debt, then you would be trying your case for the first time in the bankruptcy court."
1990.89-1149,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2198.906,2200.756,And the State standard would control.
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,2200.756,2202.516,As to the creation of the debt.
1990.89-1149,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2202.516,2206.971,But you say as to dischargeability then it's a uniform standard.
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,2213.606,2215.999,Only as to the elements of the claim.
1990.89-1149,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2226.026,2234.814,"But what are... the elements of dischargeability are the mirror image of the claim, aren't they?"
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,2236.024,2238.475,--As to the legal elements of the claim.
1990.89-1149,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2238.475,2239.447,What more is there?
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,2239.447,2240.906,"Well, there is the burden of proof."
1990.89-1149,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2240.906,2244.169,"Yeah, but I mean what other substantive elements to be proved are there?"
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,2244.169,2246.442,There would be no other substantive elements to be proved.
1990.89-1149,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2246.442,2264.852,"So you really are talking about... you say that it's one claim to... or one step to prove your claim in the bankruptcy court and another thing to prove dischargeability, or to prove no... but you are proving exactly the same elements in each case, aren't you?"
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,2264.852,2269.406,"With respect to the legal elements of the cause of action, that is correct."
1990.89-1149,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2281.265,2289.979,"Well, you know, you could argue that Congress never should have made any claims nondischargeable, if you wanted to give the debtor the broadest possible relief."
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,2293.753,2310.553,"They certainly had to draw lines, Chief Justice, but the notion of dischargeability is treated throughout the legislative history and within the code as a separate, distinct act, and one which is the very essence of the fresh start, which is described as the very essence of our modern bankruptcy laws."
1990.89-1149,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2336.271,2343.116,"Do they say why these provisions, why these nondischargeability provisions were written in if they were contrary to that principle?"
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,2343.116,2353.434,"Well, those are the few exceptions to the concept of discharge where Congress has determined that if a debt is fraudulently obtained that it should not be excepted."
1990.89-1149,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2406.369,2412.153,Why is a preponderance of the evidence standard incompatible with the fresh start?
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,2412.153,2430.763,"It is incompatible, Justice Blackmun, because the fresh start, being the cornerstone of the bankruptcy laws as this Court noted in Local Loan Company v. Hunt, that is a matter of public interest and it is a matter of great private interest as well for the debtor."
1990.89-1149,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2456.191,2457.703,"Well, you have said that about 10 times now."
1990.89-1149,2,43018,timothy_k_mcnamara,,2459.476,2472.543,"--It's insufficient not only because of the fresh start, Justice, but also because of the history, as just... Chief Justice Rehnquist noted, of having to prove claims of fraud by something more than a mere preponderance."
1990.89-1149,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2671.908,2675.23,"Thank you, Mr. McNamara."
