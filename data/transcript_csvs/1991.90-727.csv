1991.90-727,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.522,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-727, Robert G. Holmes v. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation."
1991.90-727,0,32959,jack_i_samet,,12.891,16.76,"Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-727,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,53.718,55.418,Did you say predicate act?
1991.90-727,0,32959,jack_i_samet,,55.418,57.92,"--Yes, a predicate act of racketeering activity."
1991.90-727,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,57.92,60.705,"Not a predicate crime, is that it?"
1991.90-727,0,32959,jack_i_samet,,60.705,62.705,"Well, I think they're pretty much--"
1991.90-727,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,62.705,65.239,Or a predicate violation of law?
1991.90-727,0,32959,jack_i_samet,,65.239,68.209,"--Well, I would prefer the term ""predicate act"" because it's neutral."
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1522.097,1525.817,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, may it please the Court."
1991.90-727,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1599.449,1606.686,"Is there some questions, though, about how direct the injury must be for purposes of a RICO claim?"
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1617.125,1617.708,There is indeed.
1991.90-727,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1633.468,1641.656,"Well, the argument is made here that SIPC similarly stands in an indirect relationship to this claim."
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1641.656,1661.302,"Well, if the relationship between a broker and his customers, which is the relationship we deal here, has as its best common law analogue, bailor-bailee, and the classic position has been between bailor-bailee, that either has the ability to sue for injury to the property."
1991.90-727,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1675.062,1684.733,"Would you explain to me, if you would, please, the capacity in which SIPC's suit is before us here?"
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1696.475,1701.112,It is suing in several capacities for several claims.
1991.90-727,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1721.608,1723.477,And you still won the case.
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1723.477,1731.214,"--We still won the case, Justice White, because we are suing as a subrogee of customers who were not purchaser-sellers."
1991.90-727,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1775.077,1777.945,Was that the theory of the court of appeals?
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1777.945,1781.147,"Your Honor, what's happened between--"
1991.90-727,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1781.147,1782.313,"Well, was it or not?"
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1782.313,1783.147,--No.
1991.90-727,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1785.599,1789.384,What... are you defending the court of appeals rationale?
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1789.384,1790.669,--I am... yes.
1991.90-727,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1790.669,1794.721,That isn't the rationale you just stated.
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1794.721,1801.542,"Justice White, I'm... an interesting thing happened between the court of appeals and the Supreme Court."
1991.90-727,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1801.542,1803.41,That's not strange.
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1804.243,1811.166,"The argument that was presented in the court of appeals was basically an interpretation of the phrase ""any person""."
1991.90-727,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1877.489,1879.023,May I ask you a question at this point?
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1895.284,1896.017,That's correct.
1991.90-727,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1896.017,1897.367,"Now, my question is this."
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1912.377,1914.893,"Well, I have to kind of go back through and figure it out."
1991.90-727,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1923.315,1924.684,100 cents on the dollar.
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1924.684,1929.052,"--100 cents on a dollar, and we did not reimburse any of them, that takes care--"
1991.90-727,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1929.052,1930.002,"Oh, so they would not be... okay."
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1930.002,1933.037,--That's not taking any... take care of--
1991.90-727,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1933.037,1933.287,All right.
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1937.239,1937.989,--That's correct.
1991.90-727,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1939.089,1948.13,"And assume that the wrongdoers have paid the firm everything it tortiously took from this firm, and the other customers, everything that they lost."
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1950.197,1952.249,If everybody has been paid off everything--
1991.90-727,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1952.249,1960.854,"--Well, not the category that you've had to reimburse, because they were presumably hurt by other... you know, this is not the sole cause of the failure of this firm."
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1960.854,1965.306,"--Well, Your Honor, I think it's really appropriate to talk about how this firm went under."
1991.90-727,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2125.858,2131.928,"But as you describe it, let's be sure I understand, as you describe it, I would think my second category would also have a cause of action against these people."
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2131.928,2132.63,"--Oh, I think they do."
1991.90-727,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2140.868,2142.834,Even though they are not purchasers or sellers.
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2142.834,2143.57,--That's correct.
1991.90-727,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2163.197,2171.887,I don't know any other statute where there is not some proximity requirement placed upon the ability to recover.
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2185.861,2186.277,No.
1991.90-727,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2238.626,2240.959,Do you have any cases on that?
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2241.625,2242.542,Yes.
1991.90-727,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2242.542,2244.511,The defrauded bidder would have--
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2244.511,2245.094,Yes.
1991.90-727,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2245.094,2248.129,--I mean the bidder who would have gotten it but for the fraud?
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2248.129,2248.512,Yes.
1991.90-727,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2251.831,2257.152,On the basis of defrauding or on the basis of unfair business practices?
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2257.152,2257.468,--No.
1991.90-727,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2298.109,2299.609,But the terrorist in the airplane is different.
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2318.568,2330.443,"--Your Honor, no, we're not arguing that the mother, the brother, the uncle, of any of the purchasers, or the landlord of one of the customers who now, because the customer was defrauded, can't continue to maintain his rent."
1991.90-727,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2330.443,2332.311,What about the employees of Sebag?
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2332.311,2333.061,No.
1991.90-727,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2333.061,2333.945,Why not?
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2333.945,2339.131,The injury there is precisely to injury... to... this is the corporate analogy.
1991.90-727,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2365.413,2368.198,Could I ask the question in another way?
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2387.361,2387.828,Yes.
1991.90-727,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2420.382,2424.751,"May I ask this, Mr. Blakey?"
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2433.023,2438.927,"Clearly under RICO, and a minimum, the predicate offense is mail fraud or wire fraud."
1991.90-727,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2450.735,2451.651,How could they sue?
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2454.187,2456.453,It's the loss that they suffered.
1991.90-727,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2458.453,2463.523,Anyone that is caused a loss by the deceiving of someone else has a cause of action for fraud?
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2463.523,2473.063,"--Well, Your Honor, part of the problem here is that scheme to defraud is not equivalent to common law deceit."
1991.90-727,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2499.863,2504.065,They are all subsequent consequences of the fraud.
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2506.85,2512.254,"Well, but in this context, the defrauding was of the broker-dealership itself."
1991.90-727,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2516.539,2518.372,"Yes, it's called a sinking, though."
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2525.561,2527.628,That's what common law deceit meant.
1991.90-727,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2541.904,2544.022,--I'm not saying it means common-law deceit.
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2564.566,2571.671,The issue here is... can be put in terms of what is the target of the fraud.
1991.90-727,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2623.354,2625.054,--You took them down directly.
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2643.377,2654.918,"Justice Scalia, this is a fact-specific question that was raised in the trial court and the held... the holding below is that we raised a material question of fact on that question."
1991.90-727,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2667.81,2668.31,--What fact?
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2670.928,2675.547,"--Well, if you take a look at the Bunnington Park."
1991.90-727,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2696.675,2699.043,"Mr. Blakey, you're speaking as if it were a trial below."
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2705.983,2712.387,It granted summary judgment only on the issue is we were not a purchaser-seller.
1991.90-727,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2712.387,2714.337,Were other issues actually tried?
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2714.337,2716.421,All the other issues were raised.
1991.90-727,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2716.421,2719.64,"Well, I didn't ask you whether they were raised; I asked you whether they were tried."
1991.90-727,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2719.64,2721.742,They were posed in a motion for--
1991.90-727,2,32959,jack_i_samet,,3124.743,3127.595,I don't intend to use them all unless there are questions from the Court.
1991.90-727,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3168.254,3173.789,You say wouldn't be suing under RICO if you were just suing for subrogation.
1991.90-727,2,32959,jack_i_samet,,3173.789,3174.158,--Exactly.
1991.90-727,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3193.452,3195.654,"Well, I know, but they did liquidate them."
1991.90-727,2,32959,jack_i_samet,,3195.654,3196.504,"Yes, but--"
1991.90-727,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3196.504,3200.122,And they paid out millions of dollars in claims.
1991.90-727,2,32959,jack_i_samet,,3200.122,3201.172,--But that doesn't give them standing.
1991.90-727,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3202.588,3203.138,I didn't say it did.
1991.90-727,2,32959,jack_i_samet,,3203.138,3203.638,--Okay.
1991.90-727,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3203.638,3205.874,"I didn't say it did, but it was a liquidation."
1991.90-727,2,32959,jack_i_samet,,3205.874,3210.326,But this is the claim that we're discussing: SIPC's power to assert.
1991.90-727,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3226.252,3227.12,Like an insurance company coming in.
1991.90-727,2,32959,jack_i_samet,,3227.12,3229.237,"Yes, that is exactly correct, Mr. Justice White."
1991.90-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3239.195,3246.999,"Of course, the Blue Chip case, you know, cuts against you in a way because that opinion assumed there were classes of investors other than purchasers or sellers who could be directly injured."
1991.90-727,2,32959,jack_i_samet,,3256.355,3261.657,"Well, of course we all know the author of that decision sits on this Court and is best... in the best position to describe what the decision meant."
1991.90-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3262.423,3263.44,That's what he said in the opinion.
1991.90-727,2,32959,jack_i_samet,,3266.959,3271.679,"I'm sure he would make very clear what he means, but let me tell you what I think he meant, to be corrected, I'm sure, by him."
1991.90-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3316.737,3320.237,"Thank you, Mr. Samet."
