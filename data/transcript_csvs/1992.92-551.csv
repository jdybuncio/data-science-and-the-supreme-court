1992.92-551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.903,"We'll hear argument next in Number 92-551, Henry Cisneros v. Alpine Ridge Group."
1992.92-551,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,44.826,48.184,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-551,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,261.396,277.905,"Well, Mr. Dreeben, now, was the decision of the Ninth Circuit basically that that provision should be read as requiring the Government to factor in those differences in the published formula?"
1992.92-551,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,277.905,279.639,"--That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1992.92-551,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,304.519,322.121,"Well, read in light of the statute, could it be thought to be ambiguous to some extent as to whether they're going to make these comparability studies in the published formula or whether they're going to do it separately in a case-by-case basis?"
1992.92-551,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,322.121,330.773,"The statute itself, in our view, is not ambiguous on the question of whether comparability studies are authorized."
1992.92-551,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,330.773,346.127,"No, I said was the contract ambiguous, read in light of the statute, which contemplated, apparently, that the Government could agree in these contracts to a formula approach to the adjustments?"
1992.92-551,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,346.127,350.688,"No, I do not think that the contract is at all ambiguous read in light of the statute."
1992.92-551,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,526.444,534.207,"Well now, why did the Government concede in the Ninth Circuit that section 801 substantially impaired the contract?"
1992.92-551,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,534.207,539.627,"Well, Justice O'Connor, I don't believe that the Government did concede that in any meaningful sense."
1992.92-551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,679.085,684.038,It used the proviso only after it had gone through the formulaic calculations.
1992.92-551,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,684.038,685.427,"That's exactly right, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1992.92-551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,742.515,760.93,"Of course, if you have your formulas set unrealistically enough... that is, high enough... you would always have this case-by-case adjustment applicable, which would defeat the whole purpose of requiring the formula."
1992.92-551,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,760.93,770.066,"I think you're right, Justice Scalia, that if HUD really manipulated the adjustment factor in such a way so that it was never applicable, then this would be a very different case."
1992.92-551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,770.066,775.688,"And Congress has required in the statute that there be the adjustment formula, right?"
1992.92-551,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,775.688,791.323,"Yes, that's... it required that there be either the use of comparisons of fair market rentals or a reasonable formula, and HUD elected the reasonable formula approach, but the point here is that the factors in general operation are not inaccurate."
1992.92-551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,849.629,854.814,Do we have any idea what percentage of the projects were reevaluated in this fashion?
1992.92-551,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,854.814,862.998,"The record does not show that, and I don't think that there have been reliable statistics that would be publicly available that would show that kind of information."
1992.92-551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,911.759,930.706,"May I just ask on 801, at the time Congress passed 801, was the Ninth Circuit the only one to have ruled on whether HUD could use comparability studies, or had there been other courts, district courts in other circuits, that had ruled on the point?"
1992.92-551,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,930.706,938.796,"Justice Kennedy, to my knowledge the Ninth Circuit was the only Federal court, the only court to rule on this issue."
1992.92-551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1485.045,1487.997,"Mr. Dreeben, could I ask you a couple of questions about your first point?"
1992.92-551,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1499.054,1501.334,"No, Justice Scalia, we don't, for two reasons."
1992.92-551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1574.149,1579.037,"Well, you're... you're not saying Chevron applies to the contract."
1992.92-551,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1579.037,1581.037,"Chevron doesn't apply to the contract, Chevron--"
1992.92-551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1581.037,1583.785,You're saying it applies to the statute and somehow gets parlayed into the contract.
1992.92-551,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1583.785,1584.206,--That's correct.
1992.92-551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1600.498,1604.778,"Well, that's just to say that the agency should be careful when it draws up the contracts."
1992.92-551,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1604.778,1632.844,"--I agree, and in this case I think the agency has been careful and has made it unambiguous, but the other principle that applies here is that a party that seeks to apply a right against the Government and to foreclose the exercise of the Government's power to make sure that its programs are working right should also get unambiguous language in its favor, and by no stretch of the imagination did the owners get an unambiguous right to above-market rents when the comparability studies show that the factors just aren't working in that particular case."
1992.92-551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1633.687,1635.14,Is Fulton cited in your brief?
1992.92-551,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1635.14,1641.122,"--Fulton is cited in our reply brief, Chief Justice Rehnquist, at--"
1992.92-551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1641.122,1644.761,If it's in your reply brief--
1992.92-551,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1644.761,1645.043,--Page 5.
1992.92-551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1648.229,1649.401,--Very well.
1992.92-551,1,44443,warren_j_daheim,,1653.041,1655.54,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-551,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3281.246,3282.605,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.92-551,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3283.777,3284.84,Very well.
