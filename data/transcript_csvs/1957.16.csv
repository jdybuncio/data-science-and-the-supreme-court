1957.16,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,15.485,"Number 16, Andrew G. Nelson, Appellant, versus United States of America."
1957.16,0,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,20.83,23.698,"May it please, Your Honors."
1957.16,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,176.435,176.925,Yes.
1957.16,0,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,176.925,181.355,-- if they be moved and delivered to drugstores.
1957.16,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1039.022,1071.557,"Mr. Blanchard, may I ask you whether which one of two things is your contention, one, that this word in the grandfather -- in the -- in the certificate and permit are terms of art and that new -- and new store fixtures, new household, goods in stock and trade of drugstores describes the category of commodities such as are used in drugstores (Voice Overlap) --"
1957.16,0,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,1071.557,1073.186,Such as are sold in drugstores.
1957.16,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1073.186,1074.384,Which are sold?
1957.16,0,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,1074.384,1075.021,"Yes, sir."
1957.16,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1075.021,1079.768,You -- you say that a term of art which -- which is so identified and --
1957.16,0,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,1079.768,1081.204,"A term of art, I don't understand."
1957.16,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1081.204,1086.142,"Is that a technical, is that a thing that people in this business know as such?"
1957.16,0,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,1086.142,1093.292,People in this business are thoroughly familiar with the description of its authorized commodities in terms of the place where they are sold.
1957.16,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1096.988,1107.619,"I mean, that's so settled that that's the meaning, that's a gloss that's encrusted on those English words and that's what they must mean and nothing else, is that it?"
1957.16,0,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,1107.619,1110.278,"I'm not sure I understand, Your Honor."
1957.16,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1110.278,1123.498,"It must -- the meaning that you give -- give to this phrase, is that a meaning that must be given to those words by anybody who knows how they are used in this -- in such a situation?"
1957.16,0,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,1123.498,1130.483,"Yes, Your Honor, unless there is a specific restriction stated in so many words appearing in the authority."
1957.16,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1130.483,1134.472,"And you say that's as though Congress had so defined it, is that what you're saying?"
1957.16,0,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,1134.472,1138.854,"Yes, sir, by the -- in grandfather permits only."
1957.16,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1144.637,1149.816,I understand that but we first have to determine what the scope is before we can decide what it's controlled in.
1957.16,0,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,1149.816,1150.338,That was done by the --
1957.16,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1150.338,1160.555,"And what I'm trying to find out is whether the scope is so defined by these terms that the Commission had no choice but to give it your meaning, that's what you're saying, is it?"
1957.16,0,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,1160.555,1162.655,"That's what I'm saying, as a matter of law."
1957.16,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1162.655,1163.577,As a matter of law.
1957.16,0,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,1163.577,1163.912,As a matter of law.
1957.16,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1163.912,1165.351,Have choice at all.
1957.16,0,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,1167.491,1184.152,And we point to the fact -- we point to the fact that in the McAteer case where the authorities were both within the classification of good -- of reference to goods by reference to place where they're sold.
1957.16,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1188.303,1195.105,"Are you saying -- well, are you saying wherever there's a permit that makes some reference to a place."
1957.16,0,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,1199.175,1204.577,Only when it's a place of sale that's recognized classification of commodity description.
1957.16,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1204.577,1207.351,"That's a technical -- well, I call it technical description."
1957.16,0,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,1207.351,1212.39,That just -- just as our descriptions by reference to the industry served --
1957.16,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1212.39,1213.405,All right.
1957.16,0,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,1213.405,1215.364,-- supplies for (Inaudible) --
1957.16,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1215.364,1221.187,That you can prove that at least to me by some other cases which had some other terms.
1957.16,0,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,1221.187,1221.527,No.
1957.16,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1241.634,1249.497,Because that's a very different phrase than this such as are sold by wholesale house means such as are sold by a wholesale house.
1957.16,0,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,1249.497,1249.914,And the Commission --
1957.16,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1249.914,1251.754,But we haven't got such a phrase here.
1957.16,0,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,1251.754,1260.436,The Commission held as I pointed out as the McAteer case that stock in trade of and goods such as are sold by were synonymous terms.
1957.16,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1263.622,1269.086,All right.
1957.16,0,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,1269.086,1287.455,"Now, I will not have the time to go into the -- as I say that the Ratner case was the last effort by the Commission made to read into a permit describing the authorized commodities in terms of place of sale until this case came forward."
1957.16,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1542.534,1544.832,Mr. Fisher.
1957.16,1,39278,roger_d_fisher,,1544.832,1548.554,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1957.16,2,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,3385.847,3388.355,May it please the Court.
1957.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3388.355,3390.317,Mr. Blanchard.
1957.16,2,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,3390.317,3418.493,"We cannot believe that a Congress which went to such lengths to keep the issuing Commission in this case from any semblance of control over the scope of the authority of a grandfather permit, a Congress which commanded that Commission to find what this man has been doing then issue the -- the permit without further proceedings."
1957.16,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3479.718,3487.362,"May I ask Mr. Blanchard, was it necessary to obtain the permit?"
1957.16,2,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,3489.482,3493.007,"Yes, because the first sentence in 209 requires it."
1957.16,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3493.007,3500.736,"Now then, (Inaudible) for obtaining the permit is (Inaudible) the scope of the right, isn't it?"
1957.16,2,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,3500.736,3502.33,Yes.
1957.16,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3502.33,3512.246,"And if error was made in (Inaudible), wouldn't the remedy be (Inaudible)."
1957.16,2,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,3521.713,3531.545,"I think as we have interpreted this permit for over 20 years, it doesn't need any -- any modification."
1957.16,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3540.129,3565.029,"Are you -- did you say that clause, the language of authority it place in the permit can do all you've been doing, or do you say that regardless of the language of the permit, you nevertheless under the statute has the right to do all what you've been doing?"
1957.16,2,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,3565.029,3566.296,That's the point.
1957.16,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3568.105,3568.575,Then you're (Voice Overlap) --
1957.16,2,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,3568.575,3594.474,"-- if it's possible -- if it's possible to interpret that permit as -- conveying to us the right which the statute gave us, it is just as much the duty of the -- of this Commission to so interpret it as it was of the issuing commission to issuing the permit having that scope, the same scope of authority as the scope of the operation."
1957.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3603.272,3603.389,No.
1957.16,2,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,3604.88,3605.514,"Oh, I beg your pardon."
1957.16,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3605.514,3607.004,Only the red light when it comes up.
1957.16,2,37708,paul_e_blanchard,,3607.004,3615.446,"I would like to explain the statement of Mr. Nelson's, what I've found which the counsel has so heavily relied in."
