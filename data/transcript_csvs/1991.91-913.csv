1991.91-913,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.577,"We'll hear argument now in No. 91-913, John R. Patterson, Trustee v. Joseph B. Shumate, Jr.--"
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,13.282,14.284,"It is Agee, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-913,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,14.284,14.482,Agee.
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,14.482,15.734,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-913,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,133.143,135.366,What does that have to do with anything before us?
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,135.366,148.623,"Mr. Justice White, I think what that has to do with is establishing that plan participants have very little exposure, by and large, if the interest of their--"
1991.91-913,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,148.623,152.436,What does that have to do with the entitlement of the beneficiary?
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,152.436,155.93,--It protects the entitlement of the beneficiary.
1991.91-913,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,205.451,212.084,But this section applies to all pension plans or not?
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,212.084,214.257,Section 522?
1991.91-913,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,237.152,243.966,"Yes, but it would apply to, not just ERISA pension plans, wouldn't it?"
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,243.966,246.688,--That... that's correct.
1991.91-913,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,247.517,258.446,"But if it is an ERISA plan you have a provision in ERISA plans that may not be present in other plans, namely, that it is not subject to attachment."
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,258.446,261.507,"--Mr. Justice White, that's correct."
1991.91-913,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,290.288,301.538,"Well, on your provision you are writing out of the code, ERISA as a nonbankruptcy applicable law."
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,301.538,307.061,"That's correct, in a sense, Mr. Justice White, for two reasons."
1991.91-913,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,340.885,344.557,Where do we find the text of 522(b)(2)(a)?
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,349.021,357.436,"In my brief, Mr. Chief Justice, it would be in the petition for cert.--"
1991.91-913,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,357.436,363.269,"Is that Appendix 1A, petition for cert?"
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,363.269,370.595,"--That's correct, page 60A in the petition for certiorari."
1991.91-913,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,370.595,373.367,Thank you.
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,373.367,386.077,"The bankruptcy trustee would be able to access, if the ERISA benefit is included as part of the estate, only that to which the debtor could have accessed."
1991.91-913,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,409.942,419.539,"Well, it might be of limited significance, but it's still the case that there is not a complete identity of the subjects to which the exclusion and the exemption apply."
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,430.158,465.25,"Mr. Justice Souter, I do to this extent: that if you conclude first that there is an omnibus exclusion of ERISA benefits under 541(c)(2), using that applicable nonbankruptcy law language, then if you came to the exemption section, the only place where the Congress apparently has said explicitly, this is where we are dealing with an ERISA benefit, and it has placed, at least in the non-opt-out States, a limitation to the reasonable needs of the debtor, I submit that that is written out of the code because you have created first an omnibus--"
1991.91-913,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,465.25,474.036,"That may be written out with respect to the ERISA plans, but there are still going to be plans covered by the exemption that are not covered by the exclusion; isn't that correct?"
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,474.036,475.007,--That is correct.
1991.91-913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,484.443,490.838,Where is the language you are talking about?
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,494.881,499.574,"--522(d), I think will be, as cited in my brief--"
1991.91-913,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,499.574,502.646,Where is the... I want the text.
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,502.646,504.328,--That would be page 3.
1991.91-913,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,504.328,506.199,Page 3 of your brief?
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,506.199,507.698,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-913,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,507.698,507.868,Thank you.
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,507.868,535.206,"But if there is an inclusion of the ERISA benefit where the actual trust protection of the plan doesn't cover it for some reason, or if the bankruptcy trustee was able to access an asset that the debtor could actually reach into the plan and take out, there would still remain the exemptions available in bankruptcy under section 522(d)."
1991.91-913,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,552.077,557.803,"Mr. Agee, could I ask you a question because I must confess I am having a little difficulty following the argument."
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,565.727,566.989,That's correct.
1991.91-913,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,566.989,573.862,"And am I also correct that your argument based on this (d)(2), whatever, relates solely to 522?"
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,573.862,577.174,"No, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1991.91-913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,591.414,593.537,It doesn't refer to ERISA though.
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,597.369,609.657,"Well, it refers to, on page 4, three triple I's, plans... it's done in the negative, but plans to qualify under section 401(a)."
1991.91-913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,611.64,613.914,"Exclusively ERISA, nothing but ERISA--"
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,613.914,617.627,"No, that would include other types of plans including Government plans."
1991.91-913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,617.627,618.648,"--Yes, but that shoots your argument."
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,618.648,620.619,"Well, I hope that it doesn't."
1991.91-913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,620.619,621.751,That utterly destroys your argument.
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,621.751,636.991,"Because if you are going to accord plain meaning to this particular section, then reasonable needs limitations for private plans, pension plans, stock bonus plans, profit-sharing plans, that's gone."
1991.91-913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,663.949,678.391,"But even if ERISA is excluded under the earlier provision, you would still need this provision to cover some plans other than ERISA, as to which you wanted only the reasonable needs limitation; isn't that right?"
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,680.342,691.23,"It would still make sense as long as... if you read out 522(d) the coverage for pension plans, stock bonus plans and profit-sharing plans, which would be private plans."
1991.91-913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,691.23,692.161,Right.
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,692.161,697.935,And I don't think the Congress would have intended that if they would have included that language in the statute.
1991.91-913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,697.935,700.686,"Maybe not, but you can't say that it is utterly illogical."
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,708.192,710.273,It would... that's correct.
1991.91-913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,713.665,713.805,A little bit.
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,713.805,728.035,There is another issue here in dealing in particular with the exemption question which differentiates this particular case from other cases the Court has heard before.
1991.91-913,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,818.136,821.269,Could I back up just a second because I want to be sure I understand your argument.
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,837.288,841.201,"--I do, Mr. Justice Stevens, for several reasons."
1991.91-913,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,841.201,849.176,"But I didn't understand you had made that argument yet, and that is the argument the court of appeals addressed and disagreed with."
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,849.176,850.788,That's correct.
1991.91-913,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,850.788,852.418,"Now, why are they wrong?"
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,852.418,853.93,There are several reasons.
1991.91-913,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,889.433,903.504,"So you say, to G these two sections you have to just say that ERISA is not an nonbankruptcy law... applicable nonbankruptcy law."
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,903.504,905.577,In this particular section--
1991.91-913,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,905.577,910.419,Because Congress has specifically dealt with the issue in another section?
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,910.419,913.522,"--That is the primary argument, Justice White."
1991.91-913,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,913.522,922.869,What kind of a nonbankruptcy law would... what kind of an law would be an applicable nonbankruptcy law?
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,922.869,934.646,"In that section, 541(c)(2), the argument has been made in all the other lower courts that the law... the applicable nonbankruptcy law is limited to State law in that section."
1991.91-913,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,941.771,942.472,Can I interrupt you again?
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,958.872,979.255,"--If it qualifies... if you accept the bankruptcy trustee's argument that State law is applicable to nonbankruptcy law only here and the spendthrift trust protection applies, then it has taken the property out of the estate by this specific statutory exclusion before you get to the exemption provision."
1991.91-913,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,979.255,979.616,Exactly.
1991.91-913,0,24874,g_steven_agee,,979.616,993.155,"And in the legislative history of this section, the discussion is on the continuing over of the pre-code practice of honoring spendthrift trust protection under State law."
1991.91-913,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1262.876,1264.108,"Thank you, Mr. Agee."
1991.91-913,1,33855,kevin_r_huennekens,,1265.36,1276.546,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-913,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1344.391,1347.523,Applicable nonbankruptcy law.
1991.91-913,1,33855,kevin_r_huennekens,,1347.523,1349.586,"Applicable nonbankruptcy law, yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-913,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1358.683,1363.305,"A lot of ERISA plans are pension plans, aren't they?"
1991.91-913,1,33855,kevin_r_huennekens,,1363.305,1366.958,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1991.91-913,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1366.958,1376.243,"Well, 522 speaks of pension plans and it says how much of it can be exempted."
1991.91-913,1,33855,kevin_r_huennekens,,1383.257,1398.778,"The reason, Mr. Justice White, that ERISA plans exclude from 541(c)(2) is because ERISA requires that qualified plans, the pension plan, the assets be held in a trust."
1991.91-913,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1412.267,1412.718,"Well, I know."
1991.91-913,1,33855,kevin_r_huennekens,,1431.11,1438.327,"--There may very well be a slight overlap between the two provisions, but that is not necessarily fatal."
1991.91-913,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1594.135,1596.449,"How can you be certain of that, Mr. Huennekens?"
1991.91-913,1,33855,kevin_r_huennekens,,1604.556,1609.398,"Mr. Chief Justice, they have not been definitively construed."
1991.91-913,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1628.6,1630.803,How did the Fourth Circuit know that?
1991.91-913,1,33855,kevin_r_huennekens,,1630.803,1650.937,"From the context within which the language was used in a particular place, for instance, referring to the securities laws, referring to copyright law, those types of references, obviously incorporating Federal law as well as State law."
1991.91-913,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1842.595,1845.246,You mean it doesn't cover spendthrift trusts?
1991.91-913,1,33855,kevin_r_huennekens,,1845.246,1850.361,"--In some States, spendthrift trust law has been abolished altogether."
1991.91-913,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1850.361,1855.774,"Yes, but in those States where there is spendthrift trust laws, they would apply."
1991.91-913,1,33855,kevin_r_huennekens,,1856.946,1858.669,They most certainly would be an applicable law.
1991.91-913,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1858.669,1866.785,"So that problem of having somewhat varying and inconsistent State laws apply, I mean, that problem exists no matter what, doesn't it?"
1991.91-913,1,33855,kevin_r_huennekens,,1866.785,1891.44,"Mr. Justice, I am suggesting that ERISA has its own... by virtue of the anti-alienation provision, which has been... preempts State law, it is the end of the analysis with regard to whether or not it can be... the pension benefit can be subjected to creditor process."
1991.91-913,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1891.44,1894.034,"Once you have an ERISA plan, I understand."
1991.91-913,1,33855,kevin_r_huennekens,,1907.173,1908.545,That is correct.
1991.91-913,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1908.545,1910.047,But just not for ERISA plans.
1991.91-913,1,33855,kevin_r_huennekens,,1910.047,1911.639,Just not for ERISA plans.
1991.91-913,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2102.457,2105.72,"How would that come about, Mr. Huennekens, what you just said?"
1991.91-913,1,33855,kevin_r_huennekens,,2105.72,2117.307,--It is... the restriction on the voluntary or involuntary alienation of ERISA plans is uniformly enforced outside of bankruptcy.
1991.91-913,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2147.998,2161.789,That seems to me the whole purpose of the bankruptcy law is to collect assets that have never been collected before and protective and made available to creditors.
1991.91-913,1,33855,kevin_r_huennekens,,2173.217,2177.807,"The easy answer, Mr. Chief Justice, is yes."
1991.91-913,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2223.708,2230.533,But property is just treated differently in a bankruptcy proceeding than it is outside of bankruptcy.
1991.91-913,1,33855,kevin_r_huennekens,,2230.533,2240.52,"I would respectfully say no, that inside of bankruptcy, the property interests are the same as those outside of bankruptcy."
1991.91-913,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2255.38,2258.872,"Well, outside of bankruptcy, creditors can just sue and attach."
1991.91-913,1,33855,kevin_r_huennekens,,2261.256,2263.626,"That's exactly right, Justice--"
1991.91-913,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2263.626,2265.116,So the property is treated differently.
1991.91-913,1,33855,kevin_r_huennekens,,2265.116,2287.093,"--The property is subject to an automatic stay, so the creditors cannot reach the property, but the property is there to be liquidated for the benefit of the creditors by a trustee and then equally divided among all creditors under the distribution provisions of the bankruptcy code rather than allowing one creditor to attach and beat out the other creditors."
1991.91-913,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2379.923,2382.285,"Thank you, Mr. Huennekens."
1991.91-913,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2384.118,2394.205,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-913,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2674.628,2677.871,"Thank you, Mr. Wright."
1991.91-913,3,24874,g_steven_agee,,2681.143,2686.468,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-913,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2863.348,2864.758,"Thank you, Mr. Agee."
