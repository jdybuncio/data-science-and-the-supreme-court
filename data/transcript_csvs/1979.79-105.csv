1979.79-105,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,54.466,We'll hear arguments next in Curtiss-Wright Corporation against General Electric Corporation.
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,58.286,62.251,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.79-105,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,141.679,145.962,Could those counterclaims be fairly characterized as unliquidated?
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,145.962,146.76,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-105,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,301.142,321.795,"Mr. Del Deo, you -- I take it, you don't question either this -- of the statements in Sears, Roebuck versus Mackey that the district -- the primary discretion to certify under Rule 54 is vested in the District Court or that the Court of Appeals may review that certification for abuse of discretion."
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,321.795,335.435,"I -- I certainly agree, Your Honor that the Sears case -- I -- I emphasize that the primary discretion was in the District Court."
1979.79-105,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,462.519,466.699,"But on 437, let me quote you this language from Sears, Roebuck."
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,487.856,488.624,That's correct.
1979.79-105,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,488.624,498.202,And that -- and then it goes on to say “primary -- primary discretion in the District Court -- the abuse of discretion review in the Court of Appeals.”
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,505.385,507.159,You mean in -- in the present case?
1979.79-105,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,507.159,507.973,Yes.
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,507.973,519.784,"Well, I -- I think that insofar as the standards are concerned, we did, pursuant to Sears, have a separate claim for relief and that claim was finally disposed of."
1979.79-105,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,610.427,612.156,129 could be a --
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,612.156,613.325,"But now, I want to get-- pardon?"
1979.79-105,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,613.325,618.543,"1292 (b), where the District Court certifies them, the Court of Appeals can accept or reject."
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,618.543,621.427,"Well, that's -- that's interlocut -- interlocutory, yes."
1979.79-105,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,737.408,750.002,"Your position is that this appeal could have proceeded in the Court of Appeals on the merits and then the judgment nonetheless, be -- have been stayed pending the outcome of the Third Circuit ruling."
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,750.002,778.584,"It could have -- if -- if the District Court had so determined, and there are a number of cases that we've cited in our brief to this effect, 54 (b) certification can be entered at -- judgments can be entered and -- and a motion made to stay them under 62 (h) and because of a counterclaim or whatever reason and they can either be stayed or not, not only pending appeal but pending a final determination of all the issues."
1979.79-105,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,793.74,803.529,I haven't heard you describe the harsh and extraordinary circumstances that are postulated as the basis.
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,803.529,818.514,"Well, for one thing, Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I think that harsh unusual circumstances has never been articulated by this Court in describing Rule 54 (b)."
1979.79-105,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,818.514,823.781,What -- what did the District Courts consider was the circumstances that justified his certification?
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,823.781,851.368,"The -- the District Court considered the fact that Curtiss-Wright was being deprived of its property, its monetary property and would be so deprived for a long time and would suffer financial loss because of it while the unadjudicated claims of both parties went through a long process and while the defendants in this case had the full use of the property."
1979.79-105,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,952.785,955.491,"Mr. Del Deo, that really wouldn't be up to you in this case, would it?"
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,964.077,984.587,"Well, I -- Your Honor, I think that one of the dangers of the Third Circuit's position in this case is with respect to counterclaims that it will encourage imaginative counterclaims certainly, and it will also encourage litigants to prolong litigation because we're --"
1979.79-105,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,984.587,986.369,"I'm not suggesting, I just want to make --"
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,986.369,986.424,Yes.
1979.79-105,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,986.424,987.291,-- my point more narrow.
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,996.901,997.488,Yes.
1979.79-105,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,997.488,1010.086,"And you were suggesting that you would be discouraged from joining those in the same action by this -- by a contrary rule, but it seems to me, even if you had separate actions for your two groups of claims, General Electric could still counterclaim in which ever one they chose."
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,1010.086,1013.768,"I -- Your Honor, I -- I -- that may well be."
1979.79-105,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1027.582,1029.021,It's not insult necessarily.
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,1029.021,1029.915,What?
1979.79-105,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1029.915,1031.781,It's not necessarily an insult.
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,1031.781,1033.056,"Well, I -- I -- excuse me."
1979.79-105,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1062.123,1073.142,But you haven't pinpointed what I thought I read in your brief that the -- one of the harsh circumstances here is that they're going to be deprived specifically of about $1 million a year.
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,1073.142,1075.037,"Well, that is a financial injustice."
1979.79-105,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1101.563,1126.293,"Would it have served your purposes, your client's purposes if the judge had ordered that the judgment be paid into the registry of the courts and invested in high yield government obligations pending the outcome of the suits, so that there might be 11% or 12% return, instead of 6% return?"
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,1126.293,1127.203,"Well, of course, Your Honor."
1979.79-105,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1135.593,1139.124,"Well, I know you -- you'd -- you'd gotten into the subject, or at least --"
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,1139.124,1139.142,Right.
1979.79-105,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1139.142,1144.581,-- on the edge of the subject of imaginative or innovative remedies.
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,1151.813,1156.172,"Well, that I don't think is a 54-- with due respect to, Your Honor."
1979.79-105,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1165.862,1170.248,You're saying that that would be within the equity powers of -- of the judge?
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,1170.248,1178.198,"Your Honor, what I am saying really is that it is not a consideration under 54 (b)."
1979.79-105,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1179.222,1180.661,Were on the finality issue.
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,1180.661,1194.771,On the finality issue and it's not a -- a consideration on his -- on the question of bu-- of abuse of discretion because he -- he has the discretion under this rule and he has not abused it.
1979.79-105,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1204.882,1228.327,"I -- I submit to you only that if you agreed that this would be a reasonable solution, the hypothetical solution I suggested, then would that not have some bearing on the arguments you're making about the correctness of the District Judge's ruling?"
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,1228.327,1228.801,"Well, I --"
1979.79-105,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1228.801,1239.675,"That he have to -- he had alternative remedies, this hypothetical one being possibly one and the one he adopted based on finality being another one."
1979.79-105,0,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,1239.675,1247.683,"Well, I -- the motion that I made was under 54 (b) and I -- I think the decision he made was a correct one."
1979.79-105,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1294.808,1299.773,"Well, the Third Circuit here conceded that these decisions are final under 1291, didn't it?"
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1641.328,1646.33,Mr. Jus -- Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.79-105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1703.337,1711.988,"Of course, an even more effective way to prevent piecemeal appeals would have been avoid -- to avoid adopting Rule 54 (b) at all, wouldn't it?"
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1711.988,1713.307,"Yes, indeed, Your Honor."
1979.79-105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1762.163,1772.406,"Do you suggest -- before you go into that, Mr. Groner, that the District Court wasn't aware of all these factors when he did this weighing process?"
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1772.406,1777.956,I -- I could not say that he was not aware of it.
1979.79-105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1823.519,1825.329,"Mr. Groner, may I just clarify one thing."
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1828.648,1829.335,"No, Your Honor."
1979.79-105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1832.937,1836.973,But do you -- do you then question his power to enter 54 (b) finding?
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1836.973,1837.63,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1979.79-105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1837.63,1838.978,Then you question his power to enter --
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1838.978,1839.932,"Oh, no, no."
1979.79-105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1861.219,1866.509,"If there were no just reason for delay, then it would be a -- the kind of order which could be made final by him."
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1866.509,1867.224,"Oh, yes, indeed."
1979.79-105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1867.224,1867.456,I see.
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1867.476,1868.161,"There's no question about it, Your Honor."
1979.79-105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1868.161,1868.944,"Oh, yes."
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1868.944,1870.028,Yes.
1979.79-105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1925.793,1926.821,At -- at what -- at what --
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1926.821,1927.001,Yes?
1979.79-105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1927.001,1932.754,"Could -- it would help me if you'd indicate it what date the revisers' notes, if you have time."
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,1932.754,1937.262,"These were, I believe, in 1946, Your Honor."
1979.79-105,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2035.853,2044.306,"But there's no question but -- that 54 (b) is an exception to that rule and the question in this case is the breathe of that exception, isn't that correct?"
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2044.306,2045.106,"Yes, indeed."
1979.79-105,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2045.106,2051.359,"You would concede that 54 (b) is -- whatever -- whatever its scope is an exception to that rule, wouldn't you?"
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2051.359,2052.253,"Yes, indeed."
1979.79-105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2091.665,2125.658,"What you have just tell us -- and what I take it you're telling us and about to enlarge on is that the loss of $1,000,008 a year that it was an abuse of discretion for the District Judge to say, to believe, that the loss of $1,000,008 per year on this interest problem was an -- was simply not founded, that that didn't bring it within the infrequent exception rule."
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2125.658,2128.357,"That is precisely our position, Your Honor."
1979.79-105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2155.071,2164.676,Are you saying in effect that it has to be a situation almost like Chrysler Motor Company that it's on the verge of bankruptcy if it doesn't get some cash right away?
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2164.676,2180.203,That would be the type of case that we would think the framers of -- of the rule intended and would be an infrequent harsh case because that would be a case that would present special circumstances.
1979.79-105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2186.828,2194.474,"Well, are -- is the judgment of this size on -- does that fall in the category of an ordinary money -- money judgment?"
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2194.474,2195.2,"Well, it -- it --"
1979.79-105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2195.2,2197.786,"What is this about, $20 million, the judgment?"
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2197.786,2200.226,"It's almost $20 million, Your Honor."
1979.79-105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2201.178,2202.827,"It's not very ordinary, is it?"
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2202.827,2203.308,Yes.
1979.79-105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2203.308,2204.79,Not very ordinary.
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2204.79,2209.957,"It -- it depends, Your Honor on whether we're adopting an absolute standard or a relative standard."
1979.79-105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2209.957,2210.382,Right.
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2210.382,2213.149,"To me, that is huge."
1979.79-105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2241.554,2244.508,"When you say us, you're not referring to General Electric, are you?"
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2244.508,2246.786,No.
1979.79-105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2246.786,2253.401,"As -- among -- a $1,000,008 being to cur -- Curtiss-Wright like a few $100 would be to General Electric?"
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2253.401,2254.112,"No, Your Honor."
1979.79-105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2257.563,2257.971,We'll accept that.
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2257.971,2258.906,I was really --
1979.79-105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2258.906,2260.256,We'll accept that.
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2260.256,2269.623,"I was really only trying to apply a relative test that in all candor, I would not know how the relative test would come out for any individual or for any corporation."
1979.79-105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2269.623,2293.465,"Well, speaking of relativity, Mr. Groner, I suppose if the Advisory Committee in the rulemaking process was trying to have some firm rules that would be applicable forever, $20 million in 1946 isn't the same as $20 million in 1980, is it?"
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2293.465,2299.461,"I would suppose not, Your Honor, but I -- again I repeat that it is a large sum of money."
1979.79-105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2323.327,2326.835,"Mr. Groner, can I suggest another approach to the case?"
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2364.227,2373.433,"Well, Your Honor, the -- the considerations in Rule 54 (b) are whether there ought to be an appeal at this particular Court."
1979.79-105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2373.433,2376.332,"Correct, thinking in terms of getting the whole case over."
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2376.332,2390.573,"Thinking in terms of -- of, perhaps, of getting the whole case over but weighing that in terms of the historic policy against piecemeal appeals, which has well-grounded public policy considerations for it."
1979.79-105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2410.226,2417.247,(Voice Overlap) a District Judge who isn't constantly thinking about ways to get a case of this magnitude settled?
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2417.247,2420.224,"Well, Your Honor, there -- there is no indication of that."
1979.79-105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2420.224,2420.427,Isn't --
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2420.427,2442.687,"-- and there's a -- there is -- if that was a consideration, that sort of consideration may well be the kind of consideration that ought to be weighed in terms of its significance as against the historic policy against piecemeal appeals."
1979.79-105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2466.885,2468.869,"Because on this record, he didn't articulate any such information."
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2468.869,2469.895,"No, Your Honor."
1979.79-105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2469.895,2499.385,"What if -- what if the Third Circuit, Mr. Groner, had said in this case, considering Rule 54 (b) and the -- its relationship to the tradition against piecemeal appeals, that in any case in which there is a pending plausible counterclaim, a district court in this circuit shall not certify for appeal a -- a final decision on person to Rule 54 (b)."
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2504.402,2508.048,We do -- we do not think that that is what the Third Circuit did.
1979.79-105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2508.048,2511.251,"Well, I -- the -- but I'm -- my mind is a hypothetical question."
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2511.251,2530.861,"If they had done so, if they had established a rule which actually barred the District Judge from certifying any case in which you -- there was a counterclaim, we would not think that that would be a proper exercise of discretion."
1979.79-105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2571.174,2578.502,"Well, but if it's not a proper ruling -- reading of Rule 54 (b) but is what the Third Circuit did, then it ought to be reversed."
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2578.502,2581.871,"It is not what the Third Circuit did, Your Honor."
1979.79-105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2636.5,2646.147,"Mr. Groner, if you know, has there been any great rush of certifications under Rule 54?"
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2646.147,2649.809,"We do not know, Your Honor, but --"
1979.79-105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2649.809,2666.898,"I -- I must say that there's some observation of that in a general way up here and I have never heard that there has been any great use of the rule of exceptions, such as Judge Coolahan made here."
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2666.898,2671.529,"We -- we have -- we have not made such a study, Your Honor."
1979.79-105,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2691.089,2697.589,"Well, the fact is that the mine run plain-vanilla case doesn't lend -- lend itself to a 54 (b) disposition, does it?"
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2697.589,2698.654,"I -- I'm sorry, I --"
1979.79-105,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2698.654,2704.127,The ordinary case doesn't -- isn't amenable to the 54 (b).
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2704.127,2704.134,"Well, the --"
1979.79-105,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2704.134,2707.439,It doesn't involve separate issues.
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2707.439,2712.31,"Well, the ordinary -- the ordinary case may or may not involve separate issues, Your Honor."
1979.79-105,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2712.31,2712.615,Well --
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2712.615,2717.052,There are many -- there are many cases in which there are -- there are --
1979.79-105,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2717.052,2728.458,"Yes, but comparatively few compared to most civil cases in the Federal District Courts, there are not many cases comparatively, where 54 (b) would be applicable."
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2728.458,2732.13,There are a number of cases which apply Rule 54 (b).
1979.79-105,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2734.494,2736.858,"But, you earlier said everything is --"
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2736.858,2737.471,"Is relative, yes."
1979.79-105,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2737.471,2738.379,"Is relative, yes."
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2738.379,2744.783,"Compared to other issues, compared to Rule 56 issues, for example."
1979.79-105,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2744.783,2745.395,Right.
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2745.395,2747.653,"Certainly, they -- they are small in number."
1979.79-105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2747.653,2772.318,"Because the District Judge here obviously placed his emphasis on the extraordinary aspect of this case, that is the large amounts involved and on the fact that these issues could be treated separately and on the fact that if he was in error in his exercise of discretion, there could be a judgment, a collectible judgment the other way."
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2778.496,2779.436,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-105,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2787.896,2788.217,Interest.
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2788.217,2791.543,-- interest rate which it represented.
1979.79-105,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2905.995,2909.513,Do you know the date that that was done?
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2909.513,2913.8,"I believe 1970 or 1971, Your Honor."
1979.79-105,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2913.8,2919.803,"Well, the legislature always lags behind the current facts, doesn't it?"
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,2919.803,2941.927,"Well, I am not prepared to say that about the legislature of the State of New York, Your Honor, but, in any event, if they do, they would know that and it is precisely that the legislature would take into account, Mr. Justice Blackmun, what would happen in the future that this is a matter of legislative policy."
1979.79-105,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3067.239,3079.658,"It's -- your submission is that, Mr. Groner, that it's impermissible for a district judge to consider, in any way, the difference between the going economic rate of interest and the statutory rate?"
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,3079.658,3080.912,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-105,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3080.912,3083.196,Did the Court of Appeals say anything like that?
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,3083.196,3086.287,"No, Your Honor."
1979.79-105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3086.287,3092.964,"That cuts down the scope of Rule 54 quite a bit, doesn't it?"
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,3092.964,3096.656,"We do not think so, Your Honor, because, in our view --"
1979.79-105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3096.656,3096.795,Yes.
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,3103.654,3104.821,"Oh yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3110.881,3111.127,Right.
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,3111.127,3113.328,"So, we are not reducing the scope."
1979.79-105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3113.328,3118.977,"Well, who -- who tells us -- where do we find out that he never was able to consider that?"
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,3118.977,3123.432,"You find that, Your Honor, from two different sources."
1979.79-105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3226.763,3234.714,"Mr. Groner, in -- in one sense, I suppose the question is whether he abused his discretion in finding no just reason for delay."
1979.79-105,1,28565,isaac_n_groner,,3250.329,3256.92,"In our view, it quite clearly falls upon the one who is proposing that the judgment be final."
1979.79-105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3471.843,3475.549,"Mr. Del Deo, you have about four minutes left."
1979.79-105,2,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,3475.549,3477.155,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1979.79-105,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3531.936,3535.294,Do you equate that to a property?
1979.79-105,2,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,3535.294,3548.082,"Well, I -- I think also, the deprivation of property, in and of itself, it's -- the -- the difference in the interest rate makes -- shows you how much the loss is."
1979.79-105,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3570.765,3576.083,But is the $20 million enough to change the rules?
1979.79-105,2,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,3576.083,3579.604,I don't think you -- I -- I think this is what the rule was --
1979.79-105,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3579.604,3580.415,"I mean, that's the --"
1979.79-105,2,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,3580.415,3580.909,Yes.
1979.79-105,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3580.909,3582.119,(Inaudible)
1979.79-105,2,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,3582.119,3584.461,The -- this is quite within the rule.
1979.79-105,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3585.748,3589.234,"You say the same rule was just $10,001."
1979.79-105,2,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,3589.234,3590.4,"Your Honor, the purpose --"
1979.79-105,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3590.4,3591.542,Am I right?
1979.79-105,2,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,3591.542,3591.961,Pardon?
1979.79-105,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3591.961,3597.091,"You would say the same thing if the total amount involved was $10,001."
1979.79-105,2,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,3597.091,3601.182,I think you have to take in all the facts in the -- in the case.
1979.79-105,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3602.657,3606.034,"And your answer would be, you didn't know, yes or no."
1979.79-105,2,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,3606.034,3617.534,"Well, Your Honor, I was going to say, in this case if you permit me to answer your question was that Judge Coolahan also noted that this was going to be a lengthy proceeding."
1979.79-105,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3648.696,3649.453,But at the end of the case --
1979.79-105,2,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,3649.453,3651.479,-- counterclaims are dismissed.
1979.79-105,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3651.867,3653.813,"At the end of the case, you might not get anything."
1979.79-105,2,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,3653.813,3663.224,"Well, if at the -- well, Your Honor, we'll always get the -- we'll always get the $20 million, but we'll never recoup the difference in the interest at the end of the case."
1979.79-105,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3717.778,3718.928,Unless you put up a bond.
1979.79-105,2,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,3718.928,3719.387,Pardon?
1979.79-105,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3719.387,3719.988,Unless you put up a bond --
1979.79-105,2,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,3719.988,3720.579,"Which, if we were --"
1979.79-105,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3720.579,3720.68,-- to be (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-105,2,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,3720.68,3722.378,"-- insolvent we couldn't afford, Your Honor."
1979.79-105,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3722.378,3722.728,Could I ask you?
1979.79-105,2,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,3722.728,3723.096,Thank --
1979.79-105,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3723.096,3729.018,"If a counterclaim hadn't been pending, would the -- would you think the Court of Appeals would have said the certification is alright?"
1979.79-105,2,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,3729.018,3742.808,"In -- in similar cases, which this Court has had in Liberty Mutual and Tilden, the Court of Appeals in the Third Circuit has permitted such cases to come to be certified."
1979.79-105,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3743.984,3750.894,"And, even -- even though the reason may be that -- just -- that's just the reason that the District Judge relied on here."
1979.79-105,2,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,3750.894,3756.491,"Yes, they've never used harsh unusual circumstances in cases without counterclaims that -- that I know of."
1979.79-105,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3756.491,3761.641,So that the counterclaim really is the turning point in the case.
1979.79-105,2,39107,ralph_n_del_deo,,3763.864,3768.22,"It's the only reason that they've articulated and it's the one I see, Your Honors."
1979.79-105,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3768.249,3769.015,"Thank you, gentlemen."
