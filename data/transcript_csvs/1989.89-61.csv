1989.89-61,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.622,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-61, United States against Filiberto Ojeda Rios."
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,65.942,68.894,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-61,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,157.166,164.087,"Mr. Bryson, the offense occurred in 1983?"
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,164.087,165.356,"That's right, Your Honor."
1989.89-61,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,165.356,168.808,And has the defendant ever been brought to trial?
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,168.808,170.924,"Well, a number of the defendants have been brought to trial."
1989.89-61,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,192.089,197.725,"But, at least, Mr. Ojeda Rios has never been tried?"
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,197.725,198.177,That's right.
1989.89-61,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,201.695,207.683,And you... you take the position that the Speedy Trial Act does not preclude trial at this junction?
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,207.683,213.503,"--Oh, that's right, Your Honor, because we have... there has been ongoing litigation on this issue ever since."
1989.89-61,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,220.491,230.964,The statutory provision under which the exclusion was made says basically that the presence of the seal--
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,230.964,231.731,That's right.
1989.89-61,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,231.731,235.766,--provided for by this subsection.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,236.868,239.618,That's right.
1989.89-61,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,239.618,248.324,Doesn't that phrase have the effect of incorporating the timing requirement provided for in this subsection?
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,248.324,249.276,"We don't think so, Your Honor."
1989.89-61,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,250.792,253.728,It certainly could be said to do so.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,257.613,266.47,"As are we, and it could be said to... to do so, and the Second Circuit, the First Circuit and the D.C. Circuit have concluded that that is the proper reading of the statute."
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,302.976,303.626,Do we have a judicial seal?
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,307.211,307.711,"--No, Your Honor--"
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,308.213,309.946,"Just district judges have them maybe, huh?"
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,309.946,310.48,District judges are--
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.48,311.665,"I always wanted one, you know."
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,313.548,316.986,--It... this is I think... it may not be exclusive to this statute--
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,316.986,317.569,Yeah.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,317.569,323.306,--but it certainly is unusual to have courts involved in sealing evidence.
1989.89-61,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,397.104,403.092,"Well, in your view, there would be no remedy for an unexcused delay in sealing?"
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,403.092,410.012,"Well, certainly Section 2518(a)... (8)(a) would not provide an exclusionary principle."
1989.89-61,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,426.89,441.383,"Well, Congress may have intended some kind of prophylactic remedy here in the sense that if a... if a seal is provided immediately, you're just going to eliminate the risk of much tampering."
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,441.383,446.602,"There is no doubt that they intended the immediate sealing to do exactly that, Your Honor."
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,489.114,497.137,"Mr. Bryson, I assume that if you... if you don't do it right away, the district judge... you run the risk of the district judge saying, I'm sorry it's too late."
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,497.137,497.504,Of course.
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,497.504,498.22,Right?
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,498.22,499.054,That's right.
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,499.054,503.707,So it... it isn't a sure thing that there's no harm in... in not... in not doing it immediately.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,503.707,504.49,That's right and... and--
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,504.49,506.659,"You were lucky here, though, he... he did approve them."
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,506.659,513.229,--He did approve it because this was... these were both (a) relatively short delays.
1989.89-61,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,520.133,520.799,"Yeah, but what if it was?"
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,528.989,531.691,"--Well, if the judge is willing to seal it under those circumstances--"
1989.89-61,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,531.691,532.258,And that would make it admissible.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,532.258,534.06,--our position would be the statute would fall out.
1989.89-61,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,534.66,538.262,So it's entirely up to the judge to... to let anything in of this kind he wants to?
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,538.262,541.047,"Well, under 2518(8)(a) that's... that's... that's true."
1989.89-61,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,541.764,544.199,"Well, also under the other... it doesn't violate the other section."
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,544.199,544.615,--No.
1989.89-61,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,548.252,552.354,"Well, maybe the judge says, well, I don't think the government agents aren't going to use phoney evidence."
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,554.92,560.341,"--Well, if... if the judge did that, I suspect, depending on the strength of the... of the allegations--"
1989.89-61,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,560.341,561.041,"Well, it would comply with statute."
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,562.81,563.576,"--Well, that's right."
1989.89-61,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,577.569,579.754,This particular provision would be totally meaningless.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,579.754,581.321,"--Well, it would be inapplicable."
1989.89-61,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,584.489,588.693,It would not impose any burden at all if the judge was willing to seal it.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,588.693,589.127,That's right.
1989.89-61,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,589.127,589.527,Yeah.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,589.527,590.06,That's right.
1989.89-61,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,606.339,609.457,When the judge is willing to seal it he doesn't have to hold you in contempt.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,609.457,613.493,"--Well, that may be, although it's not clear that--"
1989.89-61,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,613.493,614.344,Let me ask you another question.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,627.902,629.52,--How... how can they challenge the authenticity of the tapes?
1989.89-61,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,629.52,629.787,Yeah.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,629.787,632.222,"Well, they... they made the statements on the tapes."
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,667.979,673.466,"And that same... that same process would... would transpire whether it was sealed or not, presumably."
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,673.466,673.966,--That's right.
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,673.966,675.033,"I mean, you could make the same argument."
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,675.033,675.666,That's right.
1989.89-61,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,707.535,716.391,"As a practical matter, once the tapes have been sealed and the government wants to have access to them to prepare for trial, what do they do, make copies?"
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,716.391,720.195,"Well, they generally will have made copies in advance and they will be working from the copies."
1989.89-61,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,721.495,723.647,So you make a copy in advance of submitting it to seal?
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,723.647,727.115,"--Oh, yes, that's... that's not infrequent and the courts have approved that... that procedure."
1989.89-61,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,750.797,753.849,"But even if the tape is sealed, the government has to authenticate it, doesn't it?"
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,753.849,754.282,"Oh, sure."
1989.89-61,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,756.368,762.305,"When you referred a moment ago to the... a clear and convincing standard of evidence, is that provided in the rules?"
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,762.305,762.655,No.
1989.89-61,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,771.378,773.346,What's... what's the basis for that rule?
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,773.346,775.88,"There isn't any basis in the rule, Your Honor."
1989.89-61,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,802.682,807.734,Does that just go to the explanation for the absence of the seal or with respect to authenticity?
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,807.734,808.9,With respect to authenticity.
1989.89-61,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,808.9,809.684,Only?
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,809.684,810.936,"Well, that's right."
1989.89-61,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,811.852,815.221,Doesn't... doesn't Rule 901 provide the way things shall be authenticated?
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,815.221,825.446,"Yes, it does, and... and I think the better argument... I think those courts of appeals that have held clear and convincing evidence as a requirement may well be wrong, and that's not the issue before the Court."
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,873.342,877.044,This seems to be our week for the dog that didn't bark legislative history.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,880.413,881.346,"Well, I can to a little--"
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,881.346,882.882,--that says that it should be excluded from that reason.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,882.882,883.632,--I can do a little better than that.
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,887.769,888.436,Did he lick the hand?
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,888.436,888.769,Yes.
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,888.769,889.252,"Okay, well--"
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,889.836,895.273,In this case... let me just run through what... what we have.
1989.89-61,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1000.959,1008.196,"But couldn't you also interpret that history as saying they're assuming the seal wouldn't be there unless it were put on immediately, as the statute requires?"
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1008.196,1008.798,"--Well, you... you could."
1989.89-61,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1009.798,1011.667,"And if you do interpret it that way, then it adds up to nothing."
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1011.667,1012.083,That's right.
1989.89-61,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1012.083,1012.433,Yeah.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1012.433,1013.233,If you interpret it that way.
1989.89-61,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1025.724,1032.579,"Well, is there anything in the legislative history that suggests that there is any purpose for the seal other than to be sure that it was affixed in a timely manner?"
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1035.698,1052.225,"Well, they certainly wanted it on there right away but there is a reason for the seal whenever it goes on, which is that even if it's two weeks late or three weeks late or six weeks late, it... it cuts off the problem of... of risks of... of lack of authenticity from whatever point forward that it's put on."
1989.89-61,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1052.994,1056.612,"So its... its only function is a temporal function, really."
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1056.946,1057.429,--Well--
1989.89-61,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1057.429,1063.6,--it's a different... a question of when it gets on is... is the only thing that has it serve any statutory purpose.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1063.6,1066.45,"--Well, its... its function is to establish authenticity."
1989.89-61,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1073.706,1077.258,"Well, it's to prevent any post-sealed questions of authenticity--"
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1077.258,1077.624,--That's right.
1989.89-61,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1077.624,1078.443,--from being raised.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1078.443,1078.993,That's right.
1989.89-61,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1083.728,1087.215,"If it's put on the day before trial, it's no good, is it?"
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1087.215,1088.981,"--Well, Your Honor, it may well be no good."
1989.89-61,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1088.981,1091.417,"I mean, would it... would it serve any purpose?"
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1091.417,1092.667,It would... certainly not.
1989.89-61,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1101.373,1104.575,This [inaudible] involves time [inaudible]?
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1104.575,1104.927,Certainly.
1989.89-61,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1109.712,1113.866,Did the Department of Justice take any position on this provision to the bill?
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1113.866,1121.02,"--This was... this was not the administration's bill and, Your Honor, I can't tell you whether there was any objection."
1989.89-61,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1123.322,1124.539,I don't think it amounts to--
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1124.539,1128.892,--because it was not a provision that was at all controversial and it went right through all the versions of the statute.
1989.89-61,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1221.866,1227.07,--How different... how different is that than the sort of showing you'd put on simply to authenticate it?
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1227.07,1228.42,--It's... it's not very different.
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1230.605,1233.557,That's a... that's a very... let me understand what you're saying.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1236.676,1237.042,Yes.
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1237.042,1243.246,--that the presence of a seal means the presence of a seal that was put on immediately... right?
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1243.246,1243.532,Right.
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1243.532,1255.054,--then all you have to do to establish a satisfactory explanation for the absence of a seal that was put on immediately is to show that this is nonetheless an authentic tape.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1255.054,1260.808,"Well, we have to have a credible explanation and that satisfies the explanation part."
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1274.534,1276.086,"But what is the explanation, though?"
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1276.569,1277.219,In this particular case?
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1277.219,1277.669,Yeah.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1277.669,1281.99,"Oh, well, our explanation was there was one legal error made, arguably."
1989.89-61,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1286.058,1291.779,"I know, but you seem to say that all you have to do is to prove that the tapes are... haven't been tampered with."
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1291.779,1293.798,"--Well, we have to... we have to show an explanation."
1989.89-61,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1300.535,1301.485,And that's why you delayed.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1301.485,1303.403,And that's why we delayed.
1989.89-61,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1306.855,1307.371,Yes.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1307.371,1310.473,"Now, it's satisfactory in one sense that it explains--"
1989.89-61,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1310.473,1310.823,I got you.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1311.223,1314.325,"--accurately, truthfully and with no doubt what happened."
1989.89-61,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1315.411,1318.413,"Well, what does the term ""explanation"" apply to?"
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1318.413,1323.567,"Well, it does applies to our coming forward and telling the judge why there was a detail... a delay in the sealing."
1989.89-61,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1323.567,1325.567,In other... it's an explanation of the delay?
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1325.567,1325.917,That's right.
1989.89-61,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1325.917,1327.269,Is that what your position is?
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1327.269,1328.702,That's right.
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1328.702,1335.975,"Gee, don't... don't you think satisfactory explanation must mean an explanation as to why the delay is excusable?"
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1335.975,1337.375,"Well, I... we think--"
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1337.375,1338.827,I... I... nobody would read it that way.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1338.827,1343.295,--It can be... in a sense it is because we say that it's excusable if--
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1343.295,1343.645,So long as you--
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1343.645,1345.814,--in fact it had no consequence in resulting in the alteration of the tapes--
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1345.814,1346.414,"--No, no."
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1346.414,1348.849,--as opposed to being a good reason or a good cause.
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1348.849,1361.156,"Do you think it's a satisfactory explanation if the department comes in and says, well, you know, we just... just didn't want to take it to this judge and we... and, yeah, we know we should have taken it in, but we just didn't want to do it?"
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1361.156,1361.523,Well--
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1361.523,1366.477,We had an attorney general who didn't believe in this provision of the law and we decided not to take it in.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1368.512,1369.212,"--Well, and--"
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1369.212,1372.298,"And that is a satisfactory explanation, as I understand you're... you're saying."
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1372.298,1372.964,--That's correct.
1989.89-61,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1396.644,1397.096,Nobody is perfect.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1397.48,1398.38,--it was a mistake to have... nope.
1989.89-61,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1427.449,1432.084,"--Well, on that... on that basis you don't even... never... don't have to have it sealed at all."
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1437.702,1439.654,--There is a very good reason for a seal.
1989.89-61,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1439.654,1446.844,"Well, I know, but you... but you would still have this satisfactory explanation if there wasn't a seal."
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1447.81,1448.227,We would.
1989.89-61,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1449.16,1453.997,"--Here's why we do... we just don't believe in seals, we never did, and we don't think there ought to be a seal on this tape."
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1453.997,1454.963,That is correct.
1989.89-61,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1454.963,1457.365,"That's... now, is it satisfactory?"
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1461.167,1461.467,That's right.
1989.89-61,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1471.403,1474.589,"But as I understand it, you would have to go through the lengthy hearing in all cases to authenticate."
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1474.589,1483.361,"--No, because I think what happens, Your Honor, is that if you have a chain of custody established in part with the aid of the seal, the judicial seal--"
1989.89-61,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1483.361,1485.897,"Well, we're presuming there's no seal."
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1485.897,1494.768,"--Well, in that case, you'd have to go through a long hearing in all likelihood, if there is any colorable showing made that anything may have happened to the tapes in the meantime."
1989.89-61,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1496.684,1498.136,Do you have a fall-back position?
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1498.136,1498.703,"Yes, we do."
1989.89-61,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1505.54,1520.549,"Mr. Bryson, before you... before you fall back, if we file an opinion agreeing with you, aren't we, in effect, amending that statute?"
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1520.549,1521.116,"No, Your Honor."
1989.89-61,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1522.068,1529.339,"Well, have... have we yet an explanation of why it wasn't done?"
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1529.339,1532.357,"--Yes, and I'm going to give you that... you haven't yet, but you're going get it right now."
1989.89-61,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1569.316,1572.434,"Well, will you pardon me if I say I don't understand it?"
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1572.434,1575.053,"--Well, it may well be wrong--"
1989.89-61,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1575.053,1575.753,"I mean, the statute says--"
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1575.753,1577.422,--but that was his... that was his conclusion.
1989.89-61,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1577.422,1578.622,--He read the statute.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1582.174,1582.64,"Well, that's right."
1989.89-61,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1584.776,1585.226,So how does he explain that?
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1585.226,1590.43,--Because he didn't think it was necessary to put it on at that time because he felt that the extension--
1989.89-61,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1590.43,1592.713,"Well, it said so."
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1594.582,1595.582,"--Well, that's... that's the question, Your Honor."
1989.89-61,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1619.263,1626.5,"Do you... do you interpret the term ""extension"" to modify the period... period of the order?"
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1628.017,1628.435,Order--
1989.89-61,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1628.435,1631.737,--separation of the period of the order or extensions thereof.
1989.89-61,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1631.737,1633.321,--I think it means order or extensions.
1989.89-61,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1685.921,1687.573,"Very well, Mr. Bryson."
1989.89-61,1,40322,richard_a_reeve,,1697.429,1699.965,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1989.89-61,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1755.968,1759.754,"Well, the critical language doesn't say immediate seal, Mr. Reeve."
1989.89-61,1,40322,richard_a_reeve,,1759.754,1763.907,"Your Honor, it is not explicit in that way, but I--"
1989.89-61,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1763.907,1767.359,"Well, it doesn't... it doesn't contain the word ""immediate"", does it?"
1989.89-61,1,40322,richard_a_reeve,,1767.359,1770.561,--It does not in that sentence of the provision.
1989.89-61,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1770.561,1772.227,"Yeah, that's... well, that's what I am asking."
1989.89-61,1,40322,richard_a_reeve,,1772.227,1773.863,"Yes, Your Honor, and I'd like to address that."
1989.89-61,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1813.488,1815.09,"Of course, because that is what they were talking about."
1989.89-61,1,40322,richard_a_reeve,,1815.09,1815.64,Exactly right.
1989.89-61,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1815.64,1817.708,They didn't want to say any seal in the world would suffice.
1989.89-61,1,40322,richard_a_reeve,,1817.708,1818.775,"That... well, that's--"
1989.89-61,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1818.775,1822.077,"How else would they have said it if they just meant, you know, the kind of a seal we were talking about?"
1989.89-61,1,40322,richard_a_reeve,,1825.981,1833.635,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that... that... that it's clear when you look back, when you asked the question... what is the seal provided for by this subsection?"
1989.89-61,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1840.106,1853.298,"But even so, the statute does go on, when it talks about the use of the evidence, to say that there must be a satisfactory explanation for the absence of a seal."
1989.89-61,1,40322,richard_a_reeve,,1853.298,1855.417,"--Well, Your Honor, it does although it doesn't--"
1989.89-61,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1855.417,1864.071,And you would read it as though it said a satisfactory explanation for noncompliance with the immediate sealing requirement.
1989.89-61,1,40322,richard_a_reeve,,1864.071,1868.558,"--Well, Your Honor, I respectively differ with the Court in... in terms of what the language is."
1989.89-61,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1952.997,1957.449,"Well, wait... your... your... come to think of it, that is the logical consequence of your argument."
1989.89-61,1,40322,richard_a_reeve,,1966.455,1967.055,"--No, Your Honor."
1989.89-61,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1967.055,1967.923,Why not?
1989.89-61,1,40322,richard_a_reeve,,1967.923,1973.827,"Because that... that section, immediately upon the expiration of the period of the order--"
1989.89-61,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1973.827,1974.244,Yeah?
1989.89-61,1,40322,richard_a_reeve,,1974.244,1977.362,--defines when the government is to do it.
1989.89-61,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1977.362,1977.712,Right.
1989.89-61,1,40322,richard_a_reeve,,1977.712,1978.579,"Now, if the government--"
1989.89-61,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1978.579,1988.135,"I'm a district judge and I say, gee, I cannot give you a seal as provided for in this subsection because a seal as provided for in this... in this subsection... does it say subsection?"
1989.89-61,1,40322,richard_a_reeve,,1988.954,1989.67,"--Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1989.89-61,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1989.67,1998.86,I cannot provide you a seal as provided for by this subsection because such a seal is a seal that is issued immediately upon expiration of the... of the order.
1989.89-61,1,40322,richard_a_reeve,,2007.548,2022.825,"Your Honor, it would be my interpretation of the statute, based on the language in that sentence as well as in the language of the second section, that is, Subsection B which says all orders and applications shall be sealed by the court, that the court does have a mandatory duty, and that the government could make that argument."
1989.89-61,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2044.507,2054.112,What is the harm to your client if the proof is by clear and convincing evidence that the tapes are authentic and accurate?
1989.89-61,1,40322,richard_a_reeve,,2054.112,2057.831,"Your Honor, I would respond in two ways."
1989.89-61,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2160.799,2170.321,"I think you're right about that but I also think the parent, if he or she did not get a satisfactory explanation, would not throw the kid out of the house for the rest of the night."
1989.89-61,1,40322,richard_a_reeve,,2170.887,2177.325,"Your Honor, I... I suppose there's all different kinds of parents in the world, and--"
1989.89-61,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2272.203,2282.559,"Well, how... how did all these other... other circuit courts of appeals get off the trolley."
1989.89-61,1,40322,richard_a_reeve,,2285.594,2290.515,"Your Honor, with respect, I think it's important to break down the issue, and... and I want to address it."
1989.89-61,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2316.163,2321.284,And there... there are four other courts that would... would have come out differently in this case.
1989.89-61,1,40322,richard_a_reeve,,2321.284,2322.386,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.89-61,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2343.929,2344.496,"Excuse me, I didn't understand."
1989.89-61,1,40322,richard_a_reeve,,2344.496,2344.881,"--Yes, sir."
1989.89-61,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2344.881,2348.5,What... in what respect have they not agreed... has not a single one of them agreed--
1989.89-61,1,40322,richard_a_reeve,,2348.5,2348.883,"Yes, sir."
1989.89-61,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2348.883,2349.317,--with the government?
1989.89-61,1,40322,richard_a_reeve,,2350.283,2361.224,"The government's initial argument, that is, that the exclusionary provision of Section 2518(8)(a) only applies to cases where the seal is absent."
1989.89-61,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,3310.863,3312.631,"Yes, I do, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.89-61,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3371.919,3379.757,"Well, wouldn't you apply some sort of a... objective test to whether he was justified in believing that?"
1989.89-61,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,3379.757,3380.109,"Well, I think--"
1989.89-61,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3380.109,3383.477,The courts below thought that there was just no basis for that.
1989.89-61,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,3383.477,3384.761,"--Well, they... they thought he was wrong."
1989.89-61,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3442.998,3443.914,"Thank you, Mr. Bryson."
