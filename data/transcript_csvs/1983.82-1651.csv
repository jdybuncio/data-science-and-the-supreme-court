1983.82-1651,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.577,We'll hear arguments next in Nix against Williams.
1983.82-1651,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,48.703,51.525,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.82-1651,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,151.159,158.335,"Is it true, as the Respondent states, that the scope of the search was to stop at the county line?"
1983.82-1651,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,158.335,160.976,The testimony in the record is flatly to the contrary.
1983.82-1651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,184.471,188.074,"The Court of Appeals didn't disagree with that, did it?"
1983.82-1651,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,188.074,189.383,--The Court of Appeals did not--
1983.82-1651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,189.383,191.046,He found on another theory.
1983.82-1651,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,191.046,196.409,--The Court of Appeals introduced an absence of bad faith theory into the case and reversed on that ground.
1983.82-1651,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1203.3,1206.252,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.82-1651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1507.999,1509.389,What do you think we ought to do if we agree with you?
1983.82-1651,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1519.686,1521.827,"--You could do either, Your Honor."
1983.82-1651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1528.532,1529.802,"Well, they didn't review the facts."
1983.82-1651,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1529.802,1535.015,"They didn't, but three courts have independently, as was pointed out in the case before."
1983.82-1651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1535.015,1537.599,"Well, if it's so obvious maybe we ought to remand."
1983.82-1651,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1537.599,1542.111,This case has been around for 15 years.
1983.82-1651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1548.095,1549.237,Another five years.
1983.82-1651,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1549.237,1549.825,15.
1983.82-1651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1549.825,1552.908,But another five wouldn't make any difference?
1983.82-1651,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1552.908,1562.874,It's not unacceptable to the Government or to Iowa for there to be a remand.
1983.82-1651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1596.468,1610.926,Is this a... do you think this good faith point that the Court of Appeals seized on is a question of fact?
1983.82-1651,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1610.926,1625.256,"--If good faith is an element at all, we would have it be an objective inquiry, which would basically be a question of law: whether the officer knew or should have known that he was not complying--"
1983.82-1651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1625.256,1626.147,It's not like intent?
1983.82-1651,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1627.717,1628.899,--Nothing subjective at all.
1983.82-1651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1632.66,1636.212,So you don't think the Court of Appeals used the wrong standard in disagreeing with the Iowa Supreme Court?
1983.82-1651,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1636.212,1638.903,The Court of Appeals we think used completely the wrong standard.
1983.82-1651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1648.59,1653.803,"Well, good faith is an element of inevitable discovery in Iowa?"
1983.82-1651,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1653.803,1655.904,"Well, the Iowa--"
1983.82-1651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1655.904,1656.535,Is that right?
1983.82-1651,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1656.535,1657.477,--The Iowa Supreme Court--
1983.82-1651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1657.477,1657.827,Is that right?
1983.82-1651,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1657.827,1658.448,--said it is.
1983.82-1651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1658.448,1659.007,Yes.
1983.82-1651,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1659.007,1660.278,But that's equally wrong.
1983.82-1651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1662.071,1664.101,"Well, it isn't wrong under Iowa law."
1983.82-1651,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1664.101,1667.813,"--No, Iowa can clearly make it an element of its test."
1983.82-1651,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1667.813,1671.436,The Eighth Circuit doesn't review Iowa law and we don't review Iowa law.
1983.82-1651,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1671.436,1672.036,That's correct.
1983.82-1651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1672.036,1684.534,"I think that's what the... you think that the... well, what standard, what erroneous standard did the Court of Appeals use?"
1983.82-1651,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1684.534,1695.871,"The Court of Appeals said in explicit words that the test for good faith is subjective, and they used as an example, I think, something that points out how erroneous their test is."
1983.82-1651,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1703.445,1704.146,So they're doubly wrong.
1983.82-1651,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1710.241,1713.553,--It shouldn't be an element and it certainly shouldn't be a subjective test.
1983.82-1651,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1713.553,1722.859,"The State argued, at least here, the Stone, the extension of Stone versus Powell."
1983.82-1651,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1727.411,1734.377,"We didn't address that because the federal interest in that question seemed less clear, but we fully support the State's argument on that issue."
1983.82-1651,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1794.277,1803.58,Mr. Bartels.
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,1803.58,1809.724,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1651,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1834.362,1839.695,"What is your position, that it was a Sixth Amendment violation?"
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,1839.695,1840.787,"That's right, Your Honor."
1983.82-1651,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1843.307,1855.616,"Well, may I ask, is it on that ground, that it was a Sixth Amendment violation, therefore this is not a remedy problem, that the very introduction of the evidence was itself a violation of the Sixth Amendment?"
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,1855.616,1856.645,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1651,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1856.645,1869.474,"Well, Mr. Bartels, the Massiah type of Sixth Amendment violation produces a different result, doesn't it, than almost any other type of Sixth Amendment violation?"
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,1894.501,1906.948,"Well, Your Honor, in all of these cases I don't think it's clear that the state would not have had the evidence otherwise, and the Court has never looked at the problem in that way before, at least."
1983.82-1651,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1954.92,1979.787,"Well, what if, Mr. Bartels, the same confession or testimony, if you want to have it that way, had been elicited from Mr. Williams that had been elicited, but maybe half an hour after the testimony was elicited but before they returned to Des Moines, Williams and the officer, the body was found by the searching party?"
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,1982.909,1992.386,"It would be quite different, Your Honor, because in that situation the violation of the Sixth Amendment rights would not be the cause--"
1983.82-1651,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1992.386,1995.579,"And yet, it's exactly the same violation."
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,1995.579,1999.589,"--No, Your Honor, in fact it's not."
1983.82-1651,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2036.664,2041.806,Can you find that compulsion to exclude at trial in the language of the Sixth Amendment itself?
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2041.806,2047.901,"Your Honor, there's nothing about... the word ""exclusion"" is not in there."
1983.82-1651,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2047.901,2050.252,Where do you find it?
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2050.252,2051.183,Your Honor--
1983.82-1651,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2051.183,2063.412,"Because I gather your argument is if there's been a Sixth Amendment violation which resulted in obtaining of the evidence, that the Sixth Amendment itself compels the exclusion of the evidence."
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2064.461,2065.493,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1651,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2065.493,2066.725,"Well now, where do you find that in the--"
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2066.725,2076.97,"Well, Your Honor, the language of the Sixth Amendment is that the accused shall enjoy the right to the assistance of counsel to his defense."
1983.82-1651,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2102.198,2103.808,--Do you agree--
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2103.808,2107.771,--is that the violation occurs when the evidence--
1983.82-1651,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2107.771,2108.66,--Is admitted.
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2108.66,2109.16,--comes in.
1983.82-1651,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2109.16,2117.956,Do you agree with Ms. Oberly's argument that Morrison has at least some language contrary to that position?
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2117.956,2127.322,"Well, Your Honor, I have not had a chance to look at Morrison, which wasn't cited in any of the briefs, and so I can only speak from my recollection."
1983.82-1651,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2249.683,2257.54,May I ask what decisions of ours you rely on primarily for your Sixth Amendment argument?
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2257.54,2267.576,"Massiah, Brewer, Estelle versus Smith, United States versus Henry, and Weatherford versus Bursey."
1983.82-1651,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2267.576,2278.762,"Mr. Bartels, as you have mentioned Estelle against Smith, you have filed two supplemental briefs in this case."
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2278.762,2280.625,"I apologize for that, Your Honor."
1983.82-1651,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2280.625,2286.798,"And frankly, I've never seen that many since I've been here."
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2286.798,2288.228,I'm sorry to set that particular record.
1983.82-1651,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2288.228,2296.854,"The first one says that the purpose of it is to discuss Estelle against Smith, which should have been included in the brief of the Respondent."
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2299.758,2304.24,"Your Honor, I don't think that really fits under Rule 35.5."
1983.82-1651,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2324.022,2326.195,So this is one way of getting around the page limitation.
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2328.236,2329.307,"--No, Your Honor, I'm sorry."
1983.82-1651,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2480.724,2484.767,"Under what heading do you argue this, Mr. Bartels?"
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2487.83,2490.752,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-1651,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2490.752,2512.575,"Do you think that if we disagreed with the factual conclusion of the courts other than the Eighth Circuit that discovery would have been inevitable here, the judgment... but held for you on the rest... rather, held against you, do you think the same judgment of the Eighth Circuit... we wouldn't affirm the judgment of the Eighth Circuit."
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2512.575,2514.278,"Your Honor, I think you'd have two choices."
1983.82-1651,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2571.613,2599.383,"But do you think it's actually likely... and of course, you're as able to predict the reactions of me and my colleagues as I am, I suppose... that the Court would uphold the judgment of the Eighth Circuit on the grounds that... on an issue on which the Eighth Circuit didn't pass, the inevitability of the discovery, on which other lower courts have found discovery would have been inevitable, we would make our own findings of fact and say, no, discovery would not be inevitable?"
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2599.383,2611.03,"Well, Your Honor, let me comment about at least the state court findings of fact, which normally would be afforded a presumption of correctness under Section 2254(d)."
1983.82-1651,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2684.477,2690.902,"Well, do you think the habeas court was entitled to have a hearing and redetermine that question of fact?"
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2690.902,2693.383,"Yes, Your Honor, because--"
1983.82-1651,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2693.383,2696.415,Under what provision?
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2696.415,2700.599,"--Your Honor, under Section 2254(d)(3) and (6)."
1983.82-1651,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2700.599,2701.699,(3) and (6).
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2701.699,2705.372,There was not an adequate development of the factual matter.
1983.82-1651,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2705.372,2709.646,"As soon as you discover a piece of evidence, relevant piece of evidence, you have a new hearing?"
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2709.646,2736.303,"Your Honor, if that relevant piece of evidence discloses not just something new, but that the state court relied on an inaccurate and misleading version of the facts presented by the state, that would seem classically a case where the Petitioner did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate that factual issue in the state court."
1983.82-1651,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2748.19,2749.931,"Well, in any event what did the habeas court conclude?"
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2749.931,2764.71,"--Your Honor, the habeas court concluded, without much explanation, that the new evidence added little and detracted little from what was before the state courts."
1983.82-1651,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2764.71,2768.433,"So it was a fair conclusion in the state court, anyway?"
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2768.433,2772.154,"No, Your Honor, because I think that the district court's treatment of that--"
1983.82-1651,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2772.154,2774.547,"Well, it was a right conclusion."
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2774.547,2778.749,"--Only if the district court's conclusion was correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1651,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2780.381,2781.56,Yes.
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2781.56,2784.172,--either this Court or the Eighth Circuit to review.
1983.82-1651,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2784.172,2784.903,Right.
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2784.903,2789.388,"Now, if I may return to the scope of the search."
1983.82-1651,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2958.967,2971.976,"Well, but in Stone versus Powell the Court also said that it was concerned that very probative, trustworthy evidence was being excluded as a result of the invocation of the exclusionary rule."
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2974.618,2975.817,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-1651,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3003.456,3012.391,Why isn't social cost always relevant when we're talking about what remedy we assign for a constitutional violation?
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3012.391,3025.511,"--Your Honor, in this case it's because, at least as this Court has interpreted the Sixth Amendment right to counsel in past cases, the framers of the Constitution already made... did that balancing."
1983.82-1651,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3025.511,3027.662,How were we able to figure that out?
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3027.662,3050.897,"Well, Your Honor, I think if one looks at what the function of the right to counsel would be in an interrogation context, it would be to prevent the police from accomplishing what they are after, which is to elicit information and then use it at trial, without interposing--"
1983.82-1651,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3050.897,3063.666,"Doesn't this get back, Mr. Bartels, to what I think you said to me earlier, that really your major argument here today is that the very admission of this evidence violated the Sixth Amendment?"
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3063.666,3065.176,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1651,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3065.176,3068.809,And that the only way you can correct that is simply not allow it to be admitted?
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3068.809,3070.031,That's correct.
1983.82-1651,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3070.031,3072.112,It doesn't get into any balancing or anything else; isn't that your--
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3072.112,3084.902,"That's right, Your Honor, and because there is no balancing in this particular area of the Sixth Amendment, not only do we not have a hypothetical probable discovery doctrine, but Stone versus Powell doesn't apply."
1983.82-1651,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3084.902,3090.344,"--Even if it was bound to be discovered, the inevitable discovery concept?"
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3090.344,3094.304,"Well, Your Honor, I'm not sure what we would mean by ""bound to be discovered""."
1983.82-1651,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3094.304,3096.247,"Well, inevitably, inevitable discovery."
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3097.647,3100.999,"If we're talking about a hypothetical situation, we can never know for sure."
1983.82-1651,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3101.901,3104.823,"Well, let me really put it up to you to see if you really mean it."
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3113.028,3116.621,"--Your Honor, in that case they have actually found the body--"
1983.82-1651,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3116.621,3117.362,Yes.
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3117.362,3118.58,--by legal means.
1983.82-1651,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3118.58,3119.211,Yes.
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3122.153,3124.687,"Not yet, Your Honor, because they haven't--"
1983.82-1651,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3124.687,3128.478,"Well, your right to counsel is don't interrogate him without counsel."
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3128.478,3129.229,--Your Honor--
1983.82-1651,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3129.229,3131.36,Excluding the evidence is only a remedy.
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3131.36,3137.424,"--Your Honor, if that were the case this Court would have decided Weatherford versus Bursey differently."
1983.82-1651,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3145.469,3160.918,"Well, I thought you've been saying to me, Mr. Bartels, this isn't a remedy case, that exclusion of the evidence is not as a remedy for the Sixth Amendment violation; it is itself... the admission of the evidence is itself--"
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3160.918,3163.069,"That's exactly what I'm trying to say, Your Honor."
1983.82-1651,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3163.069,3164.041,--I thought you were.
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3197.394,3205.379,"Well, Your Honor, in the Fourth Amendment I don't think we do have a situation where the admission of the evidence is the violation itself."
1983.82-1651,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3283.08,3289.204,"Mr. Bartels, I'm afraid I don't really understand your Sixth Amendment argument."
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3309.797,3317.501,"Your Honor, the problem with characterizing this as an independent source case is that there is no independent source, and that's why--"
1983.82-1651,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3317.501,3319.863,Isn't that a factual issue?
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3319.863,3324.958,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't think that there's any real dispute about that in this case."
1983.82-1651,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3364.052,3377.602,"If you change my terminology to ""inevitable discovery"", doesn't that in itself result in an issue of fact only, so far as--"
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3377.602,3390.318,"Your Honor, I don't have any questions but what if there is going to be a hypothetical probable discovery or inevitable discovery doctrine, that we're dealing with a question that is not... certainly not one of law."
1983.82-1651,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3400.937,3417.957,"--Well, Mr. Bartels, courts traditionally are called upon to make factual determinations, for instance in setting damages in civil cases, that require you to make hypothetical projections."
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3423.03,3437.842,"--Your Honor, it is, these sorts of questions are unknown, when we're talking about the concept of causation in terms of the causal connection between the violation and the evidence in question."
1983.82-1651,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3461.665,3464.019,"That's the same as an attenuation inquiry, isn't it?"
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3467.13,3467.71,"Inevitable discovery, Your Honor?"
1983.82-1651,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3467.71,3468.16,No.
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3471.562,3472.493,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1651,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3472.493,3475.984,"--but for, it was caused, but still it's not enough cause."
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3475.984,3476.885,"That's right, Your Honor."
1983.82-1651,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3489.685,3511.387,"Well, Mr. Bartels, suppose that Williams was asked, where's the body, and he tells them, the officer, and they drive over to this place and they see some searchers walking up the bar pit 500 yards away from the culvert."
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3529.4,3534.214,"--Your Honor, I don't think we have a lead pipe cinch even in that situation."
1983.82-1651,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3536.615,3541.067,"Well, I'll just go on until we get to facts so that it is a lead pipe cinch."
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3543.889,3548.093,"That's right, Your Honor, because of the nature of the Sixth Amendment right involved."
1983.82-1651,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3548.093,3560.15,"Mr. Bartels, either you or someone, perhaps several, have referred to the social costs that are involved in these areas with respect to one side."
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3566.074,3567.254,Fourteen.
1983.82-1651,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3567.254,3568.555,Fourteen years.
1983.82-1651,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3586.938,3591.33,"Your Honor, that's a point that was raised by one of the amicus briefs."
1983.82-1651,3,17394,brent_r_appel,,3822.622,3823.833,Mr. Chief Justice:
1983.82-1651,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3907.078,3908.72,"Thank you, gentlemen."
