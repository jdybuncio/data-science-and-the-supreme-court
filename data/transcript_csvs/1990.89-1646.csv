1990.89-1646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.009,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-1646, United States v. Marcus Smith."
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,53.976,58.611,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1646,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,133.278,142.494,"Well, now, Mr. Shapiro, the Government did not bring here the question about the Gonzalez Act, and--"
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,142.494,143.525,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1646,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,143.525,147.318,--That strikes me as a little unusual.
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,154.041,157.854,"Well, the meaning of the Gonzalez Act is very much part of the case, Your Honor."
1990.89-1646,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,184.08,190.275,"So you think we do have to get into it, and understand at least what the Gonzalez Act means?"
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,190.275,190.886,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1646,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,190.886,193.067,Are you going to tell us what you think it means?
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,193.067,193.738,"Well, I'm going to try--"
1990.89-1646,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,193.738,194.729,Because it's a mystery to me.
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,194.729,195.968,--I'm going to try.
1990.89-1646,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,265.874,271.068,Does the Gonzalez Act grant any affirmative right to sue the physician?
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,271.068,272.518,"--No, it does not, Your Honor."
1990.89-1646,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,350.671,356.174,But that doesn't apply if the tort occurs outside the United States?
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,356.174,365.451,"Your Honor, the Gonzalez Act itself is less than completely clear on whether the preclusion of that act applies in the circumstances of this case."
1990.89-1646,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,375.736,382.972,So we can assume that the Gonzalez Act just doesn't apply if the tort occurs outside the United States?
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,382.972,395.75,"--The Gonzalez Act does not preclude... that is, we do not challenge the holding of the court below that the Gonzalez Act does not preclude the action against the doctor in this case, the Gonzalez Act itself."
1990.89-1646,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,396.579,398.76,But it doesn't give a cause of action?
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,398.76,399.331,--That is correct.
1990.89-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,449.574,456.981,"But it is true, is it not, Mr. Shapiro, that it would have permitted a cause of action against the doctor on these very facts?"
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,456.981,458.841,--It would not have precluded it.
1990.89-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,458.841,459.802,It would not have precluded it.
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,475.651,479.374,The Gonzalez Act itself did not require indemnification.
1990.89-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,481.447,483.577,But there had been a... the Secretary had taken the appropriate action--
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,483.577,484.406,"--Yes, yes--"
1990.89-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,484.406,487.368,--so that that is what would have happened in this case if there had been no Reform Act.
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,487.368,488.189,"--That is true, Your Honor."
1990.89-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,488.189,492.223,"So that if the Reform Act is read the way you read it, this doctor now loses."
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,495.656,502.449,We're saying that there is no repeal of any aspect of the Gonzalez Act.
1990.89-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,513.735,516.219,You don't regard that as an implied repeal?
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,516.219,516.957,"--No, Your Honor, we don't."
1990.89-1646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,518.339,521.321,Does this mean this act isn't applicable?
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,521.712,531.52,--The Gonzalez Act provides that a doctor may be indemnified in situations where under some other law the doctor is held liable.
1990.89-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,543.685,549.95,"No, but it limits its application to providing protection in the case there might be recovery under foreign law in a foreign jurisdiction."
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,549.95,551.042,It limits its application.
1990.89-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,551.042,551.743,That's all that's left of it.
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,551.743,556.183,"Well, there may be other situations in which indemnification--"
1990.89-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,556.183,561.156,"But not the principal ones of suits against... there were three in the original act, but now we're down to part of one."
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,561.156,582.301,"--Well, it may include another, because there may be situations in which a doctor is lent to a State or a private institution, and is sued in situations where the case cannot be regarded as one within the scope of his Federal employment, and therefore one where the Tort Claims Act remedy is relevant."
1990.89-1646,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,661.693,668.908,"Well, the problem with that is that the Federal Tort Claims Act doesn't apply to torts overseas."
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,671.801,674.782,"--Your Honor, we don't believe--"
1990.89-1646,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,674.782,676.902,--that the Reform Act affects this?
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,681.657,693.843,"--Well, the Ninth... the Ninth Circuit did certainly address that question squarely, but we think it didn't read the act as a whole, or... nor did it focus on the legislative findings."
1990.89-1646,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,741.264,752.764,"Well, but it says an action or proceeding subject in paragraph 1, and if you read paragraph 1 as not applying overseas, then how does that help you?"
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,752.764,770.793,"Well, Your Honor, we think... we think it's clear that paragraph (b)(1) itself... we concede that it is capable of two readings, but that standing alone the far more plausible one is the one we urge."
1990.89-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,986.107,990.099,"Mr. Shapiro, those were all in effect at the time the Gonzalez Act was applied, weren't they?"
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,990.69,993.191,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1009.261,1010.482,"No, it's pretended to protect the doctors--"
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1010.482,1010.833,--Yes.
1990.89-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1010.833,1011.354,--is what it was doing.
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1021.048,1025.944,"This returns, and I think it's more than a matter of semantics, Justice Stevens."
1990.89-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1036.779,1040.321,"Well, it's critical for your reading of the savings clause about no violation of the statute."
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1042.132,1042.623,"--Yes, yes."
1990.89-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1042.623,1058.635,"And literally you perhaps have the better of it, but one can assume that perhaps there is some legislative history suggesting Congress did not intend to take away, except for those created by the Westfall case, what had thought to be other Tort Claim Act... other statutory remedies."
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1058.635,1060.184,There is an indication--
1990.89-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1060.184,1062.806,"And let me ask you one other thing, because you might want to address them both together."
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1072.062,1098.861,"--The only references, I believe, in the legislative history to medical malpractice are references to the Gonzalez Act as an example of situations in which actions are precluded, and a reference to the Powers case, which is very much like this case, in which the Fifth Circuit held that an action of this type was precluded by the Gonzalez Act itself."
1990.89-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1177.48,1178.541,"Well, it is clear."
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1190.66,1191.902,"--Your Honor, the provision--"
1990.89-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1191.902,1193.161,"That's clear, isn't it?"
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1193.161,1194.663,--I don't believe so.
1990.89-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1194.663,1195.184,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1195.184,1211.093,"There's a provision of the old Drivers Act, which was very similar to the remand provision of this act, which was interpreted by the courts to apply only when it was determined that the employee was not acting within the scope of his employment."
1990.89-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1213.203,1215.837,"Yes, but this remand provision refers to the absence of a remedy."
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1218.018,1221.912,--So did the old provision of the Drivers Act.
1990.89-1646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1221.912,1222.269,"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't--"
1990.89-1646,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1222.269,1228.865,"That is, the question what the... phrase absence of a remedy means was much debated in the lower courts."
1990.89-1646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1476.806,1478.719,"--Very well, Mr. Shapiro."
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,1482.04,1489.475,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1646,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1534.914,1538.676,Are you defending the rationale of the court of appeals?
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,1538.676,1540.199,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1646,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1540.199,1545.462,"Well, they didn't need to get to the Gonzalez Act at all."
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,1554.398,1557.51,"Which is true, Your Honor."
1990.89-1646,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1557.51,1559.811,"Well, that isn't... the Government says it isn't."
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,1559.811,1567.174,But the first issue that the Ninth Circuit addressed in its opinion was the Gonzalez Act.
1990.89-1646,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1585.387,1585.727,Um-hum.
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,1585.727,1586.799,And--
1990.89-1646,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1586.799,1590.932,"Do you defend their, the Ninth Circuit's reasoning about the Reform Act?"
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,1590.932,1595.727,"--Well, I am not sure, Your Honor, how clear--"
1990.89-1646,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1595.727,1596.095,You're not sure what it was?
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,1596.095,1600.89,"--Well, I think the court went part way."
1990.89-1646,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1637.633,1643.029,"To win here, you don't have to defend every sentence in the Ninth Circuit's opinion."
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,1654.775,1658.276,"--In the limited circumstances of this case, I would, Your Honor."
1990.89-1646,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1689.859,1699.182,"But even if... even if you thought the court of appeals was wrong in that specific statement, you... you wouldn't lose."
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,1699.182,1700.304,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1646,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1700.304,1701.395,That's what you're arguing?
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,1701.395,1701.986,That's correct.
1990.89-1646,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1701.986,1702.295,That's right.
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,1702.295,1713.802,"And their holding, as they said in their last sentence of their opinion before the conclusion, was the same as the holding in Newman v. Soballe."
1990.89-1646,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1742.132,1756.694,"Well, do you think that the Gonzalez Act conveys a cause of action on a plaintiff who has been allegedly injured by a Federal doctor?"
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,1756.694,1765.031,"I prefer to refer to it as a remedy, Your Honor, but I would also agree that a cause of action would be an acceptable synonym."
1990.89-1646,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1819.775,1820.036,"Excuse me, I--"
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,1820.036,1821.077,--they wouldn't appeal from that.
1990.89-1646,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1821.077,1826.921,"--That could mean to permit suits where suits are otherwise available, but not to create a cause of action."
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,1833.534,1843.572,"Well, first of all, the Gonzalez Act in 1089(a) does talk about a cause of action under the Federal Tort Claims Act."
1990.89-1646,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1845.572,1846.023,"Well, wait a minute."
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,1851.867,1854.498,--Is exclusive.
1990.89-1646,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1854.498,1855.36,--shall be exclusive.
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,1858.491,1863.774,"That... other than what might be available through the Federal Tort Claims Act, Your Honor."
1990.89-1646,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1863.774,1864.896,"Well, that's right."
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,1871.989,1886.12,"Then we go to 1089(f), which indicates that the Secretary may hold the doctor harmless or indemnify him in situations where he may be detailed to a foreign country--"
1990.89-1646,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1886.12,1886.521,Right.
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,1886.521,1890.062,"--or a Federal institution, or under some other circumstances--"
1990.89-1646,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1890.062,1891.344,That doesn't create a cause of action either.
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,1896.667,1929.698,"--Well, that's why I prefer to refer to it as a remedy, Your Honor, because as the Government has taken the position... for example, prior to the Westfall legislation, when we only had the Gonzalez Act... the Gonzalez Act was enacted in 1976, and since 1976 until 1989 the Government made the argument that the Gonzalez Act provided an exclusive remedy only through the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act."
1990.89-1646,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1939.783,1948.679,"Did they say that it provided an exclusive remedy under the Tort Claims Act, or did, do they say that it provided that the remedy under the Tort Claims Act is exclusive?"
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,1948.679,1950.402,"The latter, Your Honor."
1990.89-1646,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1950.402,1950.923,The latter.
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,1964.571,1983.223,"Well, Your Honor, the Government has already conceded that they had no disagreement and they were not appealing from the rationale of either Newman or Smith with regard to the fact that a doctor can be sued in his individual capacity, and the Government would then indemnify him."
1990.89-1646,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1983.223,1998.333,"Well, they said they are not appealing from it, but to the extent that you make an argument based upon the Gonzalez Act that relates to the interpretation of the Reform Act, I don't understand them to have waived their position."
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,1998.333,2036.778,"Well, with regard to the Reform Act, because it did not carry a provision similar to what's contained in 1089(f), and because of the legislative history which cites the Gonzalez Act with some approval, we believe that Congress intended for 1089(f) to remain viable so that an individual doctor would still be protected from individual liability for, among other things, suits that occur either in a foreign country or in the United States if the claim arose in a foreign country."
1990.89-1646,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2096.574,2110.206,"Well, I thought they just said that maybe we ought to, we ought to remand to have the Gonzalez Act further considered."
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,2120.982,2125.146,"--Well, in their petition at page 20--"
1990.89-1646,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2125.146,2127.097,I'm talking about their brief on the merits.
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,2127.097,2148.611,"--Your Honor, with regard to the brief on the merits, what they are arguing in there is that the Gonzalez Act continues to have viability, but the viability is now limited to (1) a suit against the doctor in a foreign country and (2) to an intentional tort, such an assault and battery."
1990.89-1646,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2148.611,2150.612,"Well, they say it's of no utility in this case."
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,2150.612,2154.675,"Well, I'm not sure how they arrive at that, Your Honor."
1990.89-1646,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2154.675,2155.804,"Well, but that's what they urge."
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,2155.804,2157.166,I understand.
1990.89-1646,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2157.166,2157.567,Yes.
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,2181.513,2191.218,"I think, Your Honor, that the question presented in the petition wasn't necessarily the decision that was reached by the Ninth Circuit."
1990.89-1646,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2541.049,2542.579,May I ask you a question?
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,2555.898,2556.699,Yes.
1990.89-1646,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2613.237,2616.639,"May I ask you another... I may make you a little far afield, but I am curious."
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,2627.057,2628.516,I'm not--
1990.89-1646,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2628.516,2632.38,"Say a driver, you know, some wild allegation he intentionally insulted someone."
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,2633.92,2660.016,"--Other than the Gonzalez Act and the VA statute and a couple of the other piecemeal statutes providing for medical doctors' immunization, which has subsections providing for intentional torts, I am not aware of any provision that would permit a suit for an intentional tort under either the Drivers Act or the Reform Act."
1990.89-1646,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2661.328,2675.337,"--I suppose if we, if we accept the Government's position here, a suit against the doctor for an intentional tort would also be barred, if the Gonzalez Act is superseded by the Reform Act?"
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,2675.337,2680.362,"--I would think, to carry their logic, it would have to be."
1990.89-1646,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2680.362,2680.881,Yeah.
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,2680.881,2689.786,Because they are picking and choosing those provisions of the Gonzalez Act that they believe have been repealed.
1990.89-1646,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2689.786,2693.86,"Well, they're saying that whatever is outside the scope of the Reform Act remains."
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,2702.645,2703.346,That's correct.
1990.89-1646,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2703.346,2713.722,"Well, then... and if the statute applies to bar any action except under the Reform Act, that would mean an intentional tort action would be barred, I would think--"
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,2713.722,2714.043,Yes.
1990.89-1646,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2745.912,2767.668,"--What is your response here to Mr. Shapiro's argument based on 2679(d)(4) to the effect that, in the provision there, that once there has been a scope certification and a substitution of the United States, the action proceeds subject to the limitations and exceptions applicable to those actions?"
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,2781.128,2789.656,"Justice Souter, prior to enactment of the Reform Act, the Gonzalez Act essentially carried those same provisions."
1990.89-1646,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2815.722,2825.928,"If we don't accept your position on the Gonzalez Act, does this argument defeat you under the Reform Act?"
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,2825.928,2838.767,"No, because in this particular case... again, it is an incident that occurred in a foreign country, and Congress doesn't really extend to a foreign country."
1990.89-1646,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2840.307,2844.31,"Well, isn't that one of the limitations and exceptions to which (d)(4) refers?"
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,2844.31,2859.942,"--Well, if you look at the introductory language to 2680, the language specifically says that this section and this chapter shall not apply to any of the following, which includes a foreign country."
1990.89-1646,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2870.441,2873.873,"What, what then do we make of (d)(4)?"
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,2875.984,2884.268,"Basically, in any type of a common law tort situation it would be available as an exclusive remedy."
1990.89-1646,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2884.268,2884.639,Um-hum.
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,2884.639,2907.944,"As the legislative history clearly points out at page 3 of the House Report, the examples of the kinds of claims that may be brought against Federal employees includes suits for clerical negligence in typing or filing documents, errors in benefit determination, suits against park rangers."
1990.89-1646,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2916.029,2923.034,"So it would basically, in most cases it would refer, then, to limitations and so on under the local law?"
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,2923.034,2925.554,Yes.
1990.89-1646,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2925.554,2926.676,"Yeah, okay."
1990.89-1646,1,45749,walter_a_oleniewski,,2926.676,2931.329,Thank you.
1990.89-1646,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2931.329,2934.211,"Thank you, Mr. Oleniewski."
1990.89-1646,2,21559,david_l_shapiro,,2936.264,2938.257,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1646,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2987.017,2987.718,Mr. Shapiro--
1990.89-1646,2,21559,david_l_shapiro,,2987.718,2988.048,--I'm sorry.
1990.89-1646,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2988.048,3000.848,"--Mr. Shapiro, while you're on the Gonzalez Act-type things, could you explain to me the purpose of the last part of subsection (f) of the Gonzalez Act?"
1990.89-1646,2,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3064.28,3066.02,"Yes, I think it is, Your Honor."
1990.89-1646,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3075.888,3084.874,"Yes, but the point is that the first part of the Gonzalez Act uses language that's very similar to the language you're relying on in the Reform Act."
1990.89-1646,2,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3084.874,3084.884,That's true.
1990.89-1646,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3084.884,3093.98,"And if... if in the Gonzalez Act they didn't think that that language precluded the suit against the individual, why would they in the Reform Act?"
1990.89-1646,2,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3093.98,3110.232,"The Gonzalez Act is simply cloudy on this point, and the other two parts of subsection (f) may well embrace points that are consistent with a broader reading of subsection (a) of the Gonzalez Act."
1990.89-1646,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3184.209,3184.289,"Mr. Shapiro, I'm just curious."
1990.89-1646,2,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3196.538,3200.952,There are other statutes similar to the Gonzalez Act.
1990.89-1646,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3248.653,3249.932,"Thank you, Mr. Shapiro."
