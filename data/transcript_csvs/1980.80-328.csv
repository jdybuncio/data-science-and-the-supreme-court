1980.80-328,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,4.952,We will hear arguments next in New York v. Belton.
1980.80-328,0,31002,james_r_harvey,,71.529,74.898,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-328,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,193.041,194.375,What time of day was this?
1980.80-328,0,31002,james_r_harvey,,194.375,195.493,"Mid-morning, Your Honor."
1980.80-328,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,311.368,313.903,You say there were five jackets?
1980.80-328,0,31002,james_r_harvey,,313.903,315.986,"I believe that's correct, Your Honor."
1980.80-328,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,322.556,323.356,Five jackets?
1980.80-328,0,31002,james_r_harvey,,323.356,324.223,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.80-328,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,327.725,328.894,"Did he search the others, too?"
1980.80-328,0,31002,james_r_harvey,,328.894,330.912,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-328,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,345.838,351.223,At trial did they disclaim any ownership?
1980.80-328,0,31002,james_r_harvey,,353.742,360.598,"--Okay, Your Honor, in the jacket, in... the defendant in this case, the Respondent, now Belton... he had an ID card."
1980.80-328,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,379.076,382.428,But the ID card also was in this jacket?
1980.80-328,0,31002,james_r_harvey,,382.428,382.728,That's correct.
1980.80-328,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,440.748,444.8,Was this trooper always alone with the four?
1980.80-328,0,31002,james_r_harvey,,444.8,445.867,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.80-328,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,453.656,455.675,Did he secure them in any way when they were standing--
1980.80-328,0,31002,james_r_harvey,,455.675,456.841,"No, Your Honor, they were in no way secured."
1980.80-328,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,456.841,458.56,--Just stood outside the car?
1980.80-328,0,31002,james_r_harvey,,458.56,462.661,"They were outside of the vehicle, outside of their particular vehicle, Your Honor."
1980.80-328,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,506.023,508.059,Did you say it was a two-door vehicle?
1980.80-328,0,31002,james_r_harvey,,508.059,508.892,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.80-328,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,508.892,510.375,Then did he have to get in it and--
1980.80-328,0,31002,james_r_harvey,,510.375,511.094,Yes.
1980.80-328,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,521.133,525.937,"--I take it any of the four, had he been able to reach it, would have had to get in the same way, would he?"
1980.80-328,0,31002,james_r_harvey,,525.937,539.995,"Being a two-door vehicle, Your Honor, they could have certainly... my position is more that they could have overpowered the officer and put him in a situation where they could have obtained the evidence and taken out the jackets in this particular case."
1980.80-328,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,551.152,553.688,And why did the New York Court of Appeals say it was not?
1980.80-328,0,31002,james_r_harvey,,553.688,554.304,--Okay.
1980.80-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,600.651,602.368,Were any of them armed?
1980.80-328,0,31002,james_r_harvey,,602.368,607.305,--There was no evidence in this particular case of any weapons.
1980.80-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,608.672,610.691,"Well, yes, the officer had a weapon."
1980.80-328,0,31002,james_r_harvey,,610.691,613.293,"That's correct, which he never used, or never even drew."
1980.80-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,613.293,616.745,"Well, I don't get this, he automatically can be overpowered."
1980.80-328,0,31002,james_r_harvey,,620.662,622.231,"Well, Your Honor, I maybe misspoke."
1980.80-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,623.564,624.7,--Couldn't he have called for help?
1980.80-328,0,31002,james_r_harvey,,629.052,630.42,He certainly--
1980.80-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,630.42,631.92,--And they usually call for help.
1980.80-328,0,31002,james_r_harvey,,631.92,632.586,"--Excuse me, Your Honor."
1980.80-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,638.705,638.871,Gone?
1980.80-328,0,31002,james_r_harvey,,640.157,642.692,"He's outside of his vehicle at this point in time, Your Honor."
1980.80-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,645.525,645.76,That's what I'm--
1980.80-328,0,31002,james_r_harvey,,645.76,648.929,"--that's very unusual in a speeding case, Your Honor, for a police officer--"
1980.80-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,648.929,649.945,--With four people in the car?
1980.80-328,0,31002,james_r_harvey,,649.945,650.528,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.80-328,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,650.528,674.993,"Mr. Harvey, Judge Gabrielli in his dissent makes some point of the fact that under your state procedural rules the New York Court of Appeals cannot make new findings of fact where the Supreme Court and the Appellate Division have made concurrent findings."
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1614.841,1617.591,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-328,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1800.543,1810.501,"Mr. Frey, is this an argument that because the jacket was capable of being worn, we ought to treat its search as we would treat one if he were wearing the jacket?"
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1810.501,1812.551,"No, no, it would not have to be a jacket."
1980.80-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1832.182,1834.034,So what about a lady's purse?
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1841.103,1855.03,"Well, the questions that I would ask are at the time the purse is seized, is it within the area where the woman who has been arrested could possibly lunge for it and grab it?"
1980.80-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1855.03,1857.565,"Supposing that it is, you would say, they may search it?"
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1857.565,1859.934,If it's still during the arrest process.
1980.80-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1863.903,1867.855,What about a briefcase that's on the front seat beside the person you arrest?
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1867.855,1868.957,--Yes.
1980.80-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1868.957,1869.89,The same?
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1869.89,1871.742,I would say the same.
1980.80-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.342,1874.408,"Otherwise, you would--"
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1874.408,1878.912,"--To follow what the Court has held in Robinson, it does not turn on the privacy expectation."
1980.80-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1878.912,1885.883,"--And so you would say, if you arrested on the street, if you arrest a person on the street carrying a briefcase, you can obviously search the briefcase?"
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1885.883,1886.585,If it's unlocked.
1980.80-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1886.585,1887.735,If it's unlocked?
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1887.735,1890.554,I would have difficulty with the suggestion.
1980.80-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1892.571,1893.855,But what if it were just zippered?
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1895.94,1908.098,--I think the question the Court has to answer in this situation is whether it is something to which somebody might possibly have gained access during the course of the arrest.
1980.80-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1908.098,1914.485,"We've certainly sustained as an incident search, a search of a zippered bag, in Draper, Draper."
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1914.485,1917.704,"Yes, I would say a zippered container would be searchable incident to arrest; yes."
1980.80-328,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1924.508,1925.627,"You don't have much choice about that, do you?"
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1925.627,1926.877,--Excuse me?
1980.80-328,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1926.877,1928.995,You don't have much choice about that any longer.
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1928.995,1939.535,"Well, I would have... I don't think that the Court held in Chadwick that a search then and there would necessarily not have been incident to arrest."
1980.80-328,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1986.999,1987.7,We'll resume there at one o'clock.
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1999.508,2001.258,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-328,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2134.012,2147.538,"Well, Mr. Frey, you wouldn't contend that the cases from this Court that you have referred to are kind of a unified whole easily applicable by any lower court or any policeman, would you?"
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2147.538,2155.691,"I would say that in the area of search incident to arrest the cases to date have been reasonably consistent, and it seems to me that--"
1980.80-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2155.691,2158.829,"Up until they were unsettled by Chadwick and Sanders, maybe?"
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2158.829,2174.339,"--Well, I don't think that Chadwick... Chadwick apparently has been the source; Sanders, I don't think, has anything to do with search incident to arrest, but Chadwick has been the source of some confusion for the lower courts, but I don't think it's any inconsistency in this Court's treatment of the subject that has prompted that."
1980.80-328,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2174.339,2177.791,"Well, there was no claim in Chadwick, was there, that that was a search incidental to arrest?"
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2177.791,2179.057,We did not make that claim; no.
1980.80-328,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2179.057,2179.659,I didn't think so.
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2181.093,2189.849,"No, but it was a point that was discussed in the Court's opinion, and in just a second I will get to what the Court said about it because I think it is important."
1980.80-328,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2223.236,2234.393,I take it you will take some note of the fact that in Chadwick the search was not at the time or place of the arrest but long after?
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2234.393,2235.477,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2256.723,2272.583,"I take it you wouldn't have suggested that in Chadwick that footlocker could have been searched if the arrested had taken place in the station, while they were sitting on... right after the dog had decided what was in the?"
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2272.583,2282.606,"--If the arrest had taken place in the station and they had been sitting on it, I would say that it could have been searched incident to arrest but for the fact that it was locked and therefore it was not--"
1980.80-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2282.606,2284.522,"Well, ""but for"" is... that's a rather big ""but for"", is it not?"
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2284.522,2285.156,"--That is the big ""but for""."
1980.80-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2387.003,2399.663,"Well, you don't think that there's any inference to be drawn from Chadwick that the search in that case could not have been justified as a search incident to arrest?"
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2399.663,2408.686,"--What Chadwick held was that the search at the station house, an hour and a half later, after the people were presumably locked in cells someplace else, could not be justified as incident to the arrest."
1980.80-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2411.905,2433.401,"You think that you would be making the argument you would be making now if when they arrested the people, just as they were, while the footlocker was in the station wagon, that they could have searched the footlocker incident to arrest except for the fact it was locked?"
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2433.401,2434.401,--Except for the lock.
1980.80-328,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2513.869,2528.446,"If... I suppose what you're driving at is that, conceivably, the officer might have said to the four of them, you get in your car, and don't get more than two car lengths ahead of me and go to the station?"
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2528.446,2534.183,"That is one of the important reasons for the search incident, when you have a number of items like this."
1980.80-328,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2541.52,2547.49,But now you're going to destruction of the evidence if that had happened without any preliminary search.
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2550.559,2552.061,"--That would be a risk, yes."
1980.80-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2572.392,2580.311,"In this case, instead of doing that, they put all four of them and their jackets in the car with the policeman, in the same car."
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2580.311,2581.83,--I'm not sure.
1980.80-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2583.913,2585.932,"Well, that's what... that's what the lawyer who tried the case said."
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2585.932,2591.703,"--Well, but it's... I don't think he put the cocaine in any place where Mr. Belton could reach it."
1980.80-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2591.703,2592.971,"Well, they were all in the same car."
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2592.971,2596.607,"Well, I... but if he knew that--"
1980.80-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2596.607,2597.223,Weren't they?
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2597.99,2603.661,"--The part of the record that's in the appendix, I don't recall that it shows."
1980.80-328,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2614.985,2623.157,"Well, whatever car they were in, the policeman had possession, I take it, of the cocaine while he was driving them to the station?"
1980.80-328,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2623.157,2624.374,I assume so.
1980.80-328,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2625.859,2628.978,Very well.
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2630.828,2634.363,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-328,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2660.163,2662.282,"You mean, after they got out of the car?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2662.282,2663.032,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-328,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2664.265,2666.984,"Obviously, they were, while they were in the car, initially."
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2666.984,2667.686,That's correct.
1980.80-328,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2709.096,2716.334,"Well, do you read it as saying that there's nothing that could possibly support that exception because in fact they were outside the car?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2716.334,2718.036,"In fact, they were outside the car--"
1980.80-328,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2718.036,2720.488,"I mean, is that the way you read your court of appeals?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2720.488,2722.021,"--Yes, and that's the proof."
1980.80-328,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2724.69,2730.277,And you argue in agreement that therefore the exception cannot apply under this set of facts?
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2730.277,2731.877,It does not apply under Chimel.
1980.80-328,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2777.574,2782.042,Maybe he's a fast-draw policeman and therefore didn't have to draw it.
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2782.042,2790.548,"I might indicate that when the question was asked of him he was quick to respond, as the record shows, there was just no need for that at any time."
1980.80-328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2796.869,2810.962,How about the possibility of them not with weapons but simply with their own bodies overpowering him while he was looking in the back seat?
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2810.962,2813.83,I think that we have to deal with the record the way it exists.
1980.80-328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2845.985,2855.84,"Well, but how long would it have taken four of them, acting unison, to have frustrated the officer's search?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2855.84,2861.561,--I think that the only thing we could do is hypothesize that that perhaps could be possible.
1980.80-328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2887.592,2895.012,"But Chimel was at least a one-on-one situation, not a four-on-one situation."
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2895.012,2896.131,I think that that's true.
1980.80-328,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2900.616,2907.421,Why don't you remind Justice Rehnquist that the man himself said he had a gun and he wasn't worried.
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2907.421,2909.388,--He indicated that he had no reason for it.
1980.80-328,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2909.388,2910.29,He was the only one that was there.
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2910.29,2932.554,"But I think that the point is, if we were to decide the strength or the weakness of the protection of the Fourth Amendment based upon the number of officers, or the number of weapons, or the number of handcuffs, then an officer without any weapons, without any handcuffs, all alone, would be able to do much more searching without a warrant than an officer who was armed with a shotgun, or two officers--"
1980.80-328,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2932.554,2936.339,"Mr. Cambria, does this record show anything about these four?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2940.243,2947.647,"--The only thing indicated, Your Honor, was that they were on their way home to Buffalo, and they were at all times cooperative with the officer."
1980.80-328,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2949.832,2950.498,Were they young men?
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2950.498,2955.652,"They were all young men and that was revealed in the record, that they were young men."
1980.80-328,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2955.652,2956.419,Late teenagers or something?
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2956.419,2959.021,"Your Honor, it's not revealed in the record."
1980.80-328,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2960.89,2961.49,I see.
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2961.49,2985.338,"The point that I think again, the appellate division here, and, I submit, the Government is attempting to say by citing Adams v. Williams and the other cases, that we should scrap Chimel, that we should adopt the Robinson standard for the area, as opposed to what it stands for which is the person."
1980.80-328,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3000.315,3004.067,"Under your view, could the officer open the glove compartment?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3004.067,3007.669,--I believe that the officer could open the glove compartment.
1980.80-328,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3008.787,3009.337,Why?
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3009.337,3025.63,"--Well, because I believe that under South Dakota v. Opperman and the other cases around the car exception, that those areas traditionally do not enjoy the expectation of privacy that private receptacles do."
1980.80-328,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3044.294,3048.012,But Opperman was an inventory search of an abandoned car.
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3050.031,3054.816,"I think that if we then go to inventory, we're talking of something other than the Fourth Amendment."
1980.80-328,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3076.431,3088.156,"The purpose of an inventory search is in part, at least, to protect the officers from claims of possible theft or disappearance of the materials, so they would go into the pockets if they were going to make an inventory, would they not?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3088.156,3090.941,"I'm not sure if they would, and it would depend upon--"
1980.80-328,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3090.941,3094.143,"Well, what good would it do them to make an inventory search if they didn't look in the pockets?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3094.143,3102.214,--My recollection of Opperman is that it depends upon their local rules and regulations as to what they can do and what they can't do in the inventory situation.
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3122.294,3131.316,"Mr. Cambria, there never was any finding in this case, was there, that there was probable cause to search the jacket?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3131.316,3131.816,No.
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3131.816,3137.654,"And the claim is that it should be searched just incident to arrest, whether there is probable cause or not?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3137.654,3139.522,That was the claim that was first made--
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3139.522,3140.188,Yes.
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3140.955,3141.572,--Yes.
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3141.572,3142.138,It still is.
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3155.615,3160.0,I would say that probable cause wouldn't make the difference as it did not in Sanders.
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3160.0,3166.089,"Well, I know, I know, but in this case you would still have the problem of proving probable cause, if you went for a warrant."
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3166.089,3170.707,"No question about that, that there wouldn't be any probable cause for this specific jacket."
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3244.355,3256.147,"Well, Mr. Cambria, you wouldn't... if he had patted down this jacket, which he did, and he had discovered something that it felt like a gun, you still wouldn't suggest that he could search it, would you?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3256.147,3259.099,"Not under the... no, for two reasons; no."
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3259.099,3259.782,"Well, yes."
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3264.169,3265.636,I think that's exactly correct.
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3265.636,3268.038,"Then you would have probable cause, maybe, to believe there's something in the jacket."
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3268.038,3271.99,The difference is that in Adams v. Williams the gun is immediately--
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3271.99,3273.025,I understand.
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3273.025,3273.775,--associated with the person.
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3273.775,3274.275,I understand.
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3274.275,3280.779,"And in our case, at no time... and that's why there's been an allusion to the Draper standard; Draper is different."
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3288.034,3292.086,"Well, it was taken from him, and once it was taken from him, it was in complete control of the officer."
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3292.086,3292.52,--Yes.
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3292.52,3293.955,So how could he get in the zipper bag?
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3293.955,3297.99,"That question, which certainly is not here at this point--"
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3297.99,3298.473,"Well, I don't know."
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3302.425,3302.941,--Yes.
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3306.26,3309.079,"On your argument, could the outcome in Draper be the same?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3315.316,3319.969,--Yes... in my argument it was never taken from any of the defendants.
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3327.556,3336.931,"You mean, if one of these persons, as he was getting out of the car, he was carrying a jacket in his hand, the officer took it from him--"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3336.931,3340.716,And separated--
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3340.716,3345.352,"--Patted it down, didn't feel anything like a weapon or anything, and then he searched it, just like he did here."
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3349.839,3352.774,"--I would say this, that he could not do that if he's--"
1980.80-328,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3352.774,3355.226,"No, now, wait a minute, Mr. Cambria, why isn't that Draper?"
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3355.226,3356.46,It is Draper.
1980.80-328,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3356.46,3360.879,He walks out of the car with it on his arm and the officer takes it from him.
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3364.497,3374.187,"--I would submit this, that Draper may be qualified by Chadwick and Sanders; it may be, because of the--"
1980.80-328,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3374.187,3387.612,"Oh, well, frankly, I thought what you were arguing was the difference between, distinction between Draper and this case and between the hypothetical my brother White has just given you, and this case; is that they were not within grabbable distance--"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3387.612,3389.962,--Yes.
1980.80-328,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3389.962,3390.814,--Of the coat.
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3390.814,3392.214,"As to my case, yes."
1980.80-328,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3394.766,3398.718,"Well, I guess it's wise not to continue to argue that rather than to debate whether this was--"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3398.718,3399.92,I was trying to answer the hypothetical--
1980.80-328,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3399.92,3402.372,--And suggest that Draper has been qualified by Chadwick.
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3402.372,3411.812,"I just was trying to find out what your argument is, and it sounds to me like you would qualify Draper, that your argument would qualify Draper."
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3411.812,3412.312,--No.
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3417.364,3423.501,"Well, wouldn't the court below, on its argument, the exclusive control test, wouldn't it qualify Draper."
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3423.501,3433.058,"--No, because I think in this case the court below, the decision below was, that at no time were these materials within the Chimel standard."
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3464.495,3468.732,So you suggest that there's no need to depart from Draper in this case?
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3468.732,3473.6,--I suggest in my case there's no need to depart from Draper because the facts are not there.
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3473.6,3475.468,Nor in any Draper case?
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3475.468,3479.437,"Well, I'm not sure whether or not Chadwick, now, and Sanders--"
1980.80-328,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3479.437,3487.526,"Well, suppose, in this very case, instead of the jacket lying on the seat he'd been wearing it, one of the four, this defendant, when he walked out."
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3492.347,3493.047,--I think that that--
1980.80-328,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3493.047,3494.48,Wouldn't that be Draper?
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3494.48,3494.963,--No.
1980.80-328,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3517.012,3519.614,You mean it wasn't enough that they had probable cause to arrest him?
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3519.614,3521.347,--With regard to Draper?
1980.80-328,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3521.347,3522.566,Yes.
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3522.566,3525.518,I think that the difference is this.
1980.80-328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3534.974,3537.157,"Well, he was arrested for speeding, wasn't he?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3538.659,3538.909,Yes.
1980.80-328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3538.909,3542.194,--You don't challenge the probable cause for that arrest?
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3542.194,3543.027,For the arrest for speeding?
1980.80-328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3543.377,3545.396,How about the arrest for marijuana?
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3545.396,3547.096,Not for the arrest for the marijuana.
1980.80-328,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3551.05,3558.537,"Well, the issue in this case is bottomed upon the premise that the arrest was a lawful custodial arrest."
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3558.537,3559.22,That's... yes.
1980.80-328,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3559.22,3559.737,Is it not?
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3559.737,3560.439,Yes.
1980.80-328,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3560.439,3569.594,And the only issue is whether or not the search and seizure were within the permissible scope of a search and seizure incident to that lawful custodial arrest?
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3569.594,3570.027,Yes.
1980.80-328,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3601.131,3604.849,"Now, did Chimel speak in terms of ""grabbable reach"" or ""reach""?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3604.849,3604.999,Yes.
1980.80-328,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3606.133,3608.885,"Or was the emphasis on plain view, first?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3608.885,3609.285,--No.
1980.80-328,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3618.324,3619.759,And in plain view?
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3620.626,3624.829,"No, there wasn't... I do not believe there was a mention of plain view."
1980.80-328,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3624.829,3626.712,--Plain view comes first.
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3630.9,3642.256,"No, I might indicate that in Chimel the opinion covered closed drawers, open drawers; plain view, not in plain view; many areas."
1980.80-328,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3681.833,3683.649,"Well, that's the issue before us."
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3683.649,3685.368,"--Yes, it was never argued at the time of the trial."
1980.80-328,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3685.368,3691.289,Is this within the permissible geographic scope of a search incident to a lawful custodial arrest?
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3691.289,3691.289,Yes.
1980.80-328,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3691.289,3694.205,"There's no question, is there, about the permissible temporal scope?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3694.205,3697.359,"I don't think so at all here; no, not in this particular--"
1980.80-328,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3697.359,3700.895,"There is no question, at least by hypothesis, that this was a lawful custodial arrest?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3700.895,3702.395,--That's true.
1980.80-328,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3702.395,3707.715,So the only issue is whether or not this is within the permissible geographic scope of such a search--
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3707.715,3708.349,"Yes, and I--"
1980.80-328,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3708.349,3709.001,--and seizure.
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3709.001,3722.391,"--What I am suggesting is that we should not... and the Court has not, in the past... adopted a place or area requirement, but has in fact employed this grabbable reach element."
1980.80-328,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3770.722,3774.693,"Well, the issue is whether or not this was within the Chimel confines."
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3776.276,3776.459,Yes.
1980.80-328,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3782.013,3783.397,"Mr. Cambria, may I ask you a question?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3783.397,3784.299,"Yes, sir, Justice Powell."
1980.80-328,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3784.299,3791.036,"If this jacket had been on the seat beside the driver, it would have been reachable before the driver got out of the car."
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3805.562,3809.58,At the time of arrest the occupant was outside of the car.
1980.80-328,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3809.58,3809.83,I know.
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3811.363,3815.984,"If it was within his grabbable reach, under Chimel, I think that I would be foolish to argue otherwise."
1980.80-328,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3815.984,3822.988,--So that the difference really is whether or not the officer asked for the jacket before or after the driver stepped out of the car?
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3822.988,3825.94,"No, I don't think that that's the difference."
1980.80-328,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3883.026,3888.43,"Do you not draw any distinction between a residence, a home, and an automobile?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3888.43,3914.73,"I don't think that there is a distinction between articles within an automobile and articles in a residence, or articles anywhere else, if they are private receptacles, and I don't think there's much argument here that these are not, then the question is, as it was in Sanders and the other cases, that we don't give up the privacy simply because they happened to be in an automobile or because they're somewhere else."
1980.80-328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3914.73,3931.959,"What do you do with our Edwards case then, which said that although the search took place an hour and a half after the arrest or two hours after the arrest, since it could have been done at the time of the arrest, it was good at two hours afterwards?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3931.959,3942.833,"I think that there is a vast difference between Edwards and this case, because in Mr. Edwards' situation we're talking about his clothes, which were totally immediately associated with him because he was wearing them."
1980.80-328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3980.273,3996.551,You certainly have the temporal disparity in Edwards that you do not have here and that you don't have in Chimel.
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,3996.551,4009.292,"Well, I don't think we have a temporal difference in Edwards since, one is he was wearing the garment, it was always in danger of having whatever evidence was contained on it being destroyed."
1980.80-328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4015.696,4019.333,"Well, so then it makes no difference when the person is arrested?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4019.333,4022.702,"No, it would make a difference under Preston, certainly."
1980.80-328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4044.115,4048.5,"Except in Edwards, it was held that it would not invalidate it."
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4048.5,4052.721,"No, it did not invalidate it, and I submit, because of several unique factors."
1980.80-328,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4089.144,4096.35,"Mr. Cambria, maybe this is too trivial a question, but you have used the term ""grabbable reach"" repeatedly."
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4096.35,4096.533,Yes.
1980.80-328,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4096.533,4100.785,Is a grabbable reach a greater or a lesser area than a just plain reach?
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4100.785,4113.795,"Well, I think that grabbable reach, in the sense of being able to reach the materials, that's the way I interpret Chimel; readily reach the materials immediately."
1980.80-328,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4144.814,4148.45,"Well, have we got to go through the record to find out if it was reachable or not?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4148.45,4158.323,"I think that the record certainly shows in all ways and fashions that it was not, and there is no affirmative proof that it was."
1980.80-328,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4158.323,4159.79,Was there any findings?
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4159.79,4160.323,Never.
1980.80-328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4171.231,4177.452,"Well, but that's not... in a sense, a constitutional fact, if we're talking about a Fourth Amendment claim."
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4186.308,4206.638,"Well, I think that... it seems to me that in this particular case you couldn't make a judgment of fact, that the Court would not be in a position to make a judgment of fact as opposed to a judgment of law based upon the record as found by the highest court of the State of New York."
1980.80-328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4206.638,4211.225,"Well, if the Court of Appeals of New York said, this was not within grabbable reach--"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4211.225,4211.508,It did.
1980.80-328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4211.508,4216.01,--Whereabouts in the record?
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4216.01,4236.658,"The opinion was to the effect that in the last footnote of the chief judge's opinion he said, we search the record in vain in an attempt to find the facts which support, the dissenting justice is Gabrielli, his statement that this was ready to hand or within their reach."
1980.80-328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4239.275,4242.811,"Well, do you regard that as a finding of fact?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4242.811,4243.811,Yes.
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4278.584,4299.064,"Mr. Cambria, I take it that when you arrest someone in connection with a car, if you want to go beyond your grabbable reach range, you'll have to rely on the automobile search, the automobile theory, which requires probable cause to believe that where you are searching you may find what you're searching for?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4299.064,4309.603,"And then only as to those items listed by this Court in Opperman, which would be items immediately associated with a car: trunk, glove compartment, wheel wells, fender wells, and so on."
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4309.603,4313.621,"Well, I think you also have to have probable cause to believe you're going to find something in those areas."
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4313.621,4313.873,No question about it.
1980.80-328,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4327.048,4341.189,"Mr. Cambria, when you... as I understand the facts here, after the officer stopped the car, the driver rolled down the left window of the car, and the officer when he went into the back seat was on one side of the car and the four individuals were on the other side."
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4343.308,4351.996,"No, the only testimony here is that he took the individuals out to the rear of the car, that he first split them up and patted them all down."
1980.80-328,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4354.881,4356.567,"Which door did he go in, do you know?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4356.567,4359.519,"--He, I believe, indicated the driver's door."
1980.80-328,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4359.519,4360.869,He went in the driver's door.
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4361.702,4362.721,Then he came back out--
1980.80-328,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4362.721,4368.089,"But if the window was open, I suppose it's conceivable, even though they're outside the car, they could have reached in and grabbed the jacket."
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4368.089,4369.791,"--However, the record doesn't support that."
1980.80-328,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4374.379,4374.912,I see.
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4374.912,4378.664,"No way... in fact, the officer puts himself back into the car."
1980.80-328,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4378.664,4381.533,I thought the four individuals were separated from one another.
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4381.533,4382.883,That's so.
1980.80-328,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4382.883,4384.051,Are they all behind the car?
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4384.051,4386.253,"That's what the record states, Your Honor, yes."
1980.80-328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4386.253,4395.525,"Mr. Cambria, let me go back to the footnote that you have referred to in Chief Judge Cooke's opinion, at A-81 of the Appendix."
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4431.762,4432.464,Yes.
1980.80-328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4432.464,4442.07,"Now, that suggests more the exclusive control type of thing that the Government is arguing against, rather than the grabbable reach thing."
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4442.07,4458.164,"I think, in this case, that the court of appeals decision can be read to say, since it was in the exclusive control of the officer and it was not within the grabbable reach of the defendants, then it doesn't fit within the Chimel doctrine."
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4472.423,4482.714,"So you agree with the United States, I gather, if the court of appeals, if the opinion below is read as establishing a control test, you don't defend that?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4482.714,4492.653,"That established a control... if there would have been testimony in this case that the material was within the grabbable reach of the individuals, it would be a different case."
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4492.653,4493.303,"Well, I know."
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4506.079,4506.595,Of the officer.
1980.80-328,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4506.595,4511.983,"Now, if the court below meant that you couldn't search that jacket, you do not defend that view?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4511.983,4515.768,I see this... I see no reason to defend it on this record.
1980.80-328,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4522.755,4530.527,"Neither Chadwick nor Sanders involved, and I think you'll agree with this, a claim that the search was incident to a lawful custodial arrest, did it?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4530.527,4531.627,It was discussed.
1980.80-328,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4531.627,4533.812,It was discussed in Chadwick.
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4533.812,4534.412,Yes.
1980.80-328,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4534.412,4539.014,"And the findings were made... and discussed in a footnote, I guess, in Sanders?"
1980.80-328,2,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,4539.014,4539.48,Yes.
1980.80-328,3,31002,james_r_harvey,,4701.5,4705.904,"Since I still have a couple minutes, Your Honor, if it please the Court:"
1980.80-328,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4735.007,4756.253,"If we take your view, I take it that any container in a car, any piece of evidence in a car, or in the interior of the car, or anything in any container in the car, is searchable and seizable incident to the arrest?"
1980.80-328,3,31002,james_r_harvey,,4756.253,4766.542,"--My position, Your Honor, under the facts of this case, where you've got four individuals exiting the vehicle, all being placed under arrest for possession of marijuana, that anything--"
1980.80-328,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4766.542,4780.552,"It wouldn't have made any difference... to you it wouldn't have made any difference whether the jacket was on the floor, or the back seat, or anywhere in the interior of the car, or whether what the officer seized was a briefcase?"
1980.80-328,3,31002,james_r_harvey,,4780.552,4789.225,"--If it were within the area of gaining access by any of these arrestees, Your Honor, then it should be subject to--"
1980.80-328,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4789.225,4793.36,"If it was a briefcase in exactly the same position as the jacket, you would say it could be searched?"
1980.80-328,3,31002,james_r_harvey,,4793.36,4795.378,"--A briefcase that could be gotten into, yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-328,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4796.747,4802.132,"Well, wait a minute, you've said, under the overpowering theory, or your said, under--"
1980.80-328,3,31002,james_r_harvey,,4802.132,4806.269,"Well, Your Honor, also they could have reached in through the... that it's tied in."
1980.80-328,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4806.269,4814.792,"--The overpowering theory would depend, I suppose, if I understand your shorthand for the theory, upon how many arrestees there were and how many policemen there were arresting them, and which ones were--"
1980.80-328,3,31002,james_r_harvey,,4814.792,4822.862,"I think that's certainly the criteria, and the area that's being searched, in this case the inside of an automobile, Your Honor, that is, on the back seat of the--"
1980.80-328,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4822.862,4828.182,"--The overpowering theory depends at least in part, I suppose, upon the fact that there was one arresting officer and four arrestees."
1980.80-328,3,31002,james_r_harvey,,4828.816,4829.651,--The facts of this case; that's correct.
1980.80-328,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4829.651,4835.872,"And therefore if there were only one arrestee, then he might--"
1980.80-328,3,31002,james_r_harvey,,4835.872,4837.872,You're getting into a different factual situation.
1980.80-328,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4837.872,4842.192,--And there's a possibility of overpowering when you leave four of them in the back of the car?
1980.80-328,3,31002,james_r_harvey,,4844.728,4848.263,"You're certainly in the car looking through the vehicle in this case, Your Honor."
1980.80-328,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4848.263,4850.632,"Yes, but I mean, that's a danger of being overpowered?"
1980.80-328,3,31002,james_r_harvey,,4855.786,4856.469,In fact--
1980.80-328,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4856.469,4859.653,"And you got in the car and got back out, and nothing happens."

1980.80-328,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4860.787,4862.939,Then you've got to worry about overpowering?
1980.80-328,3,31002,james_r_harvey,,4862.939,4875.08,"--In fact, the officer was not overpowered in this particular case, but he certainly, under the Chimel-Robinson rules had the opportunity and the right to search the interior of those jackets, Your Honor."
1980.80-328,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4876.18,4877.28,"Thank you, gentlemen."
