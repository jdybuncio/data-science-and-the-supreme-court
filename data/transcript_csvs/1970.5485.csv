1970.5485,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.381,"We will hear arguments next in 5485, Johnson against Mississippi."
1970.5485,0,41903,stephen_w_porter,,15.516,17.991,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.5485,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,99.285,102.57,Is this one month sentence was stayed?
1970.5485,0,41903,stephen_w_porter,,102.57,103.142,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.5485,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,103.142,103.516,With serious evidence?
1970.5485,0,41903,stephen_w_porter,,103.516,103.917,Yes.
1970.5485,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,139.246,142.975,And he was there as a defendant in case that’s going to be tried that day?
1970.5485,0,41903,stephen_w_porter,,142.975,145.857,"Yes, Your Honor whether or not he was going to be tried that day."
1970.5485,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,147.476,147.486,Trial.
1970.5485,0,41903,stephen_w_porter,,147.486,148.968,-- of this term.
1970.5485,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,148.968,149.257,And he was --
1970.5485,0,41903,stephen_w_porter,,149.257,150.339,And he was required --
1970.5485,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,150.339,153.223,A defendant in one of the cases that the Court was going to try during that term.
1970.5485,0,41903,stephen_w_porter,,153.223,157.707,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.5485,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,177.177,187.109,What would be your view if the judge then and there or upon the adjournment of Court that had imposed the sentence of 30 days for contempt of Court?
1970.5485,0,41903,stephen_w_porter,,187.109,190.333,Your Honor.
1970.5485,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,196.949,197.464,Yes.
1970.5485,0,41903,stephen_w_porter,,198.048,214.833,"And I think even then, the behavior of petitioner Johnson who was alleged is far less than the outrageous behavior which is present in many of the decided cases to this Court on this subject."
1970.5485,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,234.373,243.461,"What difference does it make whether it’s a spectator, a tourist, a defendant, or a member of the bar of the Court?"
1970.5485,0,41903,stephen_w_porter,,243.461,244.458,"Well, I think Your Honor that there are --"
1970.5485,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,244.458,250.11,And except that it might be a higher degree of culpability on the part of the lawyer of course.
1970.5485,0,41903,stephen_w_porter,,250.11,256.571,Leaving aside the question of a lawyer for the moment.
1970.5485,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,307.725,311.685,Is the judge on the bench at the time this --
1970.5485,0,41903,stephen_w_porter,,311.685,312.256,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.5485,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,315.049,316.631,What was going on in the courtroom?
1970.5485,0,41903,stephen_w_porter,,319.372,343.567,"The record does not show what was going on whether or not if it was going on -- it appears the petitioner arrived in Court shortly after the judge was making his opening announcements with respect to a -- I don’t believe it, a trial was going on because I don’t think jurors had been chosen yet, with respect to any of the pending cases."
1970.5485,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,343.567,344.848,Just some preliminary matters at time.
1970.5485,0,41903,stephen_w_porter,,344.848,351.243,"It’s a preliminary matter -- I believe that’s correct, Your Honor."
1970.5485,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,351.243,371.907,"You haven’t indicated your view of the matter but you don’t need to, the view of the Court’s power summarily to deal with utterance of that kind in the courtroom, do you question the Court’s power to deal with that kind of an utterance in the courtroom by any person?"
1970.5485,0,41903,stephen_w_porter,,371.907,377.504,"I don’t question Your Honor, the power of the court to deal with an utterance of that kind in a courtroom."
1970.5485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,429.756,437.241,"You mean, staying in front of the courtroom he says, and to judge, look to him and say -- and say, “Go to hell.”"
1970.5485,0,41903,stephen_w_porter,,439.055,442.864,"I'm not suggesting that that the judge cannot do anything about it, Your Honor."
1970.5485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,443.375,446.083,What do you suggest he could do?
1970.5485,0,41903,stephen_w_porter,,446.083,449.06,"There's several things he could do and it depends, I think --"
1970.5485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,449.06,452.855,"He could put him in jail for 30 days right then and there, could he?"
1970.5485,0,41903,stephen_w_porter,,452.855,455.736,I think he could probably put him in jail for 30 days right then and there.
1970.5485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,457.269,457.753,Legally?
1970.5485,0,41903,stephen_w_porter,,457.753,459.075,"Yes, Your Honor, legally."
1970.5485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,468.027,472.146,And if the Sheriff heard it and told the judge that that’s different.
1970.5485,0,41903,stephen_w_porter,,473.726,475.735,I think that’s correct.
1970.5485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,477.347,477.594,What would he do then --
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,1742.726,1746.944,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.5485,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1757.528,1758.193,Who’s this?
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,1761.169,1763.957,Judge that imposed this sentence.
1970.5485,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1763.957,1766.162,Is this the same -- this was in Grenada County which you are addressing?
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,1766.162,1768.298,"Grenada County, yes."
1970.5485,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1768.298,1779.303,But is this the same Judge Perry who was involved in the proceedings in Winston County and as related in the appendix C to your brief?
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,1780.016,1798.912,"Same judge and I come to my reason for making that opinion (Inaudible) in the appendix to the brief what the defendant published a report at the time, this brief once affirmed."
1970.5485,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1824.785,1826.793,Did he hear him?
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,1826.793,1827.664,Mr. Justice Marshall --
1970.5485,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1827.664,1828.091,(Voice Overlap)
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,1828.091,1837.493,He said he did in the petition that he instructed the show cause petition or information which he instructed to prosecute it to prepare.
1970.5485,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1843.52,1843.533,Yes.
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,1843.533,1847.089,But you’ll find in the record that Judge Perry himself stated that he heard it.
1970.5485,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1847.089,1848.454,I see.
1970.5485,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1848.454,1854.042,But would there be anything inconsistent between hearing it and having it reported to him?
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,1854.042,1860.038,It could have been both and like here is a question of counsel.
1970.5485,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1926.92,1928.002,It was never denied.
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,1928.002,1928.571,Sir?
1970.5485,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1928.571,1932.064,There never was denial on what was said.
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,1932.064,1932.649,"No, sir."
1970.5485,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1932.649,1933.974,"Never, never."
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,1934.748,1936.958,"No, sir."
1970.5485,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2113.097,2122.663,I have two problems with your argument and I may say so unless you can straighten it out Mr. Lyell.
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2176.096,2193.483,"Well, I think what they mean by the statement Mr. Justice, as I understood is this, that they had to accept as a fact from the finding of the trial court, what this contemnor did?"
1970.5485,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2211.552,2215.715,"Now, there's never been a denial of this or is there ever been any opportunity for a denial."
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2245.169,2246.055,"Well, he had --"
1970.5485,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2246.055,2262.432,"Therefore, if there was no hearing or opportunity for a hearing, if there was denial of a hearing and if the appellate court takes the facts stated in the judgment of the trial judge as true and correct, I don’t see how there could’ve been any appellate review at all?"
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2262.432,2262.769,"Summarily, --"
1970.5485,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2262.769,2268.266,Unless the dumb noble kind of a review that you suggest that Mississippi statute requires?
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2268.266,2277.202,My recollection is that there at least two of these show cause order who served and to give him an answer or opportunity to file a written response.
1970.5485,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2295.548,2301.967,"I heard you say, it means offers some excuse for doing something, admits you’ve done something?"
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2301.967,2302.533,Yes.
1970.5485,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2304.002,2311.973,"But you -- on page 40 of the appendix, it stated that Martha M. Wood, and that was his lawyer as I understand it."
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2316.86,2318.867,"What date was that, sir?"
1970.5485,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2318.867,2324.437,"I think it was 1969, 9:00 AM on January 27, 1969."
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2331.586,2337.679,But had not he’d been previously afforded an opportunity to file a response in earlier.
1970.5485,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2337.679,2340.63,"Now, where is that in the record?"
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2340.63,2341.002,Part of Mississippi --
1970.5485,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2341.002,2341.97,Or in the appendix?
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2344.28,2348.444,I haven’t seen the printed record.
1970.5485,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2352.055,2352.547,Or you have --
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2352.547,2356.45,"Then, I think the original record was up there, when I have to thank sheriff Almeda."
1970.5485,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2356.45,2360.434,"Well, this was filed here on February 10, 1971."
1970.5485,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2360.434,2366.614,Which cannot be found in the appendix?
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2366.614,2376.576,"From my information was that he had -- there were two hearings set and the first one, he didn’t even show up."
1970.5485,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2376.576,2382.547,"Is it your position he defaulted in his opportunity to present evidence and litigation, or to purge or to claim"
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2382.547,2384.086,I think so.
1970.5485,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2384.086,2395.831,And that the occasion that Justice Stewart is referring to then in your view was just the occasion to hear this judge’s sentence for contempt?
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2395.831,2400.917,Perhaps on second one but it is there on the second one.
1970.5485,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2448.314,2449.225,Mr. Lyell.
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2449.225,2449.459,Sir.
1970.5485,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2449.459,2454.77,"As I understand, I'm looking at page 40 Mr. Justice Stewart referred to."
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2498.011,2500.005,"Well, I can’t answer that --"
1970.5485,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2500.005,2501.953,You can’t say whether that did or did not occur?
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2501.953,2503.272,I can’t say it no.
1970.5485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2503.272,2503.973,Would you think that --
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2503.973,2506.164,"What, sir?"
1970.5485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2506.164,2509.511,When doing that brings this case within Mayberry?
1970.5485,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2509.511,2522.211,"Well, I think Mr. Justice White that he is guilty of a summary contempt which would bear immediate imposition of punishment."
1970.5485,2,41903,stephen_w_porter,,3134.188,3135.328,"No, Your Honor."
1970.5485,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3135.328,3137.146,Very well.
