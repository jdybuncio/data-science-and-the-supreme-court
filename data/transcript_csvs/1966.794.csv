1966.794,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,36.397,"Number 794, the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad Company versus Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen."
1966.794,0,36174,martin_m_lucente,,41.888,45.25,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.794,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1352.528,1357.541,Mr. Highsaw.
1966.794,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,1357.541,1360.065,May it please the Court.
1966.794,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1481.672,1487.758,"On your approach it wouldn't make any difference how many facts like that were of record, would it?"
1966.794,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,1487.758,1489.563,"Not on our approach, no, Your Honor."
1966.794,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1629.211,1632.305,You mean applicable in the sense of the limited review on the Board --
1966.794,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,1632.305,1643.806,It's applicable with this case in determining whether the venue was proper in the Judicial District of Colorado.
1966.794,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1855.729,1857.802,Where would the proper venue be?
1966.794,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,1857.802,1876.163,"Where would the proper venue be on residence requirements, the proper venue could be either in the Northern District of Ohio, Your Honor, or it could be under the District of Columbia statute which permit suits or you can be found, it could be in the District of Columbia."
1966.794,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1876.658,1885.774,I don't see where -- would not -- how that follow if under (b) it has to be brought where all the defendants reside.
1966.794,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,1896.262,1896.383,But what --
1966.794,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1896.383,1897.851,Now how could it be brought in either place?
1966.794,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,1897.851,1911.078,"Now what the -- well, looking at the Northern District of Ohio, what the Court of Appeals held was that the Brotherhood was resided -- the Brotherhood is a jural entity resided in the Northern District of Ohio."
1966.794,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1911.078,1920.296,"Well, that surely does -- violence to the statute which could be argued to be equally great as what you say you're (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.794,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,1920.296,1934.78,"No, I don't think it can, Your Honor, because prior to the use of the residence language, the statute for great many years, read inhabitant and the word inhabitant had been interpreted and there's no question about this."
1966.794,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1970.333,1981.9,"But certainly under their reasoning of Bouligny, if that is controlling here then I should think it follows, doesn't it, with this suit, it couldn't be brought anywhere?"
1966.794,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,1981.9,1982.719,No.
1966.794,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1986.492,1986.578,Why?
1966.794,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1986.578,1991.617,But the matter is that a suit could be brought wherever they can find the members of the union.
1966.794,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,1991.617,2004.015,"Well, I said -- I believe what I was mentioning, Your Honor, in the Graham case, this Court said that a railway labor organization could be sued in the District of Columbia."
1966.794,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2172.9,2173.347,Well --
1966.794,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,2173.347,2185.985,"The principle is the use of this type of legislative material where you have no language and you have no legislative history, which are the normal tools for interpreting statutes."
1966.794,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2203.691,2207.531,Well Bouligny involved of the diversity of citizenship problem?
1966.794,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,2207.531,2208.965,"That's correct, sir."
1966.794,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2208.965,2232.629,"The problem on -- in Bouligny was whether for purposes of determining citizenship which has the constitutional basis in the diversity doctrine, it would take the position that a labor union is a citizen of the state where it has its principal place of business."
1966.794,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,2235.621,2236.539,That's correct.
1966.794,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2236.539,2257.642,"And without a constitutional basis and the question that I suppose this case presents is whether for venue purposes, a residence of a labor union may be taken to be where it has put principal place of business, that would be Cleveland here."
1966.794,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,2257.642,2258.557,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1966.794,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2258.557,2283.022,"Now, if you don't take that position, if you do follow the analogy of Bouligny all the way through then you would say that venue would be proper wherever any member of the labor union can be found because the historic doctrine is that labor union citizenship is a citizenship of its members, of each of its members."
1966.794,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,2283.022,2328.505,"If you applied the -- I believe, Your Honor, though this is the argument made by the carrier this -- what you're referring to now does appear in the brief of the National Railway Labor Conference's amicus but the carrier itself makes a different argument and I think that the -- that that argument at least put some correct setting, the substance of the Bouligny decision on the subject matter and that -- its argument is, is that if the substance of the Bouligny decision as applied to the venue problem, then you wouldn't be able to sue in any judicial district because all of the members obviously aren't residents of any particular judicial district."
1966.794,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2328.505,2345.497,But the -- if you assume that all of the defendants -- this purpose means that you have to get all of the members of the labor union but if you assume that you could sue the labor union that you had venue over anyone of its members and you could sue practically everywhere in this case.
1966.794,1,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,2345.497,2346.247,That's correct.
1966.794,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2375.717,2377.075,Mr. Lucente.
1966.794,2,36174,martin_m_lucente,,2377.075,2377.914,May it please the Court.
1966.794,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2459.198,2459.869,Very well.
