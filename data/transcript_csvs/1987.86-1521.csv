1987.86-1521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,54.607,"Mr. Wallace, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1987.86-1521,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,54.607,63.042,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,277.628,280.981,Was that in the 7th Circuit?
1987.86-1521,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,280.981,283.014,--That was the 7th Circuit case.
1987.86-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,283.014,287.756,And did the Government just lie still for that or--
1987.86-1521,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,287.756,292.632,We did not petition for writ of certiorari for Haffner.
1987.86-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,300.539,300.779,--I see.
1987.86-1521,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,301.039,303.903,"So, we--"
1987.86-1521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,303.903,309.349,Rested on your expectation that you would win a case like this?
1987.86-1521,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,309.349,317.536,"--Well, we didn't think that our future course here would be enhanced by tacking certiorari denied on to the 7th Circuit's decision."
1987.86-1521,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,375.685,379.219,"Mr. Wallace, the present case came up from the Tax Court, too, didn't it?"
1987.86-1521,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,379.219,383.582,The present case is from a District Court.
1987.86-1521,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,383.582,384.222,From the District Court.
1987.86-1521,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,384.222,389.287,It's on appeal from the District Court for the Central District of California.
1987.86-1521,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,389.287,392.599,And Haffner came out of the Northern District of Illinois?
1987.86-1521,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,392.599,393.861,That is correct.
1987.86-1521,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,393.861,401.267,"Is this the first time the issue was reviewed by the Tax Court, by the full Tax Court?"
1987.86-1521,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,401.267,401.497,That is correct.
1987.86-1521,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,401.497,402.018,The first time?
1987.86-1521,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,402.018,405.692,It is the first Tax Court decision on the issue.
1987.86-1521,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,405.692,407.684,And you have five dissents or something like that?
1987.86-1521,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,407.684,428.297,"There were five dissents, but eleven votes agreeing with our position, and I would add that the Tax Court's opinion seems to us to be the fullest and most persuasive treatment of the issue thus far by any court."
1987.86-1521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,428.297,438.285,And the Tax Court held that the bonds were not intended to be exempt under the 1937 Act?
1987.86-1521,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,438.285,446.322,"Under the 1937 Act, which was the only issue before the Tax Court since the Repealer Provision, would not have affected the Tax Court cases."
1987.86-1521,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,733.252,744.282,"Then, Mr. Wallace, why would there be specific exemption language in Section 20 of the earlier act?"
1987.86-1521,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,744.282,783.989,"Well, that brings me, Mr. Justice, to the first ground relied upon, we think erroneously, by the Court in Haffner, the difference in the drafting between this language we just looked at in Section 5 and the language that appears on the next page, which is Section 20(b) of the 1937 Act, a provision which has not existed in the Act since 1949, and that is referring to obligations of the Federal Housing Authority, a federal agency, which was to furnish money to the state agencies."
1987.86-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,915.064,919.676,"But you just told us that this wasn't an exception, that the language simply didn't cover it."
1987.86-1521,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,919.676,924.231,The language would have covered sur taxes.
1987.86-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,928.923,934.79,"That is a true exception, but you just told us that the exemption of any transfer taxes--"
1987.86-1521,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,934.79,934.957,--That is correct.
1987.86-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,934.957,935.868,--is not really an exemption.
1987.86-1521,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,935.868,949.309,"It might not have been necessary, but it was a draftsmanship devise used out of an abundance of caution and it was not something peculiar to this statute."
1987.86-1521,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1257.944,1262.996,"Mr. Wallace, which Senator Walsh was this?"
1987.86-1521,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1264.468,1266.239,This was Montana.
1987.86-1521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1300.678,1304.441,Maybe he's responsible for getting estate tax exemptions for the bond.
1987.86-1521,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1311.357,1314.078,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1987.86-1521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1605.281,1606.413,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,1608.183,1615.419,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1521,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1667.243,1684.844,"Mr. Rotstein, if all we had before us was the language of Section 5(e) and we didn't have the language Section 20, would you concede that the Government's position is correct in that we would not ordinarily give that broad language such a broad effect?"
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,1684.844,1689.266,"Your Honor, I would so concede if there was not also the legislative history."
1987.86-1521,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1797.647,1803.831,"Well, the legislative history you rely on is the statement of Senator Walsh, I gather?"
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,1803.831,1817.593,"--Well, it's the statement of Senator Walsh plus the version, the rejected version, of Secretary Ickes, which contained a reference to estate tax and Section 5(e)."
1987.86-1521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1823.806,1830.478,You are combining two of the Government's arguments.
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,1845.87,1846.941,"Well,--"
1987.86-1521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1846.941,1857.747,"You may call it a formalistic distinction, but the fact is when you tax the bonds, you're imposing an annual tax or some other tax on the bonds themselves."
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,1868.418,1870.649,--It is a tax on the transfer.
1987.86-1521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1889.382,1890.303,In light of 20(b).
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,1890.303,1891.435,In light of 20(b).
1987.86-1521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2156.768,2164.855,"In an estate tax report, Mr. Rotstein, if something is exempt from the estate tax, do you not even have to list it?"
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2164.855,2166.816,--That's my understanding.
1987.86-1521,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2187.731,2194.075,Aren't you taking almost a criminal risk if you don't list something that might be taxable?
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2203.392,2204.623,That's true.
1987.86-1521,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2206.964,2208.485,That may not only be conservative.
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2210.357,2211.256,It could be wise.
1987.86-1521,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2223.444,2225.377,"This is the get-by doctrine, in other words?"
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2228.6,2229.99,--The get-by doctrine?
1987.86-1521,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2229.99,2230.21,Yes.
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2230.21,2236.594,"It's the get-by doctrine, and this kind of conduct will be encouraged."
1987.86-1521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2250.224,2267.085,"Why couldn't a taxpayer simply list or include it, but say it's not taxable, which would not allow him to take a forward position but still not risk evasion?"
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2267.085,2268.966,A taxpayer could do that.
1987.86-1521,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2283.367,2286.737,Do you practice tax law exclusively?
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2286.737,2287.488,--I do not.
1987.86-1521,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2289.111,2289.909,But you do some of it anyway?
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2289.909,2292.761,"In this case, Justice Blackman."
1987.86-1521,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2292.761,2317.518,"Because surely if you were in tax law constantly, you would do just that, take the prudent reference of non-includability, but at least of indicating presence, so that there's no question of a fraud tack for an attempt to evade tax."
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2317.518,2323.772,"That's correct, Your Honor, and the more prudent executors and tax lawyers may do just that."
1987.86-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2329.528,2330.248,I really don't think they're encouraged.
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2337.905,2338.215,--That's correct.
1987.86-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2338.215,2338.496,Yeah.
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2339.364,2352.163,The District Court found that retroactively-applied Section 641(b)(2) violates both the due process clause and the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment.
1987.86-1521,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2399.356,2400.858,How long before his death?
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2400.858,2403.509,From about... he died in April.
1987.86-1521,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2413.374,2415.968,All of them purchased within a year then?
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2415.968,2416.747,All purchased within a year.
1987.86-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2449.308,2459.606,"Was it not true that at the time he made these purchases, there were a lot of tax lawyers during the past forty years or so, forty or fifty years, who had thought they were subject to estate tax?"
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2459.606,2462.628,The Government argues that.
1987.86-1521,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2544.68,2548.471,Was Dr. Stein in good health when these notes were purchased?
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2548.471,2551.013,He was in good health right up till the end.
1987.86-1521,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2553.536,2558.629,"One could almost say it was a purchase, not a transfer, a purchase in contemplation of death otherwise."
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2558.629,2561.702,It could have been.
1987.86-1521,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2597.818,2602.63,"In the companion case, do you know how long before death the project notes were purchased?"
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2602.63,2604.743,I do not.
1987.86-1521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2604.743,2611.857,"In either of these cases, did the decedents claim exemption for the notes?"
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2613.589,2616.961,"That's correct, and neither did the executors claim exemptions."
1987.86-1521,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2618.35,2627.878,Do you know how the Internal Revenue Service discovered their existence?
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2630.59,2634.863,"Well, that's why we're here, Justice Blackmun."
1987.86-1521,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2641.426,2642.488,"In your case, that's correct."
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2642.488,2642.718,--In our case.
1987.86-1521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2666.714,2674.86,"But, Mr. Rotstein, certainly Congress made a stab at satisfying decedent's legitimate expectation."
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2688.469,2704.951,"--Well, I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice, because the executors of the estates reported project notes as taxable under compulsion of a Revenue Ruling that came down in 1981, indicating that they were taxable."
1987.86-1521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2721.753,2724.325,What sort of compulsion is a Revenue Ruling?
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2730.039,2734.703,--An executor can take other action.
1987.86-1521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2750.354,2751.746,What did the Haffner people do?
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2751.746,2761.651,"In Haffner, they apparently paid the tax but listed... disputed on the return the fact that project notes were taxable."
1987.86-1521,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2761.651,2769.057,I take the Wells Fargo executors then knew of the existence of the Rev Rule?
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2769.057,2770.507,That's correct.
1987.86-1521,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2770.507,2783.947,"That's a pretty low form of animal life in the structure of Treasury Rulings of one kind or another, about the lowest there is almost, and you feel they worked under compulsion."
1987.86-1521,1,40335,robert_h_rotstein,,2783.947,2801.03,"The record indicates that they paid the tax and reported them as taxable by virtue of the Revenue Ruling, and at that point, that was the only public pronouncement of any kind regarding the taxability of project notes."
1987.86-1521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3276.708,3279.68,"Thank you, Mr. Rotstein."
1987.86-1521,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3282.264,3283.593,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-1521,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3480.508,3492.606,"Mr. Wallace, if you'd stand there for just a minute, our records show that this is your hundredth appearance before this Court, and that your first argument here was in a case argued March 25th, 1968, for the Government."
