2005.05-409,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.525,We'll hear argument next in Kircher v. Putnam Funds Trust.
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,6.735,9.477,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2005.05-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,104.242,128.848,"Under your approach, Mr. Frederick, the Federal court would decide the principal substantive issue in the case, the principal legal issue, nonfactual perhaps, and then decide that is has no jurisdiction if it finds that it doesn't come within... within (c), sends it back to the State court."
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,133.701,134.693,"No, it's not."
2005.05-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,134.693,135.484,Why not?
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,135.484,142.346,"Because under this Court's longstanding precedent, for there to be preclusion, there must be a right of appellate review."
2005.05-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,159.968,165.031,"And for this Court, I assume, at least theoretically, on petition for certiorari?"
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,165.031,167.564,"That's correct, through the State court system."
2005.05-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,167.564,173.729,"What... what was the basis then, or was there a basis, for Judge Easterbrook's comment, it's now or never?"
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,173.729,175.94,He was wrong.
2005.05-409,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,204.758,205.83,Do we have a standard--
2005.05-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,205.83,218.779,"Do we have any cases that... that are like this one which are like this one which involve not just res judicata of... of the... of the finding by the Federal court, but the law of the case?"
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,236.911,260.677,"There are cases in the lower courts, Your Honor, in the complete preemption area that have held that a removal based on the doctrine of complete preemption was not sustainable because the case was not completely preempted, but holding that preemption, implied conflict preemption, can be applied by the State courts on remand."
2005.05-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,262.758,264.01,"You don't have any case of ours, though."
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,264.01,276.716,"--Not that I'm aware of, but what the City of Waco case says, upon which they base their reliance, is that the reason why there was appeal of that particular order was because it would be held preclusive."
2005.05-409,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,281.199,303.124,"Well, is... is there... correct me if I'm wrong, but I... I had thought there was an... an easier answer, and that is that the... the decision that ultimately the State court will make, as to whether there is or is not preclusion, is not identical to the decision that the Federal court... that the district court makes on the motion for remand because on the... and this is the way I was going about it."
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,339.437,345.121,"That is certainly true, although I would take issue with the notion of there being a colorable claim."
2005.05-409,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,366.916,368.185,"Okay, but do you take the position--"
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,368.185,369.327,But I... I don't... sorry.
2005.05-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,378.213,392.504,"Yes, but you must take issue with the this is only a quick determination, unless you also agree with... disagree with Justice... Judge Easterbrook when he said, the decision for the Federal court is only two things."
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,407.494,417.071,"--Well, under their theory, though, Justice Ginsburg, the court could, because of their construction of the removal jurisdiction provision, would retain jurisdiction."
2005.05-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,417.071,420.243,"Yes, but that was not... certainly not the Seventh Circuit's understanding."
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,420.243,439.527,"Well, and we think that that position that they have advanced in this Court is incorrect, and I would agree with your postulate that what the Federal district court does and it has jurisdiction to do is to decide whether preemption applies and then remand the case, or if preemption does apply, to dismiss it."
2005.05-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,439.527,442.84,Whether preemption applies or whether there's a colorable basis for saying?
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,447.421,448.613,It does... it does do that.
2005.05-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,448.822,454.127,"So you don't... you don't agree with what Justice Souter was saying, that all it's... all it's making is a colorable basis."
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,454.127,455.685,--I thought I expressed my--
2005.05-409,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,455.685,469.905,"In other words, you take the position that... and... and you may well be right, but I mean, you take the position that there is a complete determination on the merits at the... at the stage at which the district court rules on the motion to remand."
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,469.905,471.988,--That's... on the basis of the record then before it.
2005.05-409,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,471.988,472.487,Yes.
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,472.487,472.927,Yes.
2005.05-409,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,472.927,475.169,"Well, you say on the basis of the record then before it."
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,478.861,485.446,The court always has the authority to have evidence taken to determine its own jurisdiction.
2005.05-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,487.547,517.376,"Mr. Frederick, as I understand it, at least the Seventh Circuit's fix on this case was that the Federal courts have adjudicatory authority to do one thing and to do that one thing finally, that is, to decide whether this is a case that cannot be brought in any court or whether it's a case that Congress has left over for the States still to deal with."
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,533.919,545.536,"I... I agree with you that that is how the Seventh Circuit described the opinion and what... what the adjudicatory authority was, and that is why we take issue with the Seventh Circuit."
2005.05-409,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,599.479,605.904,"Well, it doesn't... what Thermtron says is that we read (d) in conjunction with (c)."
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,671.066,683.976,"--And our problem with that, Justice Breyer, is that all eight district court decisions here thought that they were deciding subject matter jurisdiction, and they thought that because Federal preemption ordinarily is not a basis for removal."
2005.05-409,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,685.738,685.938,No.
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,713.745,714.196,--It... it is--
2005.05-409,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,714.196,715.578,That would be the argument he's making.
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,717.018,725.055,"--Well, functionally it is the equivalent of codifying the complete preemption doctrine, which is how SLUSA actually works."
2005.05-409,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,729.326,730.127,I agree with you.
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,759.937,781.68,"--It would be a strikingly odd result, though, for this Court to reach that, given that Congress has clearly provided for appellate review of remand orders in other contexts, including in the Class Action Fairness Act, under tribal property disputes, the FDIC, the RTC, and specifically in 1447(d) itself, civil rights cases."
2005.05-409,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,785.384,786.816,"No, but isn't the... isn't the argument--"
2005.05-409,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,786.816,787.227,"Mr. Frederick, can I ask you a question?"
2005.05-409,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,787.227,800.503,"--that in those cases in which Congress has provided, we... we are not dealing with a situation in which the... the removal or not, the preemption or not is the end of the litigation."
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,831.572,845.143,"Well, I think that the closest analogy, again, is in the complete preemption area where the Court has held that, you know, the removal is based on complete preemption, and if that is found by the district court, that functionally terminates the litigation."
2005.05-409,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,863.956,867.518,Let me ask you one preliminary question just to be sure I understand the case.
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,878.455,884.95,It had the... it had the power to determine whether SLUSA applied.
2005.05-409,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,884.95,885.551,All right.
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,885.551,893.466,"And that's what section 77p(c), when it says, as set forth in subsection (b), is referring to."
2005.05-409,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,896.508,901.673,So the... there... there was jurisdiction in the Federal court to entertain the removed case.
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,901.673,902.063,--Yes.
2005.05-409,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,902.063,909.829,Then... then why... then how can you say the... the remand was based on lack of... of jurisdiction?
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,909.829,916.172,Because the courts held that the requisites of SLUSA of subsection (b) had not been satisfied.
2005.05-409,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,916.172,922.026,"Well, but they... they had held it acting on an interpretation of SLUSA before our decision in Dabit."
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,922.026,923.105,That's correct.
2005.05-409,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,923.105,928.581,And isn't it at least possible that they would... would have decided that issue had they reviewed--
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,928.581,934.725,"It is possible, but that's why the issue of the underlying district court's determination is not before you."
2005.05-409,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1000.286,1000.596,--How--
2005.05-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1000.596,1003.809,"Mr. Frederick, will... would you please explain something to me that you just said?"
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1025.575,1027.785,"That's incorrect, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.05-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1063.279,1079.681,"The... the Seventh Circuit said precisely, in particular, they did not argue in their briefs and did not maintain at oral argument, despite the court's invitation that their suits allege mismanagement rather than deceit or manipulation."
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1085.124,1089.469,"The briefs recounted what the claims are, which are negligence claims."
2005.05-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1089.469,1092.281,Then how could the Seventh Circuit have gotten it that wrong?
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1092.281,1101.386,"Well, the Seventh Circuit made five crucial errors, that it was wrong to describe the district court as saying that removal was proper."
2005.05-409,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1131.635,1145.215,"--But it... it might have been that prior to Dabit, you would have been emphasizing... or whoever would have been emphasizing the... the fraud character of... of the claims, and after Dabit, perhaps the negligence boat is the only one left for you."
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1145.215,1150.988,"But the point, Mr. Chief Justice, is that this is on a basis of subject matter jurisdiction."
2005.05-409,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1189.103,1199.058,"Maybe this is not a fair... how likely is it, given our determination in Dabit about how Congress intended to treat fraud claims, that negligence claims are going to fare any better?"
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1199.058,1205.042,"--Well, this Court in the Santa Fe case, Mr. Chief Justice, said that negligence claims are not within 10b-5."
2005.05-409,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1208.645,1209.977,Would it make sense--
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1209.977,1223.574,"So if the... if the State court applies Dabit and Santa Fe, it will come to the conclusion that the holder theory is preempted under Dabit, but the negligence theory is not preempted under the Santa Fe case."
2005.05-409,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1223.574,1230.33,--Does it make... what's worrying me in the back of my mind is we have decided Dabit since this case was brought.
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1255.237,1264.731,"It does come up often because the securities bar, every time they get a district court decision that they don't like, they want to appeal it, notwithstanding the general bar of appealability."
2005.05-409,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1290.18,1291.549,I'm trying to think.
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1328.165,1342.755,"Well, in the Cohill case, this Court addressed the situation where there was a Federal dismissal of the claims and the... and the Federal district court remanded the State claims for consideration under... under State jurisdiction."
2005.05-409,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1366.961,1368.142,Shouldn't--
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1368.142,1373.735,"No, it shouldn't and the reason it shouldn't is because Congress has decided that it shouldn't."
2005.05-409,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1384.031,1402.514,But aren't you... aren't you urging a very strange result that the... the decision on the merits of the SLUSA preclusion issue should be decided by the State courts when the whole purpose of... of that provision was to take matters out of the State courts because there was a view in Congress that they were not being handled properly there?
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1402.514,1403.863,"--No, Justice Alito, to the contrary."
2005.05-409,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1410.458,1413.41,I thought you said the merits of the issue was not going to be decided by the Federal court.
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1413.41,1413.601,--No.
2005.05-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1438.147,1441.759,So he's right that it's ultimately not decided by the Federal court.
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1441.759,1443.119,"No, it is deciding."
2005.05-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1443.119,1445.861,You're saying the Federal court makes a decision which is not binding in the case.
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1448.385,1464.804,"It is decided by the Federal court within the confines of what Congress has determined based on its wording of SLUSA and its fact that, as this Court has said in Things Remembered, the Congress is presumed to accept the general rule of nonappealability unless it says so."
2005.05-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1464.804,1465.005,"Yes, I understand that."
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1471.847,1475.57,I'm saying that it is final for purposes of remand.
2005.05-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1475.57,1477.713,"Okay, but it is not final--"
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1477.713,1477.991,And that in terms--
2005.05-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1477.991,1479.453,--for purposes of the lawsuit.
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1479.453,1489.511,"--Because... because what SLUSA does is it has an interplay between the removal jurisdiction provision and it says, as set forth in subsection (b)."
2005.05-409,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1489.511,1509.984,"I understand that, but as long as you say that, the point that... that Justice Alito makes is... is well taken, that we... we thought that this was a... a statute designed to have the Federal courts determine this issue, and it turns out that the Federal court just takes the first swing at it, and if a State court disagrees, it's... it's free to do so."
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1509.984,1519.759,That is a policy choice that Congress made when not providing a special mechanism for appellate review of remand orders.
2005.05-409,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1519.759,1528.164,"Of course, if the Federal district court says there is preclusion, therefore, case dismissed, that would be reviewable."
2005.05-409,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1528.164,1536.572,"That's correct, and that's where the uniformity of decisions would come from, the reviews by plaintiffs who's had their... who have had their cases dismissed."
2005.05-409,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1541.194,1542.556,"Thank you, Mr. Frederick."
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,1547.679,1551.261,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2005.05-409,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1595.022,1597.784,Could we just... can I ask you suppose they didn't waive it?
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,1599.577,1600.157,"--No, Your Honor."
2005.05-409,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1611.445,1613.606,Let me put the question just a little differently.
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,1630.736,1636.921,"--Your Honor, SLUSA precludes precisely what subsection (b) says it precludes, which is beyond the scope of 10b-5."
2005.05-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1657.944,1665.778,But they can always amend the complaint and pare it down and say now... we... we complained all along about negligence.
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,1695.198,1703.114,"Your Honor, in this case they could not amend their complaint because the Federal jurisdiction is determined on the complaint that we removed."
2005.05-409,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1721.998,1732.593,"And... and I understand your submission... and perhaps it's distinct from the Seventh Circuit holding in this respect... to suggest that those are different standards, the standard for removal and the standard for preclusion."
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,1732.593,1734.764,"Your Honor, I think we're the same as the Seventh Circuit."
2005.05-409,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1737.266,1746.683,"So that under your view at least, it's possible that you could have removal jurisdiction and then determine that the... the case is not, in fact, preempted."
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,1746.683,1747.334,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.05-409,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1747.334,1752.079,And so that an entirely State law case would proceed in Federal court.
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,1752.079,1754.159,"Mr. Chief Justice, let me give you an example."
2005.05-409,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1777.483,1786.299,"Is there another instance in which we've upheld Federal court jurisdiction over a purely State law cause of action, apart from the Federal officer situation?"
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,1786.299,1793.075,"--You have the Federal officer situation and you have the FSIA, Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act situation, Your Honor."
2005.05-409,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1793.075,1793.736,But those are the only two.
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,1793.736,1794.204,"Correct, Your Honor."
2005.05-409,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1794.204,1797.727,So this would be a pretty unusual creature that you're asking us to sanction.
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,1797.727,1798.538,"No, Your Honor."
2005.05-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1813.848,1815.738,"But then, Mr. Perry, there's a whole case."
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,1854.414,1855.566,"Justice Ginsburg, three answers."
2005.05-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1885.726,1906.97,"But now there you must admit that you are departing from Judge Easterbrook because Judge Easterbrook said this statute gives the Federal court adjudicatory authority to do one thing, to decide whether there's preemption or preclusion or, if not, then to remand."
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,1917.055,1921.98,"--Your Honor, Judge Easterbrook read section... subsection (d)(4) to require remand."
2005.05-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1960.773,1961.004,Yes.
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,1995.518,2006.394,"--And, Justice Ginsburg, the reason he said that was because of... of section... subsection (d)(4), which is quoted in full at the top of page 12a of the petition appendix."
2005.05-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2049.373,2049.952,I'm confused now.
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2055.145,2056.527,"No, Justice Breyer."
2005.05-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2061.971,2062.391,All right.
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2090.918,2091.518,--Your Honor--
2005.05-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2091.518,2110.894,"And if you're right that that's wrong, I don't see how you could possibly get out of (c) in 1447(c) which talks about a decision before final judgment, that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction."
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2119.52,2122.02,"--Justice Breyer, I disagree respectfully."
2005.05-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2122.02,2122.3,All right.
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2127.043,2131.407,"If it is a covered class action, that is, 50 plaintiffs and so forth--"
2005.05-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2131.407,2131.995,Yes.
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2131.995,2144.284,"--it is removable and within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Federal courts so long as the defendant has presented, either on the complaint or in the removal papers, a colorable defense of preclusion."
2005.05-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2145.216,2150.859,"Yes, which would have to be a colorable defense that there is an allegation by the plaintiff that falls within (b)."
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2150.859,2166.259,"--An allegation by the plaintiff as elaborated on by the removal notice, if necessary, because where Congress has waived the well pleaded complaint rule, the removal court will look beyond the four corners of the complaint to include affidavits and other materials provided by the defendant."
2005.05-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2180.358,2188.753,"But I don't think that any of those cases are comparable, in that the removed case is going to be tried someplace."
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2244.952,2249.987,"--I entirely agree with you, Judge... Justice Ginsburg, and I think that supports Judge Easterbrook's opinion."
2005.05-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2281.348,2287.543,Why do you say it is not... why do you say that it cannot be examined in State court if there's no appeal in the Federal forum?
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2287.543,2301.634,"--Your Honor, this Court has always held and reiterated in the Munsingwear case that where a collateral estoppel attaches because an issue has been fully and finally litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction between the same parties, that the availability of an appeal--"
2005.05-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2301.634,2302.092,"Well, but the--"
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2302.092,2302.994,--does affect collateral estoppel.
2005.05-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2302.994,2321.075,"Yes, but... but there is also exceptions to the rule of claim and issue preclusion, and when you don't have an opportunity to appeal because the system doesn't let you appeal, then you can say, Judge, don't give this preclusive effect."
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2328.61,2334.724,"Justice Ginsburg, this Court has never held that an appeal is required to give collateral estoppel effect."
2005.05-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2357.0,2360.542,"And a Nassau County court could say, we're not going to treat that as preclusive."
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2364.904,2372.299,"--And if they came out the other way and said, I am going to treat it as preclusive, because the Supreme Court says you don't have to have a right to appeal, we'd be stuck with that."
2005.05-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2372.299,2373.53,"--Well, you wouldn't be stuck with it."
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2378.903,2381.163,"That... that decision would be reviewable here, Your Honor."
2005.05-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2390.62,2394.593,"But in any case, you said Easterbrook made only one mistake."
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2394.593,2395.504,Only one mistake.
2005.05-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2395.504,2399.416,"But he made another one when he said, it's now or never for appellate review."
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2414.917,2417.498,"I respectfully disagree with you, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.05-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2455.292,2456.104,It's now or never.
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2492.137,2492.949,"--Certainly, Your Honor."
2005.05-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2492.949,2495.811,And in... this Court could decide it on review.
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2495.811,2497.33,"In a non removed case, yes."
2005.05-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2515.894,2517.025,I... I don't understand that.
2005.05-409,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2517.666,2518.584,And your best case on that is Munsingwear?
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2518.584,2519.365,"No, Your Honor."
2005.05-409,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2525.059,2525.289,"Oh, the Missouri Pacific case."
2005.05-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2525.289,2531.273,Was that a case where there was no possibility of reviewing the decision of the court of first instance?
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2531.273,2531.954,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.05-409,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2532.444,2535.337,On... on the merits of the issue as opposed to diversity?
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2535.337,2538.279,"--On the merits of the final judgment in the case, correct, Your Honor."
2005.05-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2538.279,2541.07,And why--
2005.05-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2541.07,2554.108,"In other words, if... I mean, it's awfully surprising... I think that's why you're getting this resistance... that there's an issue in a case, does... is the... the State action preempted or not."
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2577.392,2580.014,"Justice Breyer, I think the State court could decide that."
2005.05-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2580.515,2587.461,"And they don't... and if they refuse to decide it, why wouldn't this Court say, this is the same case?"
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2601.818,2615.709,"--Justice Breyer, we would certainly hope that if petitioners were to prevail on the 1447(d) issue, this Court would make clear both that we could relegate the question to State court and bring it to this Court."
2005.05-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2633.74,2636.381,So you're saying we would have to overrule Missouri Pacific?
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2636.381,2642.605,"I think you would have to clarify at least that Missouri Pacific does not apply to SLUSA removals and remands, Justice Souter."
2005.05-409,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2642.605,2671.897,"Is part of the dynamic here, Mr. Perry, that if this goes back to the State court, that affects the dynamics of the litigation because you now have a class action that has to proceed, and that a large part of the litigation strategy in these cases is determined by whether or not there's going to be a full trial on the merits of the class action to effect a settlement, and so forth, so that Congress wanted to have this reviewed quickly and in the Federal courts?"
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2671.897,2672.225,"Correct, Your Honor."
2005.05-409,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2672.766,2673.918,May I ask this question?
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2712.931,2720.067,"--Not under petitioners' theory, Your Honor, because their theory is that the inquiries are completely and totally coextensive."
2005.05-409,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2725.609,2736.137,"Under their theory, but it seems to me very strange to say that we could not, when we do get the case on a petition for certiorari... couldn't review whether it was... whether it was in fact preemption."
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2736.137,2743.932,"--Your Honor, I'd submit that it's very strange that this would not be just reviewable straight up through the Federal system, as Judge Easterbrook and the Seventh Circuit correctly held."
2005.05-409,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2743.932,2746.543,But the reason is there are two separate questions.
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2772.352,2777.254,"Your Honor, that... that may well be a fair distinction of the Missouri Pacific case."
2005.05-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2783.03,2783.889,But it's so odd.
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2783.889,2784.129,--the Seventh Circuit.
2005.05-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2784.129,2788.483,Suppose... suppose the... it came up under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2809.206,2811.297,Your Honor--
2005.05-409,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2811.297,2811.818,Is that right?
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2815.141,2818.213,"--If... if it works the same way with SLUSA, such could be the law."
2005.05-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2823.726,2845.879,"--You're... you're positing a... a State court that's going to, by golly, give that Federal decision preclusive effect even though, say, the Restatement of Judgments says... now if a decision didn't... if there was no opportunity for review, then that's a ground for refusing preclusive effect."
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2845.879,2858.969,"--And in... and in Munsingwear, Your Honor, the United States cited that precise provision of the Restatement of Judgments to this Court, and six Justices of this Court held, no, if there's no appeal, we are still going to give this judgment collateral estoppel effect."
2005.05-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2865.414,2867.724,I thought Munsingwear was about mootness.
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2867.724,2876.331,"Your Honor, it was about mootness and the result of the... the Government's complaint there was that it was going to have to live with the collateral estoppel effects of the judgment."
2005.05-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2895.053,2903.298,"But in... in any case, Munsingwear turned on... not on the availability of... of an appeal generally, but on the mootness of the case."
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2929.364,2937.039,"Well, Munsingwear reaffirmed Johnson v. Wharton which said that where Congress takes away the right to appeal, there is still collateral estoppel effect of the district court judgment."
2005.05-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2939.77,2946.936,"But not if the litigant asks to have it vacated under Munsingwear, the litigant would be entitled to have it vacated."
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2954.37,2965.538,"Your Honor, the... the holding of Munsingwear is that Johnson v. Wharton is good law, and a court need not give... may give preclusive effect to a case without an appeal."
2005.05-409,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2965.538,2966.297,Counsel--
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2966.297,2970.401,"If the Court would like to change that law, it's... it's up to this Court, but that's how we come to this case."
2005.05-409,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2970.401,2982.7,"--Counsel, if you... on the removal question, if there's a dispute about whether it's a covered class action, dispute about the number of people involved, the dollar amount, I take it that is litigated at the jurisdictional stage?"
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2982.7,2983.481,"Correct, Your Honor."
2005.05-409,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2984.05,2984.4,Okay.
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2991.696,2992.026,"--No, Your Honor."
2005.05-409,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2994.788,2995.299,I'm sorry.
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2998.689,3003.743,"--That the preclusive elements are the merits question of the case, not the jurisdictional question."
2005.05-409,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3003.743,3004.314,Why is that?
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,3013.428,3014.93,"Your Honor, I'm agreeing with you on covered security."
2005.05-409,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3024.287,3024.727,Right.
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,3025.088,3029.552,There... there are very few cases that don't involve covered securities because virtually every security is covered.
2005.05-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3096.995,3119.188,"How do you answer the argument, the third argument, that Mr. Frederick stressed that is, that Congress provided specifically in the Class Action Fairness Act, a couple of other acts, and 1447 itself with respect to civil rights actions removable under 1443?"
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,3129.557,3132.889,"In those cases, Your Honor, they work differently than SLUSA for two reasons."
2005.05-409,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3168.302,3169.511,I don't know what... what Congress' knowledge about.
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,3184.412,3194.059,"And, Justice Ginsburg, if Judge Hermansdorfer had said, I'm much too busy and therefore I lack subject matter jurisdiction, it is inconceivable that the Thermtron case would have been decided any differently."
2005.05-409,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3213.841,3216.201,--But... but I still don't... and this gets back to the question I asked before.
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,3227.171,3227.819,"No, Your Honor."
2005.05-409,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3229.532,3235.796,"Well, it says what can be removed is the covered class action involving a covered security, as set forth in subsection (b)."
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,3235.796,3246.352,Just as title VII says what can be brought is an action under this title or just as the environmental statute in Steel Company said what can be brought is an action under subsection (a).
2005.05-409,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3266.645,3280.653,"But... but here, what is set out in subsection (b) is exactly the reason for Congress' wanting to place these restrictions on it, and that, it seems to me, is the sensible reason for reading it the way your... your brother on the other side does."
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,3280.653,3289.479,"Well, Justice Souter, we know from Mesa that if Congress had just made all covered class actions removable, we would have to find some Federal defense to support Article III jurisdiction."
2005.05-409,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3313.067,3313.425,Why would it have done that?
2005.05-409,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,3321.93,3322.35,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.05-409,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3351.61,3352.902,"Thank you, Mr. Perry."
2005.05-409,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3355.045,3361.26,Thank you.
2005.05-409,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3537.676,3544.608,Do you agree that there would be Federal court review in this Court from a State court determination on the applicability of SLUSA in this case?
2005.05-409,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3544.608,3546.641,"Yes, there would be."
2005.05-409,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3567.585,3568.854,"May I ask you one question, Mr. Frederick?"
2005.05-409,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3580.993,3583.024,--That would be covered.
2005.05-409,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3592.271,3595.285,So the mere fact that it's negligently caused would not preclude preclusion.
