1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,0.0,117.458,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.83-264,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,223.245,251.664,"On that point, I notice that the Respondent cited a case, federal case Davidson v. Koerber that referred to Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, in which the District Court held that it's beyond dispute that Maryland's Article 23 protects the same interests as the 14th Amendment, and therefore Section 1983."
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,260.353,266.173,"Justice O'Connor, I think the Respondents very definitely could not have brought an action under Article 23."
1983.83-264,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,280.433,285.968,Despite that Davidson v. Koerber case; is that right?
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,285.968,288.42,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1983.83-264,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,372.276,385.166,"Mr. Strain, the Court of Appeals, though, said that the Maryland legislature intended the three-year statute of limitations period to apply to Section 1983 actions."
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,385.166,391.92,"Justice O'Connor, I don't recall that precise language in Chief Judge Winters' opinion for the Fourth Circuit."
1983.83-264,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,418.888,434.949,"Well, what if a legislative body expressly said it intended a longer statute of limitations to apply, would you give recognition to that?"
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,434.949,448.84,"Justice O'Connor, if for example the Maryland legislature had intended the catch-all provisions to apply to civil rights statutes, I think that would be important to this Court in determining what was the appropriate analogy."
1983.83-264,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,449.526,451.392,Would it be binding on us?
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,451.392,454.161,"--I think it would not be binding, Justice O'Connor."
1983.83-264,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,491.519,495.388,"Although I guess we haven't really decided that question, have we?"
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,500.725,505.112,"Justice O'Connor, I think this Court has not directly decided the issue."
1983.83-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,786.193,788.312,"General Strain, may I ask you a question?"
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,788.312,788.995,Justice Stevens.
1983.83-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,788.995,801.035,"Supposing the underlying claim of a constitutional violation here didn't involve discrimination, but rather, was something like a First Amendment claim or something like that; the employee was discharged for speaking out about some issue."
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,812.093,812.91,"That's correct, Justice Stevens."
1983.83-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,812.91,816.379,--So you're not contending all 1983 are subject to this?
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,816.379,817.997,"That's very correct, Justice Stevens."
1983.83-264,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,843.862,849.85,"There's a certain practical awkwardness about that result, isn't there?"
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,872.132,880.071,"Well, Justice Rehnquist, I believe that normally it would not be the same set of facts out of which the claim arises."
1983.83-264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1083.051,1098.994,Is the statute of limitations that you want borrowed for this purpose in connection with the discharge of a state employee?
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1098.994,1107.334,"The statute of limitations, Justice White, comes from a statute which covers state employees and private employees."
1983.83-264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1117.69,1121.808,What does that limitations period say?
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1128.295,1144.737,"It says, Justice White, that the discharged employee must file a claim with the Maryland Human Relations Commission within six months, just as the union employee must file a claim of unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB within six months."
1983.83-264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1144.737,1149.791,If the claim is what... racial discrimination?
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1149.791,1156.362,"If the claim is racial discrimination, sex discrimination, handicap, age, national origin."
1983.83-264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1156.362,1162.516,And that's the period you're referring to?
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1162.516,1163.718,"That's correct, Justice White."
1983.83-264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1163.718,1167.853,It isn't a period connected with any kind of a court proceeding?
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1167.853,1169.039,"No, it is not."
1983.83-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1193.82,1205.962,"Does the Maryland Code of Statutes have a section on limitations generally and limitations for different kinds of judicial proceedings, like the limit actions in torts?"
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1205.962,1214.983,The Maryland Code does not have such a set of limitations period with that level of specificity.
1983.83-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1246.955,1258.179,"The specific provision you rely on, as I understand it, is the... it's really just one sentence in Section 9A of the statutory scheme for this relief against discrimination."
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1258.879,1259.812,"--That's correct, Justice Stevens."
1983.83-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1259.812,1263.5,So it's not a separate limitations statute in the sense that these others are?
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1263.5,1265.333,"No, it is not."
1983.83-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1280.443,1286.18,"And more narrowly, it's contained within Subsection (a) of Section 9 of 49B."
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1286.18,1287.199,"That's correct, Justice Stevens."
1983.83-264,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1298.804,1315.099,"On that point, Mr. Strain, I wonder whether national uniformity can be said to be the applicable policy if we're looking to Section 1988 which tells us that if the federal law is deficient, we look to state law."
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1321.67,1324.639,--I didn't hear the last few words.
1983.83-264,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1325.122,1332.144,"Well, I wonder if national uniformity is a governing principle in light of Section 1988."
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1332.144,1336.596,"Justice O'Connor, I think uniformity is not a governing principle."
1983.83-264,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1395.385,1412.013,"But, Mr. Strain, if Section 1988 tells us to look at state law, and if the Court of Appeals says that the Maryland legislature did not intend the shorter period to apply, why doesn't that have to inform our decision?"
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1412.013,1422.702,"--Justice O'Connor, if the Maryland Court of Appeals said that the shorter period was not intended to apply, which it did not--"
1983.83-264,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1422.702,1424.487,"Well, it did say that, did it not?"
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1424.487,1425.939,"--It did not, Justice O'Connor."
1983.83-264,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1425.939,1431.324,"Well, let's look at the... the Fourth Circuit said that, did it not?"
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1466.647,1479.407,"Justice O'Connor, that passage is referring to Article 64A, a grievance period that is an alternative limitations period."
1983.83-264,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1481.074,1482.609,"Well, then, and earlier it said"
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1502.772,1503.306,--Yes.
1983.83-264,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1529.924,1540.112,"Well, what if the CA4 meant what I said I thought it meant; namely, that Maryland didn't intend the shorter period to apply?"
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1540.112,1549.837,"--Then, Justice O'Connor, we get back to the issue that we discussed before and that was of what significance would that be to this Court."
1983.83-264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1622.766,1629.539,"There is some significance that the writer of this opinion, Chief Judge Winter, is from Maryland."
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1629.539,1631.539,"Yes, Justice Marshall, there is."
1983.83-264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1643.597,1645.597,"And that you are, too."
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1645.597,1646.363,Pardon me?
1983.83-264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1646.363,1648.299,"If you are going to go that far, you are, too."
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1650.501,1652.869,"I wouldn't be so bold, Justice Marshall."
1983.83-264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1652.869,1665.51,Were you involved or was the... I suppose the Attorney General's office was involved in the McNutt case... or not?
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1665.51,1669.545,The Attorney General's office was not involved in the McNutt case.
1983.83-264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1672.247,1672.68,I see.
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1676.234,1679.686,I honestly don't know whether there was a petition for certiorari or not.
1983.83-264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1679.686,1684.055,But that's the case that Judge Winter thought was controlling here.
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1684.055,1685.84,That's correct.
1983.83-264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1708.337,1709.039,"Administrative, yes."
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1709.039,1710.205,That's correct.
1983.83-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1722.013,1732.821,"Not entirely, General Strain, because there's a footnote in the McNutt opinion pointing out the irony of relying on a Maryland administrative procedure rather than a federal administrative procedure."
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1741.677,1743.711,"That's correct, Justice Stevens."
1983.83-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1744.629,1746.429,Could you help me on one thing?
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1760.072,1765.376,"--Justice Stevens, that time comes after the administrative adjudication."
1983.83-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1789.407,1793.443,He only gets review of the administrative... he can't then bring his own damage action?
1983.83-264,0,38332,paul_f_strain,,1793.443,1795.061,He cannot bring his own damage action.
1983.83-264,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1833.103,1834.22,"Very well, Mr. Strain."
1983.83-264,1,41648,sheldon_h_laskin,,1837.072,1840.424,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.83-264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2151.543,2161.148,"There are a great many differences by statutes and otherwise, are there not, among those categories?"
1983.83-264,1,41648,sheldon_h_laskin,,2161.148,2162.981,"Well, not within 49B."
1983.83-264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2164.95,2171.504,I'm speaking of other relationships that are different in the private and the public sector.
1983.83-264,1,41648,sheldon_h_laskin,,2185.847,2197.237,"Well, that's certainly true, but for purposes of determination of the statute of limitations in a federal claim, I believe the footnote in Ricks still has a great deal of vitality."
1983.83-264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2197.237,2201.773,Why do you think an absolute uniformity has some special merit?
1983.83-264,1,41648,sheldon_h_laskin,,2201.773,2205.76,I don't know if absolute uniformity is every possible.
1983.83-264,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2238.148,2243.802,"Of course, you referred in 1983 as authorizing the bringing of discrimination on claims."
1983.83-264,1,41648,sheldon_h_laskin,,2263.614,2265.132,I think that's absolutely right.
1983.83-264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2301.639,2307.459,--May I go back on one question?
1983.83-264,1,41648,sheldon_h_laskin,,2324.802,2331.324,The 9A complaint has to be served on the respondent within 120 days after the filing of the 9A complaint.
1983.83-264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2331.324,2335.192,So that the defendant would at least get some notice within no more than ten months.
1983.83-264,1,41648,sheldon_h_laskin,,2335.192,2347.334,"However, in two cases... the Banach case and the State Commission case... the Maryland Court of Appeals and the Court of Special Appeals have made it very clear there is a difference in function between those two notices."
1983.83-264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2371.715,2374.651,But it does tell the employer who filed the charge?
1983.83-264,1,41648,sheldon_h_laskin,,2374.651,2375.603,--Yes.
1983.83-264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2375.603,2377.336,So that he knows who's making the complaint.
1983.83-264,1,41648,sheldon_h_laskin,,2377.336,2378.053,Yes.
1983.83-264,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2505.219,2508.19,"Why should that necessarily be so, Mr. Laskin?"
1983.83-264,1,41648,sheldon_h_laskin,,2519.462,2521.848,"Well, I can speak from personal experience."
1983.83-264,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2632.819,2641.841,What do you think the best reading of the CA4 opinion is regarding the legislative intent?
1983.83-264,1,41648,sheldon_h_laskin,,2641.841,2651.531,"In fact, the language you refer to cross-references to 698 F. 2d at 678 and 679 in McNutt."
1983.83-264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2668.223,2679.531,"Well, I don't see that Judge Haynsworth referred at all to legislative intent in McNutt."
1983.83-264,1,41648,sheldon_h_laskin,,2679.531,2690.22,"He refers to Banach, which is the interpretation of Maryland's highest fort on the statute."
1983.83-264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2694.791,2704.229,"But, as a matter of fact, he says that he's just as able... this isn't a question of state law; it's a question of federal law."
1983.83-264,1,41648,sheldon_h_laskin,,2709.55,2710.1,Certainly--
1983.83-264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2710.1,2710.633,Didn't he?
1983.83-264,1,41648,sheldon_h_laskin,,2710.633,2711.335,--He did.
1983.83-264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2718.839,2734.95,"Well, he rejected the suggestion that the question be certified, but earlier he said a relatively short limitations period was clearly thought by the Maryland legislature as appropriate to such an administrative proceeding, but it does not appear appropriate for applications in a judicial proceeding."
1983.83-264,1,41648,sheldon_h_laskin,,2734.95,2735.283,Right.
1983.83-264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2795.136,2800.504,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Strain?"
1983.83-264,2,38332,paul_f_strain,,2800.504,2802.622,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.83-264,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2876.92,2889.828,"Well, what about the common sense argument that utilization of the state procedure will be considerably discouraged by such a short statute for filing suit?"
1983.83-264,2,38332,paul_f_strain,,2889.828,2893.264,"Well, Justice White, I--"
1983.83-264,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2893.264,2900.286,"Because those agencies move rather slowly sometimes, after a complaint is filed."
1983.83-264,2,38332,paul_f_strain,,2900.286,2917.831,"--Well, in point of fact, Justice White, the Human Relations Commission, the Maryland Human Relations Commission, like the EEOC, has a procedure called ""rapid charge processing"" which results in a fact-finding, face-to-face, across-the-table conference within one month."
1983.83-264,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2917.831,2930.389,If there's the same limitations period for filing a federal suit as there is for filing a complaint with the Commission... that's your argument... that it should be.
1983.83-264,2,38332,paul_f_strain,,2930.389,2931.222,"Yes, that's correct."
1983.83-264,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2931.222,2941.678,What is somebody supposed to do... file both the complaint in the federal court and one in the Human Relations Commission?
1983.83-264,2,38332,paul_f_strain,,2946.499,2947.749,"Justice White, no."
1983.83-264,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2966.812,2968.764,And forego the federal suit?
1983.83-264,2,38332,paul_f_strain,,2968.764,2992.011,"And forego the federal suit, or as Justice Rehnquist's question suggested, file a protective suit in the district court and ask the court to hold it abeyance for an appropriate period of time, because the average processing time for the Maryland Human Relations Commission now for the average case is six months only, and I don't think on this matter of--"
1983.83-264,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2992.011,2993.045,That's after filing.
1983.83-264,2,38332,paul_f_strain,,2993.045,2995.331,--After filing; that's correct.
1983.83-264,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3021.197,3022.065,"Thank you, gentlemen."
