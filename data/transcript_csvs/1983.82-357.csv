1983.82-357,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.36,We'll hear arguments next in Michigan against Clifford.
1983.82-357,0,29211,janice_m_joyce_bartee,,15.321,17.802,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,198.56,211.75,"Mrs. Bartee, I suppose you could also prevail if the Court were to say that the facts of this case fitted within the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement, could you not?"
1983.82-357,0,29211,janice_m_joyce_bartee,,211.75,224.859,The precise holding by this Court in Michigan v. Tyler dealt with a subsequent entry which was made after initial entry was made while the flames were smoldering.
1983.82-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,233.805,247.784,"Unless, Mrs. Bartee, the entry of the investigating arson squad is part and parcel of the initial entry of the firefighters."
1983.82-357,0,29211,janice_m_joyce_bartee,,269.907,275.671,Fire investigators investigate approximately 130 to 160 fires a day.
1983.82-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,300.348,310.234,What determines whether the arson squad would go to a fire scene?
1983.82-357,0,29211,janice_m_joyce_bartee,,310.234,314.806,I think it is a matter... There are many arsons which are never investigated.
1983.82-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,328.227,332.519,Do you mean because the owner of the premises was a police officer?
1983.82-357,0,29211,janice_m_joyce_bartee,,332.519,333.14,That is correct.
1983.82-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,333.14,334.389,I see.
1983.82-357,0,29211,janice_m_joyce_bartee,,341.083,343.026,That is correct.
1983.82-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,343.026,348.44,"But, that might be suspected that somebody is after a policeman."
1983.82-357,0,29211,janice_m_joyce_bartee,,348.44,349.95,That is correct.
1983.82-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,351.041,360.728,"So, there is always some thread of suspicious circumstances present in the cases that the arson squad investigates."
1983.82-357,0,29211,janice_m_joyce_bartee,,360.728,361.968,"--Well, there may be."
1983.82-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,371.294,374.606,I want to pursue Justice O'Connor's question.
1983.82-357,0,29211,janice_m_joyce_bartee,,385.435,400.534,"--Those that have no suspicious circumstances, those for which there is not a high likelihood of rekindling, those for which the cause and origin is determined definitely, those that they can get to."
1983.82-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,401.573,408.709,What about the case where they think it has been definitely determined that it is arson?
1983.82-357,0,29211,janice_m_joyce_bartee,,412.092,420.547,--What the firefighters do themselves in the City of Detroit is they make a preliminary determination without further investigation.
1983.82-357,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,430.004,441.281,"--When the investigator arrived there, there were still some of the post-arson, post-fire activity going on, was there not?"
1983.82-357,0,29211,janice_m_joyce_bartee,,441.281,442.222,"Yes, there was."
1983.82-357,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,442.222,446.874,They were still boarding up the windows and pumping water out of the basement and cleaning up debris?
1983.82-357,0,29211,janice_m_joyce_bartee,,446.874,448.156,That is correct.
1983.82-357,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,448.156,455.179,"Following through on the other questions, wasn't there a formal report to the arson squad in this case?"
1983.82-357,0,29211,janice_m_joyce_bartee,,455.179,459.904,"I believe there was some indication of that in the record, but that was not accurate."
1983.82-357,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,477.105,478.554,"Now, does the record show that?"
1983.82-357,0,29211,janice_m_joyce_bartee,,478.554,480.925,"No, it does not."
1983.82-357,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,480.925,483.368,How are we to accept it then?
1983.82-357,0,29211,janice_m_joyce_bartee,,483.368,487.83,I believe that the record indicates... It does not indicate anything specifically.
1983.82-357,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,558.286,564.471,"But, you can't extend a border search to an arson investigation, can you?"
1983.82-357,0,29211,janice_m_joyce_bartee,,564.471,571.616,I would like to analogize the border situation to the fire situation in that there is no greater threat to the lives--
1983.82-357,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,571.616,574.898,"Well, the border one is limited to a border."
1983.82-357,0,29211,janice_m_joyce_bartee,,574.898,580.181,--The fire situation would be limited to those instances where a fire occurs.
1983.82-357,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,580.181,585.104,"Well, one is oranges and one is apples or stones."
1983.82-357,0,29211,janice_m_joyce_bartee,,585.104,597.773,"My only analogy would go to the extent that if probable cause does exist for the border situation, the independent justification for the search, which is the border search, requires no warrant."
1983.82-357,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,619.408,648.507,"I take it from the position you have suggested that if the men who were working to pump out the excess water out of the basement found some incriminating evidence, that that would be admissible as part of the whole process of extinguishing the fire and restoring safe conditions."
1983.82-357,0,29211,janice_m_joyce_bartee,,648.507,667.898,"The people that were on the premises were not government officials, but I believe if that was... Those were insurance people, I believe, and if that evidence... Once that evidence was left there in the basement, I believe that should be admissible evidence as part of that first initial investigative entry."
1983.82-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,671.251,675.134,May I ask you another question as long as you are interrupted?
1983.82-357,0,29211,janice_m_joyce_bartee,,701.281,709.586,"--Absolutely not, because I think what I would have to have is that the person who finds this evidence is validly on the premises."
1983.82-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,730.86,745.259,"Mrs. Bartee, when you advance those justification, does it really differ much, your theory, from the question posed to you by Justice O'Connor that it could come within the exigent circumstances, etcetera in Clifford?"
1983.82-357,0,29211,janice_m_joyce_bartee,,745.259,757.618,"Well, we would urge this Court to first reach the constitutional question and that is does a fire investigation require a warrant?"
1983.82-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,771.796,778.792,"But, you must realize you have a fairly strong laboring ore to bear with the Court having decided the Clifford case."
1983.82-357,0,29211,janice_m_joyce_bartee,,793.863,796.163,I believe that the Clifford--
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1930.574,1941.119,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-357,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2044.55,2051.993,"Now, some of the questions, Mr. Oade... We are getting back to fundamentals about the Fourth Amendment."
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2056.707,2062.732,"I think this case illustrates very well, Mr. Chief Justice, the purpose of the Fourth Amendment."
1983.82-357,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2062.732,2065.133,"Well, without the merits of this case, what is the broad purpose?"
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2066.933,2067.985,That is correct.
1983.82-357,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2067.985,2083.997,"Now, in this place they had anywhere from six to a dozen firemen filing around the place for many, many hours, and carpenters and whoever the people were manning the water pumps."
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2090.478,2101.565,"Mr. Chief Justice, the firefighters had a duty to fight that fire and they had a duty to extinguish that fire and they had a duty to ensure that that fire was put out."
1983.82-357,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2129.604,2148.197,"What if the firefighters had discovered, in the process of their work while the fire was still going on, bales of marijuana or kegs of heroin and that sort of thing?"
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2149.467,2154.472,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think that I can fairly concede that that is within plain view."
1983.82-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2244.72,2246.791,Is that different than the officers in Tyler?
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2246.791,2251.044,I think it is very different in this sense.
1983.82-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2267.474,2271.418,I meant as to their official duties and the powers and so forth.
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2278.714,2293.652,"I am not sure, Justice Rehnquist, whether they had the power to arrest or not, but I think that this Court has distinguished between administrative and criminal searches based on the objects and intrusiveness of the search."
1983.82-357,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2321.51,2324.232,Was all of that in evidence?
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2324.232,2328.486,This is part of the evidence that we are seeking to suppress.
1983.82-357,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2356.082,2358.884,Is that report in evidence?
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2358.884,2360.977,"Yes, I believe it is."
1983.82-357,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2360.977,2363.589,Because it certainly is not in the Joint Appendix.
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2363.589,2373.713,It is not in the Joint Appendix and we had some confusion in putting the Joint Appendix together as far as counsel contacting me and asking me what we wanted in there.
1983.82-357,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2384.311,2389.614,Are you representing that it was received in evidence in the case?
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2389.614,2391.016,This investigator's report?
1983.82-357,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2391.016,2391.425,Yes.
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2391.425,2391.936,No.
1983.82-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2404.184,2406.037,Mr.... Go ahead.
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2406.765,2407.867,It is not.
1983.82-357,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2407.867,2409.838,Or it is not before us.
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2409.838,2414.729,It has not been marked as an exhibit and put in for identification.
1983.82-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2429.63,2451.305,"Mr. Oade, to get back for a moment to the similarities or dissimilarities between the officers in your case and in Tyler, reading from page 502 of 436 US, the Court's opinion in Tyler, the first person to arrive was Chief See, who I take it was the Fire Chief, and then at 3:30 A.M. he called Police Detective Webb."
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2465.603,2471.267,"Well, I don't believe it is entirely foreclosed, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2471.267,2471.948,Why not?
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2471.948,2476.5,"And, the reason I don't is because of the scope of the search itself in this case."
1983.82-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2484.236,2488.628,"But, you are talking... It may be differentiated on the scope of the search."
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2494.592,2500.896,"I wanted to make it clear to the Court, because I am maintaining that this is a criminal investigation."
1983.82-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2500.896,2507.962,"But, if Detective Webb was involved in Tyler, there is certainly every presumption there was a criminal investigation in Tyler too."
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2507.962,2514.046,I think there was certainly a criminal investigator present.
1983.82-357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2537.531,2543.946,"Mr. Oade, every time you discover evidence of arson, it becomes the fruits of a crime, doesn't it?"
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2543.946,2545.096,"--It does, but--"
1983.82-357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2545.096,2555.944,"So you would just say there can never be an arson investigation under any circumstances, that the exigent circumstances would never allow that, is that your position?"
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2555.944,2557.484,"--No, that is not my position."
1983.82-357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2558.345,2566.24,"Well, if the officers were there at the time the firefighters were there, would you think they could have conducted this same search?"
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2566.24,2568.661,"--No, they could not."
1983.82-357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2596.8,2606.545,"But, don't you concede under Tyler, if they had been there when the firefighters were there, that that much would have authorized them to make the search they did?"
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2606.545,2608.338,It would not have authorized--
1983.82-357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2608.338,2611.591,You are asking us to overrule Tyler in another way then.
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2612.359,2612.84,"--No, I am not."
1983.82-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2638.497,2641.908,"And, under Tyler they would have had a right to call a police detective too."
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2641.908,2643.51,--They would have had a right to call a police detective.
1983.82-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2665.733,2670.648,Would you say the evidence of only old clothes in the closet is not probative of arson?
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2670.648,2674.99,--I find the fact that is probative of arson irrelevant.
1983.82-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2695.244,2697.387,What if the fire had originated in the bedroom?
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2697.387,2698.105,--Pardon me?
1983.82-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2698.105,2700.308,What if the fire had originated in the bedroom?
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2700.308,2707.782,"Well, at least they would have an arguable case that they were confining their search to the less intrusive means."
1983.82-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2707.782,2712.787,"Well, you suggest it is only arguable that they could go into the bedroom if the fire had originated there?"
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2712.787,2727.974,"I am saying that it is clear to me, Justice Rehnquist, that the cause and origin of the fire had no relationship to whatever personal effects might have been present in my clients' bedroom."
1983.82-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2727.974,2739.441,"But, I asked you what if the cause of the fire had been found in the bedroom and you say, I believe that it is only arguable that the fire people could have gone into the bedroom, even though the cause of the fire was there."
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2739.441,2744.286,I will concede if the origin of the fire was in the bedroom they had a right to be present in the bedroom.
1983.82-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2766.07,2769.973,You mean in this case you wouldn't be here if they had limited their search to the basement?
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2769.973,2774.896,If they had gotten an administrative warrant and limited the search to the basement.
1983.82-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2774.896,2784.592,So you would be here if all they did was they entered without a warrant and went down the basement to verify the cause and origin of the fire.
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2791.157,2792.697,"Justice White, I think perhaps--"
1983.82-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2792.697,2798.391,"Can't... Yes, you would be here, you just wouldn't have as much to argue about?"
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2798.391,2799.292,--That is true.
1983.82-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2926.578,2929.439,"Mr. Oade, you have referred to administrative warrants several times."
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2935.344,2947.882,"I am not aware of any particular legislative standards, and in the absence of those standards, I think that it is incumbent--"
1983.82-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2947.882,2953.055,"So at the time of this incident, there wasn't such an animal that these people could have tried to get?"
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2953.055,2955.376,"--Oh, I believe they could have."
1983.82-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2977.581,2979.893,"Just a showing that there had been a fire, is that all they need?"
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2979.893,2984.535,"I think a showing that there has been a fire and it is of suspicious origin, that is correct."
1983.82-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2988.548,2998.454,"I know they had more, but there is no finding of probable cause here so I think we have to decide the case as though it presents a question that might arise when there is no probable cause."
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,2998.454,2999.535,--I think that is true.
1983.82-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3018.877,3019.808,I understand that.
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3035.508,3044.003,"I think they would have to... I think they should, according to Tyler, they would have to get an administrative warrant and the reason for that is--"
1983.82-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3044.003,3046.084,"Tyler doesn't talk about an administrative warrant, does it?"
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3053.029,3056.152,--Probable cause type of warrant.
1983.82-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3056.152,3058.953,I don't think Tyler even mentions administrative warrant.
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3058.953,3060.345,"Well, you might be correct."
1983.82-357,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3090.063,3094.016,Do you concede that a magistrate would have issued a warrant?
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3094.016,3101.621,I think in all likelihood a magistrate would have issued a probable cause warrant in this case.
1983.82-357,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3126.096,3135.974,"I suppose it would be a rare case where, in a suspected arson case, a probable cause warrant wouldn't arise, wouldn't issue."
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3135.974,3138.565,"I think that may be true, Justice Blackmun."
1983.82-357,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3138.565,3141.047,"This is totally irrelevant, but I am curious."
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3149.232,3151.913,"I am not aware of that, Justice Blackmun."
1983.82-357,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3172.907,3177.061,"So, there were other youngsters than the Cliffords' children?"
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3177.061,3178.811,That is correct.
1983.82-357,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3205.498,3222.749,"Well, if a magistrate had issued a warrant, as you seem to concede he would have or any judicial officer would have, arson being the subject of the inquiry, how do you think the search could be limited?"
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3229.915,3235.118,"I would agree with that, Mr. Chief Justice, and the fact is they did not get a warrant."
1983.82-357,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3236.38,3240.912,Let's just stay with the warrant would not be limited.
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3253.56,3256.492,"I am not sure that is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-357,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3280.469,3285.73,Do Michigan magistrates and judicial officers issue warrants seriatim?
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3285.73,3289.243,"Oh, I think absolutely."
1983.82-357,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3289.243,3290.094,Is that common practice?
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3290.094,3291.976,A magistrate has a duty to--
1983.82-357,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3291.976,3294.576,"Well, is that a common practice in Michigan?"
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3294.576,3296.727,"--It certainly happens, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-357,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3396.325,3399.166,"Is that the justification for getting a warrant, that there is time to get one?"
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3399.166,3408.52,I think that exigent circumstances certainly in Michigan is a need for an immediate search.
1983.82-357,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3461.635,3465.798,Maybe it was because there was six inches of water in the basement.
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3465.798,3473.523,"Well, they didn't know that, but even if they did, I don't see what significance that has to exigent circumstances."
1983.82-357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3480.899,3487.334,Wasn't the Michigan Court basing its ruling on this Court's holding in Michigan versus Tyler?
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3487.334,3491.164,"Well, I don't agree with that, Justice O'Connor, and I would like to--"
1983.82-357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3491.164,3493.307,At least that is what it said it was doing.
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3493.307,3509.417,"--It said that, but I would like to also take this opportunity to correct a misstatement in the reply brief of the petitioners where they say that we, in the lower court, did not raise any Michigan constitutional grounds."
1983.82-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3536.285,3553.468,"Suppose the people, the firemen come into a burning house and they put out the fire."
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3561.192,3561.913,I agree with that.
1983.82-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3561.913,3563.853,Even if it wasn't in plain sight.
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3563.853,3565.355,I agree with that also.
1983.82-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3565.355,3577.632,Suppose though as soon as the fire is out they get an emergency... the chief gets an emergency call from another terrific blaze down the street.
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3601.317,3602.79,I think that is correct.
1983.82-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3602.79,3603.501,Yes.
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3617.93,3619.94,I think that would be an exigent circumstance.
1983.82-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3627.536,3637.752,"Well, the justification for the search without a warrant or even just a search for evidence, even without any suspicion, the exigent circumstance is what?"
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3642.764,3645.816,"--I don't view, Justice White, that the exigent--"
1983.82-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3645.816,3647.619,"Well, you tell me what the exigent circumstance is."
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3662.329,3663.358,--I think that is--
1983.82-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3663.358,3664.9,What is the exigent circumstance?
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3664.9,3667.001,--There is no exigent circumstance.
1983.82-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3667.001,3668.624,"Well, why may he search around?"
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3668.624,3672.785,The exigent circumstance was the fact that there was a fire in the first place.
1983.82-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3672.785,3673.536,All right.
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3678.808,3681.16,"And, the firefighter has the duty to determine that."
1983.82-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3681.16,3682.712,Why does he have a duty?
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3686.615,3687.264,It is in the public interest.
1983.82-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3687.264,3689.527,And for him to discharge that duty without a warrant.
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3689.527,3693.168,I think this Court said that in Tyler.
1983.82-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3698.423,3705.085,"Yes, but you just agreed with me that to discharge that duty he doesn't have to stay on the premises."
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3705.085,3710.05,--You posited a situation where some exigent circumstance called him away.
1983.82-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3710.05,3711.631,"Well, there may be a lot of others."
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3711.631,3720.045,"And, one of those others was in Tyler where there was smoke and steam and the firefighters could not perform that public duty and because--"
1983.82-357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3720.045,3721.927,And here there was water in the basement.
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3721.927,3736.297,"--But that had nothing to do with the fact of an exigent circumstance, because who came back were not firefighters and that gets to my earlier point."
1983.82-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3797.887,3811.014,If the arson squad investigators had just happened to show up during the fire and entered... And the fire was out and they entered the building just when the fire was going out.
1983.82-357,1,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,3818.671,3819.241,I would say a limited search.
1983.82-357,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3836.112,3837.584,"Thank you, counsel."
