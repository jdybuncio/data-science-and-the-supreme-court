1971.71-300,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,229.383,233.538,It's definitely -- what would be the measure of damages in the lawsuit?
1971.71-300,0,15922,andrew_w_estes,,233.538,238.02,"I think there would be several things, sir, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1971.71-300,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,248.144,253.435,"Then I gather this -- the crux of the liability would be wrongful discharge, is that it?"
1971.71-300,0,15922,andrew_w_estes,,253.435,256.789,"That's right, Your Honor, under a common law theory."

1971.71-300,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,294.708,302.471,"But in your lawsuit, you'd be asking for damages -- well would you specify that again?"
1971.71-300,0,15922,andrew_w_estes,,302.471,321.762,"Well, general damages being, the measure of damages, of course, we would look to the current trend, see what his wages would have been had he been employed, and what wages he has earned, the difference being the measure of damages that would be retrospective and in post factor, of course it would be a jury question to determine what his future damages might be."

1971.71-300,0,15922,andrew_w_estes,,385.563,388.68,"Mr. Justice White, I think that's a very difficult question."

1971.71-300,0,15922,andrew_w_estes,,417.439,417.775,That's right.

1971.71-300,0,15922,andrew_w_estes,,490.796,491.444,They are mooted --
1971.71-300,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,491.444,493.633,There have been a lot of these types of cases before?
1971.71-300,0,15922,andrew_w_estes,,493.633,497.436,"Yes, Your Honor, there is one case, it's very critical."
1971.71-300,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,505.892,507.451,That's one I wrote?
1971.71-300,0,15922,andrew_w_estes,,507.451,508.168,I believe so.
1971.71-300,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,602.304,605.888,Did you call this an election of remedies case?
1971.71-300,0,15922,andrew_w_estes,,605.888,609.687,I think it is now because of the Price case Mr. Chief Justice.

1971.71-300,0,15922,andrew_w_estes,,788.416,793.912,"Well even less, say four years or in some places one-and-a-half years."
1971.71-300,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,816.008,827.603,"How exactly -- under the amended statute unlike the situation of the time Price was decided, is it they are now a judicial review of that, both ways?"
1971.71-300,0,15922,andrew_w_estes,,838.345,838.791,"That is right, Your Honor."
1971.71-300,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,838.791,846.342,"But now under the new statute there is a judicial review, is it there, both the employee as well the railroad may have it?"

1971.71-300,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,859.52,866.868,But we said in Price there was no judicial review at all on the part of -- available to the employee?
1971.71-300,0,15922,andrew_w_estes,,866.868,867.936,Perhaps you did Mr. Justice --
1971.71-300,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,867.936,869.624,But now there is some at least whatever --

1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,1432.323,1449.99,"And in those committee hearings, a member named George M. Harrison, who probably had as many credentials as a union may have, he was president of the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employees and appeared as chairman of the legislative committee of the Railway Labor Association, he said this in substance."

1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,1622.473,1624.947,"He does indeed, Mr. Justice Douglas."
1971.71-300,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1624.947,1627.664,He had to go through the Union?
1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,1627.664,1631.721,"If my understanding of the Act is correct, he has an absolute right to go himself."
1971.71-300,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1635.195,1646.975,"No, but in terms of Section 3 (2) says that the request either made by the representative of proctor class of employee or by the carrier?"
1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,1646.975,1649.853,It is my impression that the 66th Amendment of the Act --
1971.71-300,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1649.853,1654.776,I am reading the 66th Amendment.
1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,1662.266,1680.242,"Reading 'J' of this Section, it says parties maybe heard even in person by Council or by other representative as they may respectively elect and I would assume that means if a party can be heard in person, a party means an individual rather than the Union, I would guess."
1971.71-300,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1680.242,1693.686,"But as I read Section 3 (2), the Amendment of 1966, it receives complaints only by Unions or by carriers?"
1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,1693.686,1707.037,"Mr. Justice Douglas, if that is true then my conception of the Railway Labor Act or my dispute is erroneous because it was my definite impression that not only could it be done, but it was being done daily before the Adjustment Board."
1971.71-300,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1707.037,1727.525,"But I just wondered how a Union normally would be the spokesman, if they are reading statement taking care of the interest of the employee in the future, but if the employee wants to put this thing behind him and get out of the business and never go back and work again than the Union is might not be a very good representative of him?"
1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,1727.525,1731.377,That is always of course a possibility Mr. Justice Douglas.
1971.71-300,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1854.147,1865.734,"Well what happens if both the Brotherhood and Management, both decide that this man is ought to be thrown out of his job?"
1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,1865.734,1876.331,Well he has a contract that probably -- the Brotherhood I wouldn't think would have anymore right to throw him out of the job and then would the Union.
1971.71-300,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1880.582,1887.54,It has always worked and in fact in some instances where man is just is not loved by anybody?
1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,1887.54,1893.622,"You mean, he gets double crossed by his own Union, is that what you are referring to?"
1971.71-300,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1895.071,1899.286,I imagine Congress has figured that would be the exception rather than the rule?
1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,1899.286,1915.172,"There is no prohibition against him suing his own Union obviously and secondly I don't think that again there is any problem in that regard because if he has a contract right, the Adjustment Board can give him just the same relief as the Court can."
1971.71-300,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1915.172,1919.769,And Union can't violate the contract just to take care of the guy they don't like?
1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,1919.769,1924.769,I would not believe they could Mr. Justice Marshall.
1971.71-300,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2093.434,2116.602,"Now if I may ask you, assume a railroad worker has a grievance under the contract and they try to settle it on the property and just didn't settlement and neither side takes it to the Adjustment Board, that isn’t -- the only way it gets to the Adjustment Board is if somebody takes it there?"
1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,2116.602,2116.997,Yes sir.
1971.71-300,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2126.31,2133.543,"What I really am asking, may the railroad and the worker together waive the Adjustment Board?"
1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,2133.543,2138.523,Worker and the Railroad together may enter into a settlement of problems --
1971.71-300,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2138.523,2150.674,"Yeah but they don't settle it, but the Railroad says but we don't want to go to the Adjustment Board, you don't want to go to the Adjustment Board, go to Court, we will settle it in the Court."
1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,2150.674,2161.816,Your question Mr. Justice White is broader in that your question is may the parties in a situation where administrative exhaustion of remedies is required maybe they waive the exhaustion of administrative remedies?
1971.71-300,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2161.816,2174.865,"No, exhaustion administrative remedies required, all the Act says is that somebody can it take it to the board and if somebody takes it the Board, the other party is got to go there too."
1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,2174.865,2179.849,"Mr. Justice White I'm not sure I'm perceiving your question, but let me express it this way."
1971.71-300,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2218.031,2231.618,"If union refuses to go to go the board -- Mr. Justice Douglas was asking if the union refuses to go the board when the employer turns the grievance down, the worker can't go to Court, they can't go to the board."
1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,2233.658,2239.248,I am of the opinion that the individual himself can go the board and it is not depended on his union taking it there?
1971.71-300,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2239.248,2243.49,That is what the statute says and in your brief instead it’s just the opposite.
1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,2243.49,2244.09,I was --
1971.71-300,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2244.09,2245.991,Employee representative can go --
1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,2245.991,2257.901,I thought that the Public law boards were limited to the union but I was always of the impression that the board itself was open to an individual without his union representatives and that my perception of the law.
1971.71-300,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2257.901,2265.89,"I have read somewhere in these briefs -- I've read them some time ago, but in the statistics it shows that there are several cases that have been filed by individuals, not by --"
1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,2265.89,2267.704,I am sure a public law board --
1971.71-300,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2267.704,2277.35,"[Voice Overlap] says the remedy, that's 1966 remedy was provided that either a carrier or employee representative would request to the other [Inaudible] to the special board."
1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,2277.35,2295.987,"Yes, that's a special board, that's a so called public law board, but that's not, that's where -- approaching one member and when I am approaching other member, that is public law board and Your Honor eminently correct that has to be done by the union representative, but to go with the adjustment board itself and one of the definite question, an individual can do without his union going with it."
1971.71-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2295.987,2299.216,"But, isn't the public law board that had speeded this thing up?"
1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,2299.216,2304.717,"Well, public law board was exactly created by the 66th Amendment for the purpose of speeding it up and they have speeded it up."
1971.71-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2304.717,2315.573,"So, if the only way an individual union man can go is not to the public law board, but to the adjustment board as a whole you might not get the benefit of the speedy treatment that was contemplated in 1966?"
1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,2315.573,2326.313,We think exactly he will get the speedy treatment because -- by reference to the table in our brief Your Honor will readily see that the adjustment boards don't have the backlog of cases they had.
1971.71-300,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2523.357,2526.384,And what's the employees feel now on the 66 act?
1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,2526.384,2528.115,Exactly the same as the Railroad is --
1971.71-300,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2528.115,2529.347,De novo?
1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,2529.347,2532.968,-- it is not the de novo Mr. Justice Brennan.
1971.71-300,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2541.647,2544.04,In another words you are treating the board pretty much as an arbitrator?
1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,2544.04,2546.827,"Yes, almost exactly on the question of arbitration yes."
1971.71-300,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2546.827,2551.469,And is that true on both sides that on the review – railroad review or an employee review.
1971.71-300,1,45695,william_h_major,,2551.469,2554.719,The review is equal on both sides and exactly in the same manner.
1971.71-300,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2577.676,2579.183,"Thank you, Mr. Major."
1971.71-300,2,15922,andrew_w_estes,,2581.322,2583.445,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.71-300,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2583.445,2589.111,[Voice Overlap] is that can an employee individually go to an Adjustment board?
1971.71-300,2,15922,andrew_w_estes,,2589.111,2596.559,"Your Honor it is my understanding that he cannot, but he can sue his Railroads for failure to do it, I believe there is Supreme Court case on this."
1971.71-300,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2596.559,2598.003,Is it union or the railroad?
1971.71-300,2,15922,andrew_w_estes,,2598.003,2608.542,"I think the employee once he is fired, once he is out in the court, I believe he can sue the union for its failure to adequately represent him and join --"
1971.71-300,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2608.542,2614.818,"Now, but suppose he wants to go to the adjustment board route, you mean he can't go unless the union will take his case?"
1971.71-300,2,15922,andrew_w_estes,,2614.818,2621.0,"Mr. Justice Brennan it’s my impression is that he cannot go himself, representing himself or through his counsel representing him."
1971.71-300,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2623.443,2626.819,Well that -- if that so then what's this case all about.
1971.71-300,2,15922,andrew_w_estes,,2629.174,2633.331,What this case is all about Your Honor --
1971.71-300,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2633.331,2641.424,What -- if he can't go with his grievances independently of his union does he have administrative remedy then?
1971.71-300,2,15922,andrew_w_estes,,2641.424,2645.453,"May it please Court, we have taken the position that he cannot."
1971.71-300,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2688.444,2690.379,Is that in the record or is this --
1971.71-300,2,15922,andrew_w_estes,,2690.379,2694.231,"There is no record judge, I am awfully sorry, There has been no discovery --"
1971.71-300,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2694.231,2705.556,"Well now the problem which seems to divide you gentlemen somewhat and I an inclined to say it's confusing to me is important one, something very easy to find out."
1971.71-300,2,15922,andrew_w_estes,,2730.228,2736.195,It might be dispositive in one respect Mr. Chief Justice.
