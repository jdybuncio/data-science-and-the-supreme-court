1970.89,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,47.643,We will hear arguments next in number 89 Lemon against Kurtzman and others.
1970.89,0,28029,henry_w_sawyer_iii,,50.928,56.257,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.89,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,206.604,208.755,State doesn’t prescribe the textbooks?
1970.89,0,28029,henry_w_sawyer_iii,,208.755,210.32,"No sir, they are submitted."
1970.89,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,210.32,211.162,Just as (Inaudible)
1970.89,0,28029,henry_w_sawyer_iii,,211.162,212.936,Yes sir.
1970.89,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,244.062,248.259,I'm not quite clear as to the detail of how this scheme works.
1970.89,0,28029,henry_w_sawyer_iii,,256.684,270.892,"They had like on a form, Your Honor, that says that the cost for teacher salaries, for teaching materials and for textbooks was such and such for teaching let’s say mathematics and then they submit that to the state and the state pays them the money."
1970.89,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,270.892,271.896,Well is there any order?
1970.89,0,28029,henry_w_sawyer_iii,,271.896,277.451,"Oh yes there’s an order, there's an order of whether or not—"
1970.89,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,277.451,280.713,"Well before the money is paid, what check is made on that?"
1970.89,0,28029,henry_w_sawyer_iii,,280.713,282.432,"See we don’t know Your Honor, we have no record."
1970.89,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,282.432,283.785,I see.
1970.89,0,28029,henry_w_sawyer_iii,,283.785,305.203,"We can only glean this from the statute because there's no record so we never found put how the state goes about these procedures, the crown of my appeal is that there should have been -- after all I'm here on an appeal from a motion to dismiss, the granting of motion to dismiss and I will be unable to inform you about a number of things because there isn’t any record."
1970.89,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,305.203,309.105,A motion to dismiss for what?
1970.89,0,28029,henry_w_sawyer_iii,,309.105,315.665,"Sir, a motion was made to dismiss the complaint for fair and a steady clause of action for a lack of a substantial federal question."
1970.89,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,315.665,316.976,Was there summary judgment?
1970.89,0,28029,henry_w_sawyer_iii,,316.976,334.464,"No sir and unlike Allen, it’s not an Allen situation where both sides cross move for summary judgment after answering and nothing happened in this case except the complaint was filed and the complaint was dismissed on motion but one justice descending."
1970.89,1,29511,j_shane_creamer,,1891.609,1894.644,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1970.89,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1988.639,2004.696,"Then you tend to agree with Mr. Sawyer’s point if this Act, the orientation, the genesis of this Act was to aid distress situation in the private schools of Pennsylvania."
1970.89,1,29511,j_shane_creamer,,2004.696,2010.14,"The crisis in education and paying for education Your Honor, yes."
1970.89,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2014.716,2017.202,Mr. Ball?
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2017.202,2021.195,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2440.182,2441.767,Where is it published?
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2441.767,2442.315,Pardon me sir?
1970.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2442.315,2444.456,"Where is it printed, the Act?"
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2444.456,2456.376,"The act is printed Your Honor, appendix A18."
1970.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2456.376,2458.341,That’s all of it?
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2458.341,2458.875,Pardon me sir.
1970.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2458.875,2460.213,That’s all of it?
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2460.213,2472.803,"Yes sir that’s all there is of the Act, except for the Cigarette Tax Amendment Your Honor, to which our brief referred on page and footnote 2 which simply changed the basis of the funding."
1970.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2472.803,2476.347,You mean they're making the cigarette (Inaudible)
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2476.347,2479.112,"Yes Your Honor, that’s right, that’s right."
1970.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2479.112,2480.861,Any addition to the horse race funds?
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2480.861,2484.518,"No Your Honor, in substitution for the horse racing finds."
1970.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2484.518,2490.769,Oh I see.
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2490.769,2502.896,"This Act represents one state’s effort to grapple with a serious social problem which it’s faced, like a number of other states that face the same problem."
1970.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2555.28,2558.112,Would that affect its constitutionality?
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2558.112,2560.44,"It would in Pennsylvania, Your Honor."
1970.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2561.114,2563.055,Would that affect the federal constitution?
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2563.055,2566.472,I do not think so that this is a question that could be answered.
1970.89,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2607.659,2613.218,"Well, what the state has ascertained that the school has paid for such instruction, what does that mean?"
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2613.218,2622.845,"That means that the school will have presented to the state, Your Honor a claim containing three elements of cost."
1970.89,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2656.974,2658.254,Now what does audit mean?
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2658.254,2668.45,Audit means that the state uses the procedures it would use in the case of the public schools and it audits the accounts that relate to these three items of expense.
1970.89,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2669.915,2679.648,What inquiry is made whether in fact these three items of expense do or do not involve any religious instructions?
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2679.648,2683.203,"The audit doesn’t relate to this, Your Honor."
1970.89,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2708.828,2713.142,"Now, the teachers include whom?"
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2713.142,2719.87,Teachers include persons who are employed by the school to teach in the schools.
1970.89,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2719.87,2720.883,May they be nuns?
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2720.883,2722.243,Indeed they may Your Honor.
1970.89,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2722.243,2722.788,They may be.
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2722.788,2725.782,"Indeed they may, yes, indeed."
1970.89,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2725.782,2730.174,Do these inspections contemplate on the inquiry into --
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2730.174,2735.412,"There is no inspection provided for in the Act, Your Honor other than audit."
1970.89,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2737.369,2739.412,Would you be concerned?
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2739.412,2740.173,Would I be concerned?
1970.89,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2740.173,2747.514,"If there were a inquiry into what a particular nun did or whose expense, reimbursement or so?"
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2747.514,2752.363,I would be concerned with respect to her performance in terms of quality.
1970.89,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2752.363,2759.211,I'm wondering if you’d be concerned as to that kind of inspection of member of a religious --
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2759.211,2761.538,Yes I think I would be certainly.
1970.89,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2761.538,2762.5,On what school?
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2762.5,2766.953,I would be concerned with it in a public school as well as in a private school.
1970.89,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2796.944,2802.914,"Suppose you found a fact that they did not, like from whatever source you learned that, then what would happen?"
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2802.914,2821.834,"If the state found that this neutrality was not observed, that this provision of the Act which says that there may be no introduction of religious teaching in the four relatively non-value related courses in question, then the state, if I may finish my sentence Your Honor."
1970.89,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2821.834,2823.145,"Yes, please."
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2823.145,2826.637,Then the state would not be able to pay.
1970.89,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2828.583,2840.162,"Well doesn’t, there hasn’t of that kind of inspection, that kind of inquiry, doesn’t that get the government officials into inquiries into religion that --"
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2840.162,2849.941,"Well Your Honor the problem I have with your question is that I do not know of any inspection, any monitoring that takes place of the instruction."
1970.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2967.17,2969.326,Who employs these teachers?
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2969.326,2977.733,"The non-public school employs the teacher, the non-public schools in Pennsylvania are Catholic, they are Protestant, they are Jewish, they are non-sectarian, etcetera."
1970.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2977.733,2980.903,Who employs the teachers for these particular schools?
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2980.903,2982.434,The school employs the teachers.
1970.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2982.434,2984.022,(Inaudible)
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2984.022,2985.674,"The school, in the case --"
1970.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2985.674,2990.284,Who runs the schools?
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2990.284,2993.028,"It depends upon the school in question, Your Honor."
1970.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2993.028,2993.442,What?
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,2993.442,3007.754,"It depends upon the school in question, since there has been no application attack on this Act, we don’t have, though there could be made an application attack on this Act, we do not have a particular instance of a particular school."
1970.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3009.078,3012.354,But suppose they have been controlled by the church that runs --
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,3012.354,3013.947,They may be and indeed many schools are.
1970.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3013.947,3017.339,"(Voice Overlap) they are, not maybe."
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,3017.339,3021.137,"No, I represent for example Akiba Academy."
1970.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3024.983,3027.331,Is it a Catholic school?
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,3027.331,3033.142,"Before speaking of catholic schools, they are controlled by the church, yes."
1970.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3033.142,3036.431,And the contribution goes to the Catholic schools?
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,3036.431,3038.496,"There is not a contribution, Your Honor if I may say."
1970.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3038.496,3039.965,Whatever you call it.
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,3039.965,3043.599,Well I do call it something different Your Honor.
1970.89,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3149.436,3152.636,"Mr. Ball, help me along at this point."
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,3184.008,3198.624,"Well, I have two answers for that Your Honor, first of all, if it does, then also this happens in Medicare with Methodist, Catholic, Jewish in physical hospitals and so on. Second, because these are run by religious institutions."
1970.89,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3258.094,3266.191,To what extent is it plowed in if it knows it's going to be reimbursed?
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,3266.191,3277.443,"If it knows it's going to be reimbursed, if it's going to meet the test that the state has required, it will have satisfied the standardized testing requirement and the audit requirement."
1970.89,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3340.065,3355.641,This is the problem for the large dimensions – we have indicated in some of the cases from the south that where the state finances a private school becomes a state agency.
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,3362.333,3362.994,Yes Your Honor.
1970.89,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3362.994,3365.916,Now applies to this school.
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,3374.083,3413.361,"Well Your Honor, it was up to the plaintiffs of course to frame their complaint as they would bring to bear the parties whom they would and had they had Equal Protection standing, had they a single plaintiff, one individual or anybody who had Equal Protection standing, indeed we would be prepared to argue the Equal Protection issue here today, but since you inquire, Your Honor, with respect to state action and whether these schools would be participating in state action by virtue of the fact that they receive some funding from the state, I think would be a question of degree, I would say it's a question, it is a question."
1970.89,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3438.962,3445.066,So a Black could get into one of these Catholic schools even though he wasn’t a Catholic?
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,3445.066,3448.448,Oh indeed a Black could get into one of these Catholic schools if he were not a Catholic.
1970.89,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3451.232,3452.369,An agnostic?
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,3452.369,3453.393,"Oh heavens, yes."
1970.89,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3454.603,3456.009,Any Black could get in there?
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,3456.009,3479.575,"A Black Agnostic to Black Protestant to Black Catholic, we have schools, Your Honor in the inner city of Philadelphia which have been the tie together of racially mixed neighborhoods over the decades and which are to a substantial extent made up of protestant Blacks, who after graduation become alumni Black Protestants."
1970.89,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3479.575,3492.602,I know a lot of Presbyterian and our Presbyterian schools always welcomes a chance to get a Catholic and work him over.
1970.89,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3492.602,3497.195,Mr. Ball let me get back to one question and I’ll stop.
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,3511.721,3513.402,"Every difference, Your Honor."
1970.89,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3513.402,3517.986,"How, the schools end up financially exactly the same way?"
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,3517.986,3530.104,"Well, to begin with under this Act, the state cannot pay for a religious textbook and under the constitution they cannot pay for religious instructional materials and under the constitution."
1970.89,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3579.864,3595.148,"Well, except that the school is using its other dollars for what is not replaced by the State Act, would not result identically the same, is it not so?"
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,3595.148,3613.19,"If the state were to pay the school, $800.00 for the teaching of religion, and then the financial result would be the same, yes Your Honor, the financial result would be the same."
1970.89,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3645.008,3654.361,"Well, there to say that the difference in Allen was that the parents there to for had been paying for the books."
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,3654.361,3666.014,"Well this is what he said, I don’t think this is true on the record in Allen, I think in some situations they were and in some situations they were not."
1970.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3667.892,3669.032,I would like to ask you one question.
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,3669.032,3670.381,Yes Your Honor.
1970.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3670.381,3674.34,I asked you something along that line a while ago.
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,3701.725,3708.248,"If I understand your question correctly, are there religious schools in which those who control the school hire and discharge the teacher?"
1970.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3708.248,3709.829,"That’s right, not the state."
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,3709.829,3710.5,"Yes, undeniably sir."
1970.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3710.5,3712.135,The state has nothing to do with it.
1970.89,2,43859,william_b_ball,,3712.135,3724.792,"Yes I cannot say as to these seven schools which are the only defendants in this case but looking to your question which perhaps relates to facial constitutionality, yes I would be sure that would be so. May I conclude Your Honor?"
1970.89,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3846.254,3852.153,"Thank you Mr. Ball, Thank you Mr. Sawyer, Mr. Attorney General, the case is submitted."
1970.89,3,18662,charles_f_cottam,,3897.229,3920.42,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of this honorable Court, if it please the Court, I will open and present the case numbered 570 and will be followed by Mr. Williams who will present 569."
1970.89,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4112.313,4113.612,That is the individual teacher.
1970.89,3,18662,charles_f_cottam,,4113.612,4116.544,"The individual teacher, Your Honor."
1970.89,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4166.349,4169.95,What check is made on the teacher’s representations?
1970.89,3,18662,charles_f_cottam,,4169.95,4172.506,"There’s no check, there is a statement signed, Your Honor."
1970.89,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4172.506,4181.899,"And just on the basis of the signed statement, if the signed statement contains the information would satisfy the provisions of the statute, then the (Voice Overlap)"
1970.89,3,18662,charles_f_cottam,,4181.899,4184.971,That's all is required.

1970.89,3,18662,charles_f_cottam,,4192.026,4213.771,"It’s 15% of the salary that the teacher has contracted for and there’s a limitation, that salary then including the supplement must not exceed the average maximum pay to a teacher in a public school system of our state."
1970.89,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4213.771,4215.566,For that teaching that grade and that subject?
1970.89,3,18662,charles_f_cottam,,4215.566,4218.171,"Yes, Your Honor."

1970.89,3,18662,charles_f_cottam,,4235.164,4239.799,"No, it does not Your Honor."
1970.89,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4239.799,4247.185,Would it be a an offense of any kind to present a false certificate under other statutes?
1970.89,3,18662,charles_f_cottam,,4247.185,4249.51,"As I recall, it was not a sworn statement."
1970.89,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4260.226,4262.089,And it will be the only sanctions?
1970.89,3,18662,charles_f_cottam,,4262.089,4275.393,"Yes, Your Honor, unless the state itself could prove a damage claim for misrepresentation which under Rhode Island Law would mean you’d have to prove a preexisting intent."

1970.89,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4409.27,4410.999,Out of how many?
1970.89,3,18662,charles_f_cottam,,4410.999,4425.195,"Out of approximately 45,000, roughly 66% that comes from you will notice in the legislative findings that refer to roughly to 45,000 as being educated in nonpublic schools."

1970.89,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4534.867,4541.928,I think we’ll suspend now for lunch.
1970.89,3,18662,charles_f_cottam,,4541.928,4545.482,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.89,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4565.983,4566.776,A general statute?

1970.89,3,18662,charles_f_cottam,,4751.108,4752.384,With what decision Your Honor?
1970.89,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4752.384,4758.269,"In the Pennsylvania case, the one that was argued just before this one."
1970.89,3,18662,charles_f_cottam,,4758.269,4762.768,"Well, I think, it’s entirely -- no, it’s not entirely different."
1970.89,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4804.022,4808.684,You’re making the same crisis argument that Mr. Ball made in the other case.
1970.89,3,18662,charles_f_cottam,,4808.684,4809.413,Yes Your Honor.
1970.89,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4809.413,4819.475,"And I infer from that because that these acts were enacted in crisis, that they are therefore constitutionally your argument?"
1970.89,3,18662,charles_f_cottam,,4819.475,4829.27,"No, Your Honor, I don’t argue constitutionality based on crisis, but in one of the questions you asked Mr. ball this morning, I would like to respond."
1970.89,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4843.429,4852.378,"Of course in your case, the replacement dollar argument I take it is not available to the other side because this is a supplement."
1970.89,3,18662,charles_f_cottam,,4855.074,4857.093,"Well, it’s not substantially different Your Honor."
1970.89,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4877.395,4877.958,Mr. Williams.
1970.89,4,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,4877.958,4880.618,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.89,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5614.467,5626.116,"Did I understand you to say at the outside of your argument, Mr. Williams, that the Catholic Sisters, nuns would not be eligible for this?"
1970.89,4,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,5626.116,5632.448,They couldn’t be Mr. Justice because the record shows they make $1800.00 a year.
1970.89,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5709.348,5714.579,"That its per pupil expenditure for all purposes, not just for teacher’s salaries?"

1970.89,4,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,5716.741,5721.278,Yes (Voice Overlap).
1970.89,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5721.278,5724.041,Do nuns take a vow of poverty?
1970.89,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5724.041,5725.473,Because it depend upon the order?
1970.89,4,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,5725.473,5728.627,It depends upon the order to which they belong.
1970.89,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5736.551,5740.97,"I was wondering what these teaching sisters did with the $1,800.00."
1970.89,4,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,5740.97,5746.587,"I guess, $1,800.00 probably as just walking around money at these days Mr. Justice [Laughter]"
1970.89,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5746.587,5748.478,Even on a a convent?
1970.89,4,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,5748.478,5760.815,"Well, I think that they are allowed to leave the convent but I don’t think they can go very far at $1,800.00 at these -- [Laughter], but that’s the maximum that they’re paid under the Rhode Island school system."
1970.89,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5765.121,5779.645,"In all of these cases that you referred to or at least in all the recent ones, is it not correct that the court has expressed the views that this is matter of degree, the entanglement or the involvement or the potential for it?"
1970.89,4,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,5779.645,5790.835,"I think that this was expressed and articulated clearly, perhaps for the first time in Walz against the Tax Commission."
1970.89,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5991.147,6007.676,"Would you, does this record show the extent of the surveillance of private schools in Rhode Island, to determine whether the hours in the curriculum and the teachers meet the standards prescribed by the state?"
1970.89,4,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,6009.516,6015.65,"That statutes of Rhode Island cover this, Mr. Chief Justice."
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,6287.754,6292.109,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.89,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6365.154,6389.148,"So like Mr. Pfeffer, that the if it can be called surveillance, the supervision or the overseeing which every state exercises over all of the schools in the state to see that they are meeting the minimum standards, it's always a factor that has been hovering over all private schools, isn’t that too?"
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,6389.148,6391.011,It is indeed.
1970.89,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6391.011,6409.031,Do you think that the surveillance necessary to check the compliance of the parochial school under the Rhode Islands statute is a greater degree of involvement in determining whether the teachers are properly accredited and all that sort of thing?
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,6409.031,6409.853,I certainly do.
1970.89,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6573.835,6581.478,What about the public school laws that say that religion cannot be taught in the public schools?
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,6581.478,6593.847,"Mr. Justice White, the answer to that, the one short answer to that is, that the First Amendment does not forbid a state to police its own schools."
1970.89,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6601.202,6611.595,"But what about the teacher though, says you’re transgressing the First Amendment, my First Amendments right and you’re purporting to say that I’m teaching religion and you’re supposed to keep your nose on that."
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,6611.595,6623.15,"That teacher is a public employee and must abide by the constitution of the United States which says a public employee in the schools may not teach religion, may not indoctrinate religion."
1970.89,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6624.996,6631.87,So you’re saying that it’s inherent in the First Amendment that the state must in all sorts of context decide what religion is?
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,6631.87,6637.023,It must only to the extent of not allowing public employees to do it.
1970.89,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6637.023,6642.774,"Well, anyway the state does it all the time. I mean, decides what religion is."
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,6642.774,6651.504,It decides what religion is to the extent only of forbidding transgression of religion into the public school.
1970.89,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6666.938,6681.675,What does a court do when it’s called upon in a case like this or like the others when it makes the judgement that the school is -- or the activity or the facility sectarian rather than secular?
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,6685.068,6699.743,It makes a comparable decision only in the sense that it determines whether that teacher in a public school is fulfilling the secular program of the school.
1970.89,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6989.183,7001.245,"I take it that Rhode Island does not tax but he ad valorem real estate tax, the buildings of the parochial schools, is that correct?"
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,7001.245,7005.952,"I would assume so, there's nothing in the record to that affect, but I think that can be assumed."
1970.89,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7005.952,7013.305,"Do not most of your arguments or many of your arguments have the same force, with respect to that exemption?"
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,7013.305,7016.536,No sir.
1970.89,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7019.5,7025.885,"I was speaking of your aid argument in particular, at large aid isn’t it?"
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,7025.885,7034.0,"I'm not basing my case on aid, I'm basing my case on subsidy, on financing, not aids."
1970.89,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7109.224,7128.777,"Mr. Pfeffer, can't you rolls out as the law giving all schools ground and equipment to setup playgrounds of a 100,000 each."
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,7128.777,7132.628,"And it's used to be use for ground purposes of playground, and—"
1970.89,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7132.628,7137.497,"The whole playground and paid for its up keeping, everything."
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,7137.497,7139.739,As part of the parochial school.
1970.89,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7139.739,7140.353,"No, no (Voice Overlap)."
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,7140.353,7143.315,"Mr. Justice Marshall, the reason I am unable to answer the question -- (Voice Overlap)."
1970.89,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7143.315,7155.92,"They all said, did enacted that schools are in so bad shape, and we’re going to give recreational center and a playground for every school in Rhode Island with more than 25 children."
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,7155.92,7158.537,"Of all including (Voice Overlap), your respect Your Honor."
1970.89,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7161.763,7162.467,Why?
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,7162.467,7172.572,"Because the purpose of a parochial school, and the record shows is not to provide children with playgrounds."
1970.89,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7183.205,7188.686,Is there anything in the Rhode Island law that says that a public school can have recreation facilities?
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,7188.686,7189.862,That a public school cannot have?
1970.89,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7189.862,7190.404,Yes.
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,7190.404,7191.389,Of course it doesn't have such kind of --
1970.89,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7191.389,7192.43,That’s right.
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,7195.83,7197.539,"Except, Mr. Justice Marshall—"
1970.89,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7197.539,7204.083,"Well, let's move from playground across the street."
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,7204.083,7207.614,"Well, my answer to that is, if the playground in an --(Voice Overlap)"
1970.89,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7207.614,7218.617,"It's called the same (Inaudible) Catholic school, public playground, formed by, Rhode Island and its plantations."
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,7218.617,7223.429,"Well, I would say that's what I gave yesterday in your absence in the total case."
1970.89,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7235.139,7245.294,"As signed underneath, we take everybody, including those who never heard that there was such a word as religion."
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,7245.294,7249.868,"Into that playground, there don’t have to be a student in school, then I would say that would be unconstitutional."
1970.89,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7249.868,7252.432,"Well, it's to saying --"

1970.89,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7263.745,7268.241,"It's a playground, well, if you move it next to the building, you said I couldn’t do it."
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,7268.241,7280.284,"No, I didn’t say that Mr. Justice Marshall, I said you can't do it if you're limit it to only those who were students in that school, and you limit those students that could only get those (Inaudible), and you require those students to take religious teaching, as part of it."
1970.89,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7281.523,7294.294,"Suppose it's restricted to children in that school, and that school accepts every child from the most en route Christian to the child that never heard of what religion was --."
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,7294.294,7300.771,And does not require that child to participate in any religious teaching or any religious practicing.
1970.89,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7303.582,7304.102,Why not?
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,7304.102,7306.954,"Well, that’s not (Voice Overlap)."
1970.89,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7321.0,7333.475,"Everybody in the school, this is a part of the school, part of the school’s recreational facilities, under clause 83 6b."
1970.89,5,34928,l_pfeffer,,7333.475,7353.155,"And the school is one in which there is -- religion is not required from the children, which of all faith and of no faith, and they're not subjected to religious propagation, religious practices, and the mere fact, that I said yesterday, the mere fact that the school is church-related does not disqualify that."
1970.89,6,36743,milton_stanzler,,7936.361,7938.974,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.89,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,8053.68,8058.263,"I take it, you're making that point, on the entanglement aspect."
1970.89,6,36743,milton_stanzler,,8077.953,8087.979,"No Your Honor, they would have to submit the form of expenditures, same form, and provided a teacher applies as the Commissioner of Education testified."
1970.89,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,8116.004,8138.308,"I suppose we can traditionally notice the reality that some state boards of education have disqualified some private schools, because of their failure to maintain minimum standards, even though they had no religious connection at all, is that (Voice Overlap) of a judicial notice?"
1970.89,6,36743,milton_stanzler,,8138.308,8140.332,"I think that could probably could be done, Your Honor."
1970.89,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,8149.69,8162.927,"Doesn’t this mean that state power exercises a great deal of authority and surveillance over all education, through the required years of compulsory education?"
1970.89,6,36743,milton_stanzler,,8162.927,8173.368,"Yes Your Honor, I think that there's a difference however, with respect with my brother pointed out, my brother Pfeffer pointed out, with respect to reporting the numbers of students who were attending in the school."
1970.89,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,8183.877,8213.782,"Well, I'm speaking now, the abstract of a private school, private elementary school, and it develops that instead of teaching History, which maybe required, of course, presumably is, teaching religion, even though it's not a religious connected or religious-related school, wouldn’t the school authorities say you must teach History or we will cancel your accredited standing, which means they go out of business."
1970.89,6,36743,milton_stanzler,,8213.782,8237.787,"Well, I wouldn’t -- I think that in the light of the cases, in particular the Pierce versus Society of Sisters that the private school can teach certain subjects, if they do not teach as in Rhode Island as a requirement they teach History, if you do not teach History, then I would believe that they would lose their accreditation, and the Department of Education would have a right to say it then, that you must teach History according to that state law."
1970.89,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,8237.787,8244.561,This would have nothing to do whether they're church-related or whether they were run by agnostics.
1970.89,6,36743,milton_stanzler,,8244.561,8245.657,"That is correct, Your Honor."

1970.89,7,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,8950.723,8953.21,"Page 223 of the appendix, if the Court please—"
1970.89,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8953.21,8956.045,"What that is, is part of exhibit 4 (d) (Voice Overlap)."
1970.89,7,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,8956.045,8962.598,"Counsel said that, that was a stipulation between the parties, nothing could be farther from the fact, I suggest."

1970.89,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9059.694,9060.96,Why did he give it to them?
1970.89,7,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,9060.96,9073.852,"He gave it to the principals, because I believe it was an aspiration for the way that he wished these schools to operate, but in fact, they were not operated and the testimony in the record is to fact that they were not operated under the sample."
1970.89,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9073.852,9075.374,He gave it to the teachers (Voice Overlap).
