1971.71-237,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.044,"-- in number 71-237, Mancusi against Stubbs."
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,21.765,24.943,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.71-237,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,176.914,180.438,How long did he serve in -- on the first sentence?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,180.438,197.169,"Well, when he appealed his conviction to the Tennessee Supreme Court, they gave him credit for the 10-year period between trials and apparently he served only about two more years and it's not explained exactly why he was paroled at that point but that's apparently what happened."
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,314.227,322.25,Does it appear Mrs. Marcus whether any offer was made to pay the expense?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,322.25,324.178,Nothing in the record to indicate that.
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,352.902,356.498,What was the purpose of the Guest defense that it was not a felony murder?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,356.498,357.987,"Yes, I think that's why the Court below seized on that."
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,357.987,360.668,Was he convicted of a felony murder or of a --?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,360.668,362.408,He was convicted of first degree murder.
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,365.47,369.02,So he may have been convicted under premeditated?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,369.02,371.681,Yes.
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,371.681,374.835,And what's the significant side of the Guest?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,374.835,390.691,"Apparently, the Court below felt that since Stubbs himself testified to the ownership of the gun and the fact that he kidnapped the Holms and compelled them to drive to the spot where the shooting occurred, but he said that --"
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,390.691,397.992,"But would the evidence have supported that the Tennessee Supreme Court said, the evidence that it didn't support a first degree common law premeditative?"
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,397.992,399.387,"Oh, yes."
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,399.387,399.879,It did!
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,399.879,400.403,Yes.
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,400.403,404.694,"Well, then this -- you are arguing harmless error -- Guest in an event?"
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,404.694,414.386,"Alright, we are arguing at any event that as far as harmless error is concerned that the Guest theory has no relation, because in fact for two reasons."
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,431.538,435.122,"You said, he took the stand in the â€“ in which the first or second trial?"
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,435.122,436.831,He took the stand in the first trial.
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,436.831,443.224,Did he -- does testimony indicate that he was a Guest?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,443.224,444.933,-- quite the contrary.
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,457.046,459.128,In the cross examination of Stubbs?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,459.128,463.951,"That no, this was -- and now I am speaking of Alex Holm, he made this reply."
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,464.323,471.36,"Well no, when Stubbs took the stand that he offered testimony, from which a Guest --"
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,471.36,491.266,"The testimony that he offered was that Mrs. Holm, when he was pointing the pistol in her face, asked him to put the pistol down, and that she would give him no trouble and I think there was an attempt by 1954 counsel to say that this was an expression of friendship."
1971.71-237,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,491.266,491.923,Mrs. Marcus --
1971.71-237,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,491.923,497.381,The subject of possible friendship was at least hinted at in the first trial?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,497.381,502.622,"It was hinted at by virtue of his saying, they told me they would give me no trouble."
1971.71-237,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,502.622,504.484,Mrs. Marcus let me back up a minute.
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,508.472,520.188,It was not any finding that on a record counsel was ineffective but because of a rule mandating automatic reversal in cases where counsel was tardily appointed.
1971.71-237,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,521.236,532.694,"Don't you think that's different from the average case, because I would assume that if counsel had more time, he might have been able to ask more questions on cross-examination."
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,532.694,540.478,"In this case, in the first place the record shows that the cross-examination was capably handled as was the direct examination."
1971.71-237,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,545.339,548.919,Did the Court of Appeals find that to be true?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,548.919,559.865,"The Court of Appeals, it made no reference whatsoever to lack of preparation time or the kind of questions that could have been asked except for the Guest theory."
1971.71-237,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,574.447,581.489,"But if I remember correctly in Scottsboro (ph) trial, they had 27 counsels, and this Court offset that, so the number doesn't help?"
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,581.489,588.38,"I think the record helps a great deal though because in reading it's clear that -- in fact, I think what makes it clear again --"
1971.71-237,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,588.38,597.712,"You see I have great difficulty in looking at the record, and deciding as to what somebody would say on the second hearing?"
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,610.49,618.929,We were given a little assistance as to what would have happened because 1964 counsel read into the record the questions that they would have asked.
1971.71-237,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,634.532,637.421,Well how do you know what they might have wanted to ask him?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,637.421,640.703,"They said, they read into the record and it is --"
1971.71-237,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,640.703,645.19,"They read into the record and they couldn't think of another question they would have wanted to ask, if he had been there?"
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,645.19,653.85,"No, but they listed the questions that they would have asked, and said and they further added there might have been other questions but these were the ones that on the basis --"
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,653.85,655.557,And those questions in this record Mrs. Marcus?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,655.557,656.434,"They are indeed, yes."
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,656.434,658.683,Can you tell us what page?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,658.683,660.771,It's on page 73.
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,660.771,662.23,"73, thank you."
1971.71-237,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,662.23,667.936,"So what difference would it have made if he was a Guest, how would that have helped the defendant?"
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,667.936,698.88,"Well, the Court below felt that it might have helped the defendant because if Stubbs' testimony, since he said on a stand that he kidnapped the Holms at gunpoint and compelled them to drive to the spot where the shooting occurred; this evidence was rather overwhelming, and the court below thought the Guest theory might show that if there was a felony which come to an end, that there might be more to say about the circumstances of a shooting, I think that's why they brought in the Guest theory."
1971.71-237,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,698.88,701.061,"Well, was it a felony murder conviction?"
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,701.061,703.613,"Well, it was a first degree murder conviction."
1971.71-237,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,708.943,709.618,I see.
1971.71-237,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,709.618,713.926,But if he had been a guest then it could have been felony murder?
1971.71-237,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,713.926,714.031,"Right, right."
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,714.031,716.643,That was the idea I think that the Court below had.
1971.71-237,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,716.643,718.476,How would have that helped him?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,718.476,722.706,"Well, it would have helped him simply on a felony murder as had been on the first degree murder aspect."
1971.71-237,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,722.706,724.766,And they didn't think it was first degree murder?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,724.766,725.878,It's apparently --
1971.71-237,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,725.878,734.293,"Well, I suppose as a matter of Tennessee's state law, if the judge charges the jury that they may find him guilty of first-degree murder on either theories."
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,734.293,736.245,"On either grounds, it could have included either one."
1971.71-237,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,736.245,748.656,"And that it turns out that one of the theories might not have been supported evidentially, that would be reversible even though on the other theory were adequately supported?"
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,748.656,759.393,"In Barber, this Court discussed the reading of preliminary hearing testimony of a witness who was in a federal prison across the state border."
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,841.361,849.652,-- you mean mean that's a rule that doesn't require in any instance then that the state offer to pay his expenses to come?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,849.652,856.997,It wouldn't establish a constitutional duty to do so where the witness is beyond the reach of compulsory process.
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,856.997,864.848,Well is the suggestion that the no inquiry made up at all if it's discover that he is permanently resident of overseas?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,864.848,871.522,The suggestion is that it wouldn't be a part of the constitutional duty of the prosecutor to do so.
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,871.522,875.171,"Where does the duty end, what's to be done by the prosecutor?"
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,875.171,890.113,"Well, as far as -- well the prosecutor may in cases for example where the travel expenses are not too onerous, he may well feel that having the witness present would be to his advantage and he would pursue it regardless of what the --"
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,890.113,895.522,"What -- I am Sorry Mrs. Marcus, I don't understand what you are suggesting should be the constitutional limit of the prosecution --"
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,895.522,898.433,The establishment of his residence overseas as far as --
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,898.433,905.87,"And that once that's established, whether it's Mexico, Canada, no matter where it would be, that that's the end and then they use the prior testimony."
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,905.87,908.071,"As far as this constitutional duty is concerned, yes."
1971.71-237,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,908.071,913.645,"It doesn't even require him to send a letter to say, if you don't mind, would you mind coming over to testify?"
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,913.645,928.806,"I think that where there is no compulsory process to back this up, we ask this Court to say that the limit of the duty would be the establishment that the witness is living overseas, and that is the rationale that these other courts have adopted."
1971.71-237,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,928.806,932.145,That's even if the witness is willing to come over his own expense?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,932.145,935.7,"Well, if he is willing to come and the prosecutor is aware of that --"
1971.71-237,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,935.7,947.753,But it would know unless â€“ I am just saying that he wouldn't embarrassed if the prosecutor write a letter over to him and say this case is coming up and if you could come over then we welcome?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,947.753,954.715,"Under the rule that these courts have established, that would be in the prosecutor's discretion rather than a constitutional duty."
1971.71-237,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,954.715,962.959,Did the defense ask for an allowance to bring Mr. Holm from Sweden?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,962.959,963.63,"No, they didn't."
1971.71-237,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,970.72,973.897,Did either side request the deposition?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,973.897,976.458,"No, in other words the --"
1971.71-237,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,976.458,980.617,You know whether under Tennessee practice the deposition may be employed in the current case?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,980.617,996.39,"Well, the prior hearing testimony was taken at a trial where the witness Holm was confronted, was cross-examined so that this testimony I think would have been the most valid that they possibly could read into the record."
1971.71-237,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1000.831,1003.381,Ten years closer to the event I take it?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1003.381,1007.528,"It was directly after the event, yes."
1971.71-237,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1007.817,1019.791,"And the facts were that the state in that second trial served process on Holms at his last known address, which was in Texas in the United States of America --"
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1019.791,1020.382,Yes.
1971.71-237,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1020.382,1022.119,-- and that was returned on moved --
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1022.119,1023.045,Right.
1971.71-237,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1023.045,1026.224,-- and then was there any notification to him at all in Sweden?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1026.224,1032.208,"They then have taken his son, who advised the Court as to his whereabouts and who testified on the stand as to his whereabouts."
1971.71-237,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1032.208,1033.407,That he had moved to Sweden?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1033.407,1034.211,Yes.
1971.71-237,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1034.211,1037.598,And was Holms himself ever notified?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1037.598,1063.738,"There was a remark by 1964 defense counsel that the Court in referring to a newspaper interview where Holm's son was quoted to saying his father was not aware that the trial is taking place, but even if this process was excluded as hearsay by the judge, but it's interesting to note that 1964 defense counsel made no effort to cross-examine the son on a stand as to whether or not his father knew, so that there is nothing to record really, no proper evidence on that."
1971.71-237,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1063.738,1069.577,"After the unsuccessful attempt to service in Texas, that was the end of it as far as the --"
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1069.577,1072.129,"As far, except for the establishment of where he was."
1971.71-237,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1072.129,1073.058,Through the son?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1073.058,1074.364,Right.
1971.71-237,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1125.521,1133.655,"Mrs. Marcus I take it it's your position, the state of New York is not bound by Judge Miller's habeas corpus ruling?"
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1133.655,1149.286,"Right, and this -- there was an attempt by respondent to argue that New York is in privity with Tennessee and therefore, this ruling would prevent us from looking at the record at all to determine whether counsel was effective or not."
1971.71-237,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1244.169,1246.794,Suppose he had agreed to come and pay his own expenses?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1246.794,1253.306,"If he had agreed to come, I believe that it's beyond a reasonable doubt that he would have testified the same way for several reasons."
1971.71-237,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1254.051,1259.194,"Well, may I assume that the lawyer would have additional questions?"
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1259.194,1267.398,"Well, he -- as I said he did list what he would have had but I think there are other reasons to conclude that he would beyond a reasonable doubt have testified the same way."
1971.71-237,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1268.948,1272.119,"My point is not on his testimony, my point is on cross-examination?"
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1272.119,1272.939,"Yes, I think that he would."
1971.71-237,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1272.939,1282.018,"And I don't think you can beyond a reasonable doubt, determine what a lawyer would say cross-examining the witness?"
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1282.018,1289.138,"I think though that looking at this record and this witness, what we can say is that the witness would have withstood cross-examination."
1971.71-237,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1289.138,1294.055,Have you ever known every question you would ask on cross-examination before it started?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1294.055,1295.484,"No, no your honor."
1971.71-237,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1295.636,1296.902,Thank you.
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1296.902,1305.655,The question would be how would the witness have reacted to this cross-examination and the testimony was uncomplicated.
1971.71-237,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1312.951,1313.894,You mean Holm?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1313.894,1314.374,"Holm, yes."
1971.71-237,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1340.439,1344.325,At the trial did Stubbs deny firing any shot?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1344.325,1360.418,"He testified at both trials and he reiterated that when he was released from the Texas prison, he tried for several days going toward Bristol, Tennessee, where he hoped to meet a truck route going to New York."
1971.71-237,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1371.397,1372.411,This is all his testimony -- ?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1372.411,1374.098,This is his testimony at both trials.
1971.71-237,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1374.098,1375.061,Right.
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1375.061,1382.788,Kidnapped the Holms' at gunpoint and with his left-hand holding the gun at intervals pointing into Mrs. Holm's face.
1971.71-237,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1417.578,1420.153,Was Stubbs wounded when he was apprehended?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1420.153,1427.441,"Yes, he had head wounds because Holm had hit him several times with the gun on the head, once having seized it."
1971.71-237,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1427.441,1429.521,No gunshot wounds ?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1429.521,1432.812,"There was some testimony that a bullet might have graced him, yes."
1971.71-237,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1432.812,1438.718,Didn't Stubbs also offer the explanation when he is first apprehended that he had fallen off a cliff while he was fishing and that was how that happened?
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1438.718,1449.25,"Yes, he told that -- it was the first story that he told the police officers that the blood was there only because he had an accident while fishing and he had slipped on a cliff."
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1477.824,1490.12,"Mrs. Marcus, I gather -- in this instance, the only issue before us is whether the state did what it should have done to bring Mr. Holm back for the second trial?"
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1490.12,1496.028,"Well, even if not, it would have been harmless error in the context of the overwhelming evidence in this case."
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1496.028,1500.726,"But apart from that, on the basic issue, I just want to be clear."
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1517.52,1521.341,Insofar as a witness is resident beyond the reach of compulsory process.
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1521.341,1523.844,Yes because he was living in some foreign country.
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1533.502,1535.079,"Judge Adams' opinion, Your Honor?"
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1535.079,1537.229,"Adams, I am sorry, yes."
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1569.018,1578.658,"No, he made no mention of that and then he ultimately on our second point, which was that the evidence here is so overwhelming with the hospital identification."
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1578.658,1580.139,"Yes, but if I may, I would like to conclude."
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1580.139,1581.108,Sure.
1971.71-237,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1581.108,1598.85,"Now if we don't agree with your test, but think that the test suggested by Judge Adams is the more appropriate one and then I gather there can be a reversal only if we agree with your second point namely on harmless error?"
1971.71-237,0,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1598.85,1600.561,"Yes, that's right."
1971.71-237,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1605.304,1606.63,Very well Mrs. Marcus.
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,1608.272,1611.548,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.71-237,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1708.201,1712.031,You say Stubbs said as that he -- so testified at both trials?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,1712.031,1712.624,"Yes, he did."
1971.71-237,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1712.624,1713.122,He did.
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,1713.122,1713.947,Yes.
1971.71-237,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1725.164,1729.347,Didn't he also say right at that point that he put the gun down on the seat of the car?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,1729.347,1729.861,Yes.
1971.71-237,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1729.861,1734.871,And that was -- so that the police officers and others wouldn't see the gun?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,1734.871,1735.868,Yes.
1971.71-237,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1745.148,1749.831,He didn't throw the gun away though anytime or offered to give it to the Holms?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,1749.831,1750.972,No.
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1789.536,1790.602,They were both in the back seat?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,1790.602,1792.284,They were both in the back seat.
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1792.284,1796.184,Did they both agree on that; Stubbs and Holm agreed that the two were in the back seat?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,1796.184,1796.644,Oh yes!
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1829.594,1831.614,What about this?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,1833.894,1835.388,He doesn't know how they were shot.
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1842.025,1843.228,And who had to struggle to get it away?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,1843.228,1844.317,Stubbs had to struggle.
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1844.317,1845.816,And did he get it away from Mr. Holm?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,1845.816,1857.923,"No, because the gun was found in the car, the backseat of the car, backseat when the police officer (Inaudible) -- Now the trial judge--"
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1857.923,1859.841,And did the car crash in fact?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,1859.841,1861.489,The car didn't crash.
1971.71-237,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1904.63,1905.803,He was the only eye witness?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,1905.803,1919.938,"He was the only eye witness â€“ yes, Your Honor and he was the only witness if you include Stubbsâ€™ testimony and Stubbs being present in the car, who was -- and he said that Stubbs had done the shooting."
1971.71-237,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1933.46,1943.049,"But this subject of the alleged friendly relation, a happy relationship that developed was explored at the first trial, was it not?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,1943.049,1944.686,It was not adequately explored at the first trial.
1971.71-237,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1944.686,1946.852,"Yeah, but it was explored though?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,1946.852,1951.64,It was explored by reason of Mr. Stubbsâ€™ testimony.
1971.71-237,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1952.532,1961.002,And then they cross -- Mr. Holm was examined on the same subject and he said there were no friendly relations at all.
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,1961.002,1963.666,Yes.
1971.71-237,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2010.507,2019.964,"In three days, couldn't three lawyers have found that out, if that were invalid notion?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2019.964,2034.135,"Well they might have, but this case involved the people who were from out of state, people that were not local people, both the Holms and Stubbs."
1971.71-237,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2044.951,2049.338,May be it didn't occur to the defendant until he got on the stand?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2049.338,2057.094,"Well itâ€™s possible, but his testimony was straightforward at both trials."
1971.71-237,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2061.46,2068.344,I take it all they would have had to do to learn of the defense was to interview their own client.
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2068.344,2074.025,"Yeah, I should think here they might have done so."
1971.71-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2100.837,2110.281,"When Holm came back on the stand on rebuttal (Inaudible) after the defendantâ€™s testimony, that he was available then for cross examination?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2110.281,2111.726,"Yes, but no questions were asked."
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2132.899,2144.309,"It may not, but certainly confrontation of Holm was had when he took the stand on rebuttal, wasn't he?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2144.309,2144.915,Yes.
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2144.915,2155.598,"So constitutionally, Stubbs canâ€™t complain that he didn't have an opportunity for confrontation, but what you are suggesting is that itâ€™s ineffective assistance of counsel, arenâ€™t you?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2155.598,2158.205,"Yes, well of course it is."
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2158.205,2159.909,What the Judge Miller lead into?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2159.909,2161.456,"What the Judge Miller say, Your Honor?"
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2161.456,2161.711,Yes.
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2163.183,2169.42,"Yes, Judge Miller said and his decision is appended as an Appendix to our brief."
1971.71-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2218.003,2225.031,Is it critical to your case whether or not representation was effective or ineffective?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2225.031,2226.037,Well I --
1971.71-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2226.037,2233.337,Let's assume for the moment that there was no question whatsoever as to the effectiveness of counsel at the first trial?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2233.337,2244.148,"Then as in Barber against Page, assume that there was effective cross-examination, there still was a denial of confrontation."
1971.71-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2254.675,2264.282,You are saying that just as though Holm was living ten miles away and they thought it would be more convenient to use his prior testimony than call him?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2264.282,2264.991,Yes.
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2289.394,2292.44,"Well, I gather New York doesn't deny this?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2298.59,2300.23,Yes.
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2300.23,2308.316,I take it New York does not deny -- I thought Mrs. Marcus didn't answer to some questions I asked and conceded as much?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2308.316,2318.001,"There is a further indication in the Tennessee record that counsel had been informed by the Tennessee prosecutor, that Mr. Holm would be produced."
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2325.372,2327.539,With different lawyers at the second trial?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2327.539,2330.231,"Yes, different lawyers and different set."
1971.71-237,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2330.231,2337.749,"That wasnâ€™t really admissible evidence though, was it, wasn't that a statement of counsel that trial judge refused to consider?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2337.749,2343.948,"Yes, It was a remark of counsel addressed I believe when the jury was not present."
1971.71-237,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2351.264,2359.126,But sometimes the petitioner asked the Court -- asked the prosecutor to produce the witness?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2359.126,2375.543,"No, but I think that they indicated most strenuously their desire to have the witness present in order to be questioned."
1971.71-237,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2375.543,2388.401,"No, I don't -- may be I misunderstood, but I understood your record you showed, that they didn't want the trial to go on without the witness, but they -- whether a particular the witness came or not?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2388.401,2397.029,I don't recall the exact wording that counsel used. I got the impression from the statements of counsel that they wanted the witness there.
1971.71-237,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2397.029,2403.657,"Yeah, well couldnâ€™t it be that what they wanted was the trial not to go on without the witness?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2403.657,2404.186,I think so.
1971.71-237,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2404.186,2405.292,It means no trial?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2405.292,2407.847,Yes.
1971.71-237,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2407.847,2413.364,"Well, don't you think they should have asked what was going to be done about it?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2413.364,2423.232,"I think, they might have asked, but this remark that I have mentioned, which is an evidence may have been an explanation as to why they didn't."
1971.71-237,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2427.72,2433.814,But don't you think that they could have raised that point and told the Court that?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2433.814,2435.448,"Yes, the could have."
1971.71-237,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2435.448,2445.514,And don't you think they perhaps had an obligation to do that before trial so as not to have the second trial aborted by a mistrial?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2445.514,2450.26,"Yes, if they had known that the witness Holm was not going to be present."
1971.71-237,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2450.26,2456.087,You are assuming something on which there is nothing in the record on one way or the other?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2456.087,2456.645,Well --
1971.71-237,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2456.645,2457.784,You said if they had known.
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2478.476,2483.992,"Well that, this of course would be the devious tactics by some counsel."
1971.71-237,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2485.43,2486.122,You wouldn't.
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2486.122,2498.821,"I never quoted the entire passage in the record, which is not printed in the appendix, where counsel before the testimony was offered, made their objections."
1971.71-237,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2498.821,2500.516,This is after the trial was once underway --
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2500.516,2502.548,This is after the trial was once underway.
1971.71-237,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2502.548,2518.904,"The only solution would have been a mistrial, if they were going to -- probably a mistrial, if they were going to wait for this man to be subpoenaed, and determine whether he would honor extraterritorial subpoena all the way to Sweden."
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2533.973,2549.899,"Yes, but I would say then, the passage -- the only passage that addresses in the record, that addresses itself to this point, is a statement by Mr. Mitchell, one of Stubbs' counsel at the second trial."
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2550.616,2551.685,At what page is that?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2551.685,2556.205,Page 16a of the respondent's brief at the bottom.
1971.71-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2607.002,2612.533,Was there another conviction besides the Tennessee conviction?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2612.533,2614.309,"I believe there was, yes."
1971.71-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2614.309,2620.803,The â€“ in Texas (Inaudible) and New York specifically relied on the Tennessee?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2620.803,2624.837,"Yes, they relied on it so far as this case is concerned."
1971.71-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2624.837,2625.525,Yes.
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2625.525,2629.435,"And on our, when opposing our certiorari --"
1971.71-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2629.435,2633.039,But they have gone through the same mileage out of the defense's (Inaudible)
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2633.039,2642.809,"Yes, I thought that the case might be moot because of that and that the Court might not want to consider the case, but at any rate New York --"
1971.71-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2642.809,2649.765,"Was that offered -- was the Texas conviction offered, how did they prove a prior conviction in New York?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2649.765,2655.999,"Well they would have, following a conviction by the fact finding."
1971.71-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2674.428,2677.282,"No, that went forward here?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2677.282,2685.641,"This went forward here, following his conviction in Monroe County and the only conviction that was used was the Tennessee murder conviction."
1971.71-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2685.641,2690.165,But how does anybody -- how did anybody know that was in Texas?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2690.165,2693.103,"Well, following the mandate of the of the Court below."
1971.71-237,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2693.103,2698.739,"What about his testimony, that he was on his way from the Texas penitentiary?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2706.224,2720.778,"Yes, I don't know whether that this would necessarily make him a felon, but my information is that he was in fact convicted of a felony in Texas for burglary."
1971.71-237,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2725.902,2730.854,"His counsel is claiming, I suppose of that, that kind of conviction too was unconstitutional?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2730.854,2732.345,Yes.
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2732.345,2735.292,In what proceeding is the Texas conviction being litigated?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2735.292,2740.591,"Well, there was no stay of proceedings following the decision below."
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2740.591,2741.616,In this case?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2741.616,2742.564,"Yes, in this case."
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2742.564,2745.66,"And this case was resulted in what, setting aside his sentence?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2745.66,2754.018,"Yes, that he was ordered released; if the New York courts did not resentence him, giving no effect --"
1971.71-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2754.018,2758.716,Now they are not going through the same proceeding based on the Texas?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2758.716,2759.798,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.71-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2759.798,2761.426,So it could be that --
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2761.426,2762.76,This whole thing could washed out?
1971.71-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2762.76,2766.95,"-- this whole thing, as you say may will be moot?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2766.95,2768.73,"Yeah, this is what I thought."
1971.71-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2772.639,2773.553,Yes.
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2773.553,2780.156,"No, but if it's found against him, on the Texas, then all you will have is another appeal I take it?"
1971.71-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2780.156,2790.261,"Yes, so there is currently another proceeding in the New York courts based on the Texas conviction?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2790.261,2792.518,Yes.
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2797.204,2798.706,You are not representing him in --
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2798.706,2802.288,"No, the Monroe County's public defender has been in communication with them."
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2802.288,2803.075,I see.
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2803.075,2804.005,I checked --
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2804.005,2806.006,You were assigned in throughout this --
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2806.006,2821.789,"I've been assigned in the Court below and I realizing I had spent 1000 bucks, excuse me Your Honor, dollars, I asked the clerk to assign me here this morning, to proceed."
1971.71-237,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2879.677,2887.448,"Mr. Carpenter, at point enlighten me, what kind of an effort in your estimation would be sufficient?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2887.448,2897.771,I think the only effort that is sufficient when you have an indigent defendant is an offer to pay the expenses aback and an application.
1971.71-237,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2898.51,2901.72,"Why not deposition, why not schedule deposition in Sweden?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2901.72,2902.97,"Well, this is possible."
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2911.354,2911.749,Without the privilege --
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2911.749,2916.548,In this you have to transport more people over to Sweden and you wouldn't --
1971.71-237,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2916.548,2925.201,"Isn't Justice Brennan's comment appropriate, wouldn't the defense then be complaining of expense either in going over to attend the deposition or hiring local counsel?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2927.028,2928.591,"Well, I don't know."
1971.71-237,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2953.842,2963.144,"Well suppose the witness, instead of being in Sweden were in the front lines in Vietnam, would it make any difference?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,2963.144,2976.716,"Question is -- I'm thinking of what is the -- a case arose in California, where exactly the same situation occurred."
1971.71-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2998.291,3000.066,California --
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3000.066,3002.089,"California brief, isn't it?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,3002.089,3004.242,"No, it wasn't --"
1971.71-237,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3004.242,3007.053,But at least you don't disagree with that determination?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,3007.053,3011.85,"Well, I think there was an effort made to get the witness."
1971.71-237,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3019.183,3025.431,"And yet, the military authority could have ordered that man back into the United States, couldn't they?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,3025.431,3043.657,"Yes, the case that I was mentioning or which is in the fact is the -- I think People against Benjamin, which is cited sited in 83 California Reporter 764, an intermediate Appellant Court decision."
1971.71-237,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3043.657,3062.001,"Mr. Carpenter, I take it you are relying on Barber against Page for your main proposition and there is at least a factual distinction between this case and Barber, isn't there, in that in Barber nobody cross-examined on behalf of the particular defendant who later raised the objection?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,3062.001,3062.874,Yes.
1971.71-237,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3062.874,3069.884,Whereas here there was cross-examination on behalf of your client in the 1954 trial?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,3069.884,3074.181,"Yes, there was cross-examination."
1971.71-237,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3108.05,3114.439,"Well, isn't the holding though kind of limited to the fact; when you are speaking about holding, you are talking about the facts of the particular case?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,3114.439,3140.066,"Yes, and another fact that distinguishes is Barber and Page distance was only 225 miles and it was just one straight line, but these facts, because I don't think that distance here, it's 4500 miles or so to Sweden make -- is a determining factor."
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3140.066,3155.513,"Well, Mr. Carpenter there had been the most vigorous cross-examination to Mr. Holm when he took the stand in rebuttal as to Stubbs had told this good relation story and that had been the most vigorous cross-examination of Mr. Holm, you say that here there was not."
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,3158.196,3160.503,"Yes, I would think that Barber against --"
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3160.503,3166.072,You still think that an effort should have been made to have Mr. Holms appear at the second trial?
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,3166.072,3191.858,"Yes Your Honor, because the right of confrontation involves not merely cross-examination, but also the right of a defendant to have his fact-finder, deal with the witness, face to face, consider that the demeanor of the witness as he is giving his testimony and determine, you might have waive it or give it up, because of the necessities of some case, but it's something that you shouldn't give up easily --"
1971.71-237,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3191.858,3233.66,"Suppose it appeared hypothetically now, that's not this case, but suppose hypothetically it appeared that a defense counsel in that posture consulted with his client and said you will be much better off to have this testimony read from the transcript than to have this man sitting in the courtroom, flesh and blood on the stand with the scars of the bullet wounds on his face and suppose he made that decision, would you think anyone could reasonably say that was ineffective, that tactic was ineffective assistance of the counsel or was it a permissible choice?"
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,3233.66,3237.144,I think it's perhaps possible for counsel to make that decision.
1971.71-237,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3245.292,3246.759,"Well, I didn't suggest he was dishonest."
1971.71-237,1,17519,bruce_k_carpenter,,3253.866,3270.96,"The only defense tactics that would have worked in this case in my opinion is to show Mr. Holm to have been a liar; that's the only way and counsel failed to do anything effective in the 1954 trial, they had no chance to do it in the 1964 trial."
1971.71-237,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3272.986,3273.694,Thank you.
1971.71-237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3275.674,3281.843,Mrs. Marcus what's your status of this hearing on the Texas conviction?
1971.71-237,2,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3281.843,3289.758,He has been resentenced as a second felony offender under the Texas predicate and he is appealing that Texas predicate.
1971.71-237,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3292.532,3295.058,"An appeal where, in the state of New Jersey -- in New York State Courts?"
1971.71-237,2,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3295.058,3298.633,"In New York State Courts, yes, first."
1971.71-237,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3307.725,3310.133,No but isn't the condition satisfied here?
1971.71-237,2,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3313.027,3313.545,"Yes, but --"
1971.71-237,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3313.545,3315.928,Well that satisfy the condition of this judgment?
1971.71-237,2,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3315.928,3322.623,It does not for the considerations that this Court discussed in Sibron v. New York and the Morgan case.
1971.71-237,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3342.881,3344.425,"Well, what could he sentence him to here?"
1971.71-237,2,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3345.931,3372.545,"The sentence here is not different, but as this Court pointed out in both Sibron and Morgan, it must be considered what would happen on a subsequent conviction and what would happen is that the sentencing Court would undoubtedly regard as crucial in determining what kind of person this is, what sort of chances for rehabilitation and what sort of danger he poses to the public in being released."
1971.71-237,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3394.233,3398.162,"Thank you Mrs. Marcus, thank you Mr. Carpenter."
