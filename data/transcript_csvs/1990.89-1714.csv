1990.89-1714,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,17.526,"We'll hear argument now in No. 89-1714, Harriet Pauley v. Bethenergy Mines, consolidated with Director of Officer of Workmen's Compensation Programs, Consolidated Coal Company v. Director."
1990.89-1714,0,36729,mark_e_solomons,,19.837,22.882,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1714,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,237.263,240.558,Even though you are talking about to rebut the presumption?
1990.89-1714,0,36729,mark_e_solomons,,240.558,251.071,--The burden to establish that the miner does not have pneumoconiosis or that any disability the miner has did not arise out of or in any part out of pneumoconiosis.
1990.89-1714,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,251.071,261.954,"Mr. Solomons, would it have been open to such proof under the old HEW regulations?"
1990.89-1714,0,36729,mark_e_solomons,,261.954,267.516,"Justice O'Connor, we think that the old HEW regulations were clearly open to such proof."
1990.89-1714,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,270.375,272.233,They don't talk about it directly.
1990.89-1714,0,36729,mark_e_solomons,,272.233,274.576,--They talk about it indirectly.
1990.89-1714,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,274.576,281.041,"In fact, it is not clear, I think, what would have happened under those old regulations."
1990.89-1714,0,36729,mark_e_solomons,,281.041,285.79,"Justice O'Connor, I think that that may be correct, and it's... they're very difficult to read."
1990.89-1714,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,359.84,372.583,"Yes, but nevertheless, whatever they are designed for, Congress has said that the Department of Labor should not have regulations any stricter than the... than HEW."
1990.89-1714,0,36729,mark_e_solomons,,372.583,373.739,That's right.
1990.89-1714,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,373.739,390.843,So if you could rebut... if you couldn't rebut the case under the Social Security regulations by evidence that the Department of Labor permits... isn't that one of the claims in this case?
1990.89-1714,0,36729,mark_e_solomons,,390.843,391.311,That is the claim.
1990.89-1714,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,391.311,391.827,Yes.
1990.89-1714,0,36729,mark_e_solomons,,391.827,401.276,"We think that the Department... the Social Security regulations, if you go through them, and they don't work very neatly, but if you do go through them, each one of those issues is open to factual inquiry."
1990.89-1714,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,405.43,408.945,"Well, do we know how it was applied by HEW?"
1990.89-1714,0,36729,mark_e_solomons,,408.945,415.068,--What we do know... now there are... there are very few cases that arise out of the Social Security program.
1990.89-1714,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,531.209,538.41,You say that the lack of resources resulted in the Social Security Administration's not developing any evidence of its own?
1990.89-1714,0,36729,mark_e_solomons,,538.41,542.751,"They did not develop the hard evidence, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1714,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,542.751,546.079,"Well, what's hard evidence as opposed to soft evidence?"
1990.89-1714,0,36729,mark_e_solomons,,546.079,554.622,"The hard evidence is the kind of evidence that you need to prove that a miner's disability, if in fact he has a respiratory impairment, is not due to black lung disease."
1990.89-1714,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,555.7,556.888,Or causation.
1990.89-1714,0,36729,mark_e_solomons,,558.136,558.698,Disability causation.
1990.89-1714,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,558.698,559.401,--caused by it.
1990.89-1714,0,36729,mark_e_solomons,,559.401,559.964,That's right.
1990.89-1714,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,584.329,591.732,"You say that's why the Social Security people resolved cases the way they did, not because of an irrebuttable presumption, but because there was no evidence supporting the other view?"
1990.89-1714,0,36729,mark_e_solomons,,591.732,600.103,"Well, they created a presumption for use by their claims personnel, which to me looks to some degree like the Social Security grid."
1990.89-1714,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,698.907,700.75,"Very well, Mr. Solomons."
1990.89-1714,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,702.765,718.462,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1714,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,759.195,760.586,And how do we know that?
1990.89-1714,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,763.787,769.753,--The GAO report that's cited and the congressional record testimony.
1990.89-1714,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,771.674,778.922,Did the GAO report deal with the black lung program in the Social Security agency?
1990.89-1714,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,778.922,780.795,"Yes, it did, Your Honor."
1990.89-1714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,849.893,860.544,"Well, then, I suppose it would follow that if the regulations didn't provide for rebuttal on those... either one of those two bases, the regulation would be contrary to the statute?"
1990.89-1714,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,860.544,863.825,"That's our position exactly, Justice White."
1990.89-1714,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,985.87,994.803,"Let's acknowledge, Mr. Wright, however, that it's very... it's very hard to get there through the HEW regulations."
1990.89-1714,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1000.848,1001.707,"Well, I--"
1990.89-1714,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1001.707,1004.347,Of course it's hard to get anywhere through the HEW regulations.
1990.89-1714,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1005.706,1008.767,"--I would be very happy to acknowledge that, Justice Scalia."
1990.89-1714,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1217.136,1220.306,"Thank you, Mr. Wright."
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,1238.627,1270.52,"Mr. Chief Justice, the fact finders found that they did not, but the question of whether a person has black lung disease in a case involving ventilatory studies or blood gas tests, their types of cases, is one in which the state of the medical art... HEW's view in 1972 was that the state of the medical art had simply not advanced far enough to be able to make the determination about whether a person's respiratory or pulmonary impairment--"
1990.89-1714,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1270.52,1272.8,I was asking you as a question of present fact.
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,1272.8,1278.361,--Present fact is that there is no indication in the legislative history that the state of the medical art has--
1990.89-1714,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1278.361,1285.294,I was just asking you as a question of present fact whether or not Dayton and Taylor have black lung disease.
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,1285.294,1291.715,"--Well, I... my response is that we don't know, because the state of the medical art does not allow you to know."
1990.89-1714,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1304.459,1312.893,Isn't that why they didn't allow the... this particular type of medical evidence to create the presumption under the old regulation?
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,1312.893,1315.001,"We believe that that's so, too."
1990.89-1714,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1315.001,1324.154,"And isn't it true, therefore, that, which... I don't remember which it was now, but the particular miner who proved his case by those studies would have failed under the HEW regulations?"
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,1324.154,1325.31,The--
1990.89-1714,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1325.31,1328.356,It seemed to me that was rather clear as to that one miner.
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,1328.356,1330.277,"--Well, there were two miners--"
1990.89-1714,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1330.277,1337.681,And therefore it's a little hard to see how he can be claiming that the Social... Department of Labor regulation is more restrictive than the HEW regulation.
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,1337.681,1338.866,"--What I believe you are referring to, there were two miners."
1990.89-1714,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1348.051,1350.643,But Taylor relied on the blood gas studies--
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,1350.643,1352.143,--Taylor relied on the blood gas test.
1990.89-1714,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1352.143,1356.703,--which would not have entitled him to the presumption under the HEW regulation.
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,1356.703,1357.797,That is correct.
1990.89-1714,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1364.733,1376.605,"Well, that may well be true, but this is a case, it seems to me, which clearly would have failed under the prior regulation, so I find it difficult to understand how the Department of Labor regulation, at least as to that miner, is more restrictive."
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,1376.605,1388.692,"--Well, as we say in Mr. Taylor's brief, it turns on the specific word ""criteria"" in the statute, and the distinction between substantive criteria on the one hand and forms of evidence on the other."
1990.89-1714,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1417.869,1420.976,"This word ""criteria"" has troubled us in the past."
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,1420.976,1431.238,--These consolidated cases turn on a face of the statute question and on a face of the regulation question.
1990.89-1714,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1622.567,1629.08,"Your opponents disagree with you as to the rebuttability of the HEW systems, don't they?"
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,1629.08,1629.814,They do.
1990.89-1714,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1727.992,1728.977,Mr. Henriques--
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,1731.195,1733.802,"Yes, we... it is valid."
1990.89-1714,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1733.802,1734.927,"I mean at the time, at the time."
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,1734.927,1736.364,It was valid under--
1990.89-1714,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1736.364,1746.048,Although the act is aimed at giving benefits to those who have this disease caused by coal mining.
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,1746.048,1746.626,--Right.
1990.89-1714,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1747.751,1761.057,"And so they... it would be all right for the agency to say well, you can't offer any evidence that rebuts the notion of causation, for example."
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,1761.057,1762.307,--Right.
1990.89-1714,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1766.634,1767.743,You hope it's superficially.
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,1769.914,1770.758,--try to press in their briefs.
1990.89-1714,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1848.413,1857.644,And... let's assume that the state of the medical art had changed between then and now so that you really can determine causation.
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,1866.75,1868.469,"Well, more than that."
1990.89-1714,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1898.394,1912.215,Although you don't think it modifies the criteria to update medical science for purposes of determining whether... whether your client has black lung disease.
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,1936.362,1945.344,"No, I... the... Justice Scalia, I believe that it's permissible for two different agencies to come to different conclusions about the state of the medical art."
1990.89-1714,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1948.342,1951.309,"Well, it's not just two different agencies; it's 20 years."
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,1955.494,1962.758,"That may be so, but there's nothing in the legislative history that suggests that the state of the medical art has advanced far enough even now."
1990.89-1714,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1965.038,1969.442,How does the legislative history cover whether the medical art has advanced?
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,1971.27,1982.922,"--Well, I... we believe that we don't need to resort to the legislative history because what SSA's view was... is why they left the two rebuttal tests out of the, of its own interim provision."
1990.89-1714,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1999.32,2014.487,"Are you saying that in no case was the medical art with respect to the two additional criteria, in no case could it demonstrate that pneumo... say it for me."
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2014.487,2015.674,Pneumoconiosis.
1990.89-1714,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2015.674,2016.174,There it is.
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2020.5,2026.482,"No, there are obviously cases in which the... it would have been possible to conclude that."
1990.89-1714,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2027.029,2050.597,"Well, why wouldn't that be a violation of the statute, if the statute says you have to have black lung disease and it has to have been caused by coal mining, and if at least in some cases the medical technology, as crude as it was, could demonstrate absolutely that you didn't have it or that you didn't get it from coal mining, why wouldn't that be a violation of the statute for HEW to say absolutely you can't use it in any case?"
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2050.597,2056.891,"--Because HEW was an administrative agency and had a line-drawing problem, the typical kind of line-drawing problem in the law."
1990.89-1714,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2062.812,2064.279,"Well, but this is a rebuttal."
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2081.802,2086.536,--Because it... HEW's view was that it was virtually impossible to prove.
1990.89-1714,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2089.206,2089.55,No problem.
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2091.049,2094.907,"--No, because physicians didn't necessarily share that view."
1990.89-1714,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2178.749,2184.903,I thought they argued that these miners fit that category because they didn't have the disease.
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2189.603,2191.259,Under SS--
1990.89-1714,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2191.259,2193.82,"--who had been in the mines for 10 years and had pneumonia or something else, you know?"
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2193.82,2198.241,--Our opponents say that SSA would not have approved benefits in these claims.
1990.89-1714,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2198.241,2198.678,"Well, why wouldn't they?"
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2213.314,2213.672,They would have.
1990.89-1714,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2213.672,2214.312,--They would have.
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2214.312,2217.421,They certainly would have recovered under the HEW interim provision.
1990.89-1714,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2217.421,2231.336,"Even if they could prove later beyond a shadow of a doubt they did not have serious pneumonoconiosis... if that's the way you pronounce it... and also that they, rather the cause of their disability was an automobile accident?"
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2231.336,2234.429,"Right, because the HEW interim provision did not address those inquiries."
1990.89-1714,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2235.054,2241.505,"Well, how is it that HEW reported to the contrary to the GAO, do you suppose?"
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2241.505,2243.191,"--Excuse me, I--"
1990.89-1714,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2243.191,2248.814,"How do you explain, then, the HEW report to the GAO?"
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2248.814,2253.969,--HEW's report to the GAO was that it was virtually impossible to make these determinations.
1990.89-1714,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2258.248,2266.323,"I thought it also established that some claims were denied, for instance the auto accident case."
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2266.323,2269.352,--That is incorrect.
1990.89-1714,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2322.05,2326.033,"Mr. Henriques, I didn't think that the car accident hypothetical was one that had been invented."
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2333.421,2335.467,I don't... I have never seen any reference.
1990.89-1714,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2370.485,2371.749,May I just clarify one thing?
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2378.027,2379.322,"--No, it is not."
1990.89-1714,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2380.182,2383.509,"A term... well, who, who introduced the word ""conclusively""?"
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2383.509,2384.571,--We coined it in our briefs--
1990.89-1714,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2384.571,2385.477,"Oh, well."
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2385.477,2387.383,--and it's fraught with problems.
1990.89-1714,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2389.772,2392.365,"It wouldn't be fraught with problems if it was in the regulation, but--"
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2392.365,2395.677,--The regulation does conclusively presume it in the sense that we use it--
1990.89-1714,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2395.677,2395.974,--I see.
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2395.974,2405.345,--because it says on its face HEW recognized the act's requirement that miners be totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis.
1990.89-1714,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2416.481,2421.728,"Yes, but as I remember the text of the regulation, it does not say that the presumption is irrebuttable or conclusive."
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2421.728,2424.086,It doesn't use those words--
1990.89-1714,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2424.086,2424.305,Right.
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2424.305,2440.471,"--but it all but uses the words because it specifically says that you obtain the presumption by invoking the presumption, and then when you look at rebuttal there is no rebuttal test that addresses directly, or indirectly--"
1990.89-1714,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2440.471,2447.202,"No, that's true, but supposing, for example, after they get all through they find out that the man is just... is a forgery."
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2462.524,2466.429,--I believe it does say these two ways and no others.
1990.89-1714,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2482.563,2483.719,It doesn't say only.
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2489.029,2489.404,Right.
1990.89-1714,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2489.404,2493.841,"If could have said may be rebutted only if, if it really meant that those are the only ways to do it."
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2493.841,2506.522,"Well, any doubt about that is certainly resolved, and I don't think there is doubt about it because the natural reading of the regulation, I think, would be that you list two rebuttal tests, you certainly... a disability causation under the statute is an element."
1990.89-1714,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2513.551,2523.111,"Well, that might be a natural reading if it wouldn't lead to such a natural result that somebody who dies in an automobile accident gets compensated for dying from black lung."
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2526.374,2543.054,"--But the... but HEW had a, had a line-drawing problem, and if they, in order to draw a line that would have excluded the car accident hypothetical it would have been extremely difficult if not impossible to not exclude deserving claimants."
1990.89-1714,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2552.535,2553.004,"Yes, but--"
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2568.42,2584.444,"The... one of the judgments that an agency would make is what's the likelihood that there will be cases that would win for, with respect to underserving clients."
1990.89-1714,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2610.401,2610.714,"Well, what about these cases?"
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2638.876,2646.483,"These three cases are, we think, paradigm cases for the wisdom of HEW's rule."
1990.89-1714,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2646.483,2649.091,Are there a lot of these cases out there somewhere?
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2649.091,2650.918,Like the three cases here?
1990.89-1714,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2650.918,2651.464,Like these?
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2651.464,2655.323,These are... these are absolutely typical kinds of cases in the law.
1990.89-1714,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2655.323,2656.4,"How many, thousands of them?"
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2656.4,2665.115,"The Government estimates that the remaining number of cases is anywhere from 2,500 up to a couple thousand more."
1990.89-1714,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2668.364,2674.393,"Well, but not 2,500 cases in which the ALJ has found there was either no causation or no black lung disease at all."
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2674.393,2678.314,"Yeah, when I... excuse me, Justice Stevens."
1990.89-1714,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2680.766,2681.047,Remain.
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2717.345,2733.368,"Well, the agency had to... did take that into consideration, and the Comptroller General's report that talks about HEW's decisions in this regard makes it clear just now difficult it is to tell pneumoconiosis apart from other conditions."
1990.89-1714,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2735.462,2741.849,Which means that in 99 cases out of 100 close cases the miner will win when he gets the presumption.
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2741.849,2743.943,And in... that is so.
1990.89-1714,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2847.465,2859.398,"But it seems to me you eliminate the backlog just as effectively by simply adopting a presumption and then, although you may have ability to rebutting it... to rebut it, simply not rebutting it."
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2859.398,2870.566,"The... but again, nothing would have prevented physicians from issuing decisions that HEW had already determined could not be accurate."
1990.89-1714,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2906.177,2908.723,I don't understand where these physicians would come from.
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2926.872,2927.122,--No.
1990.89-1714,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2931.041,2931.556,No.
1990.89-1714,2,30688,julian_n_henriques_jr,,2941.443,2953.689,"--Well, the, the backlog... HEW still would have had to assess the medical evidence, obtain it and then assess it, which was an enormous administrative undertaking, whether or not it's focussed on invocation or on rebuttal."
1990.89-1714,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2974.446,2976.179,"Thank you, Mr. Henriques."
