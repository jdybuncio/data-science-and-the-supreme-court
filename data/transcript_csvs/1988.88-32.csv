1988.88-32,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.543,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-32, Massachusetts v. Morash."
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,47.762,50.73,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-32,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,241.731,248.024,"Mr. Valvo, is the regulation in a bit of tension with the language of the statute?"
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,248.024,250.399,"No, Your Honor."
1988.88-32,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,250.399,254.569,"Section 3(1) says,"
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,261.676,261.988,Right.
1988.88-32,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,289.555,291.789,They covered elsewhere.
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,291.789,292.459,Pardon me?
1988.88-32,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,292.459,294.444,Covered elsewhere in the statute.
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,298.286,312.515,"There are several provisions in the enumerated benefits in Taft-Hartley that were also mentioned in ERISA, and some in exactly the same language, some in slightly different language."
1988.88-32,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,360.074,363.9,"Mr. Valvo, why does the regulation cover this?"
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,380.987,382.737,"I have two answers to that, Your Honor."
1988.88-32,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,387.015,390.544,Why don't we look at where... where is it in the--
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,390.544,392.653,--That is at page 11 of the reply brief.
1988.88-32,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,392.653,396.995,--Is this it?
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,396.995,397.23,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.88-32,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,410.179,411.162,It's at page 11?
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,411.162,412.068,--Page 11 of the reply.
1988.88-32,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,464.375,469.139,But one can also read that this is compensation for time not worked.
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,470.903,471.716,--(B)(1)?
1988.88-32,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,471.716,473.48,--It's in lieu of the vacation.
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,477.729,478.915,"Well, let me give you an example."
1988.88-32,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,485.023,485.741,Correct.
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,485.741,494.362,"If he gets four weeks vacation... what the employer is telling him is... I will pay you $20,000, and you work 48 weeks."
1988.88-32,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,506.593,508.436,"No, but he has been compensated for that week."
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,508.436,516.681,"--Well, he'll get regular installments of 52 or 12, whatever the arrangement is, of the $20,000."
1988.88-32,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,534.846,539.83,"But, if he takes that, he's not getting paid for time worked, cause he got paid during the 49th week."
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,542.813,543.078,"Well, yes."
1988.88-32,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,543.078,544.577,--If you just look at the language of the regulation.
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,544.577,555.978,"You... you're right in the sense that he received his regular paycheck, but that regular paycheck was nothing more than an installment on the $20,000 that he was getting for working 48 weeks."
1988.88-32,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,653.048,656.593,Is that a severance benefit then?
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,656.593,658.484,"No, Your Honor, it's not a severance."
1988.88-32,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,667.948,681.506,"Well, what if the employer would allow employees to make an irrevocable deferral of vacation benefits, which would be available to the employee, only on termination of the employment, or in an emergency?"
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,681.506,685.378,"Well, then you're getting... then you're talking about an arrangement, which we don't have here--"
1988.88-32,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,685.378,686.159,Right.
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,686.159,691.954,--That may be described by the statutory definition of pension.
1988.88-32,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,693.984,696.031,Would that be a severance benefit of some kind?
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,696.031,704.544,"--Well, the ERISA section 3(2) talks about pension benefits, as opposed to welfare benefits."
1988.88-32,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,721.926,734.734,"Well, that... I... do you think a worker who... I mean, do we know that a worker who has, let's say, two weeks of vacation pay that he hasn't taken in a particular year... could he have come up to the employer, and said,"
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,738.904,741.169,"This record permits that inference, but--"
1988.88-32,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,741.169,741.622,"Oh, it does?"
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,741.622,746.73,"--But, it also permits the inference that the employee could have deferred vacation time, and taken vacation time."
1988.88-32,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,754.834,759.504,"Well, but, if that makes a difference, then I don't know how we're suppose to handle it?"
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,759.504,768.391,"--Well, there's nothing in the record that requires you to find that there was an irrevocable deferral to termination or beyond."
1988.88-32,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,877.051,886.439,"But, the hypothesis for (b)(3), or one of the hypotheses for invoking it, as I read it, is that, during the time a person, the employee, performs no duties."
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,893.139,895.53,"--Well, then we're talking about (b)(1)."
1988.88-32,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,896.154,897.872,"Well, but, I mean, I thought--"
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,897.872,898.685,--It depends on how you look at it.
1988.88-32,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,898.685,902.776,"--Well, how does one look at (b)(3), and get it to apply?"
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,902.776,913.724,"Because, if you see these payments as an aggregation of the monies that would be paid... here's the termination date, and they have unused vacation time left."
1988.88-32,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,922.83,928.734,"Well, that really takes some kind of astigmatism to look at it that way, doesn't it?"
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,928.734,938.011,"Well, it's, it's... imagine an employee who has... he's hired with the understanding that he accrues one day of vacation a month."
1988.88-32,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,968.624,971.763,"Why don't we... the government's brief says,"
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,983.415,984.852,That's what we have here.
1988.88-32,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,984.852,985.82,"Well, I know."
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,992.349,996.91,"Well, it's interpreting the payroll practices regulation, which includes--"
1988.88-32,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,996.91,997.379,What part of it?
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,997.379,998.129,--(B)(1).
1988.88-32,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1003.204,1018.385,"Well, at least the government has interpreted its own regulation to cover this case, and I suppose we... if, if that's a reasonable interpretation of its regulation, I suppose we would accept it."
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,1018.385,1021.728,"--Well, I'm happy to accept that, you know, I would like you to--"
1988.88-32,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1021.728,1022.212,"But, how can we know whether it would?"
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,1028.069,1034.286,"--Well, Your Honor, the difficulty is that these vacation payments, can be viewed in different ways."
1988.88-32,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1036.425,1041.156,"Well, the government filed a... the government has filed a brief in another case, that it served on you, didn't it?"
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,1041.156,1041.781,--Yes.
1988.88-32,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1041.781,1043.454,What did it say in that?
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,1043.454,1053.558,"I think that it was referring only to the... a footnote that described severance, the distinction between severance and vacation."
1988.88-32,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1122.015,1128.262,"Well, what type of statute is not generally applicable criminal law, then, in your view?"
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,1131.48,1140.977,"A statute... certainly, a statute that made it a crime not to pay pension payments, or not to make contributions into a ERISA welfare benefit plan."
1988.88-32,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1171.761,1174.228,It's an original proposition.
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,1179.898,1201.92,"--Well, it applies to activity beyond ERISA and, therefore, when we're talking about an exemption from ERISA, we have to assume that Congress, in using the term, which has received no attention in the legislative history, was thinking, in terms of ERISA, what is generally applicable beyond ERISA."
1988.88-32,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1201.92,1211.182,"Well, if we agree with you on the first part of your argument, and agree with the government's position, we certainly don't have to rest it on this argument, I assume?"
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,1211.182,1211.868,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1988.88-32,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1213.587,1220.678,"But, under your view, the law is applicable, only that applies just to ERISA, and nothing more?"
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,1220.678,1225.301,"Well, if a generally applicable criminal law--"
1988.88-32,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1225.301,1226.176,Just to an ERISA criminal law?
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,1226.176,1233.095,"--can be applied to an ERISA activity, but it has to be able to apply to conduct beyond ERISA activity."
1988.88-32,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1234.392,1244.183,"Let's take the example you've already given... a statute, you say, that applies to employee benefits, you say, would not be generally applicable?"
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,1244.183,1247.964,If those benefits were delivered only by ERISA plan.
1988.88-32,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1247.964,1250.603,"Ah, but, all it says is employee benefits."
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,1250.603,1251.822,"Well, we don't know that."
1988.88-32,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1252.634,1253.119,"All it says, is,"
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,1260.646,1260.834,--Yes.
1988.88-32,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1261.178,1266.019,"So, you pretty much have to have a state law that says... makes it a crime to fail to comply with ERISA?"
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,1266.019,1268.362,xxx even if it says--
1988.88-32,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1268.362,1270.393,"Do you think that's what Congress meant by ""generally applicable""?"
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,1270.393,1289.603,"--Well, Your Honor, if the activity... if the prohibited conduct, includes activity that can be engaged in, outside of an ERISA context, then Congress was willing to tolerate some supplementation, or touching of ERISA by criminal laws."
1988.88-32,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1294.195,1295.007,"It could have said,"
1988.88-32,0,20259,carl_valvo,,1303.331,1318.109,"But, we have to assume, that since it's an exemption from 514(a), that the same rules that apply to generally applicable civil statutes, don't apply to generally applicable criminal statutes, and there are a number of reasons for this."
1988.88-32,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1469.968,1471.093,Thank you Mr. Valvo.
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,1473.232,1491.802,"Now, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-32,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1552.919,1556.34,The Secretary of Labor says it isn't a plan at all.
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,1556.34,1560.024,"The Secretary of Labor says... well, I'm not sure, Your Honor, that the Secretary of Labor says--"
1988.88-32,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1560.024,1560.931,"Well, he has to say that."
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,1568.335,1572.785,"--Well, I'm not sure though, that the Secretary of Labor says this is not a plan at all."
1988.88-32,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1638.118,1644.053,"Okay, the Secretary in this case says this is not a plan within the meaning of the... within the meaning of the statute?"
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,1644.053,1649.27,"The Secretary, in this case, argues that it doesn't agree with the Supreme Judicial Court."
1988.88-32,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1649.629,1652.221,"Well, it says it isn't a plan, and its regulation says that,"
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,1666.856,1670.09,"My difficulty with that... if that's, indeed, what the Secretary is saying."
1988.88-32,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1695.298,1699.155,"Well, I know, but it still has to be a plan to provide vacation benefits."
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,1699.155,1699.765,"--But, but this--"
1988.88-32,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1699.765,1702.998,"It has to be a plan, and the Secretary says this isn't a plan."
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,1702.998,1706.763,--But the Secretary didn't have before it the aspects of a plan.
1988.88-32,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1722.319,1732.439,"Well, it certainly... it certainly... he certainly says... the Secretary certainly says that this plan, that this arrangement here, is not a plan."
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,1735.094,1740.92,I agree that the Secretary argues through the Solicitor that this particular approach is not a plan.
1988.88-32,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1777.546,1780.92,"Yes, why the Secretary interprets that regulation to cover this specific arrangement."
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,1780.92,1782.591,"--But, in that sense, I disagree."
1988.88-32,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1852.764,1862.902,"But, it was, nevertheless, some kind... could be viewed as compensation on account of work performed, such as a holiday premium."
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,1862.902,1865.338,Well--
1988.88-32,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1865.338,1869.04,"You could view it that way, certainly, within the language of the regulation?"
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,1869.04,1886.44,"--I actually feel that the first part of the regulation, which is, (b)(1), where it lists those four criteria, should be read specifically to those four type of criteria, because those four criteria essentially arise immediately."
1988.88-32,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1898.466,1902.651,"Well, nothing refers in the regulation to immediate payment though, does it?"
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,1902.651,1906.447,"No, but the examples given, are all immediate-payment examples."
1988.88-32,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1927.564,1929.189,"But, that's just an example."
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,1929.189,1933.842,"--The other five... there are four other examples, which are not provided by anyone, it appears."
1988.88-32,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1959.113,1967.314,"Well, in your view, what employee, or employer agreements to provide vacation benefits are not plans?"
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,1967.314,1968.468,Are not plans?
1988.88-32,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1968.468,1968.921,Yes.
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,1968.921,1979.043,"We would agree that any vacation time taken within a year, and paid for within that year, or any vacation time taken and paid for, is not a plan."
1988.88-32,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2005.204,2007.812,What if he gives you money for the two weeks that you didn't take?
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2007.812,2008.328,I think--
1988.88-32,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2008.328,2011.748,"At the end of this year, he gives you money for the two weeks you didn't take?"
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2011.748,2017.246,"--I think when a cash payout becomes involved, there begins to become an implication toward a plan."
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2051.279,2056.839,"How important are those words, ""entrusted with that fund"", because the point of the regulation is, there's no trust fund."
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2060.884,2064.899,"I think that's why the... I think that's the distinction, exactly."
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2064.899,2066.71,That's a distinction the government draws.
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2066.71,2068.989,"That's exactly the distinction I'm drawing, too."
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2070.553,2072.88,"But then, why don't you lose under that distinction... that what I don't understand."
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2072.88,2074.005,"--Well, let me--"
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2074.005,2075.456,Because the regulation just reads right on it.
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2079.456,2081.813,"--Well, let me try to explain it somewhat differently, then."
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2093.246,2100.524,"Yes, but on account of work that had been performed prior to termination, because he had earned so many days of vacation, for which he had not been paid."
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2111.613,2113.097,He accrued that time.
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2117.893,2121.438,"Well, but the point is that then the regulation just reads right on your case."
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2121.438,2127.404,"No, because the regulation reads... the way I read the regulation is for periods of time not worked where pay continues."
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2127.404,2127.638,"No, no."
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2148.926,2156.892,"First of all, I think that if the Secretary had intended to cover a vacation premium, within (b)(1), he would have written it within (b)(1), just as he did within (b)(3)."
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2167.045,2175.651,"What if you get a Christmas bonus every year of $10 a month, say for every month where he had... so he got $120 coming at Christmas."
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2186.708,2188.879,"--No, I don't think it would be just like the vacation."
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2200.031,2202.859,"Yes, but on this record, we don't know, or do we... I'm not entirely clear."
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2210.105,2214.415,"--In fact, the bank paid the two employees for time accrued within that year."
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2214.415,2215.821,"Oh, that's right, up to January."
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2215.821,2216.04,They did.
1988.88-32,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2222.146,2245.776,"Maybe the answer to Justice Stevens questions is, that you can't (b)(1) that way, because the Secretary doesn't read it that way, because the Secretary acknowledges that if you have a joint vacation arrangement... the employee is working for a number of different employers, and the vacation is funded, then it would, indeed, be an employee welfare benefit plan."
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2251.698,2253.651,"But, in fact--"
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2253.651,2256.244,"If you have several employers, and you have a trustee funding the whole thing, it doesn't fit."
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2256.244,2261.366,"--But, but, in fact, the payment out of these vacation trust funds--"
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2261.366,2263.959,I think you're not understanding here xxx.
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2263.959,2266.536,"--I can only think of one case, and not a case by this Court."
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2281.748,2285.059,"But, the regulation wouldn't read on that case."
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2285.059,2287.418,"Well, but, it wouldn't read on that case, but the same issues are involved."
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2287.418,2290.573,"Well, except it's not payment by an employer in that case."
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2290.573,2294.947,"Well, in that case, the employer made the entire payment to the fund, and the fund distributed the payment in a year period."
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2301.304,2303.272,Except for the distinction that the government relies on.
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2305.989,2309.785,"--But, a distinction again, that I think creates a great tension with the statute."
1988.88-32,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2334.4,2350.94,"How do you understand the Secretary's position... or what do you understand the Secretary of Labor's position to be, with regard to an irrevocable deferral of vacation benefits, payable only on termination?"
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2350.94,2362.575,"From, from my review of the solicitor's brief, which is all I have on that position... the solicitor seems to point to the word ""irrevocable"" to be the distinction between that situation and this situation."
1988.88-32,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2362.575,2366.262,"And, to acknowledge that that might be a covered ERISA plan?"
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2366.262,2367.088,That's the way I read it.
1988.88-32,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2367.088,2374.961,"Now, do you take the position that there is evidence in this record that this is that kind of plan?"
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2374.961,2376.616,I can't take that position.
1988.88-32,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2376.616,2377.804,You cannot?
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2377.804,2381.849,"I cannot take that position, because I'm not... I don't see the evidence of that within the record."
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2522.902,2526.414,"Mr. Berger, I haven't read the American Motors opinion."
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2528.508,2530.367,It's in the Solicitor's brief.
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2530.367,2531.507,It's in the Solicitor's brief?
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2531.507,2533.179,"In fact, it's in a footnote of the Solicitor's brief."
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2533.179,2535.193,Would you... do you happen to have it handy?
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2536.006,2537.506,"Well, we just happen to have it handy."
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2540.441,2540.957,Thank you.
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2540.957,2565.479,"I'd like to turn to... one argument the Commonwealth makes in their brief... in their reply brief... not here, with regard to vacation being equated with wages."
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2652.85,2654.177,"May I ask you another question, Mr. Berger?"
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2654.177,2654.536,--Sure.
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2654.536,2657.395,I guess I really didn't understand this case.
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2669.922,2671.358,I believe that's a severance plan.
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2671.358,2672.327,That would be covered by ERISA?
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2672.327,2673.17,"I think, if--"
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2673.17,2680.26,"Every employer who has that kind of practice is covered by this statute, must maintain all the recordkeeping, and all the rest of it?"
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2680.26,2680.604,--I believe it is.
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2688.896,2691.88,"Well then, I think probably every employer in the country must be covered by the statute."
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2695.753,2698.003,--I think we'd all like to believe that's true.
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2699.659,2704.688,"--I mean, even if they give him one day's pay, or a watch, or something, that would be a--"
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2704.688,2705.75,--I'm not sure the watch would be covered.
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2707.828,2709.217,--Have to be cash?
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2709.217,2710.014,I think so.
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2710.014,2710.592,Why?
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2710.592,2712.247,Why wouldn't the watch--
1988.88-32,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2712.247,2713.919,Does the statute require benefits be payable in cash?
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,2713.919,2715.184,--No.
1988.88-32,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3191.615,3193.849,You have about one minute.
1988.88-32,1,28898,jason_berger,,3193.849,3195.942,"That's all it will take, I think."
1988.88-32,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3227.429,3229.804,"Mr. Valvo, do you have anything further?"
1988.88-32,2,20259,carl_valvo,,3229.804,3233.412,"Unless the Court has questions, I can rest on my arguments, sir."
1988.88-32,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3233.412,3234.005,Very well.
