2016.16-605,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.13,"We'll hear argument next in Case 16-605, the Town of Chester v. Laroe Estates. Mr. Katyal."
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,6.13,13.9,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Had Laroe filed the lawsuit against the Town of Chester, it would have been dismissed for lack of standing."
2016.16-605,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,73.43,78.385,It sets up a difference between intervening on the defendant's side and the plaintiff's side.
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,89.84,93.11,"Yeah, I don't know that there is any sort of disuniformity."
2016.16-605,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,147.28,154.43,You're saying the intervenor must have the same standing as a plaintiff would have.
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,185.91,193.695,"So -- so we think with respect to (a)(2) intervenors, they are full-blown parties. That's what this Court in Eisenstein said."
2016.16-605,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,212.71,214.4,How about permissive intervenors?
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,214.4,223.13,"Permissive intervenors are absolutely different, as our brief explains, because 24(b) allows Federal courts to impose all sorts of restrictions on them."
2016.16-605,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,280.81,288.385,-- wrong with doing this. Say -- think if a -- a party wants a court to do something.
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,323.255,325.575,"So, Justice Breyer, we agree with much of that."
2016.16-605,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,341.93,342.46,They may disagree --
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,342.46,343.03,Put the two and a half --
2016.16-605,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,343.03,344.79,-- perhaps with the argument.
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,352.4,352.97,"Correct, but --"
2016.16-605,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,352.97,360.8,"But if he doesn't want anything different than what they've already asked for, why does Article III insist that he have standing?"
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,360.8,371.1,"Justice Breyer, I'm unaware of anyone who thinks that they're -- that they're somehow a better lawyer than someone else who doesn't think that they would have a different take with respect to claims, relief, discovery --"
2016.16-605,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,371.1,371.31,This case --
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,371.31,371.75,-- jury trial --
2016.16-605,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,371.75,372.86,This very case.
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,383.52,384.9,"Well, let's take this very case."
2016.16-605,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,396.66,397.13,But why is there --
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,397.13,404.65,"Even that, I think there's an asterisk about, but -- which I'll explain in a minute, but everything about the trial strategy, any -- they haven't disclaimed any of that."
2016.16-605,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,404.65,404.89,But why --
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,404.89,405.64,And that's true about --
2016.16-605,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,405.64,420.035,"-- do you think there is a real difference, Mr. Katyal, between claims in relief on the one hand, in which case, yes, you need standing too, and everything else on the other hand, in which case, there's somebody with standing who has those claims, who seeks that relief."
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,432.22,433.41,So for two reasons.
2016.16-605,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,478.02,484.65,"Mr Katyal, I am totally confused with the permissive and -- or automatic."
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,509.485,510.04,So Justice --
2016.16-605,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,510.04,520.085,Why -- why is there some sort of added burden with respect to automatic that doesn't exist with respect to permissive?
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,520.085,522.16,I might not have been clear. It's not about the label.
2016.16-605,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,549.23,549.38,Does it --
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,549.38,550.605,That's often how --
2016.16-605,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,550.605,580.08,"But does it matter to you what -- at what point the Article III determination you say is required is made? I mean, I would think that -- why would it be necessary to do that at the outset? Why wouldn't it be when you get an intervenor who decides -- certainly if he is going to raise a different claim, but also is the one and the plaintiff is not the one imposing particularly burdensome discovery, can you wait until then, when the other party objects, and say, well, now I've got to look at your Article III standing, because you're doing something that changes the litigation?"
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,580.08,584.17,"Mr. Chief Justice, we -- we don't think we have to win that by any stretch."
2016.16-605,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,662.98,678.975,Could Congress -- could Congress enact a statute that provides for intervention of right for someone who doesn't satisfy Article III? There are -- there are several statutes that do provide for intervention of right.
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,678.975,682.21,So -- so I think that it depends on what intervention means.
2016.16-605,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,696.28,701.95,"Well, it's got to be conditioned on there being a party with standing remaining in the suit."
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,701.95,704.95,And I think the fact that there's a party with standing remaining --
2016.16-605,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,704.95,705.86,That will solve that problem.
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,705.86,707.84,"I don't think it totally does, Justice Kennedy."
2016.16-605,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,734.99,744.985,"So putting -- putting intervenors aside, suppose ten plaintiffs got together and brought a suit, so they were all joined in the same suit."
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,765.68,776.23,"They do not, Justice Kagan. And the reason why, and this is what I was saying at the outset, is that intervenors -- (a)(2) intervenors are situated differently from those plaintiffs, because plaintiffs generally march in lockstep."
2016.16-605,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,787.39,790.205,I think it is very odd that you can be an actual party.
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,803.68,808.58,"So -- well, I think that, you know, to the extent that some party didn't have standing, it might be tested at that point."
2016.16-605,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,852.99,874.72,"Mr. Katyal, I was trying to understand the -- the universe of cases in which a party -- someone seeking intervention would be able to come in under 24(a)(2) by claiming an interest relating to the property or transaction, but would not be able to claim injury in fact."
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,909.34,910.11,We don't think it is.
2016.16-605,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,910.82,911.08,Why not?
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,911.08,915.45,"First is, we do think that the rule tracks Article III, and they basically move coextensively."
2016.16-605,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,942.93,947.76,"Well, I -- I -- it's almost as if -- I had the same trouble with -- as Justice Alito did."
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,961.845,964.77,I do -- I do think that's the way the case comes to the Court.
2016.16-605,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,971.825,982.565,"On Justice Alito's point, if, as a practical matter, you have an interest to protect, that almost sounds like a shorthand for standing."
2016.16-605,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,982.565,987.26,Completely agree that the -- that the rule and Article III track the same thing.
2016.16-605,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,988.085,998.23,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Harrington."
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,998.23,1050.34,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The best reading of Rule 24(a)(2) is that it requires an intervenor, as a right, to demonstrate that he has Article III standing by showing that he has a cognizable interest cognizable under Article III, and that it could be impaired by the disposition of the pending lawsuit. I'd like to start where Justice Ginsburg started by focusing on how it works, sort of how you establish standing when you're talking about intervenors, and particularly, defendant intervenors. Like Justice Ginsburg, most of the courts of appeals that have held the other way have held that standing is not required, have focused on whether an intervenor can establish standing to initiate a lawsuit. But in our view, that is not the appropriate focus. What the rule itself focuses on is whether an intervenor could be injured by the disposition of the pending lawsuit. And so the -- it's -- it's much more like asking whether a party has standing to appeal than it is like asking whether a party would have standing to initiate a lawsuit."
2016.16-605,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1074.835,1081.31,"In -- in what sense, if any, is your position different from that of the Petitioner's?"
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1081.31,1083.83,I think it's not particularly different.
2016.16-605,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1131.525,1132.98,Why did they bother?
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1132.98,1133.98,Why did they --
2016.16-605,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1133.98,1141.8,"I -- if -- if the only issue is standing, totally different language was used by the rule drafters."
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1169.9,1171.19,So there are sort of two parts to your question.
2016.16-605,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1182.63,1183.63,"Well, that's great."
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1196.345,1224.895,"It was different, but the -- but the Standing Doctrine and intervention rules have always required that an intervenor or a party have an interest. And this Court, going back to the beginning of the 20th century, has said that you -- that an interest that is contingent or hypothetical is not sufficient for intervention, just like it had said it's not sufficient for standing. Now, the predecessor to the 1966 version of the rule allowed intervention as a right if a party would be bound by the judgment, or if a party had an actual interest in property that was going to be distributed by the court."
2016.16-605,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1233.29,1236.11,What kind of rule -- probably not -- I -- I don't know.
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1252.6,1257.925,"Justice Breyer, that's where I tend to start, that I think the -- the focus of the rule is on injury from the disposition of the lawsuit."
2016.16-605,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1278.38,1281.57,That gives the defendant standing to --
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1281.57,1283.49,It doesn't give --
2016.16-605,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1283.49,1287.53,-- take position to issue -- ask for subpoenas and so forth.
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1287.53,1287.93,Right.
2016.16-605,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1305.68,1306.31,I see your point.
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1306.31,1307.105,-- and protect his interest.
2016.16-605,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1307.105,1312.205,"Ms. Harrington, I really get confused when you invoke the Doctrine of Constitutional Avoidance."
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1312.205,1312.62,Yes.
2016.16-605,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1312.62,1326.095,"So as I understand it, you're saying, well, all right, Rule 24 is old and Lujan is new, but let's match them up, and any ambiguity we ought to just ignore or construe in your favor because of the Doctrine of Constitutional Avoidance."
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1345.745,1346.075,That's the --
2016.16-605,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1346.075,1347.495,Is there -- is there a precedent --
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1347.495,1347.78,Yes.
2016.16-605,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1347.78,1349.99,-- for applying that doctrine in quite that way?
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1349.99,1351.66,"Let me, if I can, take the air out of something."
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1357.16,1357.79,-- that argument here.
2016.16-605,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1357.79,1359.365,I appreciate the candor of that concession.
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1359.365,1360.53,Yes. (Laughter.)
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1360.53,1367.69,"He is a very capable lawyer and has proven himself with respect to that argument, so we're not pressing that -- that argument here. A couple of --"
2016.16-605,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1367.69,1383.69,"Can I ask you the same question that I asked Mr. Katyal? Could Congress pass a statute that said give someone a right to intervene, someone who would not have Article III standing?"
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1383.69,1384.8,Yes.
2016.16-605,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1413.715,1415.79,I -- I'm not sure I understood your answer to the question.
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1427.935,1428.33,Yes.
2016.16-605,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1433.63,1434.01,Right.
2016.16-605,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1434.01,1436.415,There are -- there are several statutes.
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1436.415,1436.77,Yes.
2016.16-605,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1459.18,1469.935,So -- so you think it is satisfactory to -- it satisfies the constitutional requirement of standing if Congress says you have standing?
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1469.935,1470.925,No.
2016.16-605,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1470.925,1471.46,No.
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1471.46,1476.19,"No, the question was, if Congress says a party can intervene as of right, and doesn't require a showing of standing."
2016.16-605,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1481.84,1481.98,"Oh, sure."
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1481.98,1483.19,-- without then asking for a showing.
2016.16-605,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1483.19,1484.615,We don't have to go into that here.
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1484.615,1489.44,"No, you don't have to go into that. There have been a couple questions about sort of piggyback intervenors."
2016.16-605,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1515.41,1515.74,But there's --
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1515.74,1516.67,-- and has that incentive.
2016.16-605,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1516.67,1529.705,"-- that step that you keep referring to which doesn't make any sense under Article III, which is the one about whether the existing party is adequately protecting your interests."
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1529.705,1530.02,That's right.
2016.16-605,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1530.68,1545.23,"I -- let's assume they've hired the best lawyer in the world, and they've made every conceivable argument, but you're still a contract vendor or -- with the kind of potential injury that the others assume would give you standing."
2016.16-605,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1550.53,1556.13,"Well, tell me if I'm not getting your question right. In our view, Rule 24(a)(2) requires a showing of Article III standing."
2016.16-605,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1602.37,1609.71,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dvoretzky."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1609.71,1620.435,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner's effort to turn every intervention motion into a constitutional question is a solution in search of a problem."
2016.16-605,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1628.275,1636.84,"So somebody who has no connection, other than that they're very interested in the subject -- it's an environmental case, the Sierra Club wants to be involved."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1656.275,1660.32,"Mr. Chief Justice, Rule 24(a)(2) would not allow the party that --"
2016.16-605,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1660.32,1660.79,"No, no, I know."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1684.849,1690.34,Article III would not speak to that particular bad idea by Congress. (Laughter.)
2016.16-605,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1690.34,1692.605,"Now, I can't tell whether that's a yes or a no."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1692.605,1693.9,That is a yes.
2016.16-605,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1693.9,1695.925,That type of proceeding is okay.
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1695.925,1697.945,"Constitutionally, it is okay."
2016.16-605,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1711.31,1711.39,Now --
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1711.39,1712.19,-- taking the case and --
2016.16-605,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1712.19,1715.37,"-- I hope I haven't given Congress an idea, but -- (Laughter.)"
2016.16-605,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1715.37,1722.405,"I mean, is that consistent with what we've said, that Article III standing plays an essential role in the separation of powers?"
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1722.405,1735.39,"Absolutely, because the purpose of Article III, its core purpose, is to prevent courts from issuing advisory opinions about the actions of the political branches, absent a need to do so, absent a case or controversy."
2016.16-605,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1735.39,1740.91,"Well, what if it's a -- as it goes along, the defendant says, well, I'm going to settle with the original plaintiff."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1750.08,1770.62,"No, because at that point, there would no longer be a case or controversy for the Sierra Club to participate in, absent its own injury that it was pursuing relief for. The -- the key -- the key point under Article III is that its purpose is to prevent the judicial machinery from being mobilized in the first instance, and opining on the actions of the political branches --"
2016.16-605,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1770.62,1783.135,"Can you give me a hypothetical example of a case where an intervention should be allowed, because it's important, but there's no Article III standing? Maybe outside of the context of this suit? I think there may be Article III standing."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1795.4,1799.025,I think defendant intervenors are the best example of that.
2016.16-605,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1813.48,1815.94,"Here, of course, we have a plaintiff intervenor, correct?"
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1815.94,1816.795,Yes.
2016.16-605,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1817.49,1822.39,Can you give me an example of that out -- outside of the context of this case?
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1822.39,1822.73,Sure.
2016.16-605,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1862.72,1864.23,"Well, I'll -- I'll look at Clapper."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1870.455,1871.5,Yes.
2016.16-605,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1871.7,1873.345,-- from meeting with their clients and so forth.
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1873.345,1876.77,"And I'm just building a hypothetical off of Clapper, so looking at Clapper --"
2016.16-605,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1876.77,1877.23,I understand.
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1877.23,1878.29,-- would track this.
2016.16-605,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1879.99,1892.22,"We've said it with respect to union members who we've permitted to intervene, even though the union has all of the claimed contract rights."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1892.22,1893.88,"In the Trbovich case, that's right."
2016.16-605,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1893.88,1894.05,Yes.
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1894.05,1907.51,"What the Court recognized in Trbovich was that the union member could intervene, not to assert separate claim or relief, but to present arguments, to potentially present evidence, and to protect the union members' interest in that case."
2016.16-605,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1907.51,1910.085,And would they lack Article III standing?
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1910.085,1920.495,"Well, the union member in Trbovich would lack Article III standing, because of the particular statute at issue there, in which Congress authorized only the Secretary of Labor to bring suit."
2016.16-605,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1920.495,1923.505,"No, but that's not an -- that's not an Article III question."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1927.929,1933.24,So -- so that would certainly be -- that would be a situation where the union member would not have a cause of action.
2016.16-605,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1933.24,1934.4,"Right, right."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1934.4,1939.1,"Presumably, if Congress had authorized the cause of action, we'd have to look at the union member's particular harm --"
2016.16-605,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1939.1,1955.6,"Could I come back to Justice Kennedy's question? Can you give me a real case, where there is -- where -- where you believe that the requirements of 24(a)(2) are met, but there is not -- there was not Article III standing?"
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1955.6,1958.69,"So, again, I think the defendant intervenor examples are --"
2016.16-605,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1958.69,1959.16,Plaintiff.
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1960.305,1963.27,So -- so let me talk for a moment about this case.
2016.16-605,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2019.13,2019.22,But --
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2019.22,2020.0,-- to be allowed to intervene.
2016.16-605,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2020.0,2026.715,"The Second Circuit has assumed otherwise, right? It decided this case on the assumption that there wasn't Article III standing, right?"
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2026.715,2030.1,It -- it didn't -- it did not decide the question on that assumption.
2016.16-605,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2043.91,2044.435,Right.
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2056.355,2057.285,It would.
2016.16-605,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2057.285,2063.955,The -- the question you want us to decide is a real estate law question under New York law.
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2063.955,2066.57,"Well, I'm -- I'm not asking you to decide that question."
2016.16-605,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2072.51,2086.53,"How does a defendant have standing? How does that work? What the government says is a defendant has standing because the judgment in the case may affect an interest of the defendant, a significant interest."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2089.2,2091.95,That's not an Article III standing inquiry.
2016.16-605,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2093.6,2116.105,"I mean, I don't see any more with the defendant, how you can find a defendant without standing on that basis? I mean, the reason I find it relevant is because I think the other side is arguing that an intervenor has to have standing in the sense that a defendant has to have standing, at least when you intervene on the side of the defendant, as most do."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2116.105,2128.35,"So, first of all, it doesn't make sense to speak about whether a defendant intervenor has standing because a defendant intervenor is not the one who is alleging an injury and invoking the authority of the court. Second of all --"
2016.16-605,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2128.35,2134.81,"Can we write an opinion and say the only people that have to have stand -- I mean, I don't know how to write this opinion unless you're talking about standing in general."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2154.695,2160.1,I think what you're driving at is the difficulty of writing an opinion that applies a standing --
2016.16-605,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2160.1,2161.68,"No, not the difficulty of writing an opinion."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2174.15,2179.02,The only sense in which there is defendant standing does not apply here.
2016.16-605,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2191.28,2200.55,What about when they ask for a subpoena to be enforced? I can't go in and -- you can't -- people can't just go in randomly and say I'd like to have a subpoena enforced against so and so.
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2200.55,2209.455,"No, of -- of course not, and a defendant can do that as part of an Article III case or controversy once there already is an existing case or controversy."
2016.16-605,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2209.455,2211.46,"Well, let's put aside the question of intervention."
2016.16-605,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2226.83,2228.985,How can that possibly be?
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2228.985,2233.95,"Most defendants would be happy to accept that, and the anomaly that you're pointing out is defendant --"
2016.16-605,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2233.95,2236.13,But then the case would go on without me.
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2236.13,2243.045,The anomaly that you're pointing out is precisely why it doesn't make sense to ask the question whether defendants have standing.
2016.16-605,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2283.9,2284.0,Okay.
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2319.434,2351.575,"I think this goes to the question of what is the standard for having standing. In other words, what is it that you might want to do differently that would require you to have standing. And the only thing that you might want to do differently that would require standing is asserting a different claim or seeking a different form of relief. Not making a different argument, even potentially injecting a constitutional argument the way amici do, and not seeking discovery or subpoenas, because those are not a claim or form of relief with which Article III is concerned."
2016.16-605,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2351.575,2362.18,"Counsel, on -- on that score, why isn't that exactly the case we have here? The Plaintiff in this case, by way of relief, seeks a money damages for the taking."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2400.355,2412.54,"Justice Gorsuch, the way in which this case has been litigated, and trial counsel conceded this in the Second Circuit, I'll represent it to you here today, we are not seeking separate relief only in our name."
2016.16-605,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2412.54,2415.07,"Well, except for the complaint expressly says that."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2415.07,2422.245,"The -- the complaint says that, but oftentimes the complaint says one thing and over the course of the litigation the theories might develop differently."
2016.16-605,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2442.71,2445.37,So you're disclaiming the relief sought in your complaint.
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2445.37,2447.07,We are disclaiming --
2016.16-605,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2447.07,2449.325,Is there any relief you're seeking at this stage?
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2449.325,2461.515,"The relief that we are seeking is to maximize Sherman's recovery because we have a stake in that recovery, and it's a stake that Rule 24(a)(2) protects and gives us an ability to -- to intervene --"
2016.16-605,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2461.515,2474.395,"Would you agree though that if an intervenor did seek relief in its own name, that that would be relief beyond that which the plaintiff would be entitled to provide? I mean, after all, plaintiff normally doesn't have standing to seek a judgment in someone else's name."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2478.335,2487.44,If -- if by the normal case you mean a situation where an intervenor comes in and asks for either additional money or money to be paid separately --
2016.16-605,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2487.44,2489.645,Or just a judgment in its favor.
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2489.645,2507.44,So whether it's a judgment in its favor I think depends really on the scope of the judgment. This Court has repeatedly affirmed judgments in favor of plaintiffs without inquiring into their standing once it had assured itself that at least one plaintiff in the case had standing.
2016.16-605,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2519.51,2520.95,"I'm sorry for interrupting, counselor."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2528.675,2532.53,If the -- the question is whether the judgment requires --
2016.16-605,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2532.53,2537.155,The question is whether a plaintiff can seek a judgment against a defendant in someone else's name.
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2541.56,2543.01,"No, generally not."
2016.16-605,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2543.11,2543.455,Okay.
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2554.16,2567.32,"Not -- not necessarily and not the way this Court has considered the question in numerous cases where it's affirmed judgments in favor of parties without standing, or at least without inquiring into their standing."
2016.16-605,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2567.32,2569.39,I'll let you go.
2016.16-605,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2569.39,2570.79,"Well, I -- I may not."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2585.21,2600.39,"In -- in Department of Commerce v. U.S. House of Representatives, Clinton v. New York, Bowsher v. Synar, these are all cases where the Court has expressly said, we satisfy ourselves of the jurisdiction -- of the standing of one plaintiff and need not inquire further."
2016.16-605,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2600.39,2600.71,"Well, no."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2627.775,2628.43,"Well, no."
2016.16-605,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2652.435,2653.01,"Well, no."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2666.93,2677.79,"You -- you are, but you are not exercising the authority of the court in a way that's relevant to Article III, because you're not seeking a separate claim or a separate form of relief. What Article III is --"
2016.16-605,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2677.79,2679.39,But that just seems to me to be circular.
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2681.65,2696.81,The reason I don't think it's circular is the purpose of Article III is not to micromanage the conduct of litigation and how litigation is conducted; it's to prevent courts from interjecting themselves into a controversy in the first place.
2016.16-605,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2696.81,2699.99,"That's the argument -- your argument in your brief, you focus on case or controversy."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2718.53,2747.31,"Article III standing is an element of the case or controversy requirement or an interpretation of the case or controversy requirement, but the requirement that this Court has imposed in order to have standing, is an -- an intervenor's that is injured, imminently, or concretely has been injured, traceability, and redressability, all with respect to a particular claim and a form of relief, not with respect to things that happened along the way in litigation."
2016.16-605,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2747.31,2747.41,No.
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2766.07,2776.15,"Well, I think the -- the reason for carving it off, again, goes back to the purposes of Article III, which are not to police every single exercise of judicial power."
2016.16-605,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2793.785,2797.105,But -- but we're talking about mandatory intervention.
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2824.0,2829.74,I think this goes to a key premise of the Petitioner's argument that I want to make sure to clarify.
2016.16-605,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2896.42,2903.285,Suppose somebody was a plaintiff and was dismissed for lack of standing.
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2912.34,2925.5,"In theory, if the person satisfied the requirements for an interest that may be impaired and so forth under Rule 24, then, yes, but not just any plaintiff could, then, come back in as an intervenor."
2016.16-605,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2925.5,2929.355,"You would have to meet the 24(a) requirements, of course."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2929.355,2930.57,Yes.
2016.16-605,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2930.57,2931.825,Which are stringent.
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2931.825,2954.37,"Exactly, Justice Ginsburg. The -- the Petitioner's contrary theory here, that Article III polices every action of every court, is contrary to a number of settled principles. One, I mentioned it's contrary to the one-plaintiff rule, which this Court has applied repeatedly."
2016.16-605,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3009.265,3026.9,"On the defendant's side -- I mean, on the -- why can't we just say simple? It's -- defendants are there because the court might affect their -- their behavior, do something they don't want to do or -- or affect their property in a way they don't want."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3052.055,3059.425,"Because Rule 24 and Article III serve different purposes, as reflected in Rule 24's distinct language."
2016.16-605,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3178.415,3219.97,"Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that -- because I think, as I read the district court's opinion here, they assumed you were asking for judgment in your name, because they were treating you as a contract vendor or vendee, and they were saying, you don't have the right to have a judgment in your name. Would that holding have been wrong, absent your current concession that -- that you are not seeking money in your own name, but just a payment of money?"
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3219.97,3224.85,"Justice Sotomayor, that -- that was not the state of play before the Second Circuit."
2016.16-605,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3251.2,3253.28,I have asked a different hypothetical.
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3275.34,3278.13,"If we hadn't, it would be a different case, but I think the court --"
2016.16-605,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3278.13,3280.75,And what would happen if it were a different case?
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3280.75,3290.52,"If it were a different case and we were asking for -- for money in our own name, I think an Article III standing inquiry would be appropriate in that situation, and for reasons that --"
2016.16-605,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3290.52,3306.395,"So your rule is always on a motion to intervene, there is a standing inquiry. The standing inquiry is whether or not you're asking for relief different from someone with a case or controversy."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3306.395,3319.35,"I would put it slightly differently, which is whether or not there needs to be a standing inquiry depends on whether the intervenor is seeking relief or asserting a claim different than the existing plaintiff."
2016.16-605,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3319.35,3321.235,Let's use a hypothetical.
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3321.235,3322.63,I'm sorry.
2016.16-605,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3322.63,3334.76,A -- a number of federal prisoners are similarly situated with respect to a claim that they're not being provided food consistent with their religious beliefs.
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3340.08,3340.895,Uh-huh.
2016.16-605,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3340.895,3341.59,Okay.
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3357.94,3361.87,I -- I think it depends on what relief the initial plaintiff is seeking.
2016.16-605,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3395.03,3398.88,"To the extent he's seeking relief only in his own name, an as-applied challenge."
2016.16-605,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3398.88,3408.29,"To an as -- if it were an as-applied challenge, then an additional plaintiff would need to show standing because the question, again, is what is the court ordering the defendant to do."
