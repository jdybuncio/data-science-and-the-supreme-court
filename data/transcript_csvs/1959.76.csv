1959.76,0,39049,richard_p_donaldson,,533.285,553.658,"No, it supplies the dispatching facilities which are necessary to send the cabs on various calls and so forth, then it supplies bookkeeping facilities where the money comes in once a week and the service corporation has bookkeepers who allocate that income among the various corporations."
1959.76,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,574.114,576.697,And he hires them for the service company?

1959.76,0,39049,richard_p_donaldson,,640.117,641.288,"Yes, there is, yes."
1959.76,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,644.001,647.188,But -- but your Supreme Court held that it was one.
1959.76,0,39049,richard_p_donaldson,,647.188,649.332,"They did not -- they adopt that question, Your Honor, yes."
1959.76,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,649.332,651.061,"Oh, I thought you said they did."
1959.76,0,39049,richard_p_donaldson,,651.061,652.58,"No, I said the trial court."
1959.76,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,652.58,653.921,"The trial court did, yes."
1959.76,0,39049,richard_p_donaldson,,653.921,657.947,"The Supreme Court said, assuming that it is one company, it still doesn't affect the commerce."
1959.76,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,657.947,659.952,Yes.
1959.76,0,39049,richard_p_donaldson,,659.952,670.701,"I might add to that, that that, in our opinion, would also be a question for the Labor Board because that would be a -- a step in deciding whether or not the Labor Board has jurisdiction."
1959.76,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,775.892,779.183,Was that denied if you --
1959.76,0,39049,richard_p_donaldson,,779.183,783.423,"No, I was going to add, the court below admitted that this was interstate commerce."
1959.76,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,783.423,787.644,(Inaudible)
1959.76,0,39049,richard_p_donaldson,,787.644,795.997,"I don't know what he'll do now, but he -- the court below did hold that this was interstate commerce but then they dismissed it as being de minimis."

1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1347.842,1360.659,"May I ask you, Mr. (Inaudible) had it together to use this service or the -- the service (Inaudible) What -- what's the relevance to our problem?"
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,1360.659,1363.267,"I don't think the relevance is substantial, Mr. Justice Frankfurter."
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1379.123,1386.791,From the -- the -- they could be tested as what the service company does and not what the customer's (Inaudible)
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,1386.791,1389.406,That was our position before the trial court.

1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,1695.801,1696.787,I'm sorry --
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1696.787,1698.306,Could been filed for lesser amount --

1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,1725.632,1726.252,No.
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1756.523,1764.668,"Well, now do the statute -- a fellow who doesn't know when to-- what taxicab he can get in Pennsylvania and New York Central station."
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,1775.294,1777.67,The dispatcher is employed by Yellow Cab Service.
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1778.129,1783.359,"Well, suppose this -- suppose that was taken over by an independent agency."
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,1783.359,1785.22,"Well, this is -- this is a local operation."
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1793.05,1797.747,(Inaudible)
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,1797.747,1805.359,"We concede if the strike had in fact (Inaudible) and that therefore, (Inaudible)"
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1858.744,1861.122,"But if there were such inconvenience, you think the --"
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,1861.122,1861.442,Yes.
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1861.442,1862.725,-- that the case would be different?
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,1862.725,1863.038,"Yes, if --"
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1863.038,1863.138,(Voice Overlap) --
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,1863.138,1868.797,If -- if they were established on this record that interstate travelers had been inconvenienced.
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1924.477,1932.794,"But doesn't the various of places, the various attractive (Inaudible) commerce imply potentiality and not actual results?"
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,1932.794,1940.1,The language of the statute itself is that their concern was something that has led -- had led to a labor dispute.
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1986.11,1988.926,Having read or tending to leave --
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,1988.926,1989.409,"Yes, but the --"
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1989.409,1989.93,Tending to leave --
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,1989.93,1991.005,-- the tending to leave would speak --
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1991.005,1992.211,Is the potentiality.
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,1992.211,1998.662,That is the potentiality that has not yet resulted in a work stoppage because the work stoppage is the ultimate thing that can happen.
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2001.343,2012.037,"But I suggest that tending to leave mean the kind of proof that you suggest is necessary, namely that in fact, and I want a fact here, I couldn't get one."
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2012.037,2028.585,"I would think that if the strike has been in effect, Your Honor and if the statute is to have the meaning, the -- the -- that the word “state,” it should be proved that it has in fact impaired the points at which it has claimed these local activities have a bearing on interstate commerce."
1959.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2028.585,2049.725,"Well, the plan to obstruct -- and for 23 days, they -- they operated from stockpile that -- that they has and every order is filled, there's been no interference with interstate commerce as a reality up to that time."
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2053.859,2057.145,"No, you could look ahead there, Your Honor, because that is an entirely different thing."
1959.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2065.214,2074.835,"Nor can you say the effect of a -- of a strike, 23 days after it starts, it might -- the end of a certain period, that situation might change."
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2074.835,2080.322,I think the impact of a strike of this kind is almost always the greatest at the outset.
1959.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2080.322,2084.228,"Well, it might -- it might be but it does have to always be that way?"
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2084.228,2098.436,"I think it would be in this case, Your Honor, and we submit that if counsel for the petitioners felt that there had been any actual burdening on commerce, that it was incumbent upon them to go into this matter and to make proof."
1959.76,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2214.069,2223.86,(Inaudible)
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2223.86,2239.112,"The language of the -- the language was that they would take jurisdiction with respect to instrumentalities, links, and channels of interstate commerce if $50,000 is derived from the interstate or linkage part of the enterprise."
1959.76,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2242.361,2246.985,(Inaudible)
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2246.985,2259.014,"That is the alternative ground on which we argue that -- that the $50,000 figure, we argue only as indicating that even the Board regards $1400 as de minimis."
1959.76,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2309.057,2315.434,"What you mean, as I understand it, does not affect commerce from (Inaudible)"
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2315.434,2321.564,"We say that there is no evidence it is -- it has affected it at all, the commerce that they are entitled to reach here."
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2324.627,2324.706,If --
1959.76,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2324.706,2325.356,(Inaudible)
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2325.356,2341.891,"-- if we're beyond that, then we say that all we're doing, under the case of United States against Yellow Cab Company, which is relied on by the State Supreme Court and which is good authority for this proposition, that all of this other business is a local business."
1959.76,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2360.716,2364.176,(Inaudible)
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2364.176,2365.819,It has to burden or obstruct it.
1959.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2410.774,2433.444,Are you going to discuss the effect of those contracts that Mr. Donaldson spoke of concerning the -- the keeping their -- their cabs there at the railroad companies and the superintendent of the station having jurisdiction over them and so forth for the accommodation of interstate passengers?
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2433.444,2443.76,"It is our position, Your Honor that this simply indicates that this volume of business would be brought within the ambit of that which might be regarded as possibly affecting commerce."
1959.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2499.399,2512.538,"Well then, as I understand you, if -- if some of those cabs had stopped and were not available for those railroad stations, that -- that it -- it would affect commerce and --"
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2512.538,2512.57,"Yes, it would have --"
1959.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2512.57,2513.499,-- it would have jurisdiction.
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2514.504,2515.12,Yes.
1959.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2515.12,2524.654,"But the fact that none of them did stop running under this particular kind of picketing that they engaged in, that the Board has no jurisdiction."
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2524.654,2533.002,"We contend that, as between this (Inaudible) and this respondent and, because they seem to be brought here by virtue of circumstances, the 118 separate cab companies."
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2591.296,2597.61,"Mr. Cox, may I put this to you."
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2624.608,2625.191,"Yes, Your Honor."
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2625.637,2627.314,May I put this to you.
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2631.161,2631.688,"Yes, Your Honor."
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2631.688,2633.701,The strike has lasted how many days?
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2633.701,2634.675,"Nearly a year and a half, Your Honor."
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2634.675,2636.054,Nearly a year and a half.
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2674.115,2677.004,"That is correct, Your Honor, although, as I stated a while ago, I've cited the record --"
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2677.004,2677.79,"Yes, I know."
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2677.79,2679.127,We represent that --
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2679.127,2679.145,I understand.
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2679.145,2680.684,-- it would be even more difficult today within --
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2680.684,2681.899,"Yes, but I understand that."
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2703.59,2704.449,"Yes, Your Honor."
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2710.056,2711.575,A year and a half.
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2711.575,2713.064,Or a year and a half.
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2741.792,2750.448,"But, I can't just -- my imagination is an equal to the effect of this -- with this (Inaudible) illegal to giving some reasons why they might not have been some interruption."
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2772.332,2784.179,"Well, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, the record makes clear that the effect of the picketing was that the respondent's 10 dispatchers did not come to work and that the employed drivers of the 118 corporations did not come to work."
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2809.754,2820.906,"Well then, maybe (Inaudible) that they put up -- put up with difficulties or waiting or whatnot."
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2832.773,2834.571,"We don't invite any speculation, Your Honor."
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2856.725,2865.418,"But that doesn't take care of that local situation, whatever it may have been in (Inaudible) maybe a special order of the magistrate, resourcefulness or whatnot."
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2876.441,2880.164,"Well, counsel suggested that by -- by posing the possibility of sympathy strikes."
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2884.88,2890.837,"Not sympathy but (Inaudible) happening in Detroit, Kalamazoo etcetera, etcetera."
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2890.837,2901.037,"But I would think, Your Honor, that the mere fact that you might have a -- situations each local and each in itself, not affecting commerce."
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2901.037,2917.076,"Local in the limited sense and to indicate it, namely not that it had no relation to the stream or whatever figure of speech you choose to use, inevitably (Inaudible) that it had a -- your argument is that is to attenuate it."
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2923.183,2930.276,We say that it is so local and so unrelated to the sort of interference with commerce that Congress had in mind.
1959.76,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2933.095,2943.086,All I'm suggesting is that the local -- that the act of locality may be repeated mandatorily making it more than local than nation in that in the District Court.
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2943.086,2952.567,"To that -- to that, Your Honor, we would answer that these being local disputes, the courts of each of these areas would work out these matters as we have submitted that the Court should hear."
1959.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2952.567,2972.828,"Mr. Cox, would you -- would your argument carry us far as to say that in any -- any business that merely affects commerce, that the jurisdiction of the Board depends upon whether there actually has been stoppage of -- of commerce by a strike and that they can't --"
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2972.828,2973.6,No.
1959.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2973.6,2976.392,-- their jurisdiction doesn't attach until there has been?
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2976.392,2977.672,"No, as I suggested, Your Honor."
1959.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2982.752,2983.723,"Well, on a strike?"
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2983.723,2984.944,And there is no strike yet.
1959.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2984.944,2987.098,Let's just take a strike like we have here.
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2987.098,2988.112,"Alright, take a strike."
1959.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2988.112,2988.617,Yes.
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,2988.617,3036.76,"It is our position that if there is a strike, that if the strike has gone on, and we'd like to think 24 days is a substantial period of time without any judicial restraint, that the first interest of any agency, whether it's the Board when its jurisdiction is invoked or the local court when it is asked to intervene, its first interest should be, now that we have an actual accomplished fact, a work stoppage which will impose the ultimate possible impact on commerce, has there been an impact on the interstate movement of goods or of passengers or one which as in Your Honor's example, will surely come when they head over the accident of having had some raw materials on hand."
1959.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3036.76,3044.529,"But suppose that -- suppose the Board wanted to exercise jurisdiction the first day of the strike, would it have had jurisdiction?"
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,3044.529,3075.221,"It would have -- it would have had jurisdiction if it could have been convinced over our proof to the contrary because even on the first day of the strike, we would have been able to offer some evidence that the owners had responded to this situation by providing through their own efforts, not bringing in any outsiders, they have provided whatever was necessary to maintain the interstate service."
1959.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3075.221,3082.486,"Well, do that mean that the Board must determine before it assumes jurisdiction whether the strike is to be successful or not?"
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,3082.486,3083.209,"No, Your Honor."
1959.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3084.987,3087.575,"But there was -- we got one here, the one we're talking about."
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,3089.186,3089.49,The first day.
1959.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3089.49,3090.929,"It's the first day, not that they --"
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,3090.929,3098.124,"We would -- we would say, Your Honor, that, at that point, the Board would proceed to consider the possibilities --"
1959.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3098.124,3100.174,"Not would, but could proceed."
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,3100.174,3100.18,Yes.
1959.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3100.18,3101.824,We're talking about jurisdiction and --
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,3101.824,3101.934,Yes.
1959.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3101.934,3102.356,power.
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,3103.788,3106.652,"We -- we would concede that, in any case, in this case even."
1959.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3106.652,3106.948,Yes.
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,3106.948,3112.722,It was entire and we did not object on the grounds of irrelevance to the proof that we service as these -- these terminals.
1959.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3152.868,3155.141,That would oust the Board of jurisdiction?
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,3155.141,3168.309,"If the Board felt that the proof given by the employers was that there would not be the interruption which reasonable inference might have seem to indicate, that it would oust them of jurisdiction."
1959.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3168.309,3169.336,"Alright, that's all."
1959.76,1,33791,kenneth_a_cox,,3171.325,3173.762,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1959.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3173.762,3179.081,"Your -- Mr. Donaldson, you have a few moments, five minutes, I think, to respond."
1959.76,2,39049,richard_p_donaldson,,3179.081,3180.877,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1959.76,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3304.741,3306.797,To what point do you cite these cases?
1959.76,2,39049,richard_p_donaldson,,3306.797,3307.39,Pardon?
1959.76,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3307.39,3309.033,To what point do you cite these cases?
1959.76,2,39049,richard_p_donaldson,,3309.033,3313.233,These are cases where a strike has been in effect for some time.
1959.76,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3313.233,3314.019,And -- and no --
1959.76,2,39049,richard_p_donaldson,,3314.019,3321.57,"And -- yes, and where the employer argued that because there was no showing that the strike actually impaired commerce, that the Board had no jurisdiction."
1959.76,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3321.57,3324.287,What page of the First Circuit case?
