1974.73-762,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.634,We'll hear arguments first this morning in Sosna against Iowa.
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,10.584,13.83,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,38.463,45.929,"Mr. Reynolds, is that precisely true with the -- straighten me out because I have a misapprehension here perhaps."
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,53.992,61.348,"No, if both of the parties moved in to Iowa together, then it does not apply, it only if one of the parties moves in."
1974.73-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,61.348,61.667,Well then --
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,61.667,62.841,The other party is not a resident.
1974.73-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,62.841,65.669,"This is rather unusual as compared to most statutes, is it not?"
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,65.669,66.942,I believe it is.
1974.73-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,66.942,73.087,Would the statute be easier -- be harder for you to attack if it applied across the board --
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,73.087,73.122,"Well, a --"
1974.73-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,73.122,75.791,-- to a situation where a defendant was a resident?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,75.791,101.773,"Well, I think the narrower the classification, the easier it is to argue on an equal protection question if there's no rational relationship to the narrow group that is excluded and I think that ours because it is a more narrow restriction, it's probably easier to argue because of the fact that it applies only to non-residence where there's a non-resident out of the State other party, whereas both has moved into the State --"
1974.73-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,101.773,103.406,Even for a week?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,103.406,104.028,Even for a week --
1974.73-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,104.028,105.559,Actual residence even for as long --
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,105.559,105.833,Right.
1974.73-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,105.833,106.917,-- only as long as a week?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,106.917,107.163,Right.
1974.73-762,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,114.475,124.787,"Well, isn't that an obvious background, the divorce mill state problems that we had for a number of years when there were only about three states, Florida, Nevada I guess?"
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,124.787,145.449,I think that's probably true but I think that's probably the reason for there's a durational residency requirement has cause divorce mills to occur and I think that striking down on such a durational residency requirements will take care of that problem and that the States can litigate the proper status of those parties in the state where the real interest lies.
1974.73-762,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,145.449,147.647,But isn't there quite a difference?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,164.489,194.39,"No, I think that in the instance that if we use the criterion that we have advocate as the real jurisdictional question once the court has said in the past to be the jurisdictional question which is domicile that the domicile of the party is the real interest to which the State has and the fact that the domicile of the other party is only peripheral to the interest that they have because of the many concomitant things that go with the marital situations such as a severance, such as a custody, support, division of property and the attend and other things that go with it."
1974.73-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,338.519,342.89,"You did present these questions to the Ohio likely the Iowa Court, I get it?"
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,342.89,344.566,We try to but --
1974.73-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,344.566,346.276,What did you present then in your pleadings?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,346.276,355.437,We presented it in the pleadings and the fact that we are required under the statute in question to plead the fact of one year residency requirement is to be pled.
1974.73-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,355.437,358.384,"And you -- and it was rejected, your claim was rejected?"
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,358.384,375.347,The claim was rejected by Judge Keck and he rejected not on the basis that he passed on the question and as he said that he felt he was in the position to pass upon the constitutional question when the statute upon his facing to be quite certain and that he didn't want to go the constitutional issue.
1974.73-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,375.347,387.369,"Or he didn't want to believe, rejected your claim you presented before, why didn't you appeal to that -- in the Iowa Court, carried the constitutional issue to the Iowa Court?"
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,387.369,401.356,"We'll, because of the status of the case is at the time it appeared that only preservation under a situation where there was little or no dispute to write the statute itself that the state courts have been very reluctant to get into the constitutional issue."
1974.73-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,403.526,407.006,Presented to him and they can reject it?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,407.006,427.972,We could present it to him again and reject it but the court system then was in fact depriving the -- under 1983 was depriving the citizens of his civil rights which had been by history the prerogative or had been the place that had been litigated was in the federal court and therefore the federal court would be their proper forum to litigate this one.
1974.73-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,436.7,442.012,"You talk that in your pleadings in the state court, you challenged the constitutionality presented?"
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,442.012,455.392,"No, the constitutionality of the statute was raised by the special appearance of the -- Mr. Sosna who came in and raised the special appearance and then it was litigated not by us but by them because the question had been raised as to his right to be litigated."
1974.73-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,455.392,456.412,It was then litigated?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,456.412,460.978,"He was then litigated but I don't like term litigate, I don't feel it was litigated."
1974.73-762,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,471.193,473.089,What did he do to your complaint?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,473.089,473.886,Dismissed it.
1974.73-762,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,473.886,477.098,"Well then certainly he decides that you have no claim, doesn't he?"
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,477.098,478.993,"No, he didn't decide that we had no claim."
1974.73-762,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,483.248,486.486,"Well, why aren't you bound by that under law res judicata?"
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,489.829,497.619,"Well, because we're going back in the federal court in litigating really the state as you -- as the party, the original party was Mr. Sosna, we have no different parties."
1974.73-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,515.801,521.298,"But here was a pending case stated in the State and state court system, it wasn't by law."
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,531.957,567.131,"Well, because of -- I think because of the fact of the status of the law at the time, the law was very certain they put to the question of durational residency requirement had been struck down in the past by other federal courts and I think if we should look from our brief, you can see that when you split up the cases between those that have sustained the durational residency requirement and those that have struck them down, it has been almost the majority of the state courts in the federal court however is always vindicated the rights, the constitutional rights because that had been the proper forum."
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,593.0,593.333,How can you --
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,593.333,594.679,-- require them to proceed.
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,594.679,601.635,How can you assume that the Supreme Court of Iowa will not apply the United States Constitution properly?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,608.555,609.018,That's true they did.
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,609.018,613.592,"Now, how can you -- you say that they won't follow the federal constitution?"
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,613.592,615.681,"No, what I was taking was as a lawyer looking at the --"
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,615.681,619.301,What you said that they wouldn't decide in your favor?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,619.301,629.047,"Well, I think that it has been historically true that they confine the decision or reason more compelling which would justify the durational residency requirement."
1974.73-762,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,629.447,630.897,"When you say they, who do you mean?"
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,630.897,631.924,The Supreme Court --
1974.73-762,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,631.924,632.677,Which --
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,632.677,668.25,"-- that find a more sufficient reason as the -- as in our particular case two of the three federal judges found that the interest is somehow was going to preserve, that this was somehow going to preserve the marital situation and that if you look at the decisions which have sustained the state court decision which has sustained these durational residency requirements, they've gone from filler to post under reasons that they felt that somehow was going to sustain these -- for some reason we're going to help the marriage or we're going to preserve a compelling state interest which --"
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,668.25,672.292,Has evidence shown -- is it the Iowa Supreme Court?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,672.292,672.513,The durational remedy --
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,672.513,677.853,On federal constitutional grounds?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,677.853,680.637,"That is the best of our research, it hasn't."
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,683.356,690.017,How can you imagine what they're going to do?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,690.017,693.255,"Well, I suppose you just have to as a lawyer."
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,695.627,696.824,Of Iowa?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,696.824,698.783,"Well, the history of state court decisions in regards --"
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,698.783,700.557,"Well, this is Iowa you're talking about."
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,700.557,702.979,"Well, anyway we all have an Iowa right."
1974.73-762,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,702.979,707.321,And you have a unique statute in Iowa you indicated to Justice Blackmun?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,707.321,714.356,"Well, it's unique in regards to durational residency requirement but I don't think it therefore makes it anymore easy for the Supreme Court of Iowa to decide it."
1974.73-762,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,714.356,720.463,"Well then, how are the actions of other state courts with different statutes relevant to this issue?"
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,720.463,763.537,"Well, because of the fact that they have always found that there was some compelling state interest which we have felt that there was no such compelling state interest and that the federal courts whenever were presented with the case always found that there was not a compelling state interest that the history of the federal decisions in regards to marital relationship was it was one of the most basic of the relationships and therefore that to deprive someone under color of law whether by a court or some jury, some residency requirement was in fact one of the very basic things that was at issue and that therefore the line of cases of Shapiro in welfare cases, and Dunn in the voting cases, and Memorial Hospital in the non-emergency medical care that these were all the same type of situations."
1974.73-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,763.537,769.705,So what you're saying is that you felt there was a more favorable atmosphere for your cause in the federal side?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,769.705,772.323,I felt more favorable atmosphere because of the fact that that is --
1974.73-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,772.323,772.487,I know why but --
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,772.487,774.023,-- recently been the forum of --
1974.73-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,774.023,779.146,"On the other hand, you started your action on the state side and chose not to appeal?"
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,779.146,787.32,"Well, if we didn't start it on the state action, we would be on a rather moot position to go on and say that we would like to have a divorce, start a divorce but we can't because of the residency requirement."
1974.73-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,791.735,795.751,Isn't there a federal declaratory judgment on that?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,795.751,800.178,I think there is a -- sure there's a declaratory judgment statute but the question was whether or not it's really at issue then.
1974.73-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,806.277,809.597,You have a separate maintenance statute in Iowa?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,809.597,810.924,There is a separate maintenance statute in Iowa.
1974.73-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,810.924,812.62,You chose not to follow that one either?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,812.62,814.141,That also has a requirement.
1974.73-762,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,814.141,840.063,"Mr. Reynolds, may I ask you, I notice that the defendants and the federal suit that's the state and Judge Keck expressly pleaded, I'm looking at page 23 now of the appendix paragraph (d), the suit involves primarily state laws of constitution and this Court should abstain until Iowa courts have ruled on such issue."
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,852.368,854.012,The issue of the --
1974.73-762,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,854.012,861.657,Whether -- whether or not the district court should have abstained pending resolution of this constitutional question by the Iowa court?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,861.657,862.279,No.
1974.73-762,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,862.279,863.277,It wasn't briefed either?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,863.277,864.193,No.
1974.73-762,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,864.193,865.154,By either side?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,865.154,869.319,I don't believe it was.
1974.73-762,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,870.574,889.885,"Excuse me, the question is that arguably the question is whether or not the Younger against Harris kind of approach to a pending criminal case when one seeks to go to a federal court, it should be applied with civil proceedings depending on the state you're in?"
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,889.885,928.58,"Well then, the criminal part of it, I've -- you know as an old prosecutor, I know how important it is to keep your prosecution going once you've got the machinery going and that therefore that interest is far different than that of a civil litigation where you're alleging that the civil litigation and the judge in the under color of the state law is in fact depriving a citizen of his basic federal constitutional right and I think that's quite different because of the nature of the criminal process which is different than the civil process and therefore has rises above and maybe is a more compelling state interest in the prosecution of criminals."
1974.73-762,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,928.58,956.483,"I suppose that you have, at least after this trial court judgment which you did appeal, if you have filed a declaratory judgment action against the same -- against the other party to this marriage in a state court of Iowa seeking they have a statute declared unconstitutional, you -- and the defense of res judicata had been raised than you did not sustain under Iowa law or any other law, isn't it?"
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,956.483,959.182,On res judicata as to issue or claim or as to parties or --
1974.73-762,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,959.182,962.688,"No, with the same parties, same -- it was same parties here."
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,972.944,976.279,I think that if we had brought the case against Iowa --
1974.73-762,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,976.279,976.325,"Well, --"
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,976.325,978.747,-- as against to Mr. Sosna I think we could.
1974.73-762,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,978.747,982.838,I'm talking about the other party to the marriage?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,982.838,988.383,I don't know how we could bring a declaratory judgment action against another party to the marriage.
1974.73-762,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,988.383,992.445,"Well, especially after it has already been -- your claim has already been decided."
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,992.445,999.279,"No, I -- but the marriage situation is you're certainly litigating the marriage situation and you can't get a declaratory judgment out of it."
1974.73-762,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,999.279,1004.572,You brought a declaratory judgment action on the constitutionality of the statute?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1004.572,1005.693,Right.
1974.73-762,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1006.295,1012.369,That claim had already been decided in your divorce action.
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1012.369,1013.425,Right.
1974.73-762,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1013.425,1023.119,"Well, but you think the real thing that save you is that you were litigating with Iowa rather than with the other party to a divorce action?"
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1023.119,1024.528,"Right, that's a 1983 case."
1974.73-762,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1052.563,1057.997,You can appeal it and then you can file for certiorari.
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1057.997,1060.631,"That is an alternate proceeding, yes."
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1060.631,1067.621,What you really did was instead of appealing to the state court you're appealing to the federal district court?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1067.621,1069.939,"No, we're not really appealing (Voice Overlap) to the federal district court, we're asking the --"
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1069.939,1071.52,"Well, what is the difference?"
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1071.52,1074.833,"Well, because what we are litigating -- we started out for a divorce action."
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1099.057,1103.975,"If you've gone to the Supreme Court of Iowa, what would you ask for?"
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1107.484,1114.642,We would ask for an injunction against the maybe mandamus or something like that and then you're into -- I mean that the --
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1114.642,1119.221,"Well, couldn't you appeal that way, direct appeal?"
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1119.221,1120.834,Direct appeal to the Iowa Supreme Court?
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1120.834,1123.462,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1123.462,1125.27,"Yes, we could have appealed that."
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1125.27,1130.062,And instead of that you appealed to the federal court?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1130.062,1133.164,We went and ask the federal court to declare and enjoin the state court --
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1133.164,1138.757,Would you have (Inaudible) that way?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1138.757,1139.537,"No, I don't think so."
1974.73-762,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1157.082,1159.768,That brings up another related matter.
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1165.998,1167.191,I believe so.
1974.73-762,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1167.191,1171.315,"And now she satisfies the requirement, does she?"
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1171.315,1173.237,"She has, yes."
1974.73-762,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1173.237,1179.544,"Can she get jurisdiction of the husband, the defendant by publication?"
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1179.544,1191.123,He could probably litigate the status in Iowa but not the questions of personal jurisdiction as to none Iowa in rem type of things.
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1202.428,1210.939,Wouldn't she get this thing (Inaudible) now is if we -- as if we would knock the statute out?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1210.939,1214.749,"Well, that's the whole point, you have to wait a year and there are important --"
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1214.749,1216.206,Where did the --
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1216.206,1218.492,"Yes, but there were important things that, the laws over the --"
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1218.492,1221.745,So she can get the divorce right now?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1221.745,1231.803,"But there were important things that should have been litigated that never were, for instance the right and support of those children should have been litigated than not having to wait a year or well maybe Mr. Sosna might take up other relationship."
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1231.803,1233.221,Could it be done now?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1233.221,1234.436,Pardon?
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1234.436,1236.134,Can it be done now?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1236.134,1237.459,"It can be done now, yes but the question --"
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1237.459,1238.728,All of it?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1245.594,1249.89,"Declaratory judgment, declaratory of the constitutional right of the --"
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1249.89,1252.831,That she could have had the divorce before?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1252.831,1254.229,"Right, as --"
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1254.229,1256.966,And what good does that do her?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1256.966,1264.151,This particular case -- this particular plaintiff in the class action?
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1272.309,1275.601,That didn't give you any problem?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1275.601,1276.827,What doesn't give me any problem?
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1276.827,1281.459,The fact that it's moot so far as she's concerned?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1281.459,1284.523,No because as the court --
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1284.523,1287.174,Is there any other name brought?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1287.174,1288.766,As Judge Stephenson said in his --
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1288.766,1293.874,Is there any other named party in the class?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1293.874,1298.857,"No, I believe not but at least the class was acknowledged and never challenged by anyone up to this point."
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1298.857,1301.725,Has anybody else intervened?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1301.725,1304.313,"No, but we had plenty of calls about people that wanted to."
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1304.313,1309.13,"(Voice Overlap) as to the name of the father, would happens to the class?"
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1309.13,1318.212,"I believe that there is a president for the class, we have nothing else as to remand it to the court again and let other members of the class join in if --"
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1318.212,1324.402,What case is that?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1324.402,1331.259,"I think it was the Babcock versus Wilson, I don't have the --"
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1331.259,1334.59,"That's alright, Mr. Reynolds."
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1343.114,1343.972,She herself?
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1343.972,1344.577,Yes.
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1344.577,1345.807,Not as far as the Iowa court is.
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1352.469,1354.209,You said she's gotten a divorce?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1354.209,1358.081,"Yes, in fact in New York."
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1359.911,1365.133,Will she get a divorce in Iowa if she's already gotten one in New York?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1365.133,1366.752,"Well, that's a good question."
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1367.275,1369.295,"To me, there's no problem for me at all?"
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1369.295,1384.408,"Well, Cooper versus Cooper raises the question which is an Iowa decision about a doctor from Iowa that went out to Nevada and get a Nevada divorce and the Iowa court says we can still -- our support judgments and personal judgments in regards to support."
1974.73-762,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1401.995,1404.527,So far as the support of the children go?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1404.527,1405.191,Pardon?
1974.73-762,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1405.191,1407.355,So far as the support of the children go?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1407.355,1408.088,Right.
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1429.43,1435.979,Is there anything that she can get from us that she can't get from the Iowa court right now?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1443.529,1468.71,"No, that she herself, no, but the class to which she is member I think still can because I think that as the State has admitted in their stipulation of facts that it is a group so and its so numerous that -- were numerous than has able to be counted and I think that there are numbers and numbers of people who have marital relations which are at question and needed access --"
1974.73-762,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1468.71,1489.656,"We set up several occasions Mr. Reynolds that a person can't represent a class of which he's not a member and I think that would probably be true of your client now whatever the class might be of people awaiting Iowa divorce requirement, your client certainly is no longer a member of it?"
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1489.656,1508.437,"No, I would -- at this present status, yes she would not be but the class itself and I would urge that if the court was to adopt the question that they would send it back so that other members of the class who would be members would in fact be able to join in the matter and to bring the matter back before the court."
1974.73-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1511.939,1516.25,Why couldn't it be (Inaudible) supposed to be?
1974.73-762,0,32493,james_h_reynolds,,1516.25,1539.615,"I suppose they can but as we've indicated that it's a matter of urgency and a necessity and that's the basic question about the marital relation, its not a matter of waiting a year because by that time the damages are done as to the children, the property, the relationship itself has deteriorated and that these are matters of that need work instanter, that in a year, that's the whole projection of the question."
1974.73-762,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1539.615,1540.926,Very well.
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,1550.121,1553.13,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-762,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1571.735,1572.649,Would you raise your voice a lit bit Ms. Nolan.
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,1572.649,1573.655,Yes certainly.
1974.73-762,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1617.274,1618.318,"And did you argue it, Ms. Nolan?"
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,1618.318,1653.108,"We didn't -- I did not take part in the hearings below but its my understanding it was not argued and as a matter of fact when the research was done on the cases and the various standards that might come into play, it was decided that abstention was probably not the proper thing in this particular case that the State could meet its burden that it would be of some value in this area to have a federal court ruling on the case being litigated."
1974.73-762,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1695.063,1704.57,And did you argue in any event collateral estoppel based on the conclusion of the proceeding before Judge Keck in the state court?
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,1704.57,1708.672,"No, I don't believe that was argued as a matter of collateral estoppel."
1974.73-762,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1729.423,1740.049,"No, but what I was getting at Ms. Nolan was whether you relied on that conclusion of Judge Keck's disposing adversely to this petitioner?"
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,1740.049,1740.996,To this plaintiff?
1974.73-762,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1740.996,1750.694,"Yes, the constitutional question whether you relied on that as collateral estoppel in this federal court suit?"
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,1750.694,1759.325,"Well, I would say that (Voice Overlap) representing Judge Keck in his position that he had acted under color of state law, yes, I guess we did."
1974.73-762,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1759.325,1765.002,"Ms. Nolan, did you acquiesce in bypassing your own state court?"
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,1767.854,1786.815,"I don't Mr. Justice Marshall, I think that here however, as statement was made just previously to my arising and that is that the plaintiffs have the right to go to the Supreme Court of Iowa in this matter."
1974.73-762,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1791.662,1796.806,"But all of our questions were directed to their right to go to the Supreme Court of Iowa at that time, not now."
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,1796.806,1801.072,"At that time, yes sir, I think they did certainly have that right."
1974.73-762,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1801.072,1815.887,And is your answer to Justice Marshall that the State of Iowa is perfectly willing to bypass the State Supreme Court and go into federal court?
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,1815.887,1824.843,The State of Iowa since in the last 10 years has done a great deal to liberalize its divorce laws.
1974.73-762,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2007.593,2017.025,"Ms. Nolan, has the Supreme Court of Iowa in any other case dealt with the constitutional validity of this statute?"
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2019.744,2033.051,"Well, in Judge Keck's decision which is sent out in the jurisdictional statement, there's a reference to Korsrud versus Korsrud that's in 242 Iowa I believe and 45 N.W.2d, I think it is."
1974.73-762,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2084.69,2092.257,"So the Supreme Court applied the statute, you don't know if it's the validity of the statute itself was attacked on that case?"
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2092.257,2107.331,The Supreme Court did test the validity of that statute at that time and held that there was a sham domicile pled and that it was a victim of fraud and that the court was a victim of fraud.
1974.73-762,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2107.331,2108.202,So the court applied the statute?
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2108.202,2110.32,"And the court applied the statute, yes."
1974.73-762,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2110.32,2115.847,But you don't -- do you know whether or not the constitutional validity of the statute was attacked in that case?
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2119.908,2132.235,"In my recollection, it was attacked only on the basis of whether or not the court had jurisdiction but I think that is essential to the constitutional validity of that particular section of the code."
1974.73-762,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2132.235,2134.921,Well then the facts were litigated I guess --
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2134.921,2135.05,That's right.
1974.73-762,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2135.05,2136.308,-- it were an issue in that case but --
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2136.308,2143.874,That's right.
1974.73-762,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2183.896,2185.485,How long has the statute been on the book?
1974.73-762,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2219.952,2224.015,Is Iowa statute basically the uniform law?
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2224.015,2232.662,"Well, I would say that as close as uniform laws are uniform, Iowa statute is the uniform law, yes."
1974.73-762,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2296.012,2298.052,"But that was an individual court, was it?"
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2298.052,2299.884,I believe it was sir.
1974.73-762,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2299.884,2300.24,What happened?
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2300.24,2300.567,In --
1974.73-762,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2300.567,2304.163,I thought the federal court was just on the statute not on the divorce.
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2306.231,2312.585,There were interrogatories propounded and answered in the federal court action and I believe this information is contained clearly in the answers of the individual counsel.
1974.73-762,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2312.585,2319.691,What you merely wanted was that the federal court to put the stamp of approval on this case?
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2319.691,2322.469,We appeared in that action as defendants.
1974.73-762,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2322.469,2324.286,But that's what you wanted?
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2324.286,2326.28,We would be happy if the court would put a --
1974.73-762,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2326.28,2326.642,What you really want --
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2326.642,2326.676,-- stamp of approval on our state statute.
1974.73-762,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2326.676,2329.195,"is an advisory opinion, don't you?"
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2329.195,2329.814,Pardon me?
1974.73-762,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2329.814,2332.987,"You want an advisory opinion from the federal court, don't you?"
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2332.987,2337.157,The action that was brought was for a declaratory action for declaratory judgment.
1974.73-762,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2337.157,2346.953,"It could mean an action of the State of Iowa in abandoning abstention and everything else, what you really wanted was a stamp of approval, didn't you?"
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2346.953,2348.727,I would say yes that that is true.
1974.73-762,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2349.579,2359.932,"I didn't know that federal courts were here to grant advisory opinion, I didn't know that?"
1974.73-762,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2359.932,2361.071,You were the defendant?
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2361.071,2361.92,That's correct.
1974.73-762,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2361.92,2363.052,You didn't go to another court?
1974.73-762,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2363.052,2366.643,But she agreed.
1974.73-762,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2366.643,2394.673,"Not so very long ago as time goes, the prevailing law was that a wife could not acquire a separate domicile, that was the prevailing domestic relations law would be that the marital domicile was the husband's domicile, and that so long as there was a marriage between the two, the wife was incapable of acquiring a separate domicile anywhere."
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2397.065,2410.313,"I don't know, I don't think that's been the rule in Iowa for sometime because our statutes do permit the court to take jurisdiction if one of the parties is domicile."
1974.73-762,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2410.313,2417.957,"But I say the rule that I just summarized used to be the prevailing rule in domestic relations law, you don't know of that."
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2417.957,2421.812,I have no knowledge of other states in that particular regard.
1974.73-762,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2421.812,2430.924,"Ms. Nolan, you had the discussion of the mootness issue."
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2441.435,2462.901,"Well, my position on this question before this Court is that there appears to have been a proper appeal from a district court order and that this Court does have authority and power to affirm that lower court decision which is what we asked."
1974.73-762,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2472.787,2474.58,You say -- you think it has been mooted?
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2474.58,2480.953,I think so but I think that the appeal is preserved or was properly preserved.
1974.73-762,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2480.953,2484.327,You think the class action is moot but the appeal is preserved?
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2484.327,2485.828,I believe so.
1974.73-762,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2485.828,2494.638,So what is the case or controversy between these two party -- between the husband and the wife?
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2494.638,2494.737,"Well, --"
1974.73-762,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2494.737,2503.239,Or between the husband rather the wife and the State of Iowa?
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2503.239,2504.817,The controversy was that --
1974.73-762,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2504.817,2505.947,Is --
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2505.947,2505.961,What is --
1974.73-762,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2505.961,2514.518,"Today, right this minute at quarter to 11, what controversy exists now?"
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2514.518,2549.489,I feel that the petitioner in the original action although now divorced and I assume removed from the State of Iowa would have only the controversy grounds that existed at the time that the action was originally brought and that is to have the question determined under the civil rights sections of the code and then to pursue any decision through appeal to the highest court in the land.
1974.73-762,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2549.489,2571.39,We held here that the decisions say that New York court on a divorce matter would not bind the say Iowa on the question of support of the children that that is not the res judicata?
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2571.39,2573.883,Are you referring to the divisible divorce here?
1974.73-762,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2573.883,2576.781,I'm just trying to get you over these little hedges.
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2576.781,2580.404,"Thank you, I appreciate it."
1974.73-762,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2593.651,2597.005,"Are the children in Iowa, now?"
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2597.005,2597.7,Pardon me?
1974.73-762,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2597.7,2600.425,Are the children in Iowa or New York?
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2600.425,2604.915,I do not know.
1974.73-762,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2604.915,2608.715,"Are any of the parties in Iowa, now?"
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2608.715,2614.622,As of this morning it sounds like they aren't other than Judge Keck and the State of Iowa.
1974.73-762,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2614.622,2626.734,"I'm not very clear whether the State of Iowa is urging or not urging federal jurisdiction here, you lose me in a state of confusion on it?"
1974.73-762,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2661.481,2683.9,"In many of the lower federal courts on class actions for the named party has dropped out of the case remand that case to the District Court where the case started to see of any but not can be for others to join -- other class to join, you haven't briefed that, didn't you?"
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2683.9,2685.713,I have not brief that and --
1974.73-762,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2685.713,2687.123,Are you familiar with our decision?
1974.73-762,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2687.123,2689.317,I think it was last term in the Burney case?
1974.73-762,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2689.317,2690.032,Burney.
1974.73-762,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2690.032,2691.191,Burney against Indiana.
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2691.191,2692.866,No I'm not.
1974.73-762,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2692.866,2695.657,Two terms ago.
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2695.657,2699.832,I'm not but in all of this time no other party has come forth to join this class.
1974.73-762,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2699.832,2704.624,"Well, I know that, as I recall the Burney situation was not unlike this one."
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2726.969,2729.048,I don't ask you to do that.
1974.73-762,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2729.048,2730.63,You won below and you want to hang out to that?
1974.73-762,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2733.131,2735.909,"Ms. Nolan, do you know when the divorce took place?"
1974.73-762,1,22884,elizabeth_a_nolan,,2735.909,2737.299,When the divorce took place?
1974.73-762,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2743.171,2748.4,Since we noted probable jurisdiction?
1974.73-762,2,32493,james_h_reynolds,,2954.703,2956.147,"Yes, I do Your Honor."
