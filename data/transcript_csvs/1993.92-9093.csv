1993.92-9093,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.777,"We'll hear argument next in Number 92-9093, Joseph Romano v. Oklahoma."
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,47.451,50.404,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-9093,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,95.954,104.138,"Do you think, Mrs. Peters, that would make the jury in this case more likely or less likely to itself impose the death sentence?"
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,104.138,106.269,I think that it would make it more likely.
1993.92-9093,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,129.526,141.445,"You're not saying that the jury was more likely to convict because of this second... you're saying it might have been more likely to convict, it might have been less likely... it was just kind of an aberrant factor?"
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,141.445,148.998,"--To sentence to death, I think it was more likely that it would affect its judgment to sentence him to death."
1993.92-9093,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,151.689,162.696,"Well, why wouldn't it be just as logical to say, if, as you say, juries shy away from this responsibility, to say well, he's already been sentenced to death?"
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,165.308,180.779,"Regardless of which the jury is likely to do, it is not a principled distinction... principled guiding factor to determine when death is appropriate in a case and when it is not, whether the jury returned life, or whether the jury returned death."
1993.92-9093,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,216.643,225.177,"Ms. Peters, may I ask you the state of the law in Oklahoma in this situation?"
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,239.657,241.84,"It is not, and the Court of Criminal Appeals--"
1993.92-9093,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,241.84,246.515,Is the fact of conviction in the earlier case relevant under Oklahoma law?
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,246.515,246.805,--Certainly.
1993.92-9093,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,246.805,254.45,And the Oklahoma courts in this case acknowledge that it wasn't relevant as a matter of State law--
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,254.45,255.361,That is correct.
1993.92-9093,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,255.361,255.842,--the sentence?
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,255.842,256.553,That is correct.
1993.92-9093,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,256.553,266.266,But nevertheless felt it was not a constitutional violation that the error was not harmful in a constitutional sense?
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,266.266,274.722,"The Court of Criminal Appeals recognized that it might have undermined the jury's sense of responsibility, but then went on to say that it was highly unlikely that it did so."
1993.92-9093,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,303.302,304.814,"Ms. Peters, may I interrupt you on that point?"
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,323.985,330.21,--I think that the court looked at it as an Eighth Amendment error initially--
1993.92-9093,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,330.21,330.571,It did.
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,330.571,337.727,"--and said that it might undermine the jury's sense of responsibility, and then analyzed it in the Fourteenth Amendment instead."
1993.92-9093,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,351.253,363.041,"Do you... but you also view their opinion as not engaging in harmless error analysis in the strict sense, at least with respect to the Eighth Amendment violation."
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,363.041,363.912,--That's correct.
1993.92-9093,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,377.644,384.417,"What case or cases from our Court are you relying on for your submission, Ms. Peters?"
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,384.417,385.338,Several cases.
1993.92-9093,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,390.751,398.985,"Caldwell requires, though, doesn't it, if one takes the concurring opinion which made the Court... that the information be misleading or false?"
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,398.985,402.788,"--In this case, I believe the information was misleading and inaccurate."
1993.92-9093,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,402.788,405.3,The person had not previously been sentenced to death?
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,405.3,409.243,"He had been previously sentenced to death, and as a historical fact it was correct."
1993.92-9093,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,409.243,411.444,Then what was false about it?
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,411.444,413.665,What was false about it was that it was an invalid conviction.
1993.92-9093,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,441.835,450.21,"Well, what if it had been a valid... what if the sentence had been upheld on appeal, would you still be making the same arguments here?"
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,450.21,453.332,"I would, because I also believe that the evidence was misleading."
1993.92-9093,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,458.105,463.26,But that really converts Caldwell into something that a majority of the Court never subscribed to.
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,515.582,518.433,--The factual accuracy of that document?
1993.92-9093,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,518.433,518.934,Yeah.
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,524.528,527.631,I think it was mere formal language in the document.
1993.92-9093,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,527.631,530.162,"It didn't purport to be a recitation, then?"
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,530.162,531.023,No.
1993.92-9093,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,544.251,556.269,"So you're saying that a State could not conclude that the sentencing process is enhanced by having this information, that as a matter of law it can never be enhanced by the jury having this information?"
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,556.269,558.442,--I think it would have the opposite effect.
1993.92-9093,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,559.143,563.655,So you're saying that as a matter of law a State may not conclude that under any circumstances?
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,563.655,568.778,"--Yes, unless the State can show a valid State penalogical interest."
1993.92-9093,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,569.859,571.859,Unless the State... I didn't hear that last remark.
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,571.859,578.214,"Unless the State can show that there's a valid State penalogical interest in showing the death penalty, that I cannot think of one at the moment."
1993.92-9093,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,578.214,588.202,So you are really arguing for a clear position that the jury may not be informed of an outstanding death sentence.
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,588.202,589.211,That is correct.
1993.92-9093,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,589.211,595.636,"Well, can't a jury be informed in the sentencing proceeding of a prior conviction?"
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,595.636,596.367,Certainly.
1993.92-9093,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,601.79,613.167,"But you're saying that then the jury could have been informed if this sentence had not... had been upheld, it could have been informed that he had been convicted, but he couldn't have been informed of the sentence which was imposed on him?"
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,613.167,613.978,--That is correct.
1993.92-9093,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,613.978,630.718,"What if the crime had been convicted after the prior sentence had been imposed, and it was relevant under the law of, say, an aggravating factor, or what-not, that the individual had committed the later felony following receipt of a sentence of death?"
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,635.921,639.364,I think that would certainly present a much closer question that we have here.
1993.92-9093,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,639.364,640.225,What would the answer be?
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,640.225,643.338,I'm not sure what the answer would be.
1993.92-9093,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,650.592,669.253,"I thought your position in answer to my question was, your theory is it will give the jury a diminished sense of responsibility in every case to know that another jury has already returned a death sentence, and that there are no circumstances in which it would be proper?"
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,669.253,684.394,"--I said that I could think of none, and maybe this would present a circumstance that would be proper, but there would be the competing interest of which... is it more probative, or is it more prejudicial, and that I think is a much closer question than we have presented in this case."
1993.92-9093,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,684.394,690.958,How would that affect your earlier argument that a jury is going to have a diminished sense of responsibility?
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,690.958,695.66,"That's the prejudicial impact of that evidence, is that it would diminish the jury's sense of responsibility."
1993.92-9093,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,700.625,705.738,Why is your answer different in response to Justice Souter's hypothetical?
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,712.684,720.678,--What I was about to say in this case the crime that he got the death penalty for was committed 9 months or so after the crime that he was on trial for at this time.
1993.92-9093,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,744.825,758.644,"Ms. Peters, in Caldwell, as I recall, it wasn't only inaccurate, what was told to the jury, but it was intentionally inaccurate."
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,764.619,765.277,That's correct.
1993.92-9093,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,765.277,770.031,"And there's no contention of any misleading in this trial, is there?"
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,770.031,772.644,"I believe it was misleading, because it--"
1993.92-9093,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,772.644,787.814,"Well, you say it turned out that the perfectly accurate statement later became inaccurate, because the conviction was set aside, but at the time it was said it was perfectly accurate."
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,787.814,792.238,"--Accurate, but misleading, because it led the jury to believe that its decision did not matter."
1993.92-9093,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,792.238,792.408,"Well, let's talk about that."
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,801.985,803.115,If it--
1993.92-9093,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,803.115,813.171,"Where the prosecutor hasn't been responsible for it, but the defendant can come in and show, what this witness testified to was misleading, and indeed it was misleading, is that a basis for setting aside a conviction?"
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,813.171,820.565,"--If it did not mislead the... I mean, if it did not undermine the sense of responsibility, possibly not, but if we have both of those factors, yes, I believe it is."
1993.92-9093,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,820.565,833.545,"Never mind the sense of responsibility for what the sentence is, it could have misled the jury as to the conviction, as to whether the person's guilty or not, but if the prosecutor has not been responsible for that, is that a basis for reversing the conviction?"
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,833.545,837.118,"If it renders the verdict unreliable, yes, it would be, even--"
1993.92-9093,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,837.118,838.658,Do you have a case for that?
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,847.263,852.047,"--Not if any misleading, but if there's a reasonable likelihood that the verdict was so infected that it's unreliable, I think that it would be."
1993.92-9093,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,852.047,853.718,What case supports that proposition?
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,853.948,855.6,I do not have a case on that.
1993.92-9093,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,855.6,857.882,--I don't think it's true.
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,873.242,876.732,"In this case, I do not think it was perfectly innocent on the part of the prosecutor."
1993.92-9093,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,923.014,934.541,"Ms. Peters, the way misleading evidence is usually entered in these other contexts, in the context of a trial, is that counsel is supposed to be able to counteract it."
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,945.447,945.918,That's correct.
1993.92-9093,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,945.918,946.489,The jury knew that.
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,955.155,967.985,"If counsel had done that, I think he would have been precisely within the confines of Caldwell, because he would have told the jury that not only was that jury's verdict subject to appeal, but so was this jury's verdict, and that also might have lessened their responsibility."
1993.92-9093,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1017.475,1019.686,"Excuse me, how did they compound the prejudicial effect?"
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,1021.178,1022.118,--By the instructions.
1993.92-9093,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1028.771,1032.964,"Oh... oh, I see, the fact that the information came from the court compounded the error."
1993.92-9093,0,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,1032.964,1037.047,"--The fact that it was evidence, and juries are told not to base their decision on argument of counsel."
1993.92-9093,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1108.955,1109.574,"Thank you, Ms. Peters."
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1112.946,1118.46,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1993.92-9093,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1147.831,1151.562,"Ms. Blalock, may I ask you a preliminary question?"
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1157.165,1160.779,"--The Court of Criminal Appeals held that it was not relevant, that it was irrelevant."
1993.92-9093,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1160.779,1161.85,And you don't argue that it was?
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1161.85,1172.516,"No, Your Honor, I only... my only disagreement with the Court of Criminal Appeals decision is that perhaps it erred on the side of conservatism in analyzing this evidence."
1993.92-9093,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1173.938,1177.19,"But in any event, you are not telling us that it was relevant as a matter of State law--"
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1177.19,1178.109,"--No, ma'am."
1993.92-9093,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1178.109,1186.725,--and the defendant had stipulated to instruct the jury that there had been the prior conviction of murder?
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1186.725,1187.376,"Yes, he had."
1993.92-9093,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1187.376,1194.591,"And why is it, then, that the State insisted on entering this piece of evidence that showed the sentence?"
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1194.591,1199.414,"The State is always entitled to prove its case, regardless of the defendant's stipulations."
1993.92-9093,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1203.317,1208.39,"Well, I mean, it's just curious, since it was irrelevant as a matter of State law, and there had been a stipulation."
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1214.754,1217.716,The prosecutor did not know at that time that it was irrelevant.
1993.92-9093,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1239.12,1244.373,"Well, do you think that another State court could find that this is relevant?"
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1244.373,1245.565,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1993.92-9093,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1245.565,1246.667,"Well, on what theory?"
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1246.667,1253.349,"I believe that this... the fact of the prior sentence, as well as the prior conviction, could be considered relevant."
1993.92-9093,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1254.691,1257.263,How does it help the jury's decision?
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1257.263,1265.518,"--It prevents the arbitrary factor, and the capriciousness that this Court has attempted to avoid in its capital cases."
1993.92-9093,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1287.352,1290.805,"So the Oklahoma court was wrong in saying that it's not relevant, then?"
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1290.805,1293.109,I don't think the... I think--
1993.92-9093,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1293.109,1302.125,"It's either relevant or it isn't, and you say the Oklahoma court is right, but some other court would be right in reaching a conclusion that's 180 degrees opposite from that--"
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1302.125,1302.796,--I think--
1993.92-9093,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1302.796,1305.059,--and I'm having trouble deciding which is right.
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1305.059,1310.183,--I think the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals could have properly decided it was relevant evidence.
1993.92-9093,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1320.35,1323.46,"And that legitimate State interest is what, again?"
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1323.46,1337.69,"--To prevent the jury's speculation about what the prior sentence was that prevents them from oversentencing on the second case, thinking perhaps this defendant received a life sentence on the prior first degree murder conviction, so we will make up for it."
1993.92-9093,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1337.69,1350.028,"Well, you're assuming that they're not following your instructions, and your whole argument assumes that they're not going to play it straight when the judge instructs them on their choices and the basis for their choices in the case before them."
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1350.028,1355.535,"I think that's exactly what petitioner does, is assume that they're not following--"
1993.92-9093,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1355.535,1356.634,"Well, but that... isn't that exactly what you're doing?"
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1373.504,1378.548,"--I do accept that the Court of Criminal Appeals held that it was irrelevant, and I don't have any quarrel with that."
1993.92-9093,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1378.548,1379.268,"No, but your--"
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1379.268,1379.839,I just--
1993.92-9093,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1379.839,1380.72,--Maybe we misunderstood.
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1391.196,1398.202,"--I believe that another State court could very well find that it was relevant evidence, and I believe the Court of Criminal Appeals could have found that it was relevant evidence."
1993.92-9093,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1398.202,1401.063,So that it would have been a sound conclusion if they had so found.
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1401.063,1401.925,"Yes, exactly."
1993.92-9093,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1401.925,1409.838,And doesn't your argument for the soundness of that conclusion rest on the assumption that the jury in fact will not follow its instructions in the case before them?
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1409.838,1411.691,I don't believe so.
1993.92-9093,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1412.98,1423.706,"Well, how is it relevant if they follow the instructions in the case before them that another jury in another case for another crime sentenced to life or sentenced to death?"
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1424.618,1429.45,--It gives them an additional piece of evidence about what... about that former crime.
1993.92-9093,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1430.632,1432.683,Why do they need to know anything about the former crime?
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1437.308,1444.631,"--Absolutely, and were we talking about the guilt phase, that would certainly be true, but in the sentencing phase, the fact of the prior conviction is certainly relevant evidence."
1993.92-9093,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1445.753,1448.644,Under what criterion of law?
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1448.644,1455.128,In the sentencing phase of the capital case... here there were alleged two aggravating circumstances.
1993.92-9093,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1455.128,1458.381,"Does Oklahoma define one criterion for... or, strike that."
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1467.237,1467.895,No--
1993.92-9093,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1467.895,1468.406,Is that the law?
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1468.406,1468.887,--absolutely not.
1993.92-9093,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1468.887,1470.709,Then I just don't see the relevance of it at all.
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1492.462,1493.894,I'm saying that--
1993.92-9093,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1493.894,1501.638,"Because you have to acknowledge that the mere fact that the person was sentenced one way or another is irrelevant to the determination, isn't it?"
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1501.638,1503.469,--In the second case--
1993.92-9093,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1503.469,1513.737,"Unless it indicates something about the nature of the person's character, and the only way it can do that is that one presumes that a prior jury doesn't give death unless it was a really horrible crime."
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1513.737,1518.859,"--It can give the jury additional evidence about the fact of the prior crime, that it was a particularly horrible crime."
1993.92-9093,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1528.987,1534.71,"May I ask this question about... in Oklahoma, the jury does the sentencing even in noncapital cases, isn't that correct?"
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1534.71,1535.261,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-9093,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1535.261,1549.471,"And in... when the prosecutor in the sentencing hearing calls the attention of the jury to, say a prior armed robbery conviction, is it the practice to give the details of the armed robbery conviction, or just the statutory crime and the fact that he was found guilty?"
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1549.471,1560.948,"In a noncapital case, the only thing that's relevant is the fact of the prior conviction, so the prosecutor merely introduces the judgment and sentence showing there was a prior conviction, showing it was final--"
1993.92-9093,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1560.948,1566.081,And he's not permitted to go into the gruesome details of the prior one to show this was really a serious armed robbery.
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1566.081,1568.212,--Not in a noncapital case.
1993.92-9093,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1568.212,1570.996,Then is there any reason why there should be a different rule in capital cases?
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1570.996,1581.39,"Well, yes, because the aggravating circumstance is that this evidence was used to prove... there were two different ones, and one was that there was a probability the defendant would pose a continuing threat to society."
1993.92-9093,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1588.737,1595.78,"Well, is the State permitted to... beyond putting in the death... the fact that he was sentenced to death, is it permitted to put in all the details of the prior conviction?"
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1595.78,1606.516,"As to the continuing threat aggravating circumstance, the State has to put forth that evidence about the prior crime, and it may not even be an adjudicated crime under Oklahoma law."
1993.92-9093,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1606.516,1609.368,Was that done here?
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1614.241,1615.171,"Yes, Your Honor, it was."
1993.92-9093,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1620.776,1621.646,"I mean, all the nature and the circumstances."
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1634.595,1639.257,--There was also an aggravating circumstance of prior violent felony conviction.
1993.92-9093,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1643.641,1644.362,"Well, one thing is the judgment and sentence--"
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1644.362,1645.023,--the prior conviction.
1993.92-9093,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1645.023,1647.385,--but that doesn't tell the details of the crime.
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1661.452,1664.494,In the second stage the State put on--
1993.92-9093,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1664.494,1672.689,"I thought it was all based on a stipulation, and the only question was whether the judgment that showed the death sentence would go as well."
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1672.689,1673.951,"--No, ma'am, that's not correct."
1993.92-9093,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1693.393,1705.021,"You're arguing against the decision that you're defending again, because didn't the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals say, this could diminish the jury's sense of responsibility."
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1719.129,1726.576,"--The Court of Criminal Appeals recognized that there was a possibility, or at least the issue had been raised that this was a Caldwell-type violation."
1993.92-9093,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1759.717,1766.871,"Ms. Blalock, what exactly was it that the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals held was irrelevant, the admission of the sentence?"
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1766.871,1779.149,"That's all, Your Honor, the fact that the judgment and sentence was not redacted, was not edited to delete that portion that reflected what the defendant had received on the prior first degree murder conviction."
1993.92-9093,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1783.374,1795.769,"Ms. Blalock, in view of the fact that the court of appeals found there was error here, did it have to conduct harmless error analysis, in your view?"
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1795.769,1812.262,"It did not find that there was constitutional error, and what the petitioner presupposes is that the Court of Criminal Appeals engaged in the wrong standard set down by this Court when there's Federal constitutional error."
1993.92-9093,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1832.975,1843.35,"What was the standard that the court applied to determine that though there was error, it wasn't fatal?"
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1843.35,1854.848,"They found that, when viewed in the entirety of the evidence, and in the instructions that were given to the jury, that it was highly unlikely that this evidence could have influenced the jury's verdict."
1993.92-9093,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1861.603,1882.317,"The court seemed to think there was some constitutional component to what it was doing, because it said, we must review this under a heightened standard because the qualitative difference of death from all other punishments requires a correspondingly greater degree of scrutiny, so I'm not... what do all those words add up to?"
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1891.282,1897.848,--I believe in that context... and that quotation from the court is at page 58 of the Joint--
1993.92-9093,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1897.848,1898.168,--Yes.
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1898.168,1898.699,--Appendix.
1993.92-9093,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1933.321,1939.865,"Was this heightened standard, was that a harmless error standard, and I believe Justice O'Connor asked you that question earlier."
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1939.865,1954.354,"They did not find constitutional error and then engage in a harmless error analysis under this Court's decisions of what standard applies in constitutional violations, so no, they didn't do that."
1993.92-9093,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1959.888,1971.956,"Well, their reasoning, as I understood it, was that there's no Caldwell error unless the alleged defect in the proceedings gave the jury the impression that someone other than the jury would be doing the sentencing."
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1971.956,1972.367,That was--
1993.92-9093,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1972.367,1973.746,That's the way they reasoned.
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1973.746,1977.86,"--That was exactly their reasoning as to the Eighth Amendment, the Caldwell violation."
1993.92-9093,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1977.86,1979.009,It's a fairly narrow reading of Caldwell.
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,1979.009,1986.636,"Well, in this case I believe that they were correct in holding that Caldwell didn't apply."
1993.92-9093,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2055.529,2060.333,Is there any... do you have any cases that have found this kind of evidence relevant?
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,2060.333,2065.717,"The ones that we've cited in our brief, and I believe there is... the primary one is out of Pennsylvania."
1993.92-9093,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2088.05,2089.252,I was going to ask about that.
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,2103.831,2104.452,"Yes, I would think so."
1993.92-9093,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2119.314,2130.954,"Of course, here the instruction came from the court, which gives it added importance, I suppose, and added... courts don't usually instruct on irrelevant matters."
1993.92-9093,1,15534,andre_diane_blalock,,2130.954,2138.208,The evidence came in the... the knowledge of the prior death sentence came in the form of evidence in the judgment and sentence.
1993.92-9093,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2238.693,2240.583,"Thank you, Ms. Blalock."
1993.92-9093,2,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,2243.546,2245.919,May it please the Court:
1993.92-9093,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2308.29,2311.382,"If prior verdicts are irrelevant, why are you telling us this?"
1993.92-9093,2,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,2311.382,2315.135,--If prior verdicts are irrelevant?
1993.92-9093,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2315.135,2319.817,Your whole point is that it's irrelevant and we shouldn't know--
1993.92-9093,2,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,2319.817,2321.77,Prior death sentences are irrelevant.
1993.92-9093,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2321.77,2323.109,--what prior sentences are.
1993.92-9093,2,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,2324.371,2330.996,Only what impact this might have had on the jury as an illustration.
1993.92-9093,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2330.996,2331.497,You're saying--
1993.92-9093,2,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,2333.938,2340.503,"I'm saying that the death sentence was highly prejudicial, and that that evidences what might have happened in this case."
1993.92-9093,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2342.383,2345.104,"--Of course, that third conviction might have been the only one that was on a Tuesday, too."
1993.92-9093,2,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,2345.955,2348.187,"--Also, on--"
1993.92-9093,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2348.187,2349.018,You really don't know.
1993.92-9093,2,34936,lee_ann_jones_peters,,2354.761,2361.316,"--Certainly, but we know that the only difference in what the jury heard was evidence of the death sentence."
1993.92-9093,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2396.96,2399.976,"Thank you, Ms. Peters."
