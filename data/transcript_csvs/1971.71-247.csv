1971.71-247,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,31.596,"-- arguments next, the number 71-247, Rabe against Washington."
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,34.03,38.431,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1971.71-247,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,213.51,215.718,What was the actual sentencing?
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,215.718,218.41,$600 fine Mr. Justice Douglas.
1971.71-247,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,218.41,221.008,He was then put away for five years?
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,221.008,227.554,"He was not sentenced to prison at all, just a fine."
1971.71-247,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,237.67,242.265,"And this motion picture was based on the opera Carmen, was it?"
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,242.265,243.695,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1971.71-247,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,247.519,249.232,Called Carmen Baby?
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,249.232,251.255,Carmen Baby.
1971.71-247,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,251.255,254.651,Did it have any more in common with it than the title?
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,254.651,256.144,It did.
1971.71-247,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,274.378,283.538,"How do the criminal sentences in obscenity cases in Washington state really, they are very heavy?"
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,283.538,294.014,"In a few cases, there have been prison sentences in the neighborhood of 30 days as I recall most recently in Seattle."
1971.71-247,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,321.842,327.95,"This movie was shown without incident in other states -- in your state, was it?"
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,327.95,332.662,"It was indeed, it was shown in Seattle, and it was shown in Yakima, which is not far from Richland."
1971.71-247,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,332.662,334.113,In public theaters.
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,334.113,335.16,In public theaters.
1971.71-247,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,335.16,338.052,"And it's been shown pretty well all over the United States, hasn't it?"
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,338.052,339.0,"It has, it's been --"
1971.71-247,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,339.0,341.429,"Public theaters, reviewed in the newspapers."
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,341.429,343.503,Reviewed in the New York Times.
1971.71-247,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,355.645,368.112,"And it's a fact that there is nothing in it that can be suppressed under the constitution, and that's been decided in two other courts, has it not?"
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,368.112,375.255,It was decided in New Jersey and in Maryland I believe and the opinion in New Jersey I think is very eloquent.
1971.71-247,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,375.255,377.75,Did it involve drive-in in Maryland?
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,377.75,381.136,"No, in neither state, Mr. Justice Marshall, they did involve drive-in."
1971.71-247,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,381.136,382.186,It involved the movie?
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,382.186,385.002,"It involved the same movie, but shown at an indoor theater."
1971.71-247,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,385.002,391.63,But is there anything – is it true in this (Inaudible) there were houses nearby where somebody can sit on the porch and see?
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,391.63,399.152,"The photographs in the record show that there are a few depleted houses at some distance from the screen, some of which would be able to have the view."
1971.71-247,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,399.152,402.378,Is there anything to stop a young kid from standing and seeing it?
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,402.378,406.964,"There was nothing to stop anyone of any age for standing at the fence and looking, that there is a physical --"
1971.71-247,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,406.964,411.434,Do you see any difference between that and a closed theater that doesn't not allow children?
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,411.434,412.321,I am sorry.
1971.71-247,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,412.321,417.673,Do you see any difference between that and the situation in a closed theater that does not admit children?
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,417.673,418.376,"Yes, I do."
1971.71-247,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,419.45,421.297,You give any significance to that?
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,421.297,428.759,"Yes, I think, the state could properly legislate in that area what has been called the area of obtrusive display legislation."
1971.71-247,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,428.759,430.362,"Well, this Court has said so?"
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,430.362,439.733,"Yes, indeed it has and why the states have not more clearly picked up that opportunity and acted upon it before how, I don't know."
1971.71-247,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,440.598,442.206,Some states have the (Inaudible)
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,442.206,446.255,"New York has, Arizona has, but I think it's still a minority of states that have."
1971.71-247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,451.789,464.285,"Well, are you conceding then that the State of Washington could have legislated so as to prevent the showing of this film in the manner in which it was shown with the exposure to people outside the drive-in?"
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,464.285,471.373,"There was nothing shown in the record here Mr. Justice Rehnquist that there was, in fact, any exposure to people outside the drive-in."
1971.71-247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,495.505,502.897,To cover a situation such as your state Supreme Court found to exist here where at least the people in these houses were exposed?
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,502.897,513.02,"Yes, I believe such legislation could be enacted and in the report of the President's commission on obscenity and pornography, there is even a model statute to that effect."
1971.71-247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,513.02,522.616,"Well, then is your complaint here basically Lanzetta versus New Jersey type of complaint that you weren't given fair warning of what the state intended to punish criminal?"
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,522.616,537.094,"That is one of our basic complaints, yes, indeed it is because nothing in the statute gave Mr. Rabe any notice that he could be prosecuted on any theory for showing a non-obscene film under certain circumstances such as an outdoor exhibition."
1971.71-247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,537.094,539.624,But then you also -- that is your only complaint?
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,539.624,542.678,That's not our only position.
1971.71-247,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,627.122,631.318,"Mr. Dwyer, I might take you back for a minute."
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,643.469,651.016,"There is no question Mr. Justice Marshall that some residents, have they been home and watching could have seen that screen from outside the theater."
1971.71-247,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,656.631,661.58,"Can I assume that where there is an overpass, there is some people on it?"
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,661.58,662.807,"Well, there might or might not be."
1971.71-247,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,666.715,669.304,"But, this is a finding of fact here."
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,672.622,674.643,Yes and that's true.
1971.71-247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,680.235,694.589,Would you say then that the state legislation must be so narrowly drawn as to require proof on the part of the state that someone was actually on this overpass or in this house seeing it rather than a reasonable probability that it might occur?
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,694.589,695.383,I would think so.
1971.71-247,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,722.392,724.939,"Well, you don't need to go that far however here."
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,728.101,728.918,Exactly.
1971.71-247,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,728.918,745.853,But -- whether how much power the state might have under the police power to require drive-in to be so many feet away from any residences or to put up passes so that the light and the noise and the traffic wouldn't bother people or this content of the movie wouldn't bother people.
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,753.209,756.533,"And that is the fatal defect of the prosecution as we see it, yes."
1971.71-247,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,756.533,777.12,"Well, back to my point and maybe I am in agreement, on Page 81, an opinion of Judge McGowan, on both occasions teenage and younger children were observed by the officer to be watching the motion picture from various points outside the theater fence?"
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,777.12,777.862,That is correct.
1971.71-247,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,777.862,779.601,You do agree with.
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,779.601,791.375,The opinion goes on to say that the presence of those juveniles cannot support the conviction of the petitioner because at the time in question the state had no statute directed to the protection of juveniles.
1971.71-247,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,791.375,801.009,"I am just getting facts for my own self as to whether that picture was available for children to see, that's one point I am interested in?"
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,801.009,809.621,"The answer is that the record shows that there were people of minority age at that fence watching at least parts of the picture, that's correct."
1971.71-247,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,809.621,813.142,That's what I was trying to know.
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,813.142,815.5,That's entirely correct.
1971.71-247,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,920.845,922.6,"Is it here, so we can see it?"
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,922.6,924.02,It is here Mr. Justice Douglas.
1971.71-247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1454.132,1468.013,"Well then you are saying that the state does indeed have to show that actual person's view from outside the theater, juveniles or people who didn't want to be in order to make this a criminal offense?"
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,1468.013,1484.678,"I think in order to prove that offense, yes that they must first define that the offense with particularity in the statue and then prove that the statue was violated by an actual exhibition which actually invaded privacy or caused offense in that sense."
1971.71-247,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1484.678,1494.754,"Well, Mr. Dwyer since we are talking about a statute that doesn't exist, I don't see why you have to take any position in one way or the other as to what it could constitutionally provide."
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,1498.564,1499.943,Exactly Mr. Justice --
1971.71-247,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1499.943,1513.062,"You don't need to -- it's very possible that a state could provide that nobody should have a drive-in theater within a 200 yards of any residence, but there is no statute of any kind in this case, that's you point, isn't it?"
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,1513.062,1525.731,That is our point and the case can be decided without reaching at all the questions of what the states constitutionally could do because here they have done nothing.
1971.71-247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1561.229,1566.844,Couldn't your client have gotten another copy of the film from somewhere?
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,1566.844,1581.7,"That is not shown in the record Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but I can advice the Court that is a general rule, it is not easy at all to obtain a substitute print when a print is seized and particularly in a location like Richmond, Washington."
1971.71-247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1613.911,1618.72,"And then he wasn't adjoined from showing it, he was prevented by the film being out of his possession?"
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,1618.72,1628.279,"Yes he was and our position is that seizure for evidential purposes, in effect is identical to an injunction aimed to suppressing the materials."
1971.71-247,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1628.279,1632.657,Are you claiming violation of the Fourth Amendment or the First or both?
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,1632.657,1657.194,"Well we claim both, but the emphasis on our brief has been on the First Amendment because as we read Quantity of Books against Kansas and Marcus against Search Warrant, the First Amendment requires whether materials seized are communication materials as opposed to narcotic or guns or contraband, where they are communications materials, the First Amendment requires an adversary hearing as a precondition of seizure."
1971.71-247,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1657.194,1662.429,As compared with other types of materials where ex parte wants may issue?
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,1662.429,1666.066,"Yes exactly, upon showing a probable cause, in other --"
1971.71-247,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1666.066,1668.964,But no case here is applied to (Inaudible) --
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,1668.964,1669.875,Not yet.
1971.71-247,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1672.242,1674.719,Lee didn't talk about that much earlier?
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,1674.719,1675.97,Lee didn't talk about it.
1971.71-247,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1682.094,1684.069,"There was no search warrant at all here, was it?"
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,1684.069,1684.467,There was no search --
1971.71-247,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1684.467,1685.901,It was an arrest warrant?
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,1685.901,1686.598,Merely an arrest warrant --
1971.71-247,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1686.598,1688.755,And the search was incident to the arrest?
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,1688.755,1689.591,Yes.
1971.71-247,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1689.591,1698.247,"And the -- so the arrest was valid, you say the search would still be invalid, searches in the First Amendment area?"
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,1698.247,1698.759,Yes.
1971.71-247,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1698.759,1701.559,That we should not apply ordinary Fourth Amendment law?
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,1701.559,1710.016,This is in the First Amendment area and special law has to be applied and the Court so held as to Books in the Quantity of Books against Kansas.
1971.71-247,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1716.476,1727.258,"You say that an adversary hearing would have been required to seize one copy of a book of which the distributor had a 1,000?"
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,1727.258,1733.756,"I think so, yes, because in the first place, how was the fact to establish that he has 1,000 copies if there was no adversary hearing."
1971.71-247,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1767.782,1782.788,"But you would say if it turns out there were 1,000 copies in the store and only one was seized, the burden on First Amendment right is such that there should have been a prior adversary hearing ?"
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,1782.788,1805.291,Well I think there should have been because to reach that result the only way to reach it is either to hold an ex parte hearing in which case one runs the appreciable risk as the Court said in the Kansas case that a defacto prior restraint will occur or to have an adversary hearing and one such issue in the hearing could be the quantity of duplicates available.
1971.71-247,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1805.291,1822.183,"What if a policeman in he street in New York city walks in the store, and sees -- he is an eye witness to the sale by the proprietor of the hardest imaginable core kind of pornography."
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,1831.458,1837.329,"I think he should not be able to Mr. Justice Stewart, because a policeman's idea of what constitutes hard core --"
1971.71-247,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1837.329,1843.879,Well I am assuming it's your idea as to the worst possible thing you can imagine?
1971.71-247,0,44558,william_l_dwyer,,1843.879,1853.333,"I would still say, even if it's my idea a court should determine in an advisory hearing before that material is seized, otherwise the protections are forfeited."
1971.71-247,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1878.856,1879.856,Thank you Mr. Dwyer.
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,1882.019,1886.314,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.71-247,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1920.556,1924.095,Have there been any civil determination quite at that time?
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,1924.095,1931.387,"No, there haven't Mr. Justice Douglas, none at all in my jurisdiction regarding this movie or any other to my knowledge."
1971.71-247,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1949.065,1954.666,Mr. Ludwig I read Justice McGowan's opinion as finding the picture only partially obscene.
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,1961.086,1971.148,I think Mr. Justice – formerly justice McGowan's opinion was probably the best written brief submitted more or less to this Court in a way.
1971.71-247,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2011.509,2022.232,"But the court said, that the Judge McGowan's in his opinion at least said that if we were to apply strict rules of Roth, the film Carmen Baby probably would pass the definition of obscenity test?"
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2022.232,2033.246,"Yes Your Honor, I am aware of that and I was going to try and lead into how I feel he interpreted that or how I interpret that."
1971.71-247,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2335.748,2338.789,What decisions of this Court do you rely on?
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2338.789,2368.072,"Your Honor, we rely on those mentioned by Justice McGowan, the Ginzburg case, the Michigan case, the Redrup case, and numerous other decisions, I think of comparing opinions of Chief Justice Warren that's cited in the brief in one case wherein he stated it was not the film that was on trial, but the defendant, it's not the film but the manner of use and display."
1971.71-247,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2368.072,2378.591,"Now here there was no claim on your part as I understand, and no evidence that there was anything like the so-called pandering that the Court found in Ginzburg, isn't that true?"
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2378.591,2387.784,"Yes Your Honor, I think the kind reliance by the Washington Court of the opinion was Redrup on assault individual privacy."
1971.71-247,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2387.784,2392.81,But your statute doesn't prohibit that?
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2392.81,2397.023,Our statute Your Honor prohibits the showing of obscene material.
1971.71-247,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2397.023,2404.932,"Right, right and you have indicated that this movie had one of what this Court has held are the three requisite elements?"
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2404.932,2419.939,"And I think this Court Your Honor, in all respect, has also held that in certain settings, these things maybe obscene, whereas they would not otherwise be obscene in the abstract."
1971.71-247,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2445.278,2454.832,"You may think so, but as I read the opinion of Mr. Justice McGowan, Judge McGowan he didn't."
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2459.78,2460.214,Yes Your Honor.
1971.71-247,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2460.214,2464.09,"He said this doesn't meet the criteria of Roth, didn't he?"
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2464.09,2476.208,"Yes and as I understand that he's thinking of Roth, judging this beyond in an abstract setting and not in the context of its outdoor obtrusive display."
1971.71-247,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2476.208,2478.466,And you don't have any statute or arguments that talks about it --
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2478.466,2478.812,No Your Honor.
1971.71-247,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2478.812,2480.574,-- the outdoor obtrusive display?
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2480.574,2482.47,We had at that time and we still have.
1971.71-247,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2491.416,2508.578,"Mr. Ludwig is that your contention that when you're dealing with people who are unwilling viewers or with juveniles, that the type of material which the state may proscribe need not necessarily need all three of the obscenity clauses?"
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2508.578,2541.442,"I think this Court has indicated that in a case where concern of juveniles, you need a statute expressing that limited concern, but I don't think this Court as I have review the opinions and decisions has said that you need a special statute to prohibit pandering, that you need a special statute to prohibit what Mr. Michigan was doing, or that you need a special statute to take care of the obtrusive display that there was not present in the cases reversed by Redrup."
1971.71-247,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2541.442,2565.821,"let's assume that this was -- and I haven't seen any movies lately, but Goldilocks and the Three Bears and that the light and the noise and the traffic bothered householders, that the showing of the movie bothered the nearby householders."
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2568.747,2570.143,Not an obscenity conviction.
1971.71-247,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2570.143,2574.78,Well you did with this movie which your Court has found is not obscene?
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2574.78,2577.928,On the theory that because of the contextual segregation --
1971.71-247,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2577.928,2582.72,Because it bothered the nearby residents say or potentially a minor?
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2582.72,2598.304,"Because as this Court has said perhaps in the recent case of Cohen whatever else may give rise to the state's broader power to protect or interfere in this field, they must be in some way erotic."
1971.71-247,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2601.345,2607.23,"And I presume that your state could legislate against those nuisance matters, could it not --?"
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2607.23,2624.84,"Yes I presume it could Your Honor, but I wonder if we buy and accept petitioner's argument wholeheartedly, that when talking about a fundamental First Amendment guarantee if he is right, then how can we restrict a constitutional guarantee by statute."
1971.71-247,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2624.84,2631.368,I don't think that he has any claim here as a constitutional guarantee to show a bright light on somebody's window or to make a lot of noise --
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2631.368,2633.006,"No, I'm sorry."
1971.71-247,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2634.924,2647.598,"Well, aren't you saying Mr. Ludwig that when you're dealing with obscenity in the context that juvenile in the sense in the context of unwilling viewers, it may have a broader definition?"
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2647.598,2649.042,"It may have, Yes Your honor."
1971.71-247,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2768.37,2777.08,"This conviction was under 968.0102, was it?"
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2777.08,2783.353,Yes Mr. Justice.
1971.71-247,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2823.282,2828.667,"For this film, did they sell tickets to children to see this film?"
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2828.667,2830.317,It's not in the record Your Honor.
1971.71-247,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2853.762,2865.475,But there isn't any evidence I suppose either than that this film was designed for any other group than adults?
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2865.475,2866.733,No there is not Your Honor.
1971.71-247,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2868.2,2871.258,Or any other group than just average adult?
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2871.258,2873.275,That's correct.
1971.71-247,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2873.275,2890.234,"In the first paragraph of the opinion on page 81, as I read it, the court states that Rabe was exhibiting in the motion picture Carmen Baby and had imposed no age restriction upon the paying audience."
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2892.724,2895.55,I'm sorry Mr. Justice --
1971.71-247,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2895.55,2902.476,"This is on page 81 of the appendix, opinion of Judge McGowan?"
1971.71-247,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2902.476,2904.272,"Third line, and second paragraph."
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2904.272,2916.017,In my recollection it's not accurate because I'm sure the Washington Court in writing this opinion had statement of facts before it and accepted that as in the record (Inaudible)
1971.71-247,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2916.017,2917.037,What page is that?
1971.71-247,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2917.037,2917.796,Page 81.
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2917.796,2921.469,81 of the appendix.
1971.71-247,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2921.469,2938.517,"And the -- and then on page 96 and 97, the same opinion of the Court explicitly refused and found it impossible to ground its decision on the fact that this film was exhibited to minor, did it not?"
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2938.517,2964.435,"Yes Your Honor because they were relying substantially on Redrup and I think Redrup stood for the proposition that to protect juveniles who had to have a specific limited statute, whereas the Washington Court and respondent feels that Redrup also stood for the fact that you didn't have to have such a statute for your concern with the blatant and obtrusive display that affects somebody else's privacy."
1971.71-247,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2965.268,2979.3,"But is it your position that this as just as though they set up in a park downtown, across the street from an elementary school that showed it and allowed juveniles to walk in and sit?"
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,2992.542,3015.323,"I see no effect one way or other is Mr. Chief Justice if it's shown outdoor in a manner where unwilling or even willing youngsters can see it, whether it would be in a drive-in seat or in a park, whether they are admitted by choice or where they are able to see it free of charge, I see no distinction there."
1971.71-247,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3046.597,3055.826,"Because the constitutional right of privacy is assertable only against government, isn't it?"
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,3055.826,3059.995,I think a strict interpretation of the Ninth Amendment maybe --
1971.71-247,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3059.995,3069.871,"Well, the Constitution, about all constitution, the right of privacy if it is a constitutional right, if suppose it's a constitutional right, is assertable only against government, state or federal."
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,3074.812,3077.141,Nuisance action Mr. Justice.
1971.71-247,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3093.847,3099.66,"Well, that's a right against intrusion by government, that's a constitutional right?"
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,3099.66,3118.58,"I understand that Your Honor and I accept that, but I think in answer to the petitioner we're saying that it's not a right dependent upon statute, I think it's a constitutional right and a common law he was talking about and I think the state or the sovereign state of Washington owes the protection of those constitutional rights."
1971.71-247,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3155.496,3165.444,What is the home owner's right of privacy not to see any movie or not to be disturbed by the picture there or what is it?
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,3165.444,3173.292,"I think Mr. Justice Marshall that home owner's right of privacy is to be free from obscene, erotic sexual scene."
1971.71-247,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3173.292,3177.201,Where in the world do you get that?
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,3177.201,3185.804,From the state's general obscenity statute and from the case of Roth which says obscenity is not constitutionally protected.
1971.71-247,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3185.804,3190.668,"But you recognize that you do not have a state statute, that's what I am talking about?"
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,3190.668,3191.646,We have a general --
1971.71-247,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3191.646,3207.558,"The states could very well, I understand Mr. Dwyer admit that the state could pass such a statute and so you can show these where they are being seen by unwilling people, but you haven't passed the statute."
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,3215.508,3219.049,"Our general obscenity statute Your Honor is an old statute, it's not new."
1971.71-247,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3219.049,3222.768,I think we can say before drive-ins?
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,3222.768,3226.558,I think it may -- we have amended it now to protect juvenile.
1971.71-247,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3226.558,3234.432,"Yeah, but wouldn't you assume so and so the whole point is that the statute, you haven't passed such a statute."
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,3252.594,3273.089,"Your Honor, I think the general obscenity statute is sufficient Mr. Dwyer has been kind enough to tell me that our general obscenity statute is dated perhaps 1909, but other people have been convicted under general obscenity statues with guidelines and decisions from this Court."
1971.71-247,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3291.271,3294.218,Well why would the motion picture have to have that dominate theme?
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,3311.818,3338.191,"Mr. Justice Stewart I think noise and light is other than erotic sexual scenes and I go back to Cohen v. California where the exact words escape me, but whatever else may give rise to the state's broader part to regulate and prescribe this type of conduct, it must be in some way erotic and this is erotic."
1971.71-247,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3338.191,3343.218,"Well, I guess you have Stanley --"
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,3343.218,3352.156,Petitioner says that it is a vague applied as an ex post facto decision that there are no guidelines.
1971.71-247,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3416.902,3428.013,Why didn't your court also base its judgment on perhaps the special appeal of that film to children or the special offensiveness of it to children?
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,3428.013,3430.186,Your Honor I think perhaps it could have.
1971.71-247,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3430.186,3432.071,"Well, they said they couldn't."
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,3432.071,3435.388,But we had since the prosecution commenced amended the statute.
1971.71-247,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3435.388,3437.95,I understand that.
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,3454.583,3460.314,Didn't express the limited concern for juveniles as was suggested by Redrup and Redrup was a case that they were relying on.
1971.71-247,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3460.314,3473.219,"Well, base its decision on its effect on joining homeowners but the statue wasn't tailored with specific concern, isn't it?"
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,3473.219,3479.158,"Well, as I read Redrup it did not require a special statutory concern."
1971.71-247,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3487.813,3491.165,"Well, you are suggesting that you don't agree with your court."
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,3491.165,3491.966,"No, I do Your Honor."
1971.71-247,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3514.522,3522.212,"Well, Redrup -- quite apart from Redrup what do you think about ordinary due process of law, Cohen against Arkansas?"
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,3522.212,3525.105,I am not familiar with Cohen.
1971.71-247,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3525.105,3537.425,"Well, a variety of cases that say that a criminal statute has to give fair notice both to the citizenry and to the law enforcement officers and to the judges as to why it is that's illegal."
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,3537.425,3554.003,I think we do give fair notice by our statute prescribing obscenity and then defining obscenity as material dealing with a -- having a dominant theme appealing to the prurient interest and then saying that other things are relevant in the determination of that obscenity.
1971.71-247,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3554.003,3556.056,"I just read your statue, it doesn't say any of those things."
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,3556.056,3559.557,I know the statue is a general obscenity status Your Honor.
1971.71-247,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3659.088,3666.874,What is that about the seizure that has the practical effect of suppression?
1971.71-247,1,19404,curtis_ludwig,,3666.874,3678.641,Your Honor I think Lee Art Theater said that it should be made on a judicial determination designed to focus searchingly on the question obscenity as the Marcus.
1971.71-247,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3678.641,3683.03,Without an advisory hearing?
1971.71-247,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3683.03,3684.876,Thank you Mr. Ludwig.
