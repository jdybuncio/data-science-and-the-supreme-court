1969.39,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,21.607,"Number 39, Hall against Beals and others."
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,22.483,23.611,"Yes, sir."
1969.39,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,23.611,26.813,You may proceed whenever you're ready.
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,26.813,30.324,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.39,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,69.586,75.793,But you're position is the two months is just as bad as six months or one year.
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,75.793,78.037,"Yes, sir."
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,79.023,87.116,"Although, if it had been two month at the time you wanted to vote, you wouldn't have been able to bring this lawsuit, I suppose."
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,87.116,88.102,I wouldn't have been able to.
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,88.102,88.312,No.
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,88.312,88.769,"No, sir."
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,88.769,89.917,But you could've voted.
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,89.917,102.908,"Yes, sir, but at the time, I was disenfranchised and I am now the representative of a class of all voters who were disenfranchised by similar qualms."
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,102.908,107.786,"Well, you -- well, we both know there's a mootness question in this case."
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,107.786,108.096,"Yes, sir."
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,108.096,109.87,I presume you'll address yourself to it.
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,109.87,110.457,"Yes, sir."
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,110.457,114.188,"You can be representative of the class and not be a member of it, I suppose."
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,114.188,123.69,"Well, I was a member of the class at the time the -- of my case, Your Honor, and I was disenfranchised and was prevented from voting."
1969.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,123.69,132.588,"By any residence requirement, it wouldn't matter as to the class what the length of the residence requirement was, I gather, is that your position?"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,132.588,134.527,"Well, the residence requirements vary per state."
1969.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,134.527,138.755,"Well, in other words, at the time you brought the lawsuit, you could've --"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,138.755,139.921,It was six months and I was disenfranchised.
1969.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,139.921,145.907,"Yes, and you couldn't appear for anyone except the resident at Colorado, I take it."
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,145.907,150.503,"Well, Your Honor, I believe the problem is similar in all the states."
1969.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,150.503,151.04,"I know, but --"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,151.04,152.126,It isn't my problem.
1969.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,152.126,156.286,"But as a class action, could you appear for a class of residents of New York, for example, in the juris --"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,156.286,156.703,"No, sir."
1969.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,159.098,161.084,"So then, at that time, it was six months."
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,161.084,162.122,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1969.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,162.122,163.05,"Now, it's two months."
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,163.05,163.809,That's correct.
1969.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,163.809,169.735,"Did you represent, at the time you brought the action, anyone less than two months?"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,169.735,175.895,I would've represented everyone from six months on down which would've included people who'd been there two months.
1969.39,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,175.895,179.426,Down to one day?
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,181.23,189.34,"Well, it's my contention, Your Honor, that no period longer than the registration period should be required by the state."
1969.39,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,203.453,208.804,"Mr. Hall, where is it that you said people in Colorado?"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,208.804,209.81,"I beg your pardon, Your Honor?"
1969.39,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,209.81,214.728,Did you say your class is limited to people in Colorado?
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,214.728,222.064,"Well, I think, as a technical matter of the drafting of my complaint, that's the class I attempted to represent, but I --"
1969.39,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,222.064,238.757,"Well, wouldn't your class rather be people who, at the present time, are in Colorado but who weren't there when you brought the case, because all those who were there when you brought the case are now franchised?"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,238.757,241.41,"That's correct, Your Honor, and, of course, the question won't come up again."
1969.39,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,241.41,243.484,You got a little technical problem.
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,243.484,243.941,"Yes, sir."
1969.39,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,252.861,260.546,"Well, what would be your status if you leave Colorado next week and then come back two years from now?"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,265.225,274.997,"If I acquired a residence in another state and then move back into Colorado less than two months before the National Election, no, I would not be allowed to vote."
1969.39,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,274.997,277.842,"Well, doesn't that give you status?"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,277.842,279.417,"Well, I would feel it does, Your Honor."
1969.39,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,279.417,283.886,I'm just worried about you giving up so quick.
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,283.886,295.89,"Well, Your Honor, I think, first, I do face the problem I've pointed out in the amicus briefs that I may move again in the future."
1969.39,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,342.121,351.719,"Mr. Hall, is one of the purposes of the residence requirement to protect the integrity of the elective process?"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,351.719,352.046,"Yes, sir."
1969.39,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,353.803,373.593,"Well, if you could vote in Colorado by arriving there on Friday to regis -- in time to register with no other requirement, this would mean that you can vote by absentee ballot in New York and move to Colorado or --"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,373.593,374.232,"Well, if you would tip to that --"
1969.39,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,374.232,376.078,And vote in Colorado again.
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,379.043,384.59,"Well, if one attempted that, he would be in violation of the law because when you apply in Colorado, you --"
1969.39,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,384.59,387.792,"Well, I suppose anytime anybody ever votes twice he's violating some rule, wouldn't that be true?"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,387.792,389.626,"Well, yes, sir."
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,424.343,425.768,"Well, how about other states?"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,425.768,430.908,"Some states, Your Honor, do have the new resident fill out what amounts to a postcard --"
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,430.908,446.594,"You're asking us to lay down, to decide a basic constitution that anything should -- as long as two months is invalid, which has some impact beyond Colorado."
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,452.58,458.128,"Well, the question is whether the waiting period serves any state purpose."
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,458.128,458.904,"Well, you admit --"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,465.152,466.288,"Yes, Your Honor I think --"
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,466.288,467.434,Why?
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,468.031,473.568,I think the question of the purity of election is a legitimate state concern.
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,478.526,480.332,Any state?
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,480.332,484.507,"Well, I think the question is similar for all the states, yes, sir."
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,503.125,504.453,You can't in California?
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,504.453,505.609,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,505.609,508.888,"You think the same -- you'd have the same -- what's the rule in California, do you know?"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,508.888,511.779,"It's 54 days, Your Honor."
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,511.779,513.883,Do you think that's unreasonable?
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,513.883,528.4,"Well, the State of New York has an amicus for the State of Colorado said that they have more people, maybe that a state could show that they have added problems because of an increase population and --"
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,528.4,537.834,"Are you suggesting that -- you're suggesting then that we might hold this waiting period unconstitutional in Colorado, but wholly constitutional in California and New York."
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,537.834,544.774,"Well, I think the particular states would have to show a legitimate state interest to support their particular requirement."
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,559.674,571.035,"As I understand it, you would say that it's some sort of a burden, and I gather you think a rather heavy burden on a state to show a need for this sort of a residence requirement."
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,571.035,571.806,"Yes, sir."
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,571.806,572.821,Why?
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,572.821,573.229,Well --
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,573.229,578.95,In view of Article 2 Section 1 and of the Twelfth Amendment of the United States Constitution --
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,578.95,579.428,"Well, Your Honor --"
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,579.428,584.289,"Which, effectively provides that this is up to each state legislature, why do you think the state has to --"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,584.289,584.911,"Well, Your Honor, I think --"
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,584.911,585.165,Bestow such a burden?
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,585.165,595.669,"Article 2 Section 1 provides that the state can't chose the man in which presidential electors are appointed, but once they decide that it's to be done by popular election."
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,620.95,626.76,"Well, the right of free interstate travel, of course, is a constitutional right, as has been held --"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,626.76,627.437,"Yes, sir."
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,627.437,630.546,Repeatedly and very recently by this Court.
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,641.652,650.065,"Well, I believe those statements come from cases decided in an earlier day, Your Honor."
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,651.194,652.876,Under the same constitution.
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,652.876,670.036,"Yes, sir, but I believe the recent cases such as Kramer, Williams versus Roads, and others suggest that the right to vote is a fundamental right that the Court protects with the most rigid scrutiny and that applies a compelling interest test."
1969.39,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,720.706,728.024,"Well, are they elected by the people as a whole under the constitution as it now stands?"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,728.024,731.925,"Well, they are elected at the present time under the electoral college system."
1969.39,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,731.925,733.766,"Yes, but that isn't under people as a whole."
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,736.861,750.199,"Well, that's correct, Your Honor, but I believe that the popular view is that they're elected by the people that it's expression of the national --"
1969.39,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,750.199,751.224,"Well, the popular view --"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,751.224,751.971,Will.
1969.39,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,751.971,756.752,"May be one thing, but the fact is another."
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,756.752,777.592,"Well, that may be, Your Honor, but in the Williams versus Roads case, for example, the state attempted to rely on Article 2 Section 1 and this Court said that Article 2 Section 1 does not allow a state to set up requirements that violate the Equal Protection Clause."
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,795.174,798.528,You mean the two months restriction doesn't?
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,805.17,810.379,"The State of Colorado, Your Honor, has said you could register up until Friday before the election."
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,810.379,812.682,Would you say they can have a three-day period?
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,812.682,813.17,"Yes, sir."
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,813.877,816.847,That serves a compelling state interest?
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,816.847,818.539,"They apparently feel that it does, Your Honor."
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,825.594,836.704,"But would you -- if they only had a three-day waiting period, would you attack that?"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,836.704,838.56,"I doubt it, Your Honor."
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,838.56,841.749,That would serve a compelling state interest.
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,841.749,844.854,"Arguably, Your Honor, and I don't believe I would."
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,856.112,856.216,And would you --
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,856.216,857.112,On a special machine.
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,857.112,861.5,"Would you have a different view if this was for a state office, this election was for state office?"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,861.5,862.485,"Yes, sir, I would."
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,862.485,862.923,Why?
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,864.45,865.291,I think there is the --
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,865.291,865.754,Suffice a jury?
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,865.754,874.392,Question of ensuring that the voter is familiar with the state candidates and the state issues so that he can vote intelligently.
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,874.392,877.979,And you don't think that's relevant in voting for electors?
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,877.979,878.282,"No, sir."
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,880.203,885.044,You don't think electors should really understand the problems of the state?
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,885.044,893.816,"The electors, perhaps, Your Honor, but the people who vote for the electors vote on the basis of national issues for national candidates."
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,900.627,911.154,"Do you think voters ought to know the difference between presidential candidates in terms of, say, their views on reclamation or water or natural resources?"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,911.154,919.717,"I feel the dominant issues in, for example, last year's campaign, Your Honor, were national in scope."
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,932.27,932.772,In whether a --
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,932.772,933.748,A selection of a pres --
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,933.748,940.141,"In whether a President carries a state, the western state?"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,940.141,941.166,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,971.549,985.474,"Well, that is contrary, is it not, both to the original theory of the constitution of Article 2 Section 1 as well, I suppose, to statistical fact even in modern contemporary elections?"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,990.867,991.195,"Well, as I say, Your Honor --"
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,991.195,1016.79,"Another area is for another, and I said -- and can't -- you mean, you cannot concede that a person who is familiar with a particular problem, say, of the western slope of the rocky mountains in Colorado might be quite differently attuned to a national election based upon the candidate's views of some of the issues that my brother White has mentioned - reclamation, conservation, water."
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1022.307,1022.362,"First, Your Honor --"
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1022.362,1025.271,Are attuned and familiar with the problems of that sort of an urban society?
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1025.271,1033.898,"I believe, Your Honor, that the problems you mention are local instances of other national problems."
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1053.299,1053.847,Yes.
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1053.847,1070.147,"And furthermore, Your Honor, I don't believe that if that is the justification the state wishes to comply, as expressed in Carrington versus Rash, I don't believe a state has the right to prevent people from voting because of a concern as to which way they would vote."
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1070.147,1088.174,"I know, but the -- one of the justifications asserted here is that a state has an interest and a right in seeing to it that its voters are familiar with local problems, and it's your submission, as I understand it that local problems or local impact, if you will, of national issues is of absolutely no relevance whatever."
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1088.174,1100.129,"I don't claim it's of absolutely no relevance, Your Honor, but I do think that the dominant influence on a voter in the presidential election are national issues."
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1280.736,1296.449,"When you say that the decision in Drueding doesn -- against Devlin doesn't necessitate a decision against you, what -- I suppose you do concede we have to overrule Drueding in order to decide this case in your favor, would we not?"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1296.449,1306.769,"Well, first, Your Honor, the right to travel theory that came up in the Shapiro versus Thompson was not before the Drueding Court."
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1308.426,1314.65,"Yes, but we'd have to overrule that decision in order to rule in this case in your favor, assuming this case is not moot, isn't that correct?"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1314.65,1322.406,"Yes, sir, I believe that's correct, but I believe that a different theory is present here."
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1371.024,1372.805,"Well, we'd have to overrule it."
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1372.805,1376.106,"Yes, sir."
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1376.106,1379.066,"Well, whatever obstacle that might constitute for --"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1379.066,1379.225,"Yes, sir."
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1379.225,1379.922,Various members of this Court.
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1379.922,1388.192,"Yes, sir, nor do I believe, Your Honors, that the question is moot."
1969.39,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1411.408,1423.782,"Are there any reliable records anywhere on how many people who moved and sought and could not vote in the new place of residence, reliable statistics?"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1423.782,1440.488,"Well, I have referred in brief, Your Honor, to statistics introduced by Senator Kennedy in support of a Bill he introduced in Congress, which he had prepared by the Bureau of the Census, and those figures are set forth in a particular page in the congressional order."
1969.39,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1440.488,1445.971,"Well, those are people who moved, not -- that doesn't go to the -- that's an objective factor."
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1451.807,1452.15,"No, sir."
1969.39,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1463.051,1473.129,"So, when we're talking about millions of people being disenfranchised, we don't know whether they were disenfranchised or whether they just didn't care one way or the other."
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1473.129,1490.932,"Well, we don't know that, Your Honor, but, as I say, they may have made private inquiry or articles come out in the paper before election about what the registration requirements are and they could just, in the privacy of their living room, read that they are not eligible and not make the effort to go down and apply."
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1534.963,1539.296,You're not s -- you're not asking that the 1968 election be set aside.
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1539.296,1563.66,"No, sir, nor do I feel that the amendment of the law down to two months makes the case moot, first, because I feel that the two-month requirement still has the question of being unreasonable and, secondly, there are 20 states in the Union that still have a requirement of six months or longer."
1969.39,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1617.17,1620.578,"What is the lowest requirement of any state, Mr. Hall?"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1620.578,1621.349,The lowest?
1969.39,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1621.349,1622.538,Yes.
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1622.538,1626.031,"The State of Wisconsin has no requirement at all, Your Honor."
1969.39,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1641.24,1643.28,For both national and state now?
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1643.28,1645.745,"No, sir, just for the presidential election."
1969.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1653.606,1654.646,As has Colorado?
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1654.646,1656.532,"As has Colorado, yes, sir."
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1656.532,1657.671,The --
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1659.224,1663.766,"Yes, sir, I am finished."
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1663.766,1672.548,There's no very clear definition that I can find in your complaint or elsewhere as to the class that you purportedly represent.
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1675.697,1676.254,"Well, Your Honor, that --"
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1676.254,1677.747,A broad or a narrow definition.
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1677.747,1685.116,That question wasn't decided by the District Court because they decided against me personally.
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1693.793,1695.833,Wherever -- in any of the 50 states?
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1695.833,1699.52,"Yes, sir, that would be my contention."
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1699.52,1702.013,That would be someone at your class.
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1706.137,1713.4,"Well, at the time, I was representing people trying to vote in 1968, but I would contend that I -- the question is the same and will come up --"
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1713.4,1715.972,The class is constantly changing every --
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1715.972,1717.942,But it constantly exists.
1969.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1720.549,1725.897,"So, all the people you represent when the case started have to qualify to vote, but there are some new ones."
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1725.897,1727.459,"We know that there will be new ones, Your Honor."
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1735.798,1744.579,"Really, you represent, I suppose you might assert, every adult in the United States because anybody in any state might want to move --"
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1744.579,1746.33,"Prospectively, that's correct, Your Honor."
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1746.33,1747.534,Probably before the next presidential election.
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1747.534,1748.49,"And also, I would point out --"
1969.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1748.49,1752.724,Do you represent everybody in the United States?
1969.39,0,39506,richard_hall,,1752.724,1755.276,"Everyo -- prospectively, you could say that."
1969.39,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1805.225,1809.899,"Thank you, Mr. Hall."
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,1812.212,1816.222,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2099.766,2108.071,Suppose Mr. Hall leaves Colorado tomorrow and returns 30 days before election day in 1972.
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2108.071,2109.141,Yes.
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2109.141,2111.146,He couldn't vote?
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2111.146,2111.947,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2114.499,2116.519,But he leaves tomorrow.
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2116.519,2117.852,And becomes a resident of another state.
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2117.852,2120.21,Becomes a resident of another state.
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2120.21,2120.27,"Yes, sir."
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2120.27,2127.17,"And returns to Colorado, well, would that be 59 days before."
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2127.17,2128.679,"Yes, Your Honor, two months."
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2136.634,2138.399,He would not be able to vote.
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2138.399,2143.091,Not if he returned within 30 days and established a new residency in Colorado at that time.
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2143.091,2145.603,"So, this case is moot."
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2145.603,2154.06,"Your Honor, we certainly declare that this case -- maintain that this case is moot as to all of the issues."
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2154.06,2164.319,"Well, would you think for a moment and tell me how a person in Mr. Hall's situation could ever litigate this matter?"
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2164.319,2168.762,He can litigate it as he did at the District Court level.
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2168.762,2179.822,"And if he loses there, is there any way under the sun for him to get here before election?"
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2179.822,2195.078,"Your Honor, I would feel that the suit should have been filed in a timely manner so that time could've been allowed for review, although your point is certainly well taken, Mr. Justice Marshall, namely that it would be very difficult."
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2203.009,2205.138,"You wouldn't go as far as impossible, would you?"
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2205.138,2212.406,"No, sir."
1969.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2339.667,2343.045,That's never been passed on the Registration Board in Colorado?
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2343.045,2345.115,"No, Your Honor."
1969.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2351.18,2352.956,But they held the six months reasonable.
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2352.956,2359.085,"They held the six months reasonable, Your Honor, yes."
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2489.135,2499.883,Didn't the Maryland say in the last paragraph that we've been assured by the Attorney General that the General Assembly of Maryland is going to change the law?
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2499.883,2500.888,There was some mention made to that.
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2500.888,2508.796,"And didn't he also say that the plaintiff did a wonderful job in getting it changed, assuming that they would change it?"
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2508.796,2513.274,"Yes, I recall there was some reference to that, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2615.213,2627.7,Wouldn't that voter who went from New York to New Jersey be subject to the same criminal penalties of the voter that went from Wart 6 to Wart 8 in New York?
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2627.7,2628.656,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2628.656,2632.253,And do you -- you're sure that that happens?
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2632.253,2632.9,But the criminal penalty --
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2632.9,2636.547,"There is illegal voting in every state, I assume."
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2636.547,2637.388,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2637.632,2644.801,And I assume that they are punishable and this person would be punishable here.
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2644.801,2654.975,"He would be punishable, but the election would be over and, no doubt, the electoral college would've met on December 5 of the particular presidential election year and we would have an election on the books."
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2654.975,2660.92,That goes where they have great congressional investigations as to vote frauds in certain states.
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2668.003,2672.173,"Two months is necessary, Your Honor, for this reason."
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2679.103,2685.69,"This resident here bought a home, registered his car, and paid taxes."
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2685.69,2685.924,"Yes, sir."
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2685.924,2688.805,What else would you need to find out about him?
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2688.805,2696.473,"Well, we feel that tying all these other requisites you've mentioned, Your Honor, go to status and we don't feel that that's at all legitimate."
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2707.633,2707.708,"Well, what makes him --"
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2707.708,2709.474,We need some indicia --
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2709.474,2713.255,What makes him such a good citizen in two months?
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2713.255,2714.608,"In two months, Your Honor, there is time --"
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2714.608,2724.583,"What else could he do in two months, other than to buy a home, register his car, pay his taxes, and do everything that any other resident does?"
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2727.107,2731.824,"The two months is not giving him status to vote, Your Honor."
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2736.535,2739.162,Couldn't you check these facts in two minutes?
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2739.162,2743.844,This is administrative -- this is an administrative reason to protect the period of election.
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2743.844,2751.103,"How long would it take you to find out that he owned a home, owned a car and registered the car, and paid his taxes?"
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2751.103,2763.384,"On a full-scaled basis, Your Honor, our legislature -- this indicia, our legislature has determined that it takes two months on a new resident to legitimately check out these things."
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2779.702,2782.593,"Well, they changed it from six to two."
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2782.593,2783.225,Pardon me?
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2783.225,2785.897,They changed it from six months to two months.
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2785.897,2786.977,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2786.977,2790.405,"Because, obviously, they thought six months was wrong."
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2793.087,2794.017,They -- I'm not conceding --
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2794.017,2795.122,Couldn't I assume that?
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2795.122,2796.202,"I won't concede that, Your Honor."
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2796.202,2797.55,"I could assume that, couldn't I?"
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2797.55,2806.819,"I will concede that in order to make it as far as possible, humanly possible, they took it down to two months."
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2806.949,2813.451,"Like the fact that the difference between the six-month period and the two, you had an increase in population, haven't you?"
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2813.451,2815.996,"Colorado, like many states -- western states, is noting a great increase in population."
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2815.996,2820.454,"So, there's a good possibility we're wrong about the six months."
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2821.454,2824.757,"Well, I can't second guess the legislature, Your Honor, whether they felt they were wrong or not."
1969.39,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2824.757,2836.546,"Well, speaking for myself, if I assumed that maybe they were wrong about the six months, a few years from now they might find they were wrong about the two."
1969.39,1,17493,bernard_r_baker,,2838.648,2841.42,"Well, it could follow, Your Honor."
1969.39,2,39506,richard_hall,,3697.639,3698.114,"Yes, sir."
1969.39,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3778.51,3779.759,Thank you.
