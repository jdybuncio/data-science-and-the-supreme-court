1974.74-466,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,63.951,"We'll hear arguments next in 74-466, Dunlop against Bachowski."
1974.74-466,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,72.55,75.989,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1056.762,1069.46,Does the secretary's decision not to sue must be preceded I gather by his determining that there is not probable cause to believe that there is a violation of the act?
1974.74-466,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1069.46,1078.343,Either that there's not a violation of the act or that the violation did not affect -- there's not enough probable cause to believe there that it affected the outcome of the election.
1974.74-466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1081.35,1082.315,"It certainly is, isn't that it?"
1974.74-466,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1082.315,1083.586,"No it's not, but this Court has --"
1974.74-466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1083.586,1084.845,Where did you find that?
1974.74-466,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1084.845,1092.924,"Well, it appears in the legislative history, it appears in this Court's decisions and it's been uniform decisions of the Court of Appeals."
1974.74-466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1092.924,1102.536,"Let's assume it weren't in there -- let's just assume it weren't in there and the statute simply says on its face, if there's probable cause, the secretary shall, shall bring a civil action."
1974.74-466,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1102.536,1103.161,Well --
1974.74-466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1103.161,1103.668,That's it.
1974.74-466,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1103.668,1105.128,-- it is on its face --
1974.74-466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1105.128,1107.476,"That's hardly -- that's hardly unlimited, discretion in the secretary, isn't it?"
1974.74-466,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1107.476,1109.202,"Well, we're not saying as unlimited discretion."
1974.74-466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1109.463,1110.156,Being as un --
1974.74-466,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1110.156,1111.368,-- unreviewable discretion and there's --
1974.74-466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1111.368,1111.623,"You say it, there's a view?"
1974.74-466,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1111.623,1112.535,-- a difference.
1974.74-466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1113.87,1116.268,"Well, not the way you put it in your brief."
1974.74-466,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1116.268,1121.093,"Well, I think if you read the brief, a lot of my argument it'll --"
1974.74-466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1121.093,1122.74,Like your legislative history?
1974.74-466,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1122.74,1130.379,"Well, the legislative history I'm referring to Mr. Justice White, it's very explicit in the section by section analysis in both the senate reports."
1974.74-466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1140.554,1148.873,But you say -- you say that the secretary should have the unreviewable discretion of a prosecutor deciding not to file a charge.
1974.74-466,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1148.873,1149.926,"Well, I -- ."
1974.74-466,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1149.926,1152.548,The same as the general counsel for labor board?
1974.74-466,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1152.548,1166.231,"Precisely, now, that's really -- that issue is an important issue I think but I -- it really isn't even in this case because there's no question that the secretary here found that there was violations that did not affect the outcome of the election."
1974.74-466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1189.372,1194.892,But you say the secretary could be as arbitrary as he wants to in turning down a suit?
1974.74-466,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1194.892,1198.617,"Well, we all say he can be arbitrary, we just say that his exercise of discretion --"
1974.74-466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1198.617,1198.851,You say it's unreviewable?
1974.74-466,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1198.851,1200.337,"Well, but that's not the same thing Mr. Justice White."
1974.74-466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1200.337,1202.542,It doesn't make any difference whether it's arbitrary or not.
1974.74-466,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1202.542,1204.471,"Well, it doesn't make any difference in --"
1974.74-466,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1204.471,1205.63,Besides desire from his job?
1974.74-466,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1206.02,1206.552,Precisely.
1974.74-466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1211.954,1214.349,"Whether it's arbitrary or not, you say it's not judicially reviewable?"
1974.74-466,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1214.349,1217.381,Precisely.
1974.74-466,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1242.674,1247.421,"Well, that's true in the sense but it's also true to general counsel of the labor board."
1974.74-466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1268.856,1272.764,Is that clear that he has no other right at all?
1974.74-466,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1272.764,1277.719,"Well, my understanding is that if with that kind of a charge, you would have no other right."
1974.74-466,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1284.409,1299.958,"Did the analogous language in the National Labor Relations Act with respect to what the general counsel shall do upon the filing of a charge with him, does it say he shall if he founds --"
1974.74-466,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1299.958,1310.078,"If the language really is differently structured Mr. Justice Stewart, the -- what it says is in more -- it's a little bit clearer on the face of the statute."
1974.74-466,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1323.121,1325.643,"So, you can't very much rely on the similarity of language?"
1974.74-466,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1325.643,1326.466,"No, I', relying on --"
1974.74-466,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1326.466,1328.008,You're enforcing to the similarity of function and of --
1974.74-466,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1328.008,1328.692,Exactly and --
1974.74-466,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1328.692,1329.006,-- structure.
1974.74-466,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1329.006,1329.724,And the whole.
1974.74-466,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1347.635,1352.637,Very well Mr. Evans.
1974.74-466,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1353.434,1356.739,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.74-466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1637.289,1641.809,"Do you think the secretary ought to leave behind him some evidence that he has done the job, the --"
1974.74-466,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1641.809,1650.657,"Absolutely, I think this Court could well inquire as to what procedures should lead up to the secretary's decision."
1974.74-466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1650.657,1662.684,Do you think there's -- there might be judicial review to the extent of requiring the secretary to A. process a complaint and B. to do it in accordance with the statute.
1974.74-466,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1662.684,1669.478,"I think as to A. the failure to investigate clearly, he could be mandamus to investigate as the statute requires."
1974.74-466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1669.478,1673.301,And also required to make a decision on the complaint?
1974.74-466,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1673.301,1673.773,Absolutely.
1974.74-466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1673.773,1674.929,As to whether the file or not.
1974.74-466,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1674.929,1675.478,Absolutely.
1974.74-466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1675.478,1681.357,"And must he also as I say leave some tracks that indicate that he has decided, there is not probable cause?"
1974.74-466,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1681.357,1687.84,"Well, the Court below said that he had to and it said that it would have reached that result independent of the reviewability of his decision."
1974.74-466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1692.017,1694.661,"And how about -- how about that, do you disagree with that?"
1974.74-466,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1694.661,1696.232,"Not at all, nor does the secretary."
1974.74-466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1696.232,1705.634,And so that he can be required to state reasons as to why he doesn't think there's probable cause or does he just have to say that there isn't probable cause?
1974.74-466,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1705.634,1712.15,"Well, the Court below said, he's got to tell the complaining member of the reasons and the secretary expressly has said that he is not seeking review of that determination."
1974.74-466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1712.15,1713.489,Not either of the certiorari?
1974.74-466,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1713.489,1715.642,"No, not at all."
1974.74-466,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1886.493,1888.586,Mr. Rauh.
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,1888.586,1892.343,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.74-466,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1995.918,1997.888,Where do you say it's admitted?
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,1997.888,2001.259,"Well, of paragraph 18 of our complaint sir."
1974.74-466,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2003.859,2006.059,"Yes, but why do you say the Government admitted it?"
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2006.059,2009.495,Because it was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds.
1974.74-466,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2040.895,2041.999,Which paragraph are you complaining to?
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2041.999,2042.696,18 sir.
1974.74-466,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2042.696,2044.917,"18, on page 5 (a) of appendix."
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2044.917,2046.071,Yes sir.
1974.74-466,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2047.009,2052.542,Was your suit in the District Court something in the nature of a mandamus action?
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2052.542,2064.114,"In the nature, yes sir but it -- you could either -- we didn't call it that but I think you could say it was in the nature of mandamus action sir."
1974.74-466,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2064.114,2070.268,Is mandamus action not limited to an inquiry and to whether the procedure followed was proper?
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2070.268,2075.335,"No, it's a mandamus action only in the sense it would require the secretary to do something."
1974.74-466,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2080.152,2085.326,"Mandamus does not lie to compelling discretionary act, does it?"
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2085.326,2101.022,"Well I -- I may have misspoken but it was mandamus in the sense that we require him to do something but it wasn't the normal review, the normal judicial review and administrative agency is to require them to do something, to do something different than they wanted."
1974.74-466,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2104.163,2110.529,"Do you say that this case is all different than if the secretary had said, I know you file a complaint but I'm just not going to process it?"
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2110.529,2111.879,That's exactly what he did.
1974.74-466,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2127.67,2137.389,Suppose you would say that the secretary should have -- he should have answered and said I investigated and I performed my duty and I move to dismiss?
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2137.389,2138.935,He could have done that but he didn't.
1974.74-466,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2138.935,2143.51,"Well, I know but if he to said that, wouldn't it -- wouldn't the Court had been through then?"
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2145.183,2147.805,"Well, we will -- I think we would have had a right to review."
1974.74-466,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2195.913,2197.931,"Well, that's what the case is about, isn't it?"
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2197.931,2199.87,"But no, I want to argue a broader point."
1974.74-466,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2287.595,2291.176,Congress took the right away to sue under state law?
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2291.176,2291.415,Yes sir.
1974.74-466,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2291.415,2292.577,"Now, you don't challenge that?"
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2292.577,2292.962,"No, no."
1974.74-466,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2295.235,2296.007,You rely on that?
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2296.007,2297.791,"I rely, thank you sir."
1974.74-466,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2310.984,2329.645,"Woo, when you say they couldn't have done that, your been to lose me because I would think Congress could say you have no rights under state law and the interest in having union title unclouded is sufficient that we're going to give the secretary unreviewable discretion."
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2331.179,2332.705,I would but I don't have to.
1974.74-466,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2332.705,2334.672,I would think you don't have to.
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2334.672,2338.729,"I said I don't have to, say there's a constitutional problem, there might be a contracts clause."
1974.74-466,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2427.177,2435.039,Wouldn't the secretary something a little different or a little more than attorney for the union.
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2444.926,2445.044,In this --
1974.74-466,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2445.044,2447.771,"A magisterial function, is it not?"
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2447.771,2450.903,It's a function that involved some discretion.
1974.74-466,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2455.395,2466.061,"Well, in the first instance when the problem is presented to him, he is to act as something in the nature of an umpire, he is neither on the side of the union or on the side of the decedents, isn't that true?"
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2466.061,2483.622,"He had a double function Your Honor, there was something in a nature of an umpire but Senator Kennedy said on the floor and as this Court referred to in Trbovich, he also was to act as a union member's lawyer because the union couldn't sue -- the union couldn't sue himself."
1974.74-466,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2483.622,2487.901,But once he has decided that an action should be brought?
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2487.901,2492.774,"No I think he was the union member's lawyer, I don't think it was in that connection sir."
1974.74-466,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2498.405,2507.445,"We're talking about the Attorney General of the United States but we also have often said -- many Courts have said, he has a magisterial function --"
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2507.445,2509.039,Prosecutorial function too.
1974.74-466,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2509.039,2511.157,Magisterial too.
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2525.334,2534.817,"He has the double function according to the Senator Kennedy saying we are taking away the right of the Union member to sue, we're treating the secretary's union member's lawyer."
1974.74-466,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2539.592,2544.89,Does the -- under the statute have the right to take with the consideration to public interest?
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2544.89,2556.862,"Whatever that might mean sir but in a case where you have the violations affecting the outcome, I can see no other judge malefactor that would come in to it."
1974.74-466,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2557.892,2561.536,"He doesn't have to find his public interest in what you say it is, does it?"
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2561.536,2567.911,No sir but he has to find it and something I think that a Court could reasonably feel was the public interest.
1974.74-466,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2569.546,2571.511,As if the statute didn't give it to him.
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2571.511,2583.418,"If it didn't give him final power, if it did, it sure an exception because after APA, the number of cases this Court has said are totally unreviewable or might be limited."
1974.74-466,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2583.418,2587.313,"Mr. Rauh, as I understand, you seem to have made two points."
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2592.126,2592.33,Yes.
1974.74-466,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2592.33,2594.575,"And secondly, that even if he did it, he was arbitrary, arbitrary does it?"
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2594.575,2595.924,"Yes, precisely Your Honor."
1974.74-466,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2595.924,2611.877,"Now, the first issue seems to have voiced down in this case, its because the Government doesn't contest and neither does the opposing union contest, the secretary has to make the decision, it has to get reasons for it."
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2611.877,2612.158,On the --
1974.74-466,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2612.158,2618.517,"Now, in which event, he is going to demonstrate that he is at least covered to track the act indicate he should cover?"
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2618.517,2622.599,"Sir, for 16 years, the labor department has not given reasons."
1974.74-466,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2622.599,2623.175,Will I know but --
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2623.175,2630.955,"Wait a minute, when we were here in this Supreme Court, you always get improvement in the Government when you're in the Supreme Court."
1974.74-466,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2645.803,2647.262,Well I know but that isn't my point now.
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2649.189,2649.844,No sir.
1974.74-466,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2649.844,2659.723,"Well, why hasn't it, because now they're going to have to give reasons, they're going to have to prove that they didn't disregard the complaint, that they made the investigation, there isn't probable cause and here's why."
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2659.723,2662.599,They're not going to be able to show that they made --
1974.74-466,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2662.599,2662.694,"Well, --"
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2662.694,2666.473,-- they gave us oral phone call we are not going to sue.
1974.74-466,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2668.413,2670.514,Well I know but that was before.
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2670.514,2670.897,That's right.
1974.74-466,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2670.897,2672.018,Before this decision.
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2672.018,2682.368,"Before we got to the Supreme Court and all of a sudden, the labor department when they're in the Supreme Court suddenly says, oh, we're happy to give you reasons and they start giving them."
1974.74-466,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2682.368,2688.97,"Well then which event you will -- if that is what occurred, then you're going to know that they have at least purported to do their job."
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2692.376,2707.191,"Well, I think that's final until we go back and look, we can go back to the District Court if this is reviewable and they can then say what they want to say about it, which they didn't say before."
1974.74-466,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2829.307,2832.726,I don't quite understand your point of what was plucked out of what brief or what case?
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2832.726,2849.86,"Out of the Trbovich Government brief, they plucked the legislative history section of this brief which Your Honors had already rejected in Trbovich as not showing you wanted to exclude the minority member from any union part -- any participation in the process."
1974.74-466,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2849.86,2851.085,This brief plucked from --
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2851.085,2851.442,Yes sir.
1974.74-466,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2851.442,2852.219,-- Trbovich.
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2852.219,2853.215,It's almost identical.
1974.74-466,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2945.909,2951.296,"Of course the argument of opposing counsel is that under the NLRB, there isn't any --"
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2951.296,2956.853,I was going to just get to the NLRB sir.
1974.74-466,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3030.684,3043.636,But isn't the effect of Arman and other cases like that to hold that when the Wagner Act in creating rights actually preempted rights that might have existed under state law for the same purpose?
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3043.636,3053.517,"I don't, but they may have preempted some but by in large sir, there was nothing in the labor law compared to what the Government admits is -- was here."
1974.74-466,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3114.129,3126.257,"By reviewability, you mean that the District Court had the power at your behest to order the secretary to file a suit?"
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3126.257,3126.562,Yes sir.
1974.74-466,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3126.562,3127.661,To set aside the election?
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3127.661,3128.481,Yes sir.
1974.74-466,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3128.481,3130.045,So that extent and --
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3130.045,3131.07,Oh I'd Mr. --
1974.74-466,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3131.07,3135.374,"That's the earlier question of the Chief Justice, you -- this isn't the nature of a mandamus?"
1974.74-466,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3135.374,3140.339,"It's mandamus in remedy, it's a review of administrative action under the APA."
1974.74-466,3,38778,robert_h_bork,,3656.108,3668.755,"Very briefly Mr. Chief Justice, I just want to point out that paragraph 18 of the complaint does not allege that the secretary found probable cause to believe that the violations affected the outcome."
