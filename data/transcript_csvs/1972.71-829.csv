1972.71-829,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.341,"We will hear first this morning in number 71-829, Mourning against Family Publications."
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,16.729,20.038,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1972.71-829,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,90.771,96.732,"You would help me counsel, because I wonder if -- I am not sure I have spelled it out accurately."
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,106.805,110.65,There is nothing in the record to indicate what the price would have been.
1972.71-829,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,110.65,116.425,Do you think that's not important to the case?
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,116.425,120.693,"Under the terms of the regulation and the statute, it's not."
1972.71-829,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,141.414,154.048,"Well if it's an inflated price on a package deal in order to conceal carrying charges, isn't that pretty important?"
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,154.048,193.381,"Well, absent the regulation it would be necessary to inquire about the general practices of the defendant as to whether or not, it was inflating as prices --the whole purpose of the regulation was to make that very detailed and complicated factual inquiry unnecessary, both to avoid deterring private actions such as this one and to make sure that the statute itself was administrative, otherwise the Federal Reserve Board and other enforcement agencies would be in the business of trying to compare the prices for other magazines or bicycles or television sets with the prices charged in contracts like this for all the consumer contracts that are signed every day in country."
1972.71-829,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,193.381,209.15,"But in the classical usury cases, isn't it ordinarily an important factor of evidence to show that the automobile, particular automobile had listed price, a cash price and a time price."
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,214.055,214.615,"Well, that that."
1972.71-829,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,214.615,218.591,Do you say that under these regulations that becomes irrelevant now?
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,218.591,219.194,That's correct.
1972.71-829,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,650.104,652.074,By total price you mean $120?
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,652.074,654.916,$20.45.
1972.71-829,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,841.255,857.084,"Well, then later that, I am even more puzzled, why record does not contain the figures on the publisher’s subscription price for each of these magazine, which you say is irrelevant under the Regulation."
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,857.084,858.074,That's correct.
1972.71-829,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,859.447,876.866,But you just emphasized that a merchant having a $100 price tag on something and a $120 timed price was the kind of an evil that the statute was trying to get at?
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,876.866,886.93,The regulation is designed not merely to facilitate or encourage that kind of case by case inquiry as to whether there was a hidden finance charge.
1972.71-829,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,891.267,903.962,"Yes, I understand the thrust of the legislation alright, when you get away from the legislation and get down to a specific case under it then I should think this factor would be of some interest."
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,903.962,929.167,"If the Statute stood alone, an inquiry would be necessary as to whether or not this particular creditor regularly extended credit for which the finance charge was required and that would be the case because Section 1602 of the Act defining creditor, limits the substantive provisions of the Act to creditors who extend credit for which finance charge is regularly imposed."
1972.71-829,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,930.113,947.553,"Would the regulation apply to release real estate, where you reserve a total amount of rent for a period of time like two years, payable in installments over two years, it's certainly be beyond the foremost."
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,947.553,950.381,"Only, only under one circumstance, the Statute provides--"
1972.71-829,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,950.381,952.37,But why not under all circumstances?
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,952.37,952.91,Because –-
1972.71-829,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,952.91,955.406,"Federally, the regulations reads right on it, does not?"
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,955.406,958.585,And the regulation requires there be an extension of credit.
1972.71-829,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,967.833,970.116,So may be we have the wrong issue up here.
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,974.814,975.604,That's correct.
1972.71-829,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,975.604,977.133,Not whether there was credit at all.
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,977.133,980.988,"Well, that's an issue that has been raised in addition, but the problem you raised --"
1972.71-829,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,980.988,983.392,"Is that issue here, whether there's credit at all?"
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,983.392,985.1,That issue is here.
1972.71-829,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,986.218,988.858,Did you bring it here or did somebody else?
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,988.858,990.384,The defendants brought it here.
1972.71-829,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,990.384,992.077,On a cross petition?
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,992.077,995.632,"No, there's an alternative ground for affirming the Court of Appeals."
1972.71-829,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,995.632,996.033,I see.
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,996.033,1013.675,"It's our position that if this Court rules that the Four Installment Rule is invalid and feels that their arguments merit detailed consideration, that that case should be remanded to the Fifth Circuit, because the Fifth Circuit didn't reach, the question of whether credit was present in this particular case."
1972.71-829,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1013.675,1027.267,I don't have the facts that you all stipulated until this is really nothing for a fact finder with respect to whether or not this is extension of credit?
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1027.267,1030.559,"That's essential, that's essentially correct."
1972.71-829,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1064.001,1065.891,There wouldn’t be any credit there?
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1065.891,1066.291,There wouldn't be any credit.
1972.71-829,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1066.291,1070.546,It depends upon (Inaudible)
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1070.546,1084.555,"That’s correct but more importantly the statute distinguishes those kinds of cases from a lease in which at the end of the lease period, the property goes over to the tenant or to the person who's renting materials."
1972.71-829,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1093.027,1095.851,But not as an extension of credit.
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1095.851,1108.76,"That would be a separate question to be resolved, but in the case of a television set of course, it would be clear that the reported tenant, lessee of the goods in fact had a possession from the beginning."
1972.71-829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1192.716,1198.137,"She made additional down payment of $3.95, did she?"
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1198.137,1198.91,Yes.
1972.71-829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1198.91,1201.664,"So in that extent she was the creditor, doesn’t she?"
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1201.664,1204.203,Well --
1972.71-829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1204.203,1218.367,"At least to that extent, I mean and the whole deal was that she should be the one who extended the credit, she paid in advance for getting anything and always under the contract, she would have always paid more than she got."
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1225.331,1233.579,"Well, we believe not because under the realities of transaction where she paid for magazines before she got them."
1972.71-829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1244.852,1251.093,She couldn’t get the magazines from the publisher except by paying before the full subscription charges.
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1251.093,1251.989,That’s also correct.
1972.71-829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1253.118,1257.963,And a middle man (Inaudible)
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1257.963,1265.142,"Well, I think our economic analysis would be essentially that they put up the money for her to buy the subscription and she paid them back."
1972.71-829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1265.954,1268.005,"Well, that was with the finance charges?"
1972.71-829,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1268.005,1269.934,"Well, it doesn't make any differences."
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1269.934,1281.459,"Well, we say it doesn't make any difference under the regulation, that's correct."
1972.71-829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1504.148,1508.058,Mr. Schnapper let me try to straighten myself.
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1542.151,1544.363,That's correct.
1972.71-829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1544.363,1551.349,Is it possible to say then that FPS would have the use of that money throughout the period?
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1551.349,1559.18,"Apparently not, the letters sent to Mrs. Mourning indicated that FPS had in fact taped with the magazines to some extent in advance."
1972.71-829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1603.296,1616.258,But what I am trying to suggest is to ask whether there is a finances charge in FPS's use of her money and I take it that you are saying there is --
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1616.258,1639.804,"Well, it maybe then in this case that there is a finance charge, the argument that I would suggest wouldn’t turn upon the fact that she was -- they were using her money but rather the fact that she was using theirs but essentially she was getting a subscription purchased for her by FPS, with FPS's money and then being allowed to repay FPS with that advanced payment over a period of two-and-half years."
1972.71-829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1639.804,1650.367,"Now lastly, am I correct, in my impression that there is some pending 1972 legislation in the subject?"
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1650.367,1655.532,Congress has adjoined that particular bill (Inaudible) committee.
1972.71-829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1655.532,1657.115,And what would that bill have done?
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1660.837,1674.019,My understanding is that that particular statute would have put -- that particular amendment to the statute would have put into the statute and ruled substantially equivalent to the Four Installment rule that's been promulgated by the board.
1972.71-829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1674.019,1679.892,Does the existence of that proposed legislation weaken your argument in anyway?
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1679.892,1691.384,"No, similar case arose under Jones v. Alfred Mayer Company, several years ago in this court, where not only had a Fair Housing Act been proposed in Congress but actually passed."
1972.71-829,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1726.827,1736.339,"Not an uncommon situation, where the Immediate Legislation is in to eliminate the issue that's under litigation."
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1736.339,1745.954,"I know no, I think that reflects Congress's concern with the fact that if the regulations invalidate the whole statute is threat and whole statutory scheme maybe --"
1972.71-829,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1745.954,1750.088,I need to get clear on the whether it was a extension at credit or not.
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1769.934,1771.191,That's correct.
1972.71-829,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1771.191,1773.806,And the Court of Appeals did not disturb that.
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1773.806,1775.698,It didn't reach it one way or the other.
1972.71-829,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1775.698,1777.035,"Well, it didn't disturb it."
1972.71-829,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1777.035,1778.755,That's true too.
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,1910.719,1913.201,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1972.71-829,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1987.134,1992.618,But might not both factors be relevant?
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,1992.618,2010.755,"That might be, but I think that if the -- if you can show -- if one could show that the a cash customer pays less than a time customer, there is direct legislative history to show that's considered just simply another way of saying we are charging you for something more for paying overtime which essentially is a finance charge."
1972.71-829,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2027.352,2031.778,"Is that because they are not in the business of selling things for cash, but only --"
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2031.778,2034.681,But that's what that affidavit would lead one to believe.
1972.71-829,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2071.683,2074.563,Is that the affidavit in our files know?
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2074.563,2078.072,"Yes, it is Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.71-829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2078.072,2081.239,Does that really make a -- does that really bear on the issue before us?
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2081.239,2081.862,I think it would.
1972.71-829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2084.676,2085.272,I thought that --
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2085.272,2096.089,I think it confirms Congress's judgment and board's judgment that whenever a credit is extended for any appreciable length of time that costs are incurred by the creditor.
1972.71-829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2107.032,2124.602,"Well, I thought that; that may go to the motivation of board and the rationality of the board, but I thought that whether in particular case there was a hidden finance charge, didn't have anything to do with the issue that this was a general regulation?"
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2124.602,2126.724,This regulation applies regardless --
1972.71-829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2126.724,2130.866,Even if there were no hidden or finance charge here of any kind?
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2130.866,2130.908,I would maintain --
1972.71-829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2130.908,2136.367,"Nevertheless if the regulations are fully require the disclosure of certain information, isn't that right?"
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2136.367,2136.994,That's right.
1972.71-829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2150.369,2151.258,Not very likely?
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2151.258,2152.05,No.
1972.71-829,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.05,2156.612,Do you think what you are saying is very relevant to the validity of regulations of the statute?
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2156.612,2166.275,"That's right, because we first of all say that the provisions of the act define creditors, those who regularly extend finance charges."
1972.71-829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2450.458,2455.807,If you are right in your position exactly what would have had been disclosed here.
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2460.407,2470.277,Let me go in down what -- let's the usual case and this is one where there is no finance charge differentiated from the cost.
1972.71-829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2515.544,2518.28,"That is, 31 times 395?"
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2518.28,2520.367,No the 30 times 395.
1972.71-829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2520.367,2525.686,"Well, no total is the down-payment of 395 was 31 times 395."
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2525.686,2529.011,But payments she would have to make after the salesman walked out the door.
1972.71-829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2529.011,2531.495,"Alright, they would have to do that modification, 30 times 395."
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2531.495,2545.652,"Yes it's interesting I think Mr. Justice that on page 17 is the first time, the family publications did that modification for Mrs. Mourning, you will notice they say the time is here now, we cannot wait any longer for your payment."
1972.71-829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2568.55,2570.784,"But we now know that it is, that it was lowered."
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2570.784,2572.209,It was lowered we know that.
1972.71-829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2647.263,2649.211,Simply 31 times 395.
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2649.211,2650.916,That's right.
1972.71-829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2650.916,2653.611,"Just fourth grade arithmetic, they would have to note down."
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2653.611,2669.49,"Well, I think that one of the major points, of the Truth in Lending Act is that if you were a Mathematician, you might be able to get all the information by taking certain figures and juggling around that a creditor is required to disclosed under the Act."
1972.71-829,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2712.438,2722.704,But doesn't that run throughout the legislative history between the lines as well as on the surface that this is an effort to protect people from their own folly to a degree.
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2722.704,2725.304,That's exactly right Mr. Justice –-
1972.71-829,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2725.304,2726.847,Their own inadvertence—
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2726.847,2734.532,"They give them information and if they want to make mistakes at least, they will have the information before them."
1972.71-829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2734.532,2739.784,Now these are the requirements you specified where in which part of the legislation are they?
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2741.808,2743.916,"Sorry, I am not clear about what requirements?"
1972.71-829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2743.916,2751.01,"Well, the ones you just did in going down this contract on page 6 to 7, if you said what they would have been require to that."
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2751.01,2763.047,"Section 1638 of the Act and the regulations, Section 226.8."
1972.71-829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2763.047,2767.691,Is that in these papers over here?
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2767.691,2772.237,"Page 13A of the appendix, I have been called by my colleague."
1972.71-829,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2772.237,2775.336,"What page again, what you just mentioned?"
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2775.336,2783.87,"Of the appendix to petitioners, to respondent's brief page 13A."
1972.71-829,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2793.919,2801.308,"Mr. Randolph as I understand the court below, they said that Congress couldn't adapt this regulation."
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2801.308,2803.559,"Yes, I would like to say a word about that."
1972.71-829,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2854.311,2857.509,"And the court below just said, the Act was unconstitutional?"
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2857.509,2859.664,"Yes, they said that not even Congress."
1972.71-829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2866.993,2871.268,I understand your advisory he doesn't rely on that reasoning of the court of appeals.
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2871.268,2884.569,"But if the court were to rule in our favor we would suggest that they would have to over turn that particular aspect of the Fifth circuit's judgment and I would just like in response to Mr. Justice Marshall's question, I would just want to like to add one more thing."
1972.71-829,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2910.972,2922.301,"Well, isn't this whole act, an approach to abandon the old idea that let the buyer be aware and substitute preposition that the buyer must know."
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2923.878,2940.07,"That is the philosophy Mr. Chief Justice you may not be realizing if you are paraphrasing Section 1601 of the Act which says to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms, so the consumer will be able to compare the credit terms available to him more readily."
1972.71-829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2970.546,2971.783,In an answer to the Chief Justice?
1972.71-829,1,40343,raymond_randolph,,2971.783,2973.615,Yes I have.
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3486.493,3492.65,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3632.474,3633.813,Do you mean the price?
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3633.813,3634.951,"The price, the cost."
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3634.951,3641.873,"The cost is to the extender of the credit, and the price is to the extendee of the credit."
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3641.873,3651.36,"The price of credit, I think that's a fair statement, which for the purpose of this Act is called the finance charge, a bundled word."
1972.71-829,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3734.877,3747.631,"Did you mean, sorry, I interrupted there a bit, do you mean finance charge which is identified as such or finance charge which is determined to be present as a matter of economic reality?"
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3747.631,3757.169,"We submit that the Act does not distinguish between identified and unidentified finance charges, hidden or patent finance charges."
1972.71-829,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3834.07,3850.371,"But do you think it would not be relevant if it could be demonstrated in an attack on that transaction, that in fact all of their patients who paid cash or within 90 days would charge $1,000."
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3850.371,3852.56,"Oh, I quite agree."
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3893.808,3906.62,"There is matter of economic reality however it does -- I mean $2,000 over 20 weeks is less money than $2,000 cash on hand."
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3911.014,3915.382,That is that the seller experience the cost?
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3915.382,3916.21,That’s right.
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3916.21,3917.948,Which he may or may not pass on.
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3917.948,3919.419,Which he may or may not even realize.
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3919.419,3921.684,Which he may or may not realize and he may or may not impose on --
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3921.684,3925.052,"I mean as just as they are not even buyers they are not even sellers, is that true?"
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3925.052,3928.721,"That's true, that is correct."
1972.71-829,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4202.28,4207.165,"Well, I thought this case turned down that section, but on the regulation."
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4207.165,4216.773,I am trying to show Mr. Justice White that the regulation is inconsistent with the manifest --
1972.71-829,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4216.773,4222.141,You are then going to talk sometime about what kind of authority the board has to adopt rules and regulations.
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4222.141,4224.792,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4225.576,4234.582,"And if the regulation is valid, it is 1638, it is the information required by 1638 that would be applicable to this transaction."
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4234.582,4238.632,That is right.
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4374.382,4389.193,"Well, I found Mr. Rifkind that it was now at least declared relatively that, that had it been an entire cash transaction, it would have been a lower amount of total cash?"
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4389.193,4391.132,"No, sir."
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4391.132,4393.305,I thought that was in the briefs stated --
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4393.305,4393.85,Let me say that--
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4393.85,4415.667,"Family Publication Service would have done it and 7, subsection 7 of 1638(A), subsection 6, I mean, says that the finance charge maybe designated as a time price differential so to that extent, it would not be an impossible or unrealistic requirement."
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4417.215,4420.078,"If we had a time price differential, that is correct."
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4420.078,4422.712,Well then -- if I misunderstood that--
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4422.712,4446.189,"Just a second, just to finish with the Act, I just have one last section to call your attention to the Act, the section under which this suit actually arise is 1640, finally wraps it all up by saying that if you violated, if you failed to make the disclosures, the liability imposed is twice the amount of the finance charged in connection with the transaction."
1972.71-829,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4462.578,4468.459,"Isn't it a very big penalty in the circumstances, is it?"
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4468.459,4473.449,"If you multiply it by 250,000 customers then it is a staggering penalty."
1972.71-829,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4473.449,4484.86,"Well, such as what amount, have you suggested the amount in your brief other than saying it was a staggering amount?"
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4484.86,4496.11,"Well, they say that they are entitled to the minimum amount of $100 per person, 250,000 customers a year that's $45,000,000."
1972.71-829,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4496.11,4502.86,"Congress, certainly was capable of making that calculation, was it not?"
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4502.86,4503.154,Yes.
1972.71-829,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4503.154,4505.394,It's something like trouble damages and.
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4505.394,4512.927,"As far as Congress, Robinson, Harman in another case as where Congress left though the act clearly didn't apply."
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4598.641,4603.921,That is -- it is also clear that there was an extension of credit?
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4603.921,4606.426,"To me, it is perfectly clear that there was not."
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4606.426,4608.605,Then what did that the District Court say?
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4608.605,4630.538,"The District Court said that the letters written after the contract, the dunning letters written to Mrs. Mourning, evidenced that, it was credit that the non-cancelable provisions of the contract, the statement of the contract was non-cancelable, needed a credit of transaction."
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4657.882,4663.288,Did the District Court say that the defendant has extended consumer credit within the meaning of the Truth in Landing Act?
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4663.288,4664.459,"Yes, he did."
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4664.459,4665.824,Is that a finding or not?
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4665.824,4667.56,I think that's a conclusion of law.
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4667.56,4672.227,"And what he decided -- he concludes, whatever you want to call it anyway?"
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4672.227,4672.965,"Yes, he did."
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4672.965,4674.647,And that was tried out.
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4674.647,4675.511,There was no trial.
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4675.511,4678.851,"I know it was on affidavits, wasn't there?"
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4678.851,4679.519,There were affidavits.
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4679.519,4683.224,So they were matters besides the pleadings taken into account.
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4683.224,4685.518,Only the dunning letters that have been described.
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4685.518,4686.727,"Well, the answer is yes then."
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4686.727,4687.986,Yes.
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4687.986,4691.493,And so there was -- and the court did enter a summary judgment.
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4691.493,4692.092,That is correct.
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4692.092,4694.517,"And in the course of that, he said that."
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4694.517,4695.299,Yes.
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4695.299,4697.712,Now did the Court of Appeals do anything about that?
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4697.712,4705.129,The Court of Appeals did not reach the question as all the parties here agree.
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4705.129,4713.712,"So are you suggesting that we should decide the case on the basis of, there wasn't that credit transaction?"
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4713.712,4732.07,"I think that on the -- since the only document that is relevant, is an document that all of the parties, I think concede as an unambiguous contract and that is, that is what tells you whether it's a credit transaction as a matter of law or not."
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4739.599,4744.748,The regulations certainly doesn't make any relevant whether it was a credit transaction?
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4744.748,4745.898,Well.
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4745.898,4748.014,It does with respect to the finance charge.
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4748.014,4761.194,"It does and I must say as I read some of the opinions that have been issued by the Federal Reserve Board, they seem to be reading out the credit requirement of the Act as well."
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4761.194,4762.519,The regulations doesn't seem to.
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4762.519,4796.061,"It's not the regulation, it's more the regulation as applied that lead to reading it out because what they keep saying that they are interested in is disclosing the sum total of installment payments and they have gone after getting the statement of the sum of installment payments to be disclosed but installment agreements, not all installment agreements, are credit agreements and that's perfectly fundamental, and I think the Federal Reserve Board has lost track of that."
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4798.838,4801.497,But maybe not in this case.
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4801.497,4804.335,I think they have lost track of it in this case too.
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4853.916,4858.563,Was there an objection to deciding the case on summary judgment?
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4858.563,4860.152,No we were cross motions for summary judgments.
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4860.152,4868.204,"Well, wasn’t one of the relevant question in the case of whether or not there was a credit transaction?"
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4868.204,4869.679,Yes sir.
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4869.679,4879.14,But you say that that was a really a legal question on which you really couldn’t find anymore facts other than the contract and the letters may be?
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4879.14,4896.459,"That's right, that seems to me that the contract on its base is really the answer to whether or not it is, that's what the district judge thought too, he said the acceleration cost, their brand, I have forgotten, the non-cancel of the provision and perhaps also the dunning letters, came together to support that conclusion."
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4896.459,4906.567,But wouldn't have it been rather relevant on that question to know what the rearrangements were between Family Publications and the publishers?
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4906.567,4908.554,No I don't think so--
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4908.554,4916.158,"Let’s assume for the moment they actually had paid the publishers, a sum of money on behalf of the customer."
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4916.158,4935.409,"I would think that when I go to buy a car on time from General Motors' dealer, it really whether my relationship with him is a credit relationship, doesn't depend upon whether he has already bought the car from General Motors and he has been holding it or he plans to buy in the future from General Motors."
1972.71-829,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4945.038,4958.614,"Well it certainly -- I mean otherwise, you would think as Mr. Justice Stewart told someone else have brought out, it might be that the buyer was extending credit to the publisher, paying in advance for his service."
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4958.614,4962.226,The buyer is extending credit to the publisher that is exactly what is happening here.
1972.71-829,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4962.226,4975.239,"Well not if the intermediary Family Publications has already paid the publisher, that's why I say the fact that might be a irrelevant fact."
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4975.239,4976.639,The District Court didn't hear--
1972.71-829,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4976.639,4981.454,May be you have forgotten about fact that we say it must be on the plaintiff side not yours?
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4981.454,4997.564,"Well, our answer to the complaint did say at no point during the life of the contract has defended, that's FPS paid money to a third person or supplied goods or services to the customer for which reimbursement is expected from the customer in the future."
1972.71-829,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5015.457,5024.465,"Assuming that by everything you say up to the point as a fact that once she misses one payment, she is trouble."
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5045.708,5057.79,"Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, one of the reasons for acceleration clause is precisely that we did not care to become creditors; we wanted to be paid in advance."
1972.71-829,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5057.79,5059.745,All of it?
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5059.745,5070.351,We were willing to be paid at sort of double the rate -- but if they fell into the pot we wanted the whole amount in advance but we didn't want to be sending magazines to people who had not paid us.
1972.71-829,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5070.351,5076.862,"So that when they pay their whole amount, if they had a credit relationship then?"
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5076.862,5080.477,Yes we would be substantially in Mrs. Mournings' debts.
1972.71-829,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5085.681,5088.622,Isn't that in the original contract?
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5088.622,5090.266,"That is in the original contract, it says--"
1972.71-829,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5090.266,5095.925,"Then why isn't that a contract of credit, since it's in the contract?"
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5095.925,5104.297,"Well, if it's credit running from Mrs. Mourning to us the Act doesn't apply because it only applies the other way around."
1972.71-829,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5104.297,5106.035,Well I didn't agree for that.
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5106.035,5110.146,"Yes, the answer is it applies only to consumers."
1972.71-829,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5110.146,5134.617,"Mr. Refkind early in your colloquy with Mr. Justice White I thought I heard you say that on the record as it now stands the Court was in a position, this court is in a position to reach a determination that there was no credit transaction, that was the sentence essentially?"
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5134.617,5136.134,Yes.
1972.71-829,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5136.134,5142.824,On this record could we reach the contrary determination?
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5142.824,5151.318,"I think that on this record, it will at least to be remanded to the Fifth Circuit to consider the question."
1972.71-829,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5163.31,5166.581,Even if it's a pure question of law that would be the --
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5166.581,5190.885,"I think it would be more conformable to the normal practice of the court in those circumstances to remand it to Fifth Circuit and that may be in the last analysis you have to remand it to the District Court for an evidentiary examination of the question.If I am right then you can answer the question on the face of the contract, it seems to be, it can be answered here as well as in the other court."
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5190.885,5211.344,Well isn't that strange for the court to figure that it must invalidate the regulation unless it assumes that the fact that triggers the regulation is it present in the case?
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5211.344,5219.735,"I could see the court saying that it ought to reach the credit argument first, I think it was thrown off that normal course--"
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5219.735,5224.488,Was that in major litigation before the Court of Appeals?
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5224.488,5238.607,"It certainly was, argued late, I think the thing that may have deterred from deciding it, is that justice department came in and said we must have a ruling on the validity of regulation."
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5241.614,5248.495,And they got it?
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5248.495,5266.306,"Just to pursue the credit question once more in the legislative hearings, I think the Chairman of Federal Trade Commission was asset to the Senate Committee."
1972.71-829,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5306.934,5313.381,But where is the enforceability of this long going operation as compared to the enforceability here?
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5313.381,5332.356,"Well I suppose that the shrewd youngster would say now Mr. Gentleman before I agree to mow your lawn and forgo mowing other people's lawns this summer, I want you to write me a promise that you will pay me a dollar every week, I don't want you to move it off to the seashore and leaving the — without a lawn to mow."
1972.71-829,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5332.356,5338.916,How long ago was that somebody mowed a lawn for a dollar?
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5338.916,5346.393,I confess I don't have a lawn just about sure.
1972.71-829,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5404.455,5424.641,Well that's certainly true on a prepaid subscription to the publisher himself but this was a tripod type arrangement and it has been suggested that payment was made by your client to the publisher and your client thereby became creditor of Mrs. Mourning.
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5424.641,5429.747,There is nothing on the face of the contract that it would suggest that it was a tripod type --
1972.71-829,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5429.747,5431.538,"Well you are not a publisher of the magazines, your client were?"
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5431.538,5439.679,"Yes, that is correct, but neither is the departments or the manufacturer must do things as loyal department store."
1972.71-829,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5439.679,5443.701,But most of them have a gradient stock and make delivery don't they?
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5443.701,5444.605,They do.
1972.71-829,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5444.605,5460.179,"FPS has nothing except probably a general understanding that when as and if they send in a subscription with some money on some terms, contract will then occur."
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5460.179,5470.318,"I think the key thing though is that if the magazine doesn't get delivered it is perfectly clear that FPS is liable, not the magazine publisher."
1972.71-829,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5503.847,5514.27,I suppose your client either makes money or the finance charge or it's a discount from the magazine.
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5516.025,5518.608,No we are not the required to be.
1972.71-829,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5518.608,5524.366,"So on one end you are making money of one end to the other, either in your purchases or on your sales?"
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5524.366,5529.129,"We charge customers more than we are charged by the magazine publisher, exactly right."
1972.71-829,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5529.129,5531.245,But you are an independent organization?
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5535.253,5535.626,That is right.
1972.71-829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5535.626,5536.981,But you are not an agent; you are not an agent.
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5536.981,5537.589,We are not an agent.
1972.71-829,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5549.144,5577.418,"You suggested I think earlier there is no primitive contract between Mrs. Mourning and the magazine, but if promptly as was contemplated after the making of this contract, FPS did contract with the magazine, would Mrs. Mourning be possibly a third party beneficiary who could enforce that contract?"
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5577.418,5581.09,"Well, I think that would be difficult."
1972.71-829,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5581.09,5583.783,Well I am speaking in just the pure legal terms.
1972.71-829,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5583.783,5584.409,Yes.
1972.71-829,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5706.748,5708.348,Thank you Mr. Rifkind.
