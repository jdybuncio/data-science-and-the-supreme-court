1963.294,1,21614,d_gardiner_tyler,,1562.756,1567.39,If it Please the Court.
1963.294,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2003.894,2007.518,And it wasn't of any value to why this was introduced.
1963.294,1,21614,d_gardiner_tyler,,2007.518,2010.8,But because she was charged with the other count Your Honor.

1963.294,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2523.084,2535.387,"But I think -- I -- I think Mr. Tyler, one of the things that -- that bother us here, some of us anyway is the fact that the officer said it was a spike mic."
